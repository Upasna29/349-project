It is not worth the $30.00 USD that it is being marketed for. Now what may I mean by that you ask; well allow me to explain.\n\nBlitzkrieg 3 is nothing like it's predecessors; the infamous Blitzkrieg and Blitzkrieg 2. Both of these games were traditional RTS with different twists in game mechanics and plot lines. Blitzkrieg 3 has no plot line, and is more in line with a crappy Warlords or Clash of Clans (yes....dare I speak that name) in the sense that your only goal is to either bash endless amounts of "player-owned bases" or engage in poorly designed "Historical" missions. It is not an RTS but is more like a Mobile App game that has been given the skin of Blitzkrieg. There is no Map for you to conquer, only 3 Factions to choose from (typical German, U.S, U.S.S.R), and you are only able to use the same 12 units (6 Inft. and 6 Armor) throughout the game; as well as a few "Support" abilities (like Mortars/Smoke). I say all of this because it's system seems more like App graphics than a professionally designed PC "AA" or "AAA" game. Indeed I'd dare say this systme runs very much like War Commander; the MMO-Base Builder game on Facebook. Thus, in this writers opinion, it is not worth the $30.00; let alone does it belong on PC (should be a IOS game IMHO).\n\nBut you may ask what about the Gameplay, or the Graphics; for surely those must mean something with all those positive reviews. Allow me to explain from my first-hand experience. The Blitzkrieg series has always been more about large size battles and epic "on-map" destruction that leave the player feeling part of some epic war drama film. This, at least for this writer, is what made the past games so alluring. Burning wrecks, destroyed buildings, massive arty bombardments, and craters everywhere; all of these made Blitzkrieg a great game (and predecessor to todays total war-style games). Blitzkrieg 3 shows none of this, and in fact is a step back from it's traditional roots. Both the Graphics system and the Game Mechanics run more akin to Clash of Clans (yes....dare I speak that name again). Wrecks do not remain on the battlefield, gunfire is simple even on Ultra setting, maps are barely decent at best, the defense/offense systems are poorly balanced to the point of forcing a player to use mainly Armored units to succeed. While I could continue commenting on the poor Gameplay/Graphics I leave it to you to imagine your disappoint if you waste that $30.00.\n\nIn this writers opinion there are only 2 good things to take away from this project. The first is the base defense system; which is decent at best. I did enjoy the fact that my map extended beyond my given base design, and that I could move my defense where ever I pleased on the map. That being this very same system is broken because the defensive weapons tend to out perform even the Lvl 6 Armor/Inft; thus making it hard to swipe anyone's base on your own lvl and up (I can see the Trolls enjoying this). The other good thing was the nice Tutorial, which was very helpful (minus the glitch on the Panzergrenedier Mission). That being said it seem too.....bland......for this writers tastes.\n\nCould this game become better, you may ask; worth it's $30.00 price tag. Sadly I'm afraid not, as many of my fellow gamers are slowly discovering. As I stated earlier this game is more akin to Clash of Clans, and not worth $30.00 (more like $10.00 at most). Even if the Devs added a map, fixed the Graphics quality, added more units, made more buildings, or even put a good plot line in place the game still have one problem. It's a Massive Multiplayer Online Base Building game.....something most gamers will only attribute with Mobile Apps and iPhones/Androids. It is nothing like it's predecessor, Blitzkrieg 1 + 2, and it angers this writer to know how far the Devs have taken this game out of it's normal setting. Finally, even if fully upgraded and sold, it is not worth $30.00 freak'in dollars.\n\nAnyway I hope this is both a helpful review of the Devs, as much as a friendly warning for my fellow gamers. Waste your money at your own risk, but your better off finding a good FB MMOBB like CoC, War Commander, or Martian Invader that are cheap or FREE (key word FREE here kiddies).","May 9, 2015","false","3.8"," 274 of 363 people (75%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","75","274","363","15","20"

I wanted to write an update.  As of 6/27/2015, the devs are adding real PvP against real players.  While I admit in my review that it isn't my cup of tea, it was also why I felt some may not like this game.  The fact that they listened to those who wanted real PvP is awesome-sauce.  And I wanted to send a big kudos to the devs for continually making this game better.\n============================================\n\nThe single player campaigns are similar to Blitzkrieg 2, albeit the RPG element of it is lacking in comparison to Blitzkrieg 2.\n\nThe multiplayer campaign can be explained very simply.  It is Clash of Clans...world war 2 style.\n\nBefore you say "Cool" or "No way!" (depending on how you feel about Clash of Clans).  There are some differences.\n\nThe main difference is no waiting.  You don't spend "gems" or some equivalent resource which can only be obtained with real money.  You build your army, you go to battle and then you battle again and again and again.\n\nYour whole army gets wiped out?  No problem, they are immediately available for the next battle.  No waiting for buildings to finish, no waiting for troops to build.  If you can afford to build it, you get it immediately and it is always there.\n\nSo, in my opinion, it has the allure Clash of Clans has minus the moneygrabbing nonsense clash of clans has.\n\nIf I want to play Blitzkrieg 3, I can play for as long as I wish.  I don't have to worry about troops or waiting, it is quite refreshing.\n\nThe RPG element is similar to clash of clans.  You want that Panzer IV?  Well, you need to upgrade your tank depot...but before that, your HQ needs to upgrade.  In order to do that, you need 3000 fuel or 5000 supplies, etc.  The only way you get it is to raid other players.\n\nOn the other side, your base is something you need to defend.  There seems to be a variety of maps players can start off with.  (You don't get to choose) and each map has 3 or 4 ways to infiltrate your base.  Your defenses are limited and you need to place them strategically.\n\nWhen you raid others, it is awesome when you hit someone who has the same map as you...then you can say, "Hey, why didn't I think of that?" and improve your own defenses.\n\nMy hours aren't that deep at the time of this review.  I can't comment too much on single player.  I've been having so much fun with  multiplayer.  It really is odd, because my library of games is single player only.\n\nThis game stole a bunch of ideas from Clash of Clans.  It is NOT Blitzkrieg 2 reskinned.  I'm concerned about long term playability and freshness of new maps, but it is not an issue at the moment and the devs are updating the game frequently.\n\nHow does this compare to Company of Heroes?  In my mind, it doesn't compare.  COH1 or COH2 are true RTS style games where you gather resources and build armies, and attack and replenish losses until one player out attritions the other.   In this game, you have a squad of tanks and infantry.  You attack another player and you both have a static number of troops.  The other player has static defenses which are managed by the AI.  (You never actually duel a live human, only the defenses set up by that person before they logged off)\n\nFor many, this lack of true multiplayer may be a turnoff.  I'm a self professed lover of single player games...it doesn't bother me at all.  This game is more of a puzzle than COH.  You have a limited number of troops and you are trying to outwit the defenses.\n\nI can see some folks truly disliking this game.  I hope I explained it well enough so you can determine it for yourself.  I did compare to two very popular games and apologize if you have never played Clash of Clans or Company of Heroes and were unable to garnish anything from this review.\n\nHappy hunting.","May 6, 2015","true","32.4"," 210 of 280 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","210","280","9","3"

Just like the old times, but with better effects.\n- Rock, Paper, Scissors gameplay in a whole - vehicles are good at destroying defences, infantry has something for everyone (apart from defences), and defences/obstacles when put in place can cripple any advancing enemy.\n- Developers are listening to the community, setting the highest priority to bug hunting and making the most wanted features come out first.\n- Great oldschool music, artwork, map decorations (some - with borderline humour)... You'll like it when you notice it :)\n\nContras:\n- It's not BI as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong - It's a fun game to play, but it's just not Blitzkrieg I. Not yet.\n- BIII is kinda poorly balanced on higher, advanced levels.

All of the suggestions I've made as a regular Community member were answered to. Some made it into the game (like treating fortifications as if those were units in the means of a balance).\n3. Generals provide a unique experience with each and every faction. You can customize both your army now and the defences of your base like you see fit.\n4. Most balance issues are now gone, whilst 'Sauron's eye' should be fixed IMAO. It is a little bit too much OP.\n5. Numerous UI improvements here and there finally made the game easy to navigate.\n6.

Henry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/munkelschmunkel/","81 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlitzkrieg 3 - Review\nStory:\nBlitzkrieg 3 takes place in WWII Europe, where you control three forces through their battles:\nGermany conquering France, Russia conquering Germany and America fighting for Sicily.\n\nGameplay:\nIn singleplayer, the game is a typical RTS, you command units, that are either added to your forces by you freeing them, fullfilling objectives or just as reinforcements. You have no impact on the types of units that your army is made of, so you basically have to adapt to your army, and not the other way around.\nThe three nations have the same units, maybe with minimal slight variations, but the overall gameplay is the same for all. And this is where strategy comes in:\nThe game is basically beatable with very few, very basic strategies, once you learned an effective way to defend/attack you can always go back to that, since\nall nations play the same. Thus the singleplayer is nothing special.\nThe multiplayer on the other hand features something very unusual for this genre: You are provided with a base, the size of which grows with your level,\nthat you need to build up and defend with units and structures from other players. Upon an enemy attacking, your units are controlled by AI. You gain resources\nover time, that you can use to buy and upgrade units and structures. When attacking, you are matched against a random player of similar level and have to fight their setup. It is an interesting concept, very often seen in mobile games.\n\nPros:\n+Nice graphics, creating a fitting atmosphere\n+Troops speak in their native language\n\nNeutral:\n~The multiplayer gameplay is new for this genre, but often seen on mobile devices\n~Singleplayer offers nothing special\n\nCons:\n-The singleplayer is very basic\n-All nations play the same\n-There is no straightup 1v1 battle\n\nConclusion:\nI don't think I can give this game just one score, so I went ahead to give it a singleplayer-rating and a multiplayer-rating:\nSingleplayer: 6.5/10\nMultiplayer: 8.5/10\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 10","true","22.3"," 81 of 105 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","81","105","0","0"

But given that it’s still in development, I figured I’d give it a shot, and I’m glad I did.\n\nBlitzkrieg 3 is a fantastic strategy game, with features I haven’t seen elsewhere. The key thing to remember is that it’s not Company of Heroes. It isn’t about moving your troops cover-to-cover. It’s about blitzkrieg—lightning war. It’s Patton’s no “holding ground” strategy, and the strategy that allowed the then-evil Germans to steamroll half of Europe.\n\nIt also doesn’t feel like a WWII game. You can play as Americans and still fight against Americans, and the same goes for the Soviets and Germans. It feels more like a post-apocalyptic war-game with WWII weapons, where you build your defenses and raid the camps of neighboring tribes.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let’s get to the point: these factors are what makes Blitzkrieg 3 fun. While one side needs to try and plow through the enemy, the other side needs to build a base to defend against the attack, and this means finding all kinds of creative ways to ambush them.\n\nThe game starts with you at your base. You get a set number of fuel and supplies to spend on upgrading building and units, or on your defenses. The base building is a game in itself, because your base is technically a full map that other players can attack at any moment.\n\nThink of it like Home Alone, only with tanks and guns.\n\nRead my full review here: http://techzwn.com/2015/07/blitzkrieg-3-is-like-home-alone-with-tanks-and-its-awesome/","July 18, 2015","true","18.7"," 52 of 68 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","52","68","4","3"

Graph is ok, gameplay is ok. Of course it is not finished yet and rather overpriced. But think in another key - this price let us play with guys who are so interested in RTS genre so they are ready to pay this money to try EA title. Thats rather fair - you are taking part in developing the unfinished game.\nMy personal rate is 7/10 for now. Hope I will have more reasons to rate it as 10/10 in future.","November 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","37","45","2","0"

Why? because it's a watered down Company of Heroes 2 meets Clash of the Clans. Now I like Clash of the Clans, and I enjoy Company of Heroes but this game is missing a lot of the core concepts maybe they will add them but at this moment it's a no.\n\nThis is only for multiplayer\n\nPros (+)\n-easy to learn\n- Hard to master\n- Setting up base defenses can be fun\n- Assaulting can be fun\n\nCons (-)\n-Maps are not balanced\n- little to no differences between countries. Every country is the same\n- those stupid 3X multipliers\n- the combat just feels dumbed down a lot. (by this I mean, only two types of cover for infantry, buildings and bushes.)\n- I loath the battle timer, you have 10 minutes or shut down. This makes you feel extremely rushed, you can't do proper scouting missions and plan any type of assault. Make it a bonus to do it within 10 minutes not forced.\n\n(What feels lacking)\n- Proper cover mechanics\n- Countries, I signed up for germany so why am I assaulting German Bases?!?! If you're going to do Countries, make us feel united. Give each country strengths and weaknesses, Germans should have better armor, americans should have better infantry and russians should have better support or something that justs make dividing lines and give us a country chat, allow people to form divisions and build together a unified base then if someone wants to assault our unified base it would be 10 players simultainiously assaulting it together. Make this game feel like a world war!\n- This game has great potential please use it :)\n- Also I know this is an in development game and all but 32$ atm is too much.\nHave a nice day and I hope this makes you add it to your watch list!","June 8, 2015","false","6.6"," 79 of 115 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","79","115","2","0"

From that you then build your army and attack bases like any IOS/FB strategy game. But unlikse those who are all F2P and nickle and dime you, B3 gives you everything at the start all the buildings, you just need to upgrade them to get higher units or defences.\n\nI'd recomend the standard edition of this game. Most of the stuff that's in the dlux isn't in the game get from what i hear.\n\nHere's my list of Pro's and Cons.\n\nPro's:\n\nThey take a IOS/FaceBook strategy system and make it fair. No timers or pay to speed ups.\nIt's quite tactical in both offence and defence.\nQuite fun.\nIt's getting patches/update.\nBase defence.\n\nCons:\nMatch Making will screw you over ; eg. going up against a base with units a level 1 or 2+ higher than you. You won't win but might get a cap zone before you lose all your units or time ends.\nThe Match Maker. More or less same as the first point. Saps fun real quick but doesn't break the game.\nPathfinding is non exstant.\nThe FaceBook/IOS strategy style. Quite off puting till you see a bit of the gameplay.\nReally my big beef is the MatchMaking but that's getting fixed this week.\n\nOver all i'd give the have a 5/10 right now with the ♥♥♥ of a MM. But when the MM gives you a base fitting of your army it's a 8/10.","July 24, 2015","true","18.3"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","38","48","0","0"

If you've played COH,COH2, Men of War or ANY RTS game post 90s/early 2000s this game is gonna make you want to physically torture yourself because atleast that wouldn't make you as bored as this game does. Tank combat is pretty much just really vague flanking or tanking from the front with no form of special abilities you can use to gain an upper hand or change ammunition types, its just point and click. Infantry combat is even worse, I can't even firgure out if there's a proper cover system in the game but right now its just about having better/more guys or placing them in buildings.\n\nThe base progression thing is kind of cool...if you've never played a mobile game/facebook game in your life. I honestly don't know what else to say about that.\n\nNow the least important but worth mentioning anyway are the graphics, animations and sound. First off the graphics are not awful but they're not amazing either, especially when you zoom in. Animatons are pretty awful, they feel really cartoony sometimes especially with tanks as they look like they're toys or something out of a cartoon and lastly are the sounds, music isn't memorable which I don't care too much and all ambient, gun/explosion sounds etc are bland and boring.\n\nI would complain about the fact that all you can do is attack other peoples bases but we got PVP gamemodes so maybe that might improve things. I honestly suggest you buy a game like Men of War AS2, COH or COH2. Hell maybe even go back in time and grab the game Stalingrad, based off the old BK engine yet the game seems to have more depth and complexity than this one. Maybe a year from now Ill check the game out again and maybe it'll be better, who knows.","March 31","false","4.6"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","38","49","0","0"

It's also refreshing that the factions are balanced by having different strengths or weaknesses than a pure mirrored factions approach.\nIt also runs remarkably well for an early access version, with patches and insights coming weekly, often incorporating player feedback. Now let's just wait for the single-player missions and a better tutorial and I may just double my game time.\n\nWho am I kidding, I'm hooked anyways.

The multiplayer is a carbon copy of Quest for epic loot with a WW2 theme. You dont actually fight online opponents. You build upp a base with defences and raid other players bases to get more resources and upgrade your base.\n\nDuring these raids the opponents base is controlled by an AI same goes for your base when invaded. If you are into that its ok. But dont expect VS multiplayer couse there is none yet.\n\nMy biggest gripe at the moment is lack off control of your units, by that i mean you cant tell your tanks which way to face and you cant give your infantry units orders like throw granades, run, or take cover.. Your units do this bythemselves hence why i call it a light RTS game.\n\nThe graphics are Ok. The sound's are mediocer at best, machine guns sound more like pee shooters instead of machineguns. It has destructible environments but nothing compared to CoH2. Unit movement and behaviour is not very realistic. Tanks move and turn way to quick instead of feeling like lumbering metal beasts.\n\nIf you want a more standard WW" RTS i would reccomend CoH2 instead. Better audio, visual, and better control of youre units as well as a better singelplayer.\n\nIf you are more intrested in deep historic WW2 RTS game with maximum realism i would instead reccommend the Men of War series.\n\nThey have time to improve it since its early access but for now its a shallow RTS light game and i would pass..","May 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 100 of 164 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","100","164","2","10"

However, early access also implies that you'll be receiving an incomplete or flawed experience from that of a retail (launch) game.  All of that said, I will try my best to provide an unbiased and objective review, detailing the qualities and deficits that Blitzkrieg 3 currently has.\n\nPros:\n\n[+] Excellent graphics.  Beautiful, highly detailed maps--there are animals, roaming vehicles (trains, cars, etc.), and people who are doing daily tasks.  Trees fall down as tanks run into them, fortifications explode and crumble, and shots richochet off of vehicles creating an impressive realism.\n\n[+] Base building.  Organizing your upgrades is always fun.  There are tradeoffs to consider as you are leveling up, because you can't possibly level everything up at once.  Do you want improved infantry?  How so?  Do you work on individual upgrades to existing units, do you upgrade research options or upgrade the barracks itself?   The tradeoffs aslo exist in how you upgrade your defenses.  Do you want a widespread defensive network, or do you want a few key structures that are hihgly upgraded?  The options are impressive.\n\n[+] Strategy.  Despite what others are saying, there are lots of strategic options that open up conisderably the more you unlock and play.\n-Command points can be spent on a variety of support options.\n-Artillery to weaken defenses\n-Smoke screen to hide advances\n-Spies to scout the bases\n-Reinforcements\n\n[+] Army composition.  The options are pretty limitless here.  There are four classifications of vehicles and five classifications of infantry, and determining how many of each can be a very important decision going into battle.\n\nCons:\n\n[!] Pathfinding.  This is something that will presumably get better over time, but right now tank pathfinding is horrendous, at times.  This becomes even more apparent the larger the vehicle is.  And taking into account that as you upgrade your vehicles, you replace them with a larger chasis (stug to jadgpanther for instance), this makes it even more problematic.\n\n[!] No expanded multiplayer options.  Currently, there's only 1 v 1 asychronous battles.  I love the asynchronous battles, by the way, but I'd love to see 2 v 2 and greater options implemented.\n\n[!] Building off the above, there are no integrated community options.  No friends list, no chat system, no way to invite others to look at your base and basically zero player-to-player communication.  [This is a huge negative]\n\n[!] A lack of unit explanations.  I would love to see a detailed tactical tutorial or in-game guide.  Right now I have no idea how to use an MG squad versus an assault squad versus a normal rifleman squad.  All three seem relatively "samey," and I don't have a clue what their operational differences are (if any) besides different stat adjustments.","June 21, 2015","true","34.9"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","32","46","0","0"

I really like the idea behind it. But at the moment it`s still dissapointing.\nLine of sight is completely ruining the game in my opinion, you can use one infantry unit to scout the enemy positions and then ♥♥♥♥ a defence with way too many howitzer barrages. I spend hours on creating a good defence with measuring out killzones and positioning my fortifications only to find out my opponent can take one infantry unit and use it`s line of sight to call in way to many barrages and wipe out all my hard work without being able to counter it with anything at all. After bombing down all your defences they just roll in 8 heavy tanks or tank destroyers and destroy what is left of your fortifications ( with of course using the line of sight from an infantry unit and the massive atack range of the tanks ).\nSince the opponent bombed out all your units allready you don`t have any line of sight yourself anymore, and your opponent just takes out what`s left of your units using the fog of war. Any tank you roll in to defend gets spotted and destroyed before you can even see your enemy. Exept for spotting infantry is completely useless. If you garrison them in a building they will just get bombed to hell or taken out from a distance by a tank destroyer, if you leave them in the open, well... nvm.\n\nNot going to be only negative about the game. I like the idea of building a defence and getting the time to make it as you like it to be. Other than a game like COH where you don`t get any time to organize defences and get overrun before you can even place one building, this game let`s you choose when you are ready to be attacked, so no stress and when you are ready you just accept a battle. At this time i think 30 euros is a bit too much for the game because the part i would spend the 30 euros on ( building and spend time in sorting out a good defence ) is not working for me. As an attacker i`ve won like 40 out of 60 battles in total, defending 3 out of 30 with 60 hours of reviewing and modifying my defences.","April 3","false","96.6"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","27","38","2","0"

While the people comparing this to offline defence mobile games are not wrong, I believe this kind of gameplay can be an engaging experience. Others will talk about high-level balance, but I have only been able to sink a short time into this game due to the following concerns:\n\n1) Unclear instruction. The tutorial currently gives brief highlights of where the first couple of buttons to press are, but after that, nothing. It is a trial-and-error system to figure out what you must do. I was confused. Still am, although after two hours I think I have most of the interface figured out.\n\n2) Bugs. Yes, the game is early access. But you knew that, it's an early access review. Regardless of the release state of the game, I am here to say that the current state of bugginess impacts the playabilty of the game. Objectives dissapear from your screen and there appears to be no way to get them back. Unit pathfinding struggles immensely. You cannot target units behind buildings (you will target the building itself). There appears to be no way to adjust a unit's heading when controlling it in battle, causing micromanagement dances when trying to get a tank to stop reversing into the enemy.\n\n3) The game seems to spazz out pretty horribly if you have a less-than-stellar internet connection. I have a less-than-stellar connection, but I am able to play other online games without major issue. This game freezes near-constantly, and for seconds at a time while playing. Worse, it does this WHEN TESTING AGAINST YOUR OWN BASE. Meaning, even what should be a local single-player experience appears to communicate through the game's servers.\n\n4) Attack/Defence balance does seem to be massively off, though others with more time in the game will have better opinions on this. Simply put, the defender and attacker appear to get the same number of units. As any RTS player will tell you, this is an automatic win for any semi-competent attacker. Concentrate on one point in the enemy's defences, and it's pretty much right-click to win. The attacker can even continue to call up reinforcements to replace any lost units.\n\nUntil such time as all of these issues are resolved, I must strongly advise against purchasing this game.","May 7","false","3.0"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","35","53","2","1"

To my pleasant surprise, the narrative in the tutorial mission alternated between Russian, German and American forces. I love the way the developers choose to give different perspectives during the same session. It’s an interesting way of displaying what kind of impact, your actions have on your foe, as the perspective changes.\n\nAs you get the chance to play thru the eyes of your rival, you immediately see the aftereffect of your consequences. It’s a new take on storytelling, it’s very entertaining and refreshing.\n\n2.	Cool moments: During a tutorial mission, you are given a few German infantry to clear out a poor Russian village. And here I was, in the middle of nowhere… hoping to spread democracy. Oh, well! We musn't disappoint our fuhrer, maybe we will find some MANA vodka.\n\nI split my infantry into two squads. I started off by sending squad one to occupy an empty house on the outskirts of the village. This immediately started a firelight, my first squad was taking incoming fire from a house further up the street.\n\nI tactically maneuvered my second squad thru a forest into an assaulting position on the flank. Using the new ability “assault building”, my second squad dashed forward out of the bushes into the house, screaming, pulling ears and vomiting on a chicken, ending up with five Russian KIA inside, oh and we found really fluffy teddy bear in the basement, to celebrate our victory, my heroic soldiers baptized it PUTIN.\n\n3.	Sniper Unit - Sounds inaccurate in game. Last time I checked, yelling wasn’t part of the sniper weapons inventory. I swear to God, every time you give the sniper an order the dude goes ape sh1it, and starts screaming patriotic slogans.\n\nThe entire idea of having a dedicated unit going stealth, is silence. At least put some effort into making him act covert and whisper in response. Small changes to sound, can make a big difference to the atmosphere and characteristics of a unit.\n\n4.	There seems to be no function at the moment to see your troops behind objects. And with such a rich and beautifully detailed environment, sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint your units in the field, you constantly need to reselect the units to find them.\n\nSorry, but I don’t want to spend my time searching for my troops on the battlefield. Especially when there is a mission timer involved.  Some sort of highlight is needed to distinguish your troops from the background, Men of war dose this brilliantly. Take note.\n\n5.	Ability “About face” - Being a Company of Heroes player for many years. I found myself selecting a vehicle and trying to drag the front armoured part towards the enemy. I’m abruptly, startled and confused when I realise that no such function is available in Blitzkrige 3.\n\nIt’s 2015, happy new year! Ability’s like “About face” should be at my fingertips, and not hidden away in the far-flung-bottom right hand corner of the UI menu.\n\nYes, yes, I know! There is a Hot Key, you can press “R”. But that’s so… 2005, I’m not stating that simplification is bad. But coming from a CoH frame of mind, my RTS behaviour is tuned to having fast and responsive controls. In the current state, I don’t feel that responsiveness is coming thru in Blitzkrige 3.\n\nI know there is a red compass-marker you can utilise to set your vehicles direction, but that option is way too sluggish and clumsy to use. Having an instant clock, with an arch of fire, popup underneath your vehicle is faster and better way to do it.\n\nWhy not include a more fine-tuned approach of controlling your vehicles for those that want that possibility. Instead of this barebones, point and click. There is definitely room for improvements to be made regarding this issue.\n\n6.	At the current state Blitzkrige 3 does not offer any cover system for infantry. This is something that we should expect by today’s standards. There is a missed opportunity here in NOT letting the player use destructive environments as part of cover.\n\nA lot of effort has gone into creating a detailed destructive environment for Blitzkrige 3. And the developers have succeeded. I just wish the developers made the collateral damage more than just eye candy.\n\nLet me illustrate an example.  - Battle for Monte Casino, On 15 February 1944 the abbey was almost completely destroyed in a series of heavy American-led air raids. The bombing was conducted because many reports from troops on the ground suggested that Germans were occupying the monastery, and it was considered a key observational post by all those who were fighting in the field.\n\nOnly after the bombing were the ruins of the monastery occupied by German Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers), aiding them in their defence, because the ruins provided excellent defensive cover.\n\nThe point I’m making, is that the destructive environment in Blitzkrige 3 could have been utilized to benefit both sides. This could have created some unique variation of strategies in battles. What you get instead is repetitive gameplay, with limited paths of approach.\n\n7.	Which brings me to my next point, I find it odd that the developers of Blitzkrige 3 strongly incentivise the concept of artificial intelligence for defensive purposes, in base mode. Calling it “core component of the multiplayer experience.”\n\nYet, the game is lacking any meaningful Ai behaviour, the way Ai responds to human players is with basic triggers, which activate on conditions. Example: A is true, there for activate B and repeat, basically.\n\nSomeone once said, “The best defence is an offense!” So far, I haven’t found any way to change Ai behaviour perimeters when defending your base to aggressive stance or turtle defensive, hit and run or balanced tactics.\n\nIt’s not fair to say that the Ai is inadequate. It dose its job, but it doesn’t like to deviate from a set path. Doing anything complicated like taking the initiative or making a surprise manoeuvre is out of the question. It’s all scripted and predictable behaviour, don’t expect to encounter General Rommel in the field, anytime soon.\n\n8.	One more thing, the tip popup in the tutorial disappears to fast, it’s stressful and should be fix. This problem is especially hard on new players, who are trying to learn the game.  Your popups don’t have “next tip” or a “back to previous tip” buttons. WHY! WWwwwwhhhyy!!! WHHHHHYYY!!!!... . .. .why!\n\n9.	OMG! I have no idea what the designers or concept artist were smoking when they created this Modern-bluish-sci-fi-metallic-transformers looking UI menu, I’m pretty sure it wasn’t water vapour. For the LOVE of GOD, the current UI doesn’t fit the WW2 themed framework at all, change it.\n\nOther than that, it’s a good early access start.\n\nDont forget to thumbs up if you like my preview and would like to see more. Dont be a stranger leave a comment. Cheers 4 reading.\n\nWith less love BatSithCrazy!","May 9, 2015","true","116.8"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","41","64","3","0"

I vaguely remember playing the original Blitzekrieg on my parents' Compaq, but I was seven at the time and quite frankly don't see why we're talking about that in a reviews for a game made 12 years later. It's kind of like Clash of Clans in that you place and upgrade your base in one portion of the game and do battle in another. Different from Clash of Clans, however, is that you get direct control over your soldiers, the maps are much bigger and defensive placement relies much more on catching actual humans off-guard. I like the feeling of persistent progression and that the grind to the next dope unlock is never too mountainous. It's easy to jump in for five minutes and end up staying for a few hours.

Some new word in gameplay, currently available only pvp. it's kind of a tower offence style with managing own base defence but without controlling the defence in combat. I didn't like world of tanks, because I'm an RTS/RPG player and finally I see something great. Looks for me like a merge of old Z ideas in gameplay and C&C generals style and appearance.\n\nThere is also one pve mission available, was surprised to win it after 6 tries!

Reading up developers blog - they promise a complete pve campaign with most famous historical combats, also coming up controlled defence mode.\n\nHard to explain with words. Game is cool, there are still a lot of work to do, but for an early access - a complete pvp mode is really more than I could expect. Also for me as a freak of RTS game, long pvp tutorial (4 first pvp games runs in ez mode) seemed bored and I almost left the game at first. But then, it gets harder when you meet other people defences and can't pass through.

For example the main thing I dislike is that its not historically accurate. The pz 38t has like 20 something mm of armor in game but in real life it has 50mm. Also the tiger p has 101mm of fromt armor in game but had 200 mm of front armor in real life. The second thing I dont like is that at the start of the game I keep getting roflstomped by people who charge me with 10 m3 stuarts (at least thats what model I think they are) and my only defense towards tanks is one Anti Tank Rifle group 2 pz 38t's and 2 groups of Anti Tank solders that need to stay in a building to even have a chance.

I will be posting a video game play, with review on you tube before the end of the month geared towards the first time Blitzkrieg'er or anyone considering entering the genera for the first time ~ I encourage you! Its allot of fun..  The company responsible for its resurrection and new found internet game play fundamentals is doing a hell of a job with that ~ without sacrificing Sudden Strike / Blitzkrieg doctrine and tradition.  Its still in Alpha and I would encourage people to buy the game now and become part of the Alpha testing community.  Finally the great thing about this game and its creators so far is the fact that **THEY ARE LISTENING** TO US* and the game is getting better as a result.  The vehicle modeling is outstanding, the sub animation routines and effects are terrific. The sound sampling is top notch and very pleasing to the ears. Blitzkrieg is just pretty to look at ~ it gets even better when you start blowing everything up! This is not a full review so Im not going to go into allot of detail about game play.  You start of small and grow your army ~ this is done by growing the structures in your base through research.  As you grow your base  so does your army.  At one point there seemed to be no limit as to what I could research, upgrade and or improve. You can select & grow Generals to lead your armies.\n\nI have 3 categories to my rating system, very simple 1 through 5 Stars ~  This rating is based on overall game mechanics ~ 3d graphics quality, graphics scaling & modeling, rendering speed and smoothness, mouse & keyboard interaction(Sharpness, Response time) and finally sound quality. In addition though and maybe more importantly "genre fit"--->  Does the game play as advertised.  That said all this is considered as well ~ Game play as it relates to the game Title, stated  and as it is advertised in the trailer.  Basically did the game live up to its Pre-purchase advertising ~ Trailers, forum hype, and page Ad's etc..\n\nIf your wondering why this is so important to me ~ its simple so many times we go to purchase a game based on what we see in the trailers or read in the game information briefly provided on the sale page.  Sadly often times the game doesn't have anything to do with the trailer in the way of mechanics, game play or even story line.  Sometimes isnt even advertised in the correct genre. Example Action vs Strategy vs simulation vs RPG vs RTS etc.  Often games are advertised in genre's that once played it becomes obvious you were misled or it was framed in the wrong genre.  When that happens you dont figure it out until you have spent your hard earned money and as many of you have probably felt, I know I have ~ cheated into procuring a title that does not meet the standards of the genre it was being marketed in or as.\n\nSecond is a simple 0 though 10 fun factor & game polished rating ~ & yes 0 is an earn-able score.\n\nThird is just the good old thumbs up, a single thumb means its good you should investigate the game yourself and buy it. Im taking it one step further than Steam though ~ if the title is really good and it makes it into a favorites slot in my Steam Library I'll give it 2 thumbs up!!  That basically means look no further buy the dam thing and get busy playing!\n\nSince this game has not yet been released I will be grading it again after its official release. I've played more than 450 hours and these are my conclusions so far.  As of right now it gets 4 and half stars (****1/2)STARS well earned stars. It well earns a Hard 8 out of 10 (8 of 10) on my Fun Factor & game polished Scale, and since it is a work in progress that can be expected to go up or down with its finally release.  Because it is that, and with the upgraded 2vs2 3vs3 4vs4 multiplayer games  just around the corner with the official release ~ it can only get better.  Hope fully they are suppose to be incorporate some sort of a grand campaign internet map, that players will be teaming up and fighting battles for control of ~ non stop 24/7.. Probably of Europe, and hopefully Russia ~ we will see those are just some long term expectations and idea.\n\n**BOTH THUMBS UP**\n\n~Rommel.99 (In game Alias)\n\nThe ~ Following are sub notes to my qualifications to review games and what I am putting together ~ additionally a search request for partners in this new endeavor.  The idea of reviewing these games are to make them better and keep people from wasting there times on games that are a sell out or as we see in so many cases an out right lie as advertised versus game play.\n\nPS ~ If your wondering well who the eff are you to  suddenly be reviewing games. Thats a fair question and I will have a full resume on my new web sight listing all my qualifications. MOST  IMPORTANTLY THOUGH ~ I AM A STUDENT OF GAMING, I have been gaming since 1977.  Played the first Wolfinstien on the Apple 2c, heres a hint it. It wasn't a first person shooter then, if you've been around for a while you'll know that and remember such titles as Karateka ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHNT7mR-8d0 ), Bruce Lee by Data Soft, Conan the Barbarian ~ first game you could chop peoples heads off in!  Was awesome..  I love games of all kinds, I was one of the best Half life players in the world in 1999, Ive played every measure of first person shooter ~ the latest titles I have enjoyed are Titan Fall and BF-4..  I like vehicles. Ive played though Skyrum, Dieblo, Star Craft, Battle front, EVERYTHING STAR WARS and so many more (75 titles in my Steam Library alone). Additionally my true love is with strategy games the past 7 years.  Ive got at leat 15 hundred hours in the Hearts of Iron series, All of the TOTAL WARS.. I particularly love Napoleon, ROME 1&2, Mid-Evil 1&2 and Shogun 1&2.  Looking forward to there new Total War : WAR HAMMER 40,000.\n\nOk so all that being said I am looking for partners in crime to join me in a REAL GAME REVIEW that plays the games it reviews intensely.  For now the emphasis will be on Strategy games, war games..  As I feel that first person is so over done right now and there are a million talking heads when it comes to the "first person shooter" Genre.  I want to investigate search for and review the "THINKING MANS" game's.  So email me if your interested ~ send me a friend request to if you like.  I have a huge infrastructure already in play for this task. Servers, 2 state of the art PC's, an awesome web sight that will smoke PC-GAMERS page under construction and of course Team Speak Channels etc. There are 3 of us committed to this endeavor and an awesome name for all this has been selected, I am pulling trade mark rights on it before I post it though.. Its that good.  I need 5 solid  Students of Gaming to come on board.  I will be working to long term to engage large game companies and enter into contracts long term with these companies for the sole purpose of game play review to assist them in producing better products.   This means a strong possibility of being paid for doing what we love to do. I cannot promise any of that, however I can say for the 5 that do come on board I will be personally bringing your PC up to current Game PC Awesomeness standards.

Yes it is very pretty, everything looks fantastic, especially the buildings with the idle soldiers just about, but that is probably one of its strongest features is how pretty it is.\n\nCurrently it feels lacking in content, and while it can be said that this is an early access game, so are other titles with more content and that do not feel like a ww2 version of clash of clans.\n\nNow I have not tried out the historical battles yet, because the first one is just a wave defense and currently, I have zero desire to play a wave defense. There is no other way to see if there are any other battles because it just takes you straight into it. No single player besides that really. From what I have seen so far it doesnt look like there are any custom commanders to level up either. Nor any interactive campaign map on the multiplay side, just build a base and attack people, which just feels so uninspired that I honenestly thought that I would have to wait hours for my buildings to upgrade unless I bought a premium currency.\n\nThere really is not much of a cover system, so if you were thinking of company of heroes where you can hide behind a wall and throw grenades over it not really going to happen. While it does feel like it plays like blitzkrieg 2, it plays like blitzkrige 2. The controls are very similar without much improvement, as many other criticized the fact that you cannot face tanks, and you cant. I actually had a panzer one driving backwards until it spotted an enemy then decided to turn around.\n\nBlitztkrieg one and two are fantastic games, but just little tweaks here and there to fix old controls and such would be fantastic. The graphics are all nice and good so they got that part down. Another thing is a lack of an ability to actually call in reinforcements which I guess is because of their strange multiplayer not a campagin campaign thing that they have going.  Multiplayer is not an instant make a game better solution, and when done improperly makes things worse.\nSeeing as I have had many reservations about early access, the reason why I bought this was actually for the blitzkrieg one and two anthologies that I got with it and decided to give this a try anyways.\n\nOveral, this game needs a lot more work. It is dreadfully lacking in content and the fact that It is missing so much customization and single player aspects is very worrysome.\nThere is no way I could recommend this game. Even just as a first impression I cannot recommend it, because you could buy far better things worth your time and money.\n\nThat being said, I really want this game to succeed. I really do, the market is so lacking in rts, that people are recommend turnbased games because there is not anything else out there that is decent beside company of heores, total war, and starcraft. Plus I love blitzkrieg, and the opportunity to see a new one would be amazing. Right now however, this is just a sad shell of something much better.","May 11, 2015","false","20.2"," 45 of 77 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","45","77","4","0"

Asynchronous Multiplayer has removed all of the human interface. Furthermore the units can not dig in, resupply, fix or dig trenches which was the beauty of Blitzkrieg 1.  This has further drawn away from the realistic side to a more easy mass of force and plough through defences.  Little was meant for the inutitive information gathering, use of airpower wisely or having artillery units.  They removed all of this into a lengthy base building project which would be equal to the neverending story.

And by "that kind of thing" I mean historical RTS, or even WWII RTS. This genre caters mainly to hardcore military history buffs and Blitzkrieg 3, in my opinion, has everything in it to make them happy - historical accuracy (or, at least, ENOUGH historical accuracy), intricate tactics and that authentic "old school rts" vibe, that seems to be lacking in many of its' counterparts.","February 18","true","3.0"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

The graphics are Very pretty and not too demanding. The gameplay is relatively smooth, could be a bit polished. The vehicle variety and sounds are GREAT, It's like the took the tech trees out of WOT and put them in this game. One thing that I feel needs to be implemented is a proper cover system, like COH2, it would make infantry much more useful (for me at least). Something that they should but don't NEED to take out is the off map artillery and make artillery an on map unit like in the other Blitzkriegs, another thing, please oh please don't focus so heavily on the "Clash of Clans" style of multiplayer, leave it on there as a play style but I miss the massive battles that you could play in Blitzkrieg 1. They should add a proper campaign again like the older Blitzkriegs where you got to choose what you had in the mission and you would unlock more units as you completed more missions. Last but not least add like a skirmish mode similar to COH,COH2 and Wargame, it's just a quick way to play a battle and have some fun. I change my recommendation because they said that they will fix the pay again problem and plus this game is in Alpha so there is much work to be done.","May 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

I bought it now, because you have  a chance to receive some special things if you buy it before May 12. Game will be in the development at least 4 months more. So, if you want to level up much easier now than it will be later, like me, then buy it now. But there are not many things to do right now except leveling up and see some basic mechanics.\n\nOtherwise, you should buy it after official release and don't scream about problems now.

It sure is not Blitzkrieg at all anymore but it still makes for a decent and addicting game. Conquering the bases that other players created, each and everyone different from one another proved to be just as exciting as the constantly new possibilities in moba games. Lets see how long this game can hold me. For now, it gets a recommend, the price of 30€ isn't much and the content is there even if unfinished and a tad broken.\n\nI hope the publishers take care of the future development of this game, so I don't have to change my review into a negative one. Therefore for anyone reading this, this review should be taken with the fact in mind that this game is in alpha status and that I, as of writing this, really enjoyed the 8hours I've spent so far with this game but might change my mind in the next few months unless I see progress.\n\nMy biggest issues with this game are the lack of actual RTS elements. While range indicators are involved the basic combat system breaks down to rock, paper, siscors. The strategic part of the game lacks depth and needs drastic improvement. The movement too, Infantry should have different movement speeds based on gear and vehicles especially, should be fixed.\nThe motions feel too clunky and units don't behave realistically.\nI also want more control over my units. I want to tell my Infantry when to charge, get down or use items. The armies aren't that big that a little more mircomanagement would hurt.\nFurther the graphics are 'okay' but the sound needs improvement. Not just the ambience but the weapon and gear sounds as well.\n\nFor anyone whining about it not Blitzkrieg, youre right, get over it, its still a decent start and the brand 'blitzkrieg' doesn't belong to you. Thats life, thats gaming, accept it - Singleplayer is still similar to the old games so enjoy that. Otherwise I recommend you Men of War or the first CoH, but stay away from CoH2.\n\nI'll say it one last time, if you're not okay with playing unfinished games, don't buy this - yet. However if you have no problem with that and you enjoy ARCADE RTS you're good to buy this already.","May 7, 2015","true","11.9"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","21","37","4","0"

I can't get into the Single Player Campaign right now and the game keeps going to Early Access Selection even though I chose to go into my Steam Account on Nival website.  I don't want to go into the Early Access Account.  When you go into the Main Menu for the game, the only two selections on the Main Menu for the game is Multiplayer Campaign and Historical Battles.  You can't go into anything else.  On Historical Battles you can't even pick which battles to go into.  It just goes right into the same battle over and over again.  Plus the zoom features and rotation features need to be addressed and fixed.   Right now they are pretty much not working properly.  Please Nival fix the game to play the way you advertised it.

And it of course fell short of that statement. I still find men of war to rule the ww2 strategy title and this game isn't knocking it any time soon. The game has several elements I enjoy and around the same amount I hate.\n\nStarting on a positive note the game functions and works and the gameplay is pretty fast paced. at ten minute around quick wits and lighting strategy is required, so prepare your blitzkrieg tactics. there is an extensive upgrade tree it's almost redic how much you have to do to upgrade your base. Resources are so abundant and yet it can take awhile to accumulate  them, at first it world make sense to fight battles because they are pretty easy. I was stomping the crud out so many people. but later on is where the game picks up and you will find yourself struggling to complete the same task you found easy at first.\n\n\nThat being said it's boasted a-sync multiplayer is fancy for clash of clans style. Which is a little sad, hopefully a full fledged pvp head to head battle mode will surface, but for now get ready for ai battles. I have to admit the appeal of the game comes in spurts, this is more of a time waster then a game you want to spend hours playing. and after around 50 battles it gets dry and you pick up on most of the tactics defenders will use. The problem is you will face battles you can't win due to the leveling system. Trying to rush to the next tier leaves you vulnerable to players who just have better stuff and I found that not upgrading my units was leading to my units not being able to fight what should have been a sure match from prior battles.  It's weird when you run into the same tank you killed a million times but this time it barely takes dmg and wrecks you. The rts mode is pretty good even if it is ai you get control where your defenses are, what they are ect. You can deploy defensive structures(barbed wire, mines, hedgehogs, bunkers, ect.) and then a battle group (infantry, tanks) buildings can be garrisoned and you can test your defenses to see what other players might do to you. you can also watch replays which is important if you don't want bleed resources like a stuck pig.\n\nI enjoy the game and recommend it for those players looking to kill time and want to experience what it would be like if a mobile phone game sexed up sudden strike and produced a decent game.   However this is no company of heroes or even old blitzkrieg (which comes with it) so all is forgiven.","May 14, 2015","true","54.5"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

I've always enjoyed the Blitzkrieg games and was excited when I saw this one.  Gameplay is generally similar to the previous ones, but it has better graphics. It most assuredly needs a 'save' option, as it's annoying to have to quit mid-mission and then have to start the whole mission over again. I also miss the variable stance option for infantry where they automatically go prone when under fire. I'm not fond of the new system where auxilliaries (air and fire support) are on a separate tab rather than displayed on the same screen as one's troops, but I can learn to live with it if it doesn't change.  So far there's no means of selecting which reinforcements you recieve-don't know if that's because it's no longer there or I just haven't progressed far enough for it to be an option, but if it is gone, I'd like it back.  Overall, I'd say if you liked the previous games you'll probably like this one.\n\nNow back to conquering/liberating Europe . . .\n\nOkay, so a few more things that need to be added from BK2. Infantry need to be able to entrench as do vehicles, or at least enter pre-prepared trenches. One of the weaknesses of BK1 and BK2 was the vulnerability of infantry which was partially corrected by the ability to dig in when under fire. Right now they're completely exposed and die like flies. Likewise, it looks like the ability to summon reinforcements is not yet present and it needs to be.\n\n\nI have fought the Arras mission six or seven times now and I always end up trying (and failing) to take the bridge with one damaged tank and 3 badly wounded infantry because I lost the others trying to take on five or six Char B1, one of the most heavily armoured tanks at the beginning of the war with a hull mounted 75mm gun.  In its present state, I would consider the Arras mission virtually unwinnable unless you have LOTS of luck on your side.  Also captured weapons-mortars, anti-tank weapons, et hoc genus omne used to be movable either by infantry or by vehicle and they should be again. I would also like to see a separate and distinct German and a distinct Allies campaign.","May 9","true","3.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

A few days ago the game was released on Steam so they gave the option to transfer the game to your Steam account. I did this and then I got the "userglobusload" failure. Not only when starting the game through Steam but also via the normal exe file as I started it before. Something got screwed during transfer and I guess it's something with account names. One of their developers said it was something they could easily fix and all I had to do was contact the support department. After contacting Blitzkrieg support they almost immediately responded to check my Steam account. It was the wrong one so I provided them the correct one, almost immediately also. After that... Nothing anymore.\n\nUPDATE: They fixed it! Yesterday I even got contacted on steam and added by a developer to figure out what was wrong and for help.

While these things are game breaking and annoying, making tanks almost useless against anything except buildings and buldings with infantry, this games does show immense potential and i feel as if my money was well spent. if this quote that i said during playing this game helps,"this is the first time i have had fun playing a unfinished game i have payed for" i hope you join in and support this game.

Хочется спросить разработчиков : возможен ли реализм с безгранчны боекомплектом и одним видом боеприпаса ?\n- совмещенный режим ПвП и ПвЕ напомнает шахматы и шашки на одной доске, что выглядит как полный бред при невозможности их сбалансировать\n- ввидение командиров в игру полный бред . Скопировать с оригинала- Компании героев и то мозгов не хватило . Напомню что там нет генералов , а есть военные доктрины.\n- особенно эпичны видео дневники от разработчиков - не потомучто они интересны, а потомучто выходят с периодичностью раз в 8 месяцев\n-  хотелось бы также отметить просто бездарную работу пресс секреторя Бочарова С он же автор шедевра " Бабушкин телефон в 1080 р " .\n- о конкурсе " На Берлин " : Конкурс  уже как минимум несколько раз должен был быть проведен . Но суть не в этом , а в том что разродившись наконец на провидение конкурса и призы были озвучены такие условия, которые убирают более 90 % пользователей от участия в нем , а именно : кто умеет работать с редактором по созданию миссий или у кого есть на это время ? Почему только граждани России ?   Они бы еще озвучили как условие - реальное  взятие Берлина :)))\n-Более 3 раз поменялась команда разработчиков проекта\n-Недавно проект покинул продюсер Олег Буренко , тот самый который был на арте - капитан с пистолетом . На вопрос разработчикам: "кто же все-таки занимается разработкой проекта на данный момент и просьбу представить рабочий коллектив игровому сообществу" был получен ответ: "что якобы кол-во персонала это комерческая тайна" , прошу обратить внимание что вопроса о кол-ве не ставилось и то что в других компаниях никакой тайны о людях которые делают игру нет  , никакой тайны из этого другие успешные компании не делают и даже наоборот стараются как можно быстрее представить участников разработки игровому сообществу\n- следущий момент: делюкс издание - которое дает обладателю разрушаемую статую реальных вождей , что совершенно является просто хамским отношением к истории, культуре и традициям народов .\n- Даже выбор названия Блицкриг не этично по отношению к гражданам нашей страны и стран СНГ , так как это прямое название гитлеровской военной доктрины примененной против нас , полагаю не нужно напоминать сколько людей было убито в результате . В данном случае более логично было бы дать игровому проекту нейтральное название например типа противостояние - продолжение серии игр блицкриг .\n\n\nВ общем это ряд показателей по которым уже можно судить и делать выводы об успешности или не успешности проекта . Что касается компании производителя , на мой взгляд, они уже давно проект похронили и все к чему они сейчас стремятся это как можно быстрее выкатить игру в официальный релиз , побыстрее потому что после 2 недель релиза никто не сможет вернуть деньги . В общем и целом большая часть тех кто купил игру и так не будут возвращать деньги , но возникает вопрос купят ли эти люди уже готовое дополнение к этой игре Вьетнам ?\nСудя по чательному анализу проекта и тех кто над ним работает и организует рабочий процесс - все они ужасные тактики и еще худшие стратеги , что и послужило главной причиной краха ,столь ожидаемого изначально, проекта .","May 8, 2015","false","199.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Initially I was very frustrated (see below), but, after watching the walkthroughs, I have a better understanding/respect as to how this game is played and, indeed, how clever it is.  I've began playing it again and am enjoying it very much.  That said, I would like to see more opportunities/means to acquire resources and incentive for playing rather than waiting.  The current means is by waiting, challenging other players or the AI, or, defending your base.  However the rewards through playing, initially, were around 7K for supplies and gas but, taper off to around 2K.  Overall though, this game is growing on me more and more.\n\n////OLD REVIEW////\n\nYou'll play this game initially and think wow, awesome, and amazing.  However, as you try to build up your base, forces, and get your feet wet, you'll have a higher level player stomp you....  I'm not sure if some of the other players experienced this, but, I found during one base defense mission, that I threw my entire range of forces at one tank and it took little to no damage and all my infantry and tanks died quickly.  The emplacements offered nothing in terms of resistance as well, dying in one to two hits.  Must have been Rambo manning the tank....  Point being, attackers took little to no damage and were at 100% force strength when he took out my base.\n\nGood idea/concept.  Once the developers work out the hacks, bugs, and players who cheat, it will be a good game.  For now, though, this game still is a ways off from being anywhere near balanced or playable.  Feel free to hit me up with any questions.  Cheers","November 27, 2015","true","70.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I've never seen so much bug in a game. Patch after patch they can't fix bug and pathfinding is horrible!!

Horrible is the word!\n\n\nReally hard to find a match in multiplayer (so few players are playing it). You can let the game open for hours waiting for someone to attack you.... well you better be patient cause no one is going to (except early level)!\n\nThere is no big goal in this game, if you defend or not, it's doesn't really matters (you can choose to ignore enemies attack and then they can't attack you wtf...).\n\nDon't buy this!

If you wish to get yourself a nice WW2 RTS then you should not buy this game. The strategic deepth of the game is nearly non existent since it is based on simple countering (infantry > AT infantry > vehicles > ) witch gives you fun for about 10 mins. The simple counter mechanic does not really benefit from the fact that there are 3 unit types either.

I cannot in good conience do so. This game was the biggest let down I have ever had the misfortune of paying for, A $60.00 price tag is not excatly cheap , but I feel ripped off, there is no single player campaign that does not inculde PvPing for upgrades or better units, and there is no balance when you get into a battle, the A.I. you face has better everything, firing rate , accuracy, and upgrades, so it takes forever to get anywhere in campaign mode. I hate being forced into PvP to just to get anything done in game., as matter of fact ,I hate PvP period. This game is more like a facebook app then an actual PC, strategy game, there is no skrimmish mode to square off against an A.I., and the Historical battles seem less then impressive to Me. I have played alot of World War 2 strategy games, but this one was such a let down. Im disappointed in Nival for ruining one of the best ww2 strategy games there was.If i had one reconmendation for Nival Scrap this game and build better versions of the frist two games in the series using those game formats will in my opion insure success.","August 4, 2015","false","28.7"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","8","22","0","0"

I am on board to the history train! I remember those hours spent playing Blitzkrieg 1 and 2! Such great times spent in my childhood, discovering great strategy games (alongside with Cossacks back in those days).\n\nPeople... The solo is not the greatest, the game is unbalance and it's remind me more of a "Clash of Clans" rather than a real strategy game.\n\nIt reminds me more of a freemium / pay to win, but there is no options to pay (thank god I already paid 35 euros for that). In the screenshot I see planes, epic battles, BADASSERY! GREATNESS! I was like WO WO WO!\nI launched the game, crashed a few times, had to redo the tutorials. (tutorials take long). Go online, I take a commander by mistake, I can't choose another one... Well... OK? Thank god it was the tank commander! Why? Because here is the ULTIMATE STRATEGY GUIDE FOR SKILLZ MLG PRO! You are ready?\nHave a lot of tanks.... Basically, you want scouts to see far away, you want medium tanks to be able to kill any poor AI enemy coming towards you or to handle an ambush from a player. Then you want a tank destroyer... which will be used as a giant sniper to ... destroy everything that is in sight of the scout! AND VOILA!\nOh... I didn't say the best! You make your own base (seems fun uh? A permanent base! :D but no... here's why) but this is like a base you can't customize, you need to have your building in a big square, you can still put defenses (mines, stuff to make people not to cross a road or anti tank guns and pillbox) and you can put some of your units here and there.\nProblem? Everything cost ressource points (logic) but the only ways to get them is by : Attacking an enemy and not loosing OR wait and hope nobody attacked you when you were away from your computer!\nLet me explain, you attack and steal the ressources of people (they created a beautiful base but my team of "tank snipers" wipped out everything), GREAT! Now you are back at your base but someone attacked you, YOU LOOSE WHAT YOU JUST WON! I mean, it happened to me too many times, especially when I was about to click on something and I couldn't after because someone decided to attack me when I was attacking someone else and the AI taking care of my defense was dumb (it's an AI).\nYou level up your base with the few ressources you can get, developing paranoia, you level up your troops and defenses, IT TAKES TIME! GRINDING, PARANOIA AND TIME! It remind me of an old game which was based on the same policy and if I knew, I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT IT!\nNevertheless, I tried to love and cuddle that game, I really tried. It's blitzkrieg! But no... It's Casualkrieg, it's paranoia, waste of time, I find the animation of the units / modelization not so great (except... the tanks?).\nWorst... 35 euros... spent... on a game :( AND THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO SAY! (The commanders abilities, Unit restriction, the OP army with way more levels than you who attack your base while you're away and... 10 other dude who attacks you after him and because of the AI you loose.)\nSo much more to say.... I tried steam refund but for some reason, they are still thinking you need less than 2 hours to discover a game and decide if you really want to separate from it. I wish there was a demo. I wish I knew :(\nIf I didn't have the game and if someone gave me back my 35 euros, I would buy Men of War or EVEN COH 2 which is with LOTS OF DLCs!

It's not worth $30.00USD in its current state as it still feels like a browser game and the fact that the main focus is on quick PvP skrimishes against other bases. While a single player mode is present it's pretty bland and dumbed down, compared to the previous games. They seem to have gone a different route from the originals being more tactical and drawn out to now matches only last but 5 - 10 minutes because of such a small fighting area. Not to mention the fact that eventually you can just call in artillery where ever you want and your defenses are usually destroyed within one barrage, which I don't like the fact that you can just call in a set amount of artillery EVERY time. It would be nice if it wasn't even present or have restrictions on it to make the game a little more tactical. I recommend this game under $15 at least, however the main reason I dislike and cannot recommend this game is mostly due to the fact that it's so browser-like. I hope when the game is out of Early Access it will have improved upon that and made it more like an actual game and not something like Forge of Empires.\n\nIt really isn't a bad game, it has promise and the graphics are surprisingly good (the tanks bounce around a little too much though IMO.) But it certainly isn't worth the current price, maybe when it's out of Early Access it will be worth the $30, but as of now, no. If another sale for all three games comes along I recommend picking that up as you can get all three for less than the current listing of this game single. And the first one is very good if you like the old time RTS games.","September 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

The single play seem that it coul be fun if it had more level. The graphic etc are pretty neat, a lot of detailed animation and i find really cool.\n\nBut the core of this game at this stage is all about the muilitplayer, so i will mainly talk about MP gameplay in ths reivew.\n\nTL DR: MP is a phone app/browser based gameplay mixed with a unbalance un fun single stratgy real time tactical mess!\n\nThe mulitiplayer is NOT a real time staratge game it is some hybrid between small scale total war game mixurted with Class of the clans or battle island. U manage ur base and base defense in the same fashion as one of those cheap ♥♥♥ F2P phone app game or browser based game, and u do battle in total war men of war fashion with real time tactic.\n\nSo at this point u are prolly thinking " hey at least the battle must feel fun right?" WRONG! u see the thing is this game's muilitplayer is all about attacking base and defending base.  U set up ur static base defense(bunkers, AT guns etc) and units before battle and hope that u r ready to whoever is going to attack u. But there is no way to know how many units the enemy is going ot bring because ur opponets are chosen randomly, and there is no way of calling reinforcment, or build units in battle. so ur best hope is put as many units and base defense on the map of ur base as possible and hopefully u would win. But fear not ur opponets attack force will 99% of time consist of one kind of units and that is TANKS!\n\nThen there is the battle itself, this game have very little stratage in the real time battle, why? because tanks, yes tanks, this game have tanks do everything, tanks good against infantry, tanks good against other tanks, tank good against base defense. tanks is good against everything, all u need in ur "army" of attacking is tanks and a few recon units, that's it. Because ur tanks out range everything bsside other tanks! the base defense save a few "AT gun" implacment is absolutly useless besde target pratice for enemy tank!. U got that right! A game about base defense and base attack have static base defense out ranged by tanks! The only way for ur base defenses to be a little bit of useful is hide them behind ur indestructiable base buildings or corner area. Basicly hide them inside ur base.\n\nWhat's worse is the attacking force get off map arty barrages! U see a base defense that ur force cannot reach? arty barrage! u see infantry in trenches? mortor barrage! U see a group of enemy tanks? arty barrage! A cluster of base defense? arty barrage! It's bad enough that tanks out range ur base defense u alos get off map arty support that can hit u anywhere on the map and cause massive damage!\n\nFinally there is units balancing, as i said above tanks does everything, so the game basicly come down to who have the most heavist tanks wins. Infantry are absolutly useless, because they get wiped out by everything, EVEN IN SIDE TRENCHES, one mortor barrage ur entrenched infantry squad is dead, even if the attacker doesn't use barrages, the tanks out range infantry so they can still kill infantry from a distance. The funny part is they give u a large selection of infantry type! but what's the point of giving us large selection of infantry when they are usless 90% of time? infantry squad, assautl squad and MG squad, sniper etc are absolutely useless! the only useful infantry is AT infantry inside building,  but The sad part about this is most AT infantry get out ranged by tanks inside building.It's really sad that they put so much detail on infantry and animation etc but u rarly use them at all.\n\nU see what the problem is? tanks out range everything and good aganist everything! There is also no incentive to play lower teir units once u researched high tier units because once u get high tier unit reasearched u keep it forever! u get to use them in every single battle untill u upgrade them to the next high tier!\n\nSo in conclusion i would not recmmond this game unless u want to play "WORLD OF TANKS" with battle island lol.","September 30, 2015","false","23.4"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

Basically only like a handful of different unit, which you can keep upgrading into the next tier. Sound great to have a more advanced unit? Well, every time you upgrade your units, you simply fight against a next tier enemy. Meaning that it's the same thing over and over again.\n\nIf you are an active player, don't bother putting up defences, just make sure to use all your resources, attack 3x a day so you get attack bonus and make sure to use it all again. That way enemies if they attack simply cannot get anything from you.\n\nIt's really clash of clans in WW2 skin.","February 15","false","8.3"," 18 of 45 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","18","45","0","0"

The clash of clans style multiplayer is ok but the lack of customization on building your own base leaves alot to be desired in 2015.\n\nAlso the units and damage modelling are completely outdated from RTS of a decade+ ago.\n\nThe graphics are very pretty though.","August 6, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

I did spent quite some time playing this game hoping it will get better as I progress. I finally gave up after spending over 30 hours on it.  First of all, all three factrions have the same unit types.  Tanks and infantry units do look different among US, Russia and Germany, but those units are the same type of heavy tank, tank destroyer, assault infantry and regullar infantry, etc.  They just look different but are with the same functions.  The buildings, defense units and structures look the same among all three factions.\n\nMultiplayer is a waste of time.  The upgrading system and game progress take forever.  It takes around 600k - 800k supply to progress from a level 5 headquarter to a level 6 headquarter, and each battle won will give you only about 7k of supply.  You fight in the maps with defenses created by other players.  However, there are only a few player created defense maps (around 4-5 per level).  So you fight the same battle over and over.  Imagine fighting the exact same battle 20 times hoping to get enough supply to upgrade to the next level.\n\nAnother disappointment is that you will lose your supply to other player when your defense (controlled by AI) is breached while you are offline.   Lastly, this game is buggy.  For example, units don't respond to command, infantry won't be able to destroy road blocks as that's suppose to be one of their skill.  So it ended up my whole army got stucked and I won't be able to finish the battle.\n\nHowever, I must say the graphics are nice and the sound effects are good.  But unfortunatly, the gameplay is boring with repeatable maps and opponents.  I would not recommend this game to anyone at this stage of the game development.

List of problems that I have found with it:\n\n1. The game lacks multiplayer matches, because more people choose to play the AI instead of you. No multiplayer games is a game killer if you ask me. I can't sit there for hours waiting for 1 match.  Sure its fun setting up a defense, but if you have to beg people to attack you forget about it.\n2. The game progresses to a level 7 where you get to unlock all the different units, but you can never go back to a lower tier which are quite fun, and compete for that level ranking. They need to add in a change to any tier level ranking game.\n3.  The game needs an option to play any map of your choosing.   This right here is probably the most desired want.\n4. No way to save your maps once you have spent hours setting up your defense, because they make you upgrade to a higher level. And all that work is gone forever.\n5. No team games yet.  That is unlike the Blitzkrieg people to not have this option.\n\nThere are many other problems with this game like game balancing issues but they are minor compared to the problem of finding people to play matches with you. There is no 'set up a match' thing button that you see in most games.  All you do is set up your defenses on a map and wait for people to attack you,.. that can be 5 minutes waiting or 24 hours to 1 week.\n\nThere are some very good positives also, one being there is no base buiding like in COH where you can keep bringing up reinfocements.  I don't really likes neverending games.\n\nMost of my buddies left this game out of frustration. and I think its happening to me too.","November 10, 2015","false","188.2"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

Fans who loved the detail of the 1st and 2nd game will immediately understand how far backward this version has gone. For example, aheavy machine gun can easily destroy a panzer IV in the game. I will grant to Blizkrieg 3's credit that it is still in the early access stage, but i can already tell this game has nothing in common with the ones we have cherished over the years.","August 22, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","5","23","0","1"

Again this is another RTS that forces you to follow a script. Some of the best RTS games I have ever played allowed me to control the game. Set an objective and then the player can follow whatever strategy he or she deems fit to achieve that goal.\n\nThis channelled game play is not fun, I don’t care that I have to take item 1 then item 2 then item 3 I want to arrive a successful outcome MY way.\n\nHad the potential to be a good game along the lines CoH or MoW but they missed the boat here – developers please stop trying to force us to play YOUR version of the game. Allow people free reign over the game so we can play how WE want to.\n\nIt is an alright game, but if I was back and knew now how they structured the game play, I would not be spending any money on it, if I could I would try for a refund I feel that disappointed with this game.","September 6, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","3","23","3","0"
