This is the kind of indie developer we need!\n\nRegarding the game itself, it is as fun and satisfying as the trailer makes you believe. Controller support is near perfect (it would be better if moving through menus did not require mouse emulation, as that makes the mouse curser appear in the middle of the screen), jumping is precise and the amount of challenge is good enough.\n\nThis is a very short game, but the bonus levels and level editor feature allow some extra gameplay time if you want more. It's definitely worth your time, and the dev really deserves your money!\n\nPros\n\n- Precise platforming\n- Fun\n- Fair puzzles\n- level editor\n- controller support works very well\n\nCons\n\n- Short (no problem for me, but some people want longer games)\n- music get repetitive after a while\n- had the game crash before being patched (works great now)","December 30, 2015","true","5.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

There are three sets of levels (?): Dawn, Day and Dusk, respectively. In each level, a new game mechanic is introduced, for example: trampolines, fans that push you around, poisons and MUCH more. also the lives change in each level.\nThe in-game music is around 2-3 minutes and loops when finished.\nThe most fun part is that there is a level editor! And you can submit your levels to the steam workshop, but it's very hard to learn and the instructions are not clear.\nBut im my opinion, 5$ price is too much for a game this short, but it's still worth every penny.\nCan't wait to see more updates and level for this game.\nI give this game a very good 8.5/10","December 21, 2015","true","4.3"," 13 of 52 people (25%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","25","13","52","6","8"

The full price of the game is $4.99. That's approximately seven tenths of a cent per life. Seven the number which is a symbol of divine abundance. In Respawn Man you have an abundance of lives. Jesus only respawned once. ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED.\n\n\ntl;dr: Yes.\n\nFor those weirdos who read:\n\nThis game is a deceptively simple looking puzzle platformer that's actually quite fun. I found myself dying a lot because I kept underestimating the levels and being hasty. Despite all my cursing and exclamations of "BULLS**T!!", every level is actually completely fair, you just might have to die a few times to figure it out.\n+Level Editor and a steam workshop full of extra levels, which will only grow larger.\n+Good background music\n+Red Shirt Star Trek Reference\n+One of the best backgrounds on steam imo: Death. (my current background)\n+Extremely responsive developer. Lets face it, there are some pretty sh***y Indie Devs out there, and this is NOT one of them.\n-Short, but\n+Fairly priced\n-Graphics are meh. Might be a plus if you don't have a good computer.\n\nThe places this game shines most are it's interesting game mechanics. There are so many games out there that look so good, but are all clones of eachother. Respawn Man is a great way to kill a few hours.","March 21","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a simple game about a man who defies death and becomes respawn man, a man who uses his own corpses to his advantage. But not all is as it appears when respawning infinitely means a life of pain and eternal suffering.\n\nThis game has a neat little story with a little hilarity and rhyme. It has easy controls and a red shirted fool, who is just abusing his time. Some of the later levels get hard, and it makes you want to break the shards. But any mistake, no matter how late, is always your fault in this grind.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who really wants to take a trip back to old 32 bit gaming and enjoy the catchy music and smooth difficulty curve level designs. Good job SolidPlasma.\n\n","December 31, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Sure, it was made with a cheap game maker software but I think the dev executed the idea pretty well.\n\nGraphics as well as sound are really bad and the controls need some polishing but you'll enjoy it anyways!","January 6","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
