I played for an hour and requested a refund.  The tutorial island is terrible, the 'helpful' messages get in the way of your view, all inventories are unintuitive, what is clickable on the screen is impossible to tell without mousing over it.\n\nThe very first quest had improper info.  Talk to the quest giver then open a door elsewhere.  Get to the door, says talk to the quest giver.  Go to quest giver, says open the door.  Have to Google to find out there was a key in a box that I didn't click on.  No need to talk to quest giver.  This is the opening tutorial.  If these mistakes are here, who knows what else is wrong.\n\nOn the opening island there is only 1 enemy.  So far the game seemed to be trying to explain how things work, but no tutorial for fighting.  So I figure out how to draw my weapon and begin fighting...which involves holding down left click on the enemy.  Seems fine, just like Diablo.  Figure I will get more moves later.  Nope, not fine.  Enemy doesn't die.  It's not like I have any skill I can use here, all I can do is melee at point blank range.  Enemy kills me with 2/3rds of it's life.  I respawn and attack again (Happily enemy doesn't go back to full HP).  2 more deaths and 5 mins later and it's dead.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with the Cursed Weapon I was holding.  I found this weapon lying around, looked better than mine so I equiped it.  It's the tutorial, so what could go wrong?  Totally cursed.  Can't un-equip.  I couldn't even figure out why I couldn't un-equip until I saw a small icon in the top right of my screen saying I was holding a cursed item.  It should have said something across my screen when I tried to switch it out.\n\nThen looting is terrible.  Want to mine?  No animation.  Just opens up a window with some ore.  EVERYTHING is like this.  Can't even shift click to put it in your inventory.  Drag and drop.  Or click a picture of a hand to get it all at once.\n\nMap is fairly bad as well.  It's huge, as advertised, but ugly and hard to understand.  For instance, I wanted to un-curse my weapon.  I had to look up what a Shrine looked like on the map since it's not listed under the rest of the large icons that signify areas of importance.  Saw this complained about in another thread since I had to look this up to.  Got to the Shrine that would supposedly uncurse my weapon, but I saw no option to do so.  Accidently fell in the water next to it and died.  Submitted a request for a refund.\n\nI don't doubt that it gets better as I go, but I'm not going to waste time here.  I found Dwarf Fortress to have a nicer UI.","November 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 192 of 266 people (72%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","72","192","266","21","29"

The game was a Kickstarter campaign that successfully funded at over $20,000.\n\nDreamatrix provided a review copy to The Hidden Levels and we thank them greatly for that.\n\nAmmendment: I have played through the fixed tutorial and learned how to craft spells and use runes for them. This aspect of the game is very unique and fun, crating spells using the faith can lead to some interesting combinations. I put together a ward with acid damage and armor reduction and enemies melted. I can see this having substantial potential but again certain aspects of the game simply need polish.\n\nI am ammending my review from not recomennded to recommended for those who want a custom character and spell building game, which needs more work to be fully finished. I state again, I ONLY recommend this to players looking for something a bit more challenging than a run of the mill experience. Below is my Original review for the sake of fairness. 11/8/15\n\n\nOriginal full review:\nI was pretty hyped to start this game after watching the trailer and in game intro video. Then we got to the character creation and the graphics seemed to take a massive jump down in terms of quality. I had trouble with that but pressing on we made a character and ventured into the tutorial. The tutorial is bugged, and this is something that I'd suggest needs to be fixed immediately. Once you get to a certain point there is a door that will not open, and essentially the tutorial dies there.\n\nInto the game I traveled into town and found a quest to go gather in a swamp. I finally found a small gap i a tree that was completely black, moused over it to see it light up, and it "zoned me" into a swamp area. I fought a few things and instantly noticed that some mobs appear and disappear, the aggro distance for each mob is tied to another, and that mobs could get stuck in the goemetry and become invincible. This all mkaes for a relatively difficult combat experience.\n\nI tried my hardest to find some of the herbs or flowers from my 2 quests, but they seemed to not exist. Was the bug in the tutorial placed there to prepare me for the bugs in the game? I pressed on and killed mobs for another 20 minutes or so, and after a half hour of just swinging the sword I headed back to town.\n\nThe map displays a vast and huge world with loads to do, so if fixed I think this game has some serious potential. The amount of loot you get and the unique crafting system are hampered by the bugs but still set this apart from some other ARPG type games. I can't reccomend it in it's current state but would suggest that I update this review after some potential updates and polishing has been done. I think this game could be great, it's just not finished yet.\n\nThanks for reading and taking the time to like our review!","November 7, 2015","true","4.9"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

I love all types of RPG games and Wave of Darkness is another one to add to the list.To me it came across of Diablo 2 mix with Sacred 2.  For an early access title, there is plenty of game contents to keep you going for hours. At the time of writing this, I only put in almost 5 hours but had no major game crashes or game breaking bugs to warrant any reason to stop playing the game.  With my GTX 960 I can run the game on max with some minor frame drop every now and then.\n\nThe combat can be a bit chunky but overall not to bad. The spell creating in great. After you created your spell, each time you cast it, it levels as well. There not to much in the way of skills as I can see yet but you do get attribute points in both character leveling and skills leaving. There are fast travel way points with in most locations.  There are some areas in the game that look like it can be easily swim across but don't temp this, as your character can't swim and will die.\n\nThe Good : -\n\n* Loot, loot and more loot\n* Plenty of Bag space on your character\n* Spell Creation - Create your own spell and level them\n* Open World\n\nThe Bad : -\n\n* Quests need to be easier to Identified in both receiving and handing in.\n* Combat can be chunky\n* Way to many keys\n* Can't Swim\n\nThe Neutral : -\n\n* Curse items\n\nOverall a great game but can be a heavy in the pocket for the cost for early access game.\n\n7/10 for me.","June 28, 2015","true","7.4"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","49","76","4","1"

Quite hardcore as RPGs go, with elaborate crafting and creating recipes for all sorts of stuff from spells ans potions all the way to weapons, gear and equipment, loads of ingredients as well. The world is more or less open, plenty of lootto go around and stuff to slay, feels oldschool with its own twists, also challenging as well.\n\nHardware specs are not ludicrous so it should run just fine on dated machines.

I'm loving this game! It reminds me a lot of Gothic (my favorite game) or Risen. Don't expect cutting edge graphics or animations.  The focus of the game is on story and exploration. The world is packed with stuff to interact with and to find and using your map is essential.  Yes, you can make bookmarks on the map.  The voice acting is great. Combat is OK; don't expect Grim Dawn style action combat. You don't actively block or dodge; combat is stat dependent. It can be a bit confusing getting started, just like Gothic was, but if you explore, everything is explained pretty well.  I also recommed watching the 3 tutorial vids and reading the manual.  Quests unlock areas of the game, so if you can't do somethng or somethng is blocked/locked, there's a reason. You can go do something else and things will work themselves out. There's minimal "hand-holding" in the game, ala Gothic. Quest givers don't have ! over their heads; you have to talk to people. And there's no "Ta-Da" when you complete a quest.  You have to figure that out yourself.  Did a merchant send you out to find a camp that was overrun by enemies and to recover a lost message?  Well, when you come on a bunch of ruined wagons and dead people, and you pick a message up off the ground, you can assume you solved the quest.  I can see spending very many hours in this game. The game really simulates exploring a new land pretty well. You have to annotate your map, you have to find stuff yourself and you have to figure out your route and your methods of accomplishing goals. To me, that's real immersion. The game is running well on my machine.   I've found only one annoying glitch, but Iggy is working on that and it didn't stop my progress in the game.  What game doesn't have a few glitches, at first?   If this is the type of game you like, I recommend this game to you.","November 10, 2015","true","29.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","1"

For example, while the game still does not hold your hand or put exclamation marks over the important NPCs (or even more insulting was Neverwinter's trail of "bread crumbs" which lead you right to the quest), Wave of Darkness makes you think. This time, there is an optional tutorial at the beginning to learn the basics before releasing you into the world. In Dawn, players were assumed to have read the manual old school-style, but gawd forbid anyone wanting to read these days.\n\nThere are lots more spells and items to craft now, and my favorite thing about weapons and armor: cursed items! This alone made me very happy.\n\nThey have tackled all of the bugs that I noticed, and even did some tweaks and improvements on the engine, which I have liked since Dawn, and I have not experienced any crashes or glitches during my play through (I am running Windows 7 Home x64).\n\nAll-in-all, I greatly enjoyed Legends of Dawn, and loved Wave of Darkness so far. If you're a fan of old school roleplaying games, and want to craft your own spells, potions, weapons, and armor, then this game is for you. While playingLegends of Dawn is not a requirement, it greatly adds to the fun, as this is the middle of a trilogy, and the story is worth it.\n\nI love this game, and can't wait to see what's next.

Despite this, the following at my honest and frank opinions on a promising indie game.\nWave of Darkness fits nicely into a genre that has been neglected some-what since the rise and rise again of the MMO. The likes of Baldur’s Gate and Diablo filled many hours of my gaming youth. This meant that I was somewhat excited to see what Dreamatrix were giving us when I received the key.\nHesitantly I installed the game and launched, if I’m honest I was expecting to be disappointed. What I was given was a visual delight with some of the most genuinely pleasing aesthetics I have seen in an Indie title. This coupled with a soundtrack that helps to build on the feeling of the game, makes for a truly inspiring gaming experience.\nLike all new games Wave of Darkness does have some issues; however I have every confidence these will be resolved by the developers in due course. The camera controls are old fashioned and seem awkward compared to newer titles. Looting of mobs is easier with the latest update, however being able to drop items quickly into my inventory with a right click would be much easier and quicker than dragging and dropping. Whilst these slight issues are a little annoying they are far from game breaking.\nThe biggest disappointment came in the form of character creation. The developers have included three races, but what is lacking is any kind of indication in the character creation screen as to how these races interact with one another that might give an indication as to which one to play as. Furthermore there are limits to how you can make the model look, whilst this is not a massive issue in this style of top down RPG a little additional customisation is always nice. Again this in no way impacts on the game play.\nI am aware that I have only played for a little over one hour, so this review is based on first impressions, but in the cut throat gaming world, first impressions are vital, and in this case, over all I am impressed and will be continuing my adventure soon.\n6.5/10\n","November 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","1"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel!

The gameplay is very familiar for most RPG'ers. Solid title, tons of hours of play, but nothing that REALLY makes it stand out so far. All in all, worth a try for RPG fans. 3/5\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nFirst things first, this is a pretty solid game. 70+ hours of good, above-average RPG gameplay is nothing to scoff at. The graphics are not going to blow you away and neither is the music. However, the game does have pretty good looking load screens and the intro is pretty awesome, frankly. As for the game itself, this one certainly has more fighting and action than the last RPG I covered The Age Of Decadence. The crafting system is actually pretty manageable and can yield some pretty cool items, potions, etc. There is a lot to do, as there appear to be TONS of NPC's to interact with, side quests to engage in and a lot more going on than just the main story. However, all that being said....nothing really stands out to me about this one. It is fun, it has a huge world with tons to explore and there really are a lot of possibilities....it's just not really sucking my in story-wise so far. I find myself plowing through without being very drawn into the game at all. It could be a personal preference though. I'd say it's worth about $20 and sits at a solid 3/5. Give it a try if you love RPG's.\n\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","November 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

There are still some problems, but I'm sure they will succeed with the help of the players, to make a very good RPG this game.\nThe main quest is very long, but I think it lacks side quests - maybe later? I still have many things to do - to equip my home in Sidis Tarea to store ingredients and then make some crafting. Deepening the creation spells ... still lots of hours of gameplay! Discover all books daniens see what are all small statues that I recovered ...\nNow the game is fluid and fun to play.\n\nLes devs ont pris en considération toutes les remarques des joueurs, et la plupart des problèmes ont été résolus très rapidement. Le jeu peut être encore amélioré, et Dreamatrix est à l'écoute des joueurs pour cela. Alors n'hésitez pas à donner votre avis.\nC'est un très bon RPG, avec une quête principale très longue ; après une soixantaine d'heures de jeu, je n'ai pas encore eu le temps de tout voir, entre autre aménager la maison du joueur, faire de l'artisanat et créer toutes sortes de sorts.\nLe jeu est fluide, les différentes régions en monde ouvert et la variété de monstres rend le jeu très agréable à jouer.","June 24, 2015","true","169.7"," 28 of 55 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","28","55","3","1"

I did a few voices for WoD and I played just a bit of this and wanted to write a word or two.  I don't play many games anymore like this.  Just so involved to do so but the music is really good, the graphics are nice, the interfaces are logical and the little icons up left are nice to get at all the info you want.  I'll admit though, this game was kicking my butt so I'll have to figure out some good way to ramp up my weapons/armor/etc before going much farther.\n\nYou can zoom into a closer almost horizontal view or zoom out into an overhead view.  You can rotate the camera around so you are moving in whatever direction you like, although the camera panning is a bit slow for my tastes.  No idea if this is an innovation as I don't play many RPGs.  But anyway, this seems to be a pretty good game but gosh, I don't know if I'd ever finish it.  I'm too old!\n\nSo, there's my little review.  The game seems very challenging to me but again, maybe I'm just old. :)  But I actually prefer a harder game than one that's too easy and you just sort of breeze through it.  When you beat a harder game, it's more satisfying anyway.\n\nI'm sure I'll fire this up again and this time... I'll bring some STRATEGY! hahahhaa\n\nTS","November 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","12","24","3","0"

(This help was received after posting on the forums requesting it, not because of my negative review as some people think)\n\nI think this is justified for 2 reasons:\n\nOne, because the help players get on the forums is MOSTLY personal dev to player emails. Not a lot of dev's take time like this to help people out. Secondly, I think a few of the comments here may be correct, as the game does not have a positive review as a whole. Which isn't fair. From what I've seen, it deserves one.\n\nAnother EDIT: I've finally fixed my issue. I'm not sure if it has to do with having two monitors of different screen region, but the game wasn't launching in 1920x1080 - though not being the correct region I still feel shouldn't crash the game and make it unplayable. I was able to fix this issue by changing resolution at launch to 1920  1080 in the config file.\n\nI'm really enjoying the game so far.","June 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","20","40","2","8"

They also don't list anywhere on them the maximum number of upgrades (total slots) they can have, which can lead to you buying too many of a bag and essentially wasting gold.\nDespite what seems like a massive world, the whole place really is rather linear, and still confusing at the same time.\nA lot of the quest texts are unclearly written, which can lead you to attempt the wrong thing (or go the wrong place) which gets frustrating fast.\nYou don't really get many skills in the game, you (mostly) get Spells. Spells are odd too- you'll combine Runes (which, sadly enough is the name for both an item to unlock certain chests, and the items to make spells) to craft a spell, but that doesn't teach you the spell..you still have to carry the spell around in your bags, taking up inventory slots. Some spell combinations are ridiculous (both good and bad), and a lot of it really, really doesn't make sense.\nHonestly, I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless you're prepared for a lot of frustration","April 26","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it dies in a lot of aspects.\n\nIts basically the same game weve all played, but does it worse in a lot of ways. Youd probably enjoy your time more if you just up and bought Skyrim or Diablo or something.\n\n"Can be explored in any way and whenever you want" Funny then what are these hedgehog walls (which any functional being would have no issue climbing over or around) doing here? They arent any better than the invisible walls the game page says this game doesnt have. Oh yeah, and the cunning lack of invisible walls by using deadly deep water instead.\n\n"Allows you to combine and experiment with different character classes" Yeah, maybe when you get a fair distance into the game. But you might as well just resign yourself to Melee for the time being, because you dont have a choice when you start up the game, only difference is that melee specced stats are more useful at the start than magery specced ones.\n\nThats just the start of the blatant flaws this game has, not to mention it actually doesnt look as good as the screenshots above, even on max settings. Its like playing NWN again, but far less functional.\n\nNot worth the price, and not worth what i paid for it when it was on special. Maybe later if they fix some massive issues, but at the moment, steer elsewhere.\n\nThis game claims that its for the Hardcore Oldschool RPG fans. And im insulted, as i am one of them.\n\n------\n\nBecause apparently two features they used ambiguously wasnt enough, heres some more of my experiences:\n\nTutorial is a joke, it barely tells you where to go. You are quite frequently expected to have any clue when the quest objectives progressed, and at the end of the Tutorial when it tells you to 'find your own road' to the first city, it fails to mention that there isnt one. Going right results in a blocked road and broken bridge. Up leads to water which will apparently dissolve you since youre water soluable (What? seriously?), Down does the same. And left leads you to a peninsula with loot on it. Guess how long it took for me to realise "Skip tutorial" was what i was apparently meant to do. (i think so, anyway. The quest straight up vanished from my quest log)\n\nLooting is slow and overwhelming, literally turning the first few minutes outside the tutorial onward into an inventory management game.\n\nThe combat is simple, (and while very reminicent to other games of its type), is incredibly unimaginative. Bash/Cast/Buff/Summon/Etc. Nothing new, nothing special.\n\nThe map claims to be huge, and by scale it is, but literally only because your means of transport is a jog. The map itself is pretty average in size.\n\nThe ground itself has poor hitboxes and a wrong step when exploring could put you into a certain death situation due to the lack of a 'jump' button. (not complaining about the button, mind you).\n\nthe time it takes to bring up the save window (even on an i5 4690k and gtx970) is pretty obnoxious, considering certain other titles have zero issues with loading said menus.\n\nSome tips that pop up suggest you to use taunts, when the button isnt even bound by default.\n\nthe character and weapon models look like something youd expect from the mid 2000s more than today. (think Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines number of polygons)\n\nOnly half the objects that can be interacted with indicate so (Corpses of kills do not at any point indicate so) and the rest only show up when you mouse over them.\n\nLooted objects remain in world (fair enough) but can be looted once more, and with many of them overlapping, mostly clipping into the floor, or straight up having iffy clickboxes (i had to click a cultists foot, once to get any loot) youll quite frequently spend post battle clicking over and over on all the corpses to make sure you didnt miss anything, since even an EMPTY lootable can still be looted again.\n\n\nIts a common occurence that "open world, go where you want" results in a lot of lack of direction and confusion as to the focus of the game, and this is no exception by any means.","November 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","4"

That magic item you carry around forever until you can get it identified? Still garbage compared to your starting gear! Quest reward you worked so hard for...  Yeah.
