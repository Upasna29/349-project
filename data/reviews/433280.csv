I have been playing the demo for a long time and couldn't get the full version in my hands.\n\nThe Warlords Battlecry series are classic fantasy RTS games. With lots of races to choose from, and classes available for customizing your hero, you will lead your own campaign in conquering the riches of the land of Etheria!\n\nAlso:\n"1...2...3, BERSERKER!!!"

With almost a dozen and a half well-balanced races to choose from, the replayability value is absolutely insane and every race has several viable strategies that will work to use their strengths against their opponents' weaknesses.  Creating your leader, a hero, is also extremely rewarding from the nearly infinite number of builds that you could create.\n\nThe gameplay and story are a worthy pairing for the mechanics even if it does sound somewhat familiar to that of a standard adventure RPG cliche.  A great evil is rising and threatens to overtake the world.  Your chosen faction is determined to defeat it and, through your choices, you will make many allies and enemies of the other factions as you travel throughout the world accomplishing what you must to do so.  The world map is interesting with lore behind every location and tons and tons of content to explore as the game is very non-linear.  Combat is also a fun experience where each faction's strengths and weaknesses can be used to your advantage.  Each faction has its own unique units and buildings as well as its own level of priority for the four resources of the game.  For example, the Dwarves faction uses a ton of metal, the Daemons are heavily based on stone and crystal, and the Empire prioritizes gold, though, each of these factions will find itself needed at least a little of these key resources to truly build a respectable army.\n\nYour faction, whether you choose a fantasy classic like the Knights or Dark Elves, or a more unique one like the disease-carrying Plague Lords, or the lizardman-like Ssrathi, is an absolute blast to play.  Each has a list of armies and buildings that are almost entirely different from the other races as well as a separate tech tree.  Your hero, however, is the ultimate icing on the cake in my opinion.  With sixteen races and twenty-eight classes to choose from you could never tire of trying out different combinations to create vastly different heroes.  Each race provides six skills for you hero and each class does the same.  Each level that you achieve in the game provides you with a point to improve these skills and further improve and specialize your build.\n\nI would recommend this game to all RTS fans as well as those who love fantasy RPGs.  This is a great game that to this day I don't tire of.  I purchased it instantly as soon as I saw it on Steam and wanted to get the word out that it is an absolute gem!\n\n","January 22","true","3.1"," 91 of 103 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","91","103","3","9"

This is in my opinion one of the all time greats for real time strategy because of its bold hybrid nature, original soundtrack and voice acting, and ahead of its time mechanics. This is the very definition of a cult classic video game.\n\nHere's the long version: This game has an incredible number of stream lined RTS features that put it WAY beyond its time in terms of utility and functionality. Resource gathering is a little similar to that found in a Relic RTS (CoH or dawn of war) in that resources are based on "territory" capture (I put in quotes because the resource buildings must be captured by either your hero or one of his generals).  Buildings had the ability to set continuous production on any pattern of units or upgrades you wanted. Each unit can be set to behave according to a huge number of AI scripts including scout/rampage (useful in the age-old RTS conundrum of when your opponent is hiding one villager somewhere on the map with a secret little building and you dont want to have to search endlessly).\n\nAbove all else is the ability to make a persistent hero with his own posse of regular ole soldiers who rise above the ranks and stick with you above and beyond battles. This concept is what got me into this game in the first place and its something that saddens me to not have found its way into any other RTS's (that I know of).\n\nThe heroes are many and their abilities are interesting but one of the things I was not a big fan of when I first played the game was the plot driven campaign (I always liked Warlords Battlecry II's Total War style campaign map). I did warm up to this later on and I now view it as an improvement.\n\nWhats further incredible about this game is the sheer number of sides with very unique mechanics for each one. There is a side for everyone to take up and enjoy. (Undead take little wimpy skelemen and turn them into apocalyptic harbingers of death... dark dwarves can use their engineers to build massive siege buildings... There's an entire race of fairy people that were extremely broken but seriously who would stoop so low as to play as a giant race of pixies?) Most of all, each side has a unique feel that is spot on.\n\nThere are a ton of other features that I often miss when I play other RTS's as well but I only wanted to highlight my favorites.\n\nIn conclusion this niche classic is a fantastic time killer and quite a bit of fun. Whenever I look at spending money on a game I ask myself how many subway sandwiches is this thing worth? Is Warlords Battlecry 3 worth two subway sandwiches? Absolutely. I mean seriously. I eat subway sandwiches and then poop them out. This gave me hours of entertainment just now. I started writing this. Played like 6 missions in the campaign and enjoyed it a great deal. Easily worth 10 bucks. Buy the game. Maybe they'll make WBC IV someday. Maybe.","January 24","true","13.1"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","44","44","3","0"

This is a very good RTS-RPG on all levels with a huge amount of content, but it is simply very generic in its theme, that's all.\n\nIt's not even generic in a bad way, it just has all the classic units and races you'd expect or want.\n\nThe weakest part of the game overall is probably the graphics which were not that great when it came out in the first place, some units also feel a bit out of place graphically when you take the art themes into account, sort of like when units are added with a mod and they don't look like the same person made them.\n\nOh, and it would be best if you didn't buy this for the MP, I'm not sure what sort of hoops you're going to need to jump through to get it working.","January 22","true","0.2"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","57","69","0","2"

However, I really can't recommend this version of the game at all as it includes fan patches that not only fix the bugs but also change the gameplay drastically.\n\nScroll down for what I said when I thought this was the official version and what I'd restore along with a recommendation if it is reverted to the official version.\n\nIt's like having a reunion with a long lost childhood friend, only to find that, during our long separation, aliens have abducted him, experimented on him and gave him an extensive modification before letting him go. While these modifications are, according to the aliens, improvement, the person is no longer your childhood friend but a total stranger wearing your friend's face.\n\nSo, if you've played the official version and is planning on getting this for nostalgia's sake you should at least find out what the fan patch changes and decide whether or not you could live with it.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nNote that I'll be approaching this game from a(n extremely) nostalgic point of view.\n\nThe moment I saw this game on steam, the first thing I was checking if my eyes were deceiving me.\nAnd when I could confirm that it is really here, I bought it without any hesitation.\nThis game literally is my childhood. While it is certainly not the first RTS I've ever played, It's certainly what instill the love of the genre in me.\n\nOn to the game itself, there are two features which, to me, give this game the charm that even modern RTSs couldn't match; the hero system and the races.\n\nThere are 16 races in this game and all of them are almost completely unique (there're a few units that turn up in more than one races, like peasants, the builder unit for both Knights and Empire). While this introduce some balance problems (like how the Orcs have limited anti air capabilities while the Demons have air superiority, which will put Orcs at a disadvantage should the two races are put to fight each other), the variety results in an almost endless strategic possibilities and is like a playground for a child's imagination. Even as an adult, I still sometimes think back to the days before I lost the disc and imagine how the races interact with another. There're few games that let war elephants duke it out with a freaking T-rex (yes, there are T-rexes in this game, and it's almost worth buying just for them alone).\n\nAnd now for the hero system, instead of playing separate battles and begin anew every time, you create persistent heroes (which you can choose from all the sixteen races and twenty eight classes, in an almost RPG-like system) and have them, and their retinue of hand-picked troops, leading the battles. While this, again, creates balance problems (as a level 50+ hero could probably stemroll an entire base lead by a level 1 hero, even though there are temporary heroes and no heroes mode designed to avoid that), it also leads to a very satisfyinng gameplay as you build your hero up, finding new gears and gaining new abilities and more overpowered retinues. The system let you immerse yourself in your hero's journey and exercise your imagination. Even after many, many year, I still remember fondly my favourite hero, a Ssrathi (basically half man, half snake) Paladin, equally skilled in close combat and healing Magic, bodyguarded by a T-rex, a Minotaur King (who is as tall as the T-rex), a Knight Lord, a High Elven Moonguard and a white dragon. Isn't that awesome? That's the kind of experience this game gives. And of course, ther're so many other builds out there that could satisfy basically any idea.\n\nThe game isn't without its flaw and even its huge fan like me acknowledges that. It seems to focus on diversity of builds and strategies rather than balance, the point I've already brought up (twice). And the graphic is pretty old even in 2004 (when it came out) and is completely outdated in 2016. Still, if you can get past that and you like RTSs, RPGs or a great mix of both, I believe this game will satisfy your need and your imagination quite nicely.","January 24","false","12.4"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","40","52","0","4"

I enjoyed the combat mechanics to a degree and loved the idea of retaining troops and a hero after each map. This game brings more of the same and then some. That is to say, the same sprites that were used in the first and second games make an appearance here in the third game as well.\n\nThe leveling mechanic in Warlords Battlecry 3 is done right. Your hero gains experience as the match goes on and can even level during the match (something that could not be done in the first one). Tons of classes and races allow for moderate choices which can dramatically alter your game play.\n\nThe varying abilities that are available for warlords to take can alter everything. Abilities like Engineer make your building have more hp (think tower defense), while merchant lowers the price of all units universally (good for swarm tactics). Abilities like constitution make warrior warlords a pain, while specific classes such as pyromancy can make enemy warlords dangerous. A well built warlord can take down an army in the blink of an eye, as long you carefully watch the battle unfold.\n\nIf the Hero concept does not sell the game to you, then maybe the races will. There are 16 different races, each with unique troops and abilities to really add variety and replayability. Although some units are shared by races, you'll be impressed with the selection given here! To add to this, each race has a unique titan that can really change the tide of battle.\n\nTitans are units that can only be built near end match when most upgrades have been researched. After it is available, it takes a while to build and if it dies, its gone for the match. However, Titans can mow down armies without flinching, provided they don't get overwhelmed! (If you don't like this concept there is an option to turn this off, but why would you?)\n\nFinally, the campaign is truly something to behold. Loads of side missions and ambushes add for a significant amount of reputability. The mainline of the campaign is not all that exciting and ends quickly but the significant amount of side mission will more than make up for the weakness of the mainline in the campaign. The missions are also quite varied too. Tournament pitting you Warlord vs others as well as defense missions and elimination missions leave the campaign quite varied.\n\nAlthough my overall view of this game is highly positive, I would be boldly lying if I did not say there were problems with the game as well. Bugs that were very annoying in the first game have made a return here. I experienced an average of "1 crash every hour", but most came from multiplayer. I am unsure if what was causing the issues but it was a problem for both Windows 8 and 10. Low max resolution can be a little annoying to some as well (although it didn't bother me at all).\n\nThe most important problem by far though is the AI in Warlords Battlecry series. Sometimes you will start a match and the AI will be vicious. They will quickly swarm you and be relentless for quite some time, even on easy difficulty. This can be fun at times but frustrating as well. Other times, The AI will suddenly refuse to continue on and just give up or make baffling mistakes. I watched the AI walk a Titan into a field of towers and let it die. Afterwards, maybe 10 minutes later, it brought an army that wiped the board in seconds without losing many casualties. The AI also makes VERY bad decisions with their Warlords which will handicap them (but to a lesser extent). Suffice it to say that the AI is definitely passable and a capable challenge, but could benefit from a little work.\n\n\nThe good\n\n+ Warlords\n+ Retinue of generals\n+ Loads of varying Classes\n+ Loads of different Races\n+ Titans add a new level of combat\n+ More fleshed out mechanics\n+ Building art style is nice\n+ Soundtrack is decent (and easily modifiable if you want to make a custom soundtrack)\n\n\nThe Bad\n- Still filled with some annoying bugs\n- Crashes are horribly common (I would go hours without having one, then have 3 in 10 minutes)\n- Random AI can sometimes be REALLY hard or REALLY easy.\n- At times, maps are not optimized for the AI to understand. (Some maps cause the AI to become brain dead)\n- Max resolution is 1280x1024 (which you get used to quickly but still should have higher resolution available)\n- The fan made patches for this game are forcefully implemented here. (It is obvious that Steam and GOG did not spend any time playing the game as one mod adds a silly profane comment when building conversion occurs.) This is not a deal breaker, especially with this game, but I hate when stuff like this happens. I want the option to mod me vanilla game, not be given a premoded version.\n\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10 and recommend it for Warlords series fans. Its a good strategy game for anyone but its massive compilation of Warlords units (especially from Warlords 4) was awesome. This game is rough around the edges and some support would really help smooth out the problems. None of the problems I encountered were ever bad enough to make me upset with the game.

It's extremely challenging when you want it to be or a cake walk if you don't feel like trying to hard. The game itself has plenty of personality, fun sound effects and satisfying feeling of being able to primarily focus on your army.\n\nPositives:\n- RPG Hero System\n- Huge Battles & Maps\n- Fun campaign with excellent flavour from the story\n- 16 different races to choose from over your standard 2-3 other RTS' at the time offered.\n- 28 different hero classes\n\nNegatives (99% due to age):\n- It's age holds it back meaning resolution is lower and no where near compatible with widescreen. The game itself works fine, just stretches the image or provides you with black bars.\n- Crashes when the battles get too intense\n- Multiplayer can be a bit finicky to get working with the constant need to restart the game after each match and occassional crashes during it.\n\n\nI highly recommend The Protectors Mod as this provides huge amounts of functionality in regards to updating the old system to support higher resolutions, more units and a magnitude of other features. As the link isn't allowed on this review, simply google search it along with the name of the game and you'll get it straight away.","January 27","true","0.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Think warcraft 3 but less polished. However, there is a big list of playable races with it's own units and niches. A ton of different classes to play with and different schools of magic to learn.\n\nThe game has alot of diversity, and we are thankful that it is now on Steam after all this time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelJaded/recommended/433280/","CelJaded","CelJaded","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelJaded/","84 products in account","A powerful addiction of heroic role-playing meets old school strategic gameplay that rarely fails to surprise.\nThere are many reasons as to why Warlords Battlecry III failed to set the world on fire, but if you look hard enough, you'll find one of the most dedicated and passionate fan bases in computer gaming today; a community that, like myself, just can't seem to put this excellent game down.\n\nBattlecry III is a cult favourite then, a title with an enduring legacy that fans have continued to support over the years with a wealth of quality mods, maps, and patches that either improve, enhance and otherwise expand this wonderful blend of heroic fantasy and real-time strategy.\n\nAs an RTS, Battlecry III is both original and familiar. Usually you'll start by exploring the map and guiding your hero unit to resource mines that he/she/it can convert to your side and choke points that need to be guarded against enemy scouts.\n\nMeanwhile you'll have your worker units busily constructing a base and once those precious resources of gold, metal, ore and crystal start to pour in, it's time to produce new units and upgrades that will strengthen your chosen plan of attack.\n\nBefore you can take part in this skirmish however you need to create your own hero and here is where the fun really begins. Battlecry III makes one crucial change over its prequel; a change that improves the overall game significantly.\n\nUnlike Battlecry II, where heroes developed down a more stringent path, Battlecry III streamlines every heroic class and allows you to experiment with each one right from the beginning.\n\nSure, it may not be the best idea to create a charisma-starved undead merchant, but the game isn't going to stop you from trying it! Maybe you like the idea of creating a noble knight who practices the dark arts of necromancy? Or a wood elf who summons demons? Perhaps a plaguelord alchemist? A dwarven healer? Or an orcish paladin?\n\nThe combinations are truly endless and with 16 different races, 29 heroic classes and even more skills, weapons and experience points to gather, you're bound to find something here that suits your preferred play style.\n\nBattlecry III is made even more memorable by its charming sense of humour and rather old school isometric 3D graphics. Each battlefield unit has plenty of fun sound files and animations that makes for many a colourful confrontation loaded with more personality than a dozen similar titles I've played over the years.\n\nThe majority of this characterization comes from the contrast between the good, neutral and evil races; something that is amusingly highlighted when their respective units are clicked in-game. "The age of heroes has ended!" yells the dark rider, "buttercups and rainbows!" squeaks the diminutive fey sprite, and "when is dinner?" inquires the oafish orc giant.\n\nThe main campaign mode is made more interesting this time around too with a dedicated storyline accompanying your conquests across the land of Etheria and a developing narrative that explores your hero's effort to seal away Gorgon; the feared fifth horseman of ancient legend.\n\nIt's here though that you start to recognize the one thing that's really holding Battlecry III back; its budget. It's clear that the creators put a lot of love into this game, but as reviewers pointed out at the time, there are several aspects that feel a bit underdeveloped and old-hat; no doubt a symptom of time and budgetary constraints during its production.\n\nThere is a raft of missing content from Battlecry II for one, including unit sound effects, quests (in-game challenges that crop up from shrines) and certain scripts for hero builds and AI behaviour. Whilst graphically the game looks more detailed than Battlecry II, it's a shame that some of the second game's vibrant colour has been lost during the transition.\n\nAlso upsetting is the amount of bugs, balance concerns and the shoddy net code that is terribly unfit for purpose. Battlecry III is a great game to play with friends, no doubt about it, but good luck getting your session to sync up correctly first time.\n\nGetting back to the point I made about the story; it's also a shame that the final campaign mission doesn't feature a final showdown with Gorgon himself, as you merely fight his minions in a gauntlet-style survival encounter whilst an anti-climatic timer ticks along in the corner.\n\nAt many of these points you get the feeling that the developer's time and money simply ran out, leaving the game in a disappointing state of 'almost there'.\n\nLuckily the fan community for Battlecry III has gone well beyond the call of duty with several talented members continuing to improve the game with both Infinite Interactive's blessing and their assistance.\n\nArmed with a portion of the game's source code, a dedicated cult of modders have gone on to create brand new patches that fix bugs, balance units and in some cases add completely new content such as a summoning timer and the awesome monk hero class.\n\nWithout these community patches Battlecry III would be a much harder sell and it really speaks volumes about the raw passion and energy that has gone into these fan-made enhancement projects.\n\n(Pro tip for new players:- the Vampirism skill does not function in the 1.03.24, build so bear this in mind when building a character!)\n\nAnother reason I have continued to appreciate this title over the years is my belief in this truly being a game without boundaries.\n\nWhen it comes to heroes for example, there's no level cap and therefore no limit to how absurdly powerful your favourite little avatar can become.\n\nIf you truly are dedicated enough to make it past level 100 then expect to see the game balance busted wide open as your epic hero reigns death upon your enemies with lightening fast attacks, devastating spells and a heavily discounted legion of augmented troops.\n\nOnce again, it may be a little crazy, but the game isn't going stop you from trying it, because if it's fun, what else really matters? Admiteddly, there is a lot standing in the way of Warlords Battlecry III being any good.\n\nThe art style looks dated, the netcode is barely there and it’s blessed with more than its fair share of bugs and balance concerns.\n\nNevertheless, this is a game that will suck you in for hours at a time and truly astonish you with its replayability, sense of humour and irresistible marriage of strategy and open-ended RPG elements.\n\nA sketchy work of pure brilliance.\n\nRead the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]","January 27","true","0.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

If you've never played it and you like strategy games then I highly recommend this one. The graphics are lacking but there are tons of races/classes, 100's of spells, hundreds of items if not thousands :p  Fans of this might also want to check out Heroes of Annilated Empires, there are sme similarities but this game has way more options.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT - anyone that buys this, especially if you didn't play it in the past, I found a game manual free download here http://www.replacementdocs.com/download.php?view.1624 It's a 88 page manual just to give you an idea of how much depth there is in this little treasure. The manual helped me greatly and I played 100's of hours in the past. Dev/publisher/whoever should really put a link on the store page for it..

It has a heavy blend of RPG elements like a hero that carries over between battles, 29 classes to specialize with and even all your units can gain exp and level up. You can also keep a retinue of leveled up soldiers to bring into more skirmishes.\n\nThere are 16 races to play with, almost all of them having some theme or special trait unique to them. The downside is that with so many races, a few of them feel a little lacking in depth or unit variety, especially if you were to compare them with the factions from other rts games like starcraft or dawn of war.\n\nThe campaign mode is decent,  but I liked the campaign from the second game way better. It actually feels like a less polished version of the previous game's campaign.\n\nAside from all that its a pretty old game now, I think the graphics are still tolerable and I have encountered a few minor bugs, but I still strongly recommend it.\n\nI've also heard theres a pretty rad mod for this game, but I havn't checked it out yet.\n\n","January 23","true","25.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Other than that though this is a pretty entertaining game; I love the mix of RPG elements blended in with the real-time strategy aspects such as how a character can retain his levels for future missions with all the base-building, teching, and unit micromanagement of the RTS genre. I really would like to play this Multiplayer as my skirmishes against the AI are uneventful although were fun to learn how the game works. I have yet to play the Campaign mode as well but if it adds a story to the already intriguing system of leveling up and building then I'm all for it.\n\nI'd give this game a solid 7/10 due to the fact that the game is a bit unrefined at times with units not following today's standards of pathfinding along with some clunkiness with the AI, and lastly an Ironman Mode feature that apparently has not worked for a while. I'd expect if I had a friend or two to play this with this could easily be bumped up to an 8.","February 10","true","6.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

For anyone who was around for the original Warlords BC series, this was the pinnacle of their game system.  Some might say that WBC 2 was the most interesting in terms of character building and campaign, but this one stands in contrast to that one in the freedom it offers.\n\nThe freedom is almost overwhelming at first.  Which race/class combination to choose?  Because you can choose any of any.  Undead paladin?  Fey Necromancer?  Orcish Merchant?  All doable.  It stokes the imagination.\n\nHowever, the graphics and ui haven't aged well.  Other modern games do it better.  You can't play in windowed mode, for instance, though if you set up your monitor a certain way, it won't stretch the graphics on a wide screen.  The art style isn't bad, per se.  It's very colorful in contrast to former entries to the series.  And the number of effects are pretty satisfying to look at if you're able to look at them through nostalgia glasses (provided you've been around long enough to be nostalgic.).\n\nAnyway, I still say this is the best of the mid-late nineties early 2000's RTS genre.  It's the pinnacle of all the warcraft and starcraft.  And to boot, you get a hero that persists through all your battles.  It's fun having that continuity in a game of this kind.","January 24","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These changes have re-balanced many of the units and heroes to suit more of an arena style of play. For an actual change log you would have go to the site in order to see the full list.\n\nThis is one of the best RTS games of it's time and although the graphics have aged quite a bit it allowed you to greatly customise your hero and allow many different tactics to be used with each team. There are a total of 16 different races (some better against others) and a large game world to explore in a series of skirmishes or short missions. The major focus was on the hero and it's development in the game which race or races would it lead into battle, what are it's skills going to be and what equipment their was. While it is possible to play the game without heroes there was also no limit to their development. Races are not balanced or set to a specific play style you will need to use different tactics to stand a chance when faced with a racial mismatch but the game is almost always win-able.\n\nThe unofficial patch heroes for example have had many of their abilities changed to empower warrior type characters. New spell sets have been added and mage abilities changed to better suit the method of the modders. Summons are the most noticeable difference as you now have a limited duration on units that would likely have died due to a lack of healing from your team. The magic system in short has been altered to prevent some tactics and give others a chance if they unload all their spells at once a much harder system for people to learn.\n\nMost units from what I can remember from the original have had at least one value changed from cost to massive increases to health, armor or damage. This isn't a small change either with some of them getting double health or similar changes. The result is an over developed patched version of a game that was good by itself.\n\nUnfortunately it seems to be a case of if it ain't broken why fix it. The game is less friendly than the original for new people and many older players want their classic game back. You could call this Warlords Battlecry 4 for all the changes they have done but they aren't good ones. Play the version you want and try the 1.30B patch in compadibility mode before you judge the game.","January 25","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I've experienced other odd, one-off bugs from time to time, like being declared victorious when the enemy kills my hero instead of other way 'round, and unusual unit behavior occasionally.  But I was such a huge, drooling fanboy of WBII, which sadly is not offered on Steam, that I had to pick up WBIII for 10 bucks.  It's not all that different from WBII and still contains all the elements that made the original great: persistent heroes, different races to lead (with genuine differences in gameplay), towers that you can occupy to make them stronger (wish AOE had that), and no-fuss resource gathering which again you can strengthen permanently by adding workers (though "permanent" assumes the enemy won't convert your resource).  There is also some really good assignable AI for your units, with an unusually large number of choices, from RAMPANT (stomp around the map attacking everything) to GUARD to FALLBACK 25% HEALTH and PATROL and so many more.  The only time the game really gets fidgety is when the enemy and you keep converting the same set of resources over and over and over, at which point you really have to just break the cycle and start making advanced units to go wipe him out.\n\nTL;DR?\nA really good RTS in its day, with some unique features that make it still a blast to play.  This version is fan-modded and sometimes quirky, sometimes buggy.  For $10 it was a no-brainer for me, but modern gamers with no history wth the game may find it quaint and dated.","May 27","true","11.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","4"
