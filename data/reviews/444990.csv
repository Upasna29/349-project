But I guess not even with VR it would be scary.\n\nThe monsters feel cheap, the game totally feels not immersive. This is not horror, it's not scary at all. You can just stay there, watch the monster coming to you and you don't even have the wish to run away. More like: Come over here, I wanna see what bad animation you do when you arrive.\n\nThere is no tension, you just want to shut the game on the next spot you die.\n\nI'm gonna refund.","May 13","false","0.1"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","38","57","7","4"
