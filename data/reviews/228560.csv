"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jshackles/recommended/228560/","jshackles","jshackles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jshackles/","3382 products in account","The game is pretty terrible, honestly. Most of the things I thought would make a 4 player TMNT game just weren't there. This is a generic, boring, and repetitive beat-em-up. I'll try to hit the few things that before purchasing made me think "this game is going to rock" and the revelations that led to my disappointment.\n\n1) "The turtle power upgrade system will be really cool". Reality: It's not cool at all. You "level up" (although nowhere I could find is your actual level displayed) and get skill points you can distribute. But instead of getting a certain number of points for each turtle, you get a global number of points to distribute. If you want to switch between the different Turtles (especially in single player) you're going to fail pretty miserably. Also, most "skill tree" unlocks don't seems to do much if anything - there doesn't "feel" like a difference between being low level and high level.\n\n2) "Everything I love about the shows and comic books is here." The developers really pushed this: this game was made for the 30-something Turtles fan. Except, in reality, it's not. Despite having completely different (and sometimes creepy) graphics, all of the characters are exactly the same as they are in the brand new Nickelodeon show. And as if to add insult to injury, they didn't even get the same voice actors from the new show. There isn't much here for the 30-something TMNT fan, especially if you haven't watched the new show.\n\n3) "It will probably have an interesting/epic story". Nope. Seems like it was written for a 5 year old. Seriously, the new show has better plots than this game on a weekly basis. Nothing to see here. My playthrough did last about 4 hours (which is fairly high for a $15 game) but I'd say at least 2 hours of that was grinding away on and endless number of bad guys and/or replaying parts after dying due to their terrible checkpoint system.\n\n4) "I heard about this game over a year ago: the developers have probably had plenty of time to flush out all of the bugs by now." Wrong again. In addition to the AI being (just, in general) terrible, I encountered TONS of bugs. Once while fighting Shredder the first time, one of my AI turtle teammates was standing on his head and they were both spinning in circles wildly without moving. During another boss battle with Kurai at the construction site, the boss got stuck in a part of the map I couldn't access yet and just kept throwing bombs at me, causing me to eventually have to reload from the previous checkpoint about 10 minutes earlier. Finally, the little "mini-game" where the turtles try to hack stuff: at first I thought it was really cool. Donatello hacks things easier than the others, so use him. Until the last level: where even with Donatello's ability, the hacking terminals are literally impossible. Meaning you have to exit out and re-enter the hacking attempt until you find one that can actually be solved. And I don't mean "impossible" like "Oh man, that's really hard, I'd never be able to figure that out!" I mean "impossible" like "there is literally no way this can be accomplished". I wish I had a screenshot handy because it's hard to explain. Anyway, it required a fair bit of loading/reloading on some of the hacking terminals.\n\nWell that about sums it up. I can't really think of any redeeming qualities this game has. Besides maybe that a lot of the achievements were really easy to get. But even that becomes like the chore that drives you to play longer when you really just want to give up on it.\n\nSorry for the long review. If you're a huge TMNT fan and have watched the new cartoon (like me) I guess I could see picking this up for 75% off and being okay with it. Don't pay full price though, unless you want to be disappointed.","August 29, 2013","false","5.6"," 99 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","99","135","0","8"

The story and voice actors are good, the combat is fun, the moves are awesome without being unreal, the ninja aspects are integrated well, and the soundtrack is mega rad. A lot of games for franchises can be awful, but it's obvious the makers of this really loved TMNT and really wanted to make something worthy of it.\n\nThe con is that the combat can be overly complicated, with no way to really compensate in other areas, such as by having a "pause and issue commands" type function. Health packs are few and far between, and power ups come too slowly for how quickly the enemies improve. There are a ton of moves to learn and memorise, which require expert timing to pull off.\n\nI am not going to finish this game because I just find the combat too frustrating. I'm still listing this as a positive review because it is honestly such a great game except for this one flaw. Besides, it might just be that I've spent too much time in FPS and someone else would take to these controls like a duck to water.","November 27, 2015","true","6.7"," 84 of 113 people (74%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","74","84","113","10","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/228560/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This game is a trainwreck on wheels but its still a fun short ride for what it is.  The game is an old school button masher mostly just hit the x button for attack, there is a kick button but its not needed.  The game is low budget and the devs did a great job with what little it seems like they had budget wise to work with.  They opted out of cut scenes using a comic panel style to spend more time and money on the game itself.  The gameplay is fun and easy for anyone to play, just hit everything in sight.  The action stays fresh because you can switch turtles to use their different weapons.\n\nMost of the game is very dark and some parts are just entirely pitch black or unfinished maybe?  The camera is zoomed in real close and for some reason seems to point down alot making it one of those games where you fight the camera.  The combat is like a cheap version of Batman but somehow balanced very well.  In batman the combat is fluid while in this its stunted leaving your character swinging weapons in the air while facing an enemy.  The game is real short almost to the point of feeling like its just an episode which would be great if they make more but it seems like the game is just left to rot even though people worked hard on it.  All the turtles look sorta strange with elongated limbs and necks, so does April which must be some artistic choice like with Splinter where he looks more like a werewolf than a rat.\n\nEven with all those negatives the game is still a fun beat em up brawler that anyone can pick up and play anytime without complex controls to master which is great and satisfying to play.  Lots of fun dialog makes all those things you should hate about the game fade into the background somehow.  Its really true magic to play a game riddled with normally gamebreaking mechanics and yet still have fun doing it.\n\nRating:  7/10  Value:  $7.99","May 14, 2015","true","9.0"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","39","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/228560/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","Out of the Shadows is a tragic case of Activision being Activision. The game is much better than the two recent games released on XBOX 360 based off of the television series (TMNT and TMNT:DOTO), but yet this installment leaves such a foul taste in the mouth when thinking about it. The game is unfinished, with extemely low-quality textures and low-quality audio on both music, and voice acting that sounds like it was recorded with tin cans instead of proper microphones (even if the Voice Actors themselves are talented, they sound ♥♥♥♥ here). The low-quality textures are hidden under attrocious lighting effects created by what feels like a gimped version of Unreal 3, and if you could see the models, you'd notice that they ended up doing a copy-pasta job in most levels, meaning that levels look the same all over, making it easy, especially in the opening level, to get lost in the subway tunnel section and end up running into invisible walls if you aren't paying attention and miss the train platforms.\n\nThe gameplay, with more work again would have been immensely satisfying. Although movement and combat animation and responses feels somewhat floaty, the game actually does make a good button masher with some Batman Arkham combat elements thrown in, barring counters which feel unresponsive in some areas. When played with the under-developed practise/arcade mode, which throws you into a more traditional TMNT arcade game-like world, the game really comes into its own, playing really well and actually being enjoyable. The problem is that this is not the main game, but this side-mode is so much more fun than the base game. I was never able to play multiplayer, due to Activision never patching the multiplayer service to actually work without tricks and external tweaking, and the fact that I couldn't get any of my friends on Steam to buy it because they thought it looked like ♥♥♥♥ based on the promotional material.\n\nIn the end, TMNT Out of the Shadows feels like an absolute failure, and that's because it is. Activision pushed out a game that would never come into its own because they prefered to pretend it didn't exist. The game, in the state you can buy it in is an absolute insult to the franchise, and shows what Activision thinks of the licenses it holds. As much as I wish I could recommend it to people, I have to tell people to avoid it like the plague. Then again, that isn't too hard, the game is dead, and although still on sale, I don't think anyone would buy it anyway, unless you're a mad fan who feels the need to play every TMNT game.","September 7, 2015","false","7.9"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","43","61","2","0"

In short bursts though.\n\n3 cons I want to get out of the way first;\n\n-the camera has a mind of its own and at times doesn't zoom far enough out or let you look up and down enough to figure out where to go. It's an extra thing to combat when your already trying to do moves.\n\n-the main story missions feel really short(5 hours to complete) feels like with how complicated the game is it should of been waaay longer and the way the story goes i get the vibe that they started out with great ideas then they became uninterested.\n\n-the combat is a pro and con at the same time. The input lag is really slow and found myself inputting stuff twice to get stuff happening, usually resulting in the turtle doing the same move twice. I get why they did this, which is why it's a pro, the combat feels very good and satisfying, not like a hack n slash where you press a few buttons and your character goes nuts hitting everything around him (I hate those type of games) but more like playing an actual fighting game but in brawler mode, if anyone has ever played tekken 3s arcade brawler mode its kinda similar to that. It just feels really good and the animations are really well done and because of this theres a bit of input lag, and it does get frustrating to master at first.\n\nOK now the good points.\n\nThe rpg leveling elements put alot of AAA titles these days to shame. And it's kind of overwhelming. You won't be going max level with your first play through of the story, not by a long shot. I've only played through once so far and I've gotten all the turtles around 20%. So yeah your going to either be playing arcade mode or playing the story missions alot.\n\nThis isn't actually a bad thing. The levels are actually really fun to play and the enemies keep getting harder and come at you in bigger numbers. I absolutely love that about the old snes games. A couple of boss fights are absolutely epic and I'd love to play them over and over again.\n\nEach turtle has their own personality and fighting animations, and it really shines awesomely in this game. The voice acting as they converse with eachother and as you play them are really great and brings them all out really well. Each of them have their own fighting styles and moves, all completely unique animations from eachother. It's something you really have to experience for yourself to appreciate how well it's been done.\n\nEverything about this game screams AAA. You really get a sense that they worked extremely hard at this game. And then pulled the plug too soon. The game feels really short, disappointingly short. The first boss you beat gets away, and I thought hey, we'll get him later and it'll be even more epic, and then it never happens. I can't help but think of everything it could of been. But everything it is now is still extremely fun to play. It'll be something I go back to for sure.","December 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","17","22","3","4"

I certainly believe RedFly when they say they are TMNT fans, as it's evident in the care they took to make each turtle feel like an individual and contributing member of the group.\nThe classic arcade option allows some couch-coop, which is always a welcome bonus.\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's quite short. Now this game is $15 brand new, and I've seen $60 games offer less content, but it still doesn't feel like that epic turtle adventure that I'd have gladly paid $60 for.\nThere is a rather small assortment of enemies. This can be somewhat overlooked by the length of the game, but even just varying up textures would've made a difference.\nHave I mentioned that it's short? Well, it doesn't quite get around to exploring enough of the adversaries that the turtles encounter in their usual adventures. In fact, we get to fight Karai twice, though to be fair, the first time isn't much of a boss fight. I remember one of the Dev Interviews saying something about planning some Casey Jones DLC at one point, but I'd be less surprised to get a Half-Life 3 confirmation than to hear another positive peep out of RedFly/Activision on this one.\n\nThe Ugly:\nIn many places it is possible to step outside or be forceably moved outside of the normal level boundaries. This didn't occur for me very often, but when it did, it was pretty frustrating.\nThe multiplayer is terribly broken, and by that, I mean that many people are unable to connect to others without means of a third party networking client, and even then only the host gets to keep their save data.\nHere's the worst part. Remember all that energy and excitement that RedFly put into all the interview segments? The same excitement that had me ITCHING to tear into this game, and hopefully eventually chat with some of the devs because you could see that they were getting high on turtle power? Yeah, that all dried up and went the way of the dodo on launch day. We are left with a facebook page that doesn't really do anything but pass along less than helpful information, a less than satisfying page on Activision's website, and no real communication. We have received a patch that, among other things, removed the LAN option(it wasn't working anyway, but this was a bass-ackwards step) and aside from the poor PSN community who only recently got the game at all, we've received no further communication. The ball was severely dropped here, although it's hard to say if we should point fingers at RedFly or just assume Activision is being Activision and if it's not CoD it doesn't matter.\n\nDo I recommend this game? My answer is complicated, because despite how absolutely broken the game is in many of its facets, I still had a good time with it. And while it has DEFINITELY made me skeptical of future RedFly releases, I hope that any TMNT fan can get past the issues with this game and have as much fun as I did. I recommend this game ONLY to fans of the TMNT, and even then, I strongly urge you to prepare yourself by reading the forums if you plan to attempt multiplayer, and reading other reviews. To the rest of you, I could never in good conscience recommend this game.\n","July 2, 2014","false","63.0"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

It doesn't matter if it's a turd with a red bandana, I am bound to like it. With that out of the way, let's get this review trucking.\n\nOut of the Shadows is a freeflow combat beat 'em up loosly adapted from the 2012 Nickelodeon reboot of the series. If you haven't seen that yet, give it a shot. It captures much of the old magic in a more modern and sensible jacket than the 80s cartoon. The game however, wears a different coat. The Turtles all have a more realistic look; they look like genuine mutants. This is probably the most striking feature of the game, because it departs from the appearances we's come be familliar with.\n\nThe gameplay itself though is a bit of a mix between Batman Arkham Asylum and Turtles in Time. You control one Turtle at a time, but you can switch at the touch of a button. You fight your way through hordes of mooks by using wel timed strikes, parries and takedowns, while also switching between your turtles to keep the combo going and the bad guys flying. It can be fast and extremely engaging to challenge yourself to do better and more stylish every time you try a stage. However, the turtles do feel like tanks, and they have the fluidity of cool magma. If you're a fan of the turtles, you can overlook this and get used to it, but if you're impartial to the heroes in a halfshell, you are right in thinking that you're holding a rather clunky game.\n\nFurthermore, the music is dissapointment. Then again, every turtle game since Turtles in Time has had dissapointing music. What's also dissapointing is its design. Certain stages throw obstacles at you that are completely counter intuitive to what you'd expect from the game. The bosses in particular are just a gigantic headache, even if you've mastered the control scheme, they're still a complete mess.\n\nHowever, the presentation is quite impressive. The main menu is an inviting rendition of the turtle lair, and each option takes you to a new place. On top of that, there are plenty of other modes to try when you've completed the short campaign. Especially the arcade mode, which harkens back to the original beat 'em up, is a treat if you're able to stomach the unfair final boss. Just get a friend on the couch, a slice of pizza, and just coop like the old day. Put on some 16-bit soundtrack goodness for the full package and you might you find this game growing on you in spite of its numerous flaws.\n\nThe online option is busted, so if you cannot couch coop, then you might want to consider getting a few friends before buying the game ;).","August 26, 2014","true","178.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I still think the retro Ninja Turtle arcade games are the best overall.   Out of the Shadows may not be the best super hero game out there but still the best recent TMNT game.  It's not cartoony and has good graphics.  The Turtles have a realistic look to them but don't confuse them with the childhood-destroying spawns that Michael Bay produced.  (Thank goodness he didn't make this game!)  This game isn't based on any movies and released before the new movie.  This version of the Turtles is more like the new Nickelodeon version, just more realistic.  The fighting techniques and combos are good and even on solo the other Turtles will fight along with you and they actually help.  You can also select different Turtles anytime you want, you don't have to wait to die to select.  The voice acting is good too and stays faithful to the classic voices.\n\nI'd say my only complaints about this game is the camera views.  You can control the camera with the right joystick (if playing on Xbox controller) but the camera stays so close to the Turtle you're playing it can sometimes get annoying.  Also the camera sometimes likes to hide behind part of the environment like a support beam or pole.  It doesn't make it unplayable but you sometimes have to really be on that right joystick to move it.\n\nPros\nMusic\nFighting\nControls\nGraphics (not cartoony)*\nVoice acting\nAbility to select Turtles at will\nMultiplayer\nTraining dojo in Sewer - This is good in case you forget how to fight and need to remember the controls.\n\nCons\nCamera - isn't terrible but sometimes needs corrected by player.  Also sometimes too close to the Turtle your playing, no way to zoom out.\nChapter 3 boss - The game is very enjoyable up to this point.  This boss fight is challenging.  Don't expect to beat this fight the first time.\n\n*The Ninja Turtles in this game is based on the Nickelodeon cartoon.  They seem to have the same characteristics but more realistic graphics.","January 17, 2015","true","11.7"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

Edited it to be more rounded with better reasoning to my decisions and experience with the game. I want a reader to have a fair understanding of the game before they play/purchase. Hopefully this review can more effectively do that now.\n\nCons:\n\n-The controls for this game are in spite of the player. The camera pans in different directions and, despite some maneuverability, the player really has absolutely no control over 75% of the time. Occasionally looking around is possible in open areas, but it'll easily be redirected in combat, or when you get into areas--like hallways or corners--where it forces you into one specific view point.\n\n-Combat in the game acted more like a mobile app than an intuitive combat experience. Very much a button-mash experience using plain combos of click-click-click-other click.\n\n-Inventory is difficult to shuffle through in combat when you have more than a few items. Two types of shuriken, two bombs, and the specialty weapons all filling the same slot, and only one key in one direction to alternate through, meant I was generally ignoring most of my inventory. Ideally, one could set each turtle with a different item, but if I wanted to toss a bomb in one direction and eat a pizza before going to a specialty weapon (as an example), I'd be bouncing around endlessly.\n\n-In general exploration, I would have often preferred NOT having the other three turtles present throughout the game. I find they often get in the way.  I had many experiences with them blocking doorways or alleys that forced me to switch to a different character in order to move beyond.\n\nAs an example to the presence of the other turtles: There's a point in the game where you're running an obstacle course.  When your brothers fall behind, you'll get a puff from a smoke bomb that has the game replacing them next to you (this was my experience, at least).  When trying to make it through the course, I would continually get smoke bombed and blockaded by another turtle.  In this instance that one or two second stop meant failure, and became frustrating. I found this feature overall difficult and unwanted. I could have easily preferred an option to shut it off. Even when telling the others to "stay here," after a certain range, the game auto-moves them to meet the player.\n\n-Lack of Sandbox option.\n\n-No Jump (What kind of Ninja can't Jump?)\n\n-Glitches in the Game. Certain areas are tied to timers that force a player to wait before advancing based on a predetermined expectation for defeating a set number of enemies. This occurred to me at least two or three times, and in one area I reset the game three times believing it to be a glitch. Turtles will get stuck in the geometry/surroundings a lot, player too.\n\nPros:\n-The Art Direction of the game is fantastic. The turtles are not quite what I'd have hoped them to be from a game being produced through Nickelodeon given the design of the current-set on air. The realistic looks are a sort-of cross between the animated turtles, and the TMNT live-action from 2014. Real-looking, but without the excess junk, and physically similar to that animated ones in body proportions.\n\n-The world is well thought out, a real chunk of New York City. Plenty to look at eye-candy wise, but don't hold your breath because it's no sandbox. Expect invisible barriers all over.\n\nTMNT is a piece of my childhood that I love, and I've played the games as far back as NES/Gameboy.  This one was a real let down in terms of performance.  This could have been a fantastic sandbox, but the inability to even Jump let me know I probably wasn't going to enjoy the game.  From the lackluster combat, poor camera, continual timer delays witholding zone progression, and being stuck within the geometry often, I couldn't continue playing the game.\n\nNo amount of nostalgia could win this for me.  At best, I'd give it 4/10. Time to take it back into the shadows.","August 17, 2014","false","8.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The old TMNT games, you had just basic attack strings that could end in heavy attacks and then a few specials (I actually think they called them Ougi's) but this you have weapon and kick strings, a counter, jump attacks, rising attacks, items, vaulting, and tag mechanics.\n\nCombat system works like Batman Arkham series.  Miss/whiff an attack and you drop your combo meter.  There's also special moves that involve using the R2/RT in conjunction with the R stick.  You can rotate 90° for 1 special bar, 180° for 2 bars, and  360° to use all three.\n\nSo far the game is a blast.","August 29, 2013","true","6.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I have encountered ugly textures, game breaking AI problems (final shredder fight), health packs (pizzas) that I literally could not pick up, and a combat system that almost does well at copying the Arkham series but falls short. OH! To top it off combat can be extremely punishing at times because you cannot block/counter in the middle of a combo but the enemies can still hit you.\n\nThe positives of the game are up next. Dialogue is between the turtles is pretty funny though can get repetitive. Combos when done without being interrupted by attacking enemies look cool. The ability to chain attacks with the other turtles and interact together while fighting is fun as well.\n\nThe only real selling point of this game is local coop and nostalgia, because the game length is extremely short. The total playtime to finish the main campaign (4 LEVELS) is approximately 30-40 minutes per level assuming you do not die, so about 2 hours long. True, there is the arcade mode, and player challenges that rank you on some kind of world leaderboard but the main campaign is short.\n\nOverall I like the spirit of the game and am going to recommend it because the price tag of 15 dollars seems appropriate. However the game will probably still leave a bad taste in the mouths of those that expect a lot from the game. If you pick this game up, play it with a friend because playing this game alone will probably wish you were a Krang, or maybe misery loves company.\n\nupdate: use a controller don't use a keyboard.","January 17","true","13.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadspellera/recommended/228560/","dreadspellera","Baron Samedi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadspellera/","169 products in account","Sorry dudes. I've given this game multiple chances and it seems to only get worse and worse the more I play it.\n\nA lot of it boils down to a lack of polish. Control feedback is sluggish. Granted, it does respond... in fact, it responds to every press, so if you mash buttons like a mad man, the turtle will keep going until it's responded to every button press. Now, if you're privy to pressing the A button (or acrobatics button) over and over again, your turtle's going to be cartwheeling, backflipping and jumping like a maniac for each press of the button. Oddly enough, when you have to actually dodge enemy attacks, it only works when it wants to, which is usually a second or two after you press the button, so you get your head kicked in anyway. Then there's counterattacking, where you usually have a fairly small window to act on or else, you'll get whacked. Now, when you got sluggish response times... let's just say you really have to get used to this, which is ridiculous.\n\nFurthermore, the camera eats. Moving it around requires more fiddling than Operation since it's so bloody sensitive, Revengeance would blush! Now, for a game that requires you to time counterattacks and dodging just right, it doesn't seem to give you a good view of the action. While moving the camera around to get the right angle, it ends up zooming in too close into the action anyway. At least when you're wailing on enemies and you point the left stick or WASD keys towards a nearby enemy, you'll rush towards them and beat them up. This might not have been an issue if there was a lock on feature. This would certainly make boss fights more tolerable since you can actually focus on them, never mind enemy encounters so you can focus on them a bit better than just seeing your turtle smack them around. Maybe zoom the camera out a bit so there's less chance of another enemy sucker punching you and there you go, most of the camera issues solved.\n\nIt's also fairly glitchy - during the Mouser Cerberus fight, for instance, I suddenly teleported like 10 feet into the direction I held the left side. There was also one instance of waiting like two minutes before I could initiate a hacking mini game. Other reviews, both from release and even now, are pointing out more, though however much of it is due to this being a straight console port or not is up in the air. I'll admit that despite these three issues, I had fun at first. Yeah, there were some big issues that cropped up pretty quickly and on the whole, combat doesn't have as much oomph as the Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs, but I could at least chalk that up to being Red Fly Studio's first game - maybe they'll get it right next time??? Plus aside from some texture pop in, it looked good, the music wasn't half bad, the story was serviceable, and the dialogue was occasionally funny with that old TMNT charm. But yeah, there's only so much one can put up with before they lose their patience completely and drop the game in favor of a totally different game - preferably one that actually feels finished.","March 22, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wonder who found this to be a good game? It’s clear that the people who worked on this game were fans of the movies. The theme song is from the original movie, the team attacks are taken from the movies as well, and the team taunt is from the infamous Vanilla Ice scene. There are other references to the comics from the original pose on the rooftops to Don using a gravity gun a la the original micro series issue. There’s some more lore in there, but from all of that it’s clear this wasn’t just some fan candy, but clearly there were some fans of the franchise on the team building the game.\n\nI bring all this up because it’s so odd to see a game where there’s a clear love for the material in the details then the game to just fall flat. I want to talk about the game from the end and kind of work back. If you’re worried about spoilers, let me dispel any worry for you. You need to beat up shredder, and you do, twice.\n\nIn the final fight Shredder’s big upgrade is supposed to be teleporting. This might of seemed like a difficult thing to deal with sure. But because the game had been glitching the entire time so even the lowliest gang member had this ability from the get go. Plus you can too when during certain combos you will shift on screen from one enemy to the next. Oh and let’s not forget one of the other boss battles, Kari who teleports as well. All of these bosses have something else in common as well, there might be some set up, but in the end you need all 4 turtles punching and kicking waiting to land a hit, no pattern no rhyme or reason just keep punching till it’s over. Maybe there was supposed to be something more here, but nothing in the game would lead you to that.\n\nThe combat is clearly inspired by the Batman Arkham games. So look for the indicator to block, go for combos for points, the more you combo and pull special moves the more upgrades you can get. There’s no real difference between the characters until you upgrade them, and even then it’s only slight.\n\nTo try to find some more positive I know some people are put off by the character redesigns but in motion of the game it seems to work and each turtle has their own look and the enemies all are owning their own feel, in looks anyways.\n\nThe sound is a bit of a mixed bag. The music is pretty forgettable, but isn’t holding anything back. The turtles random lines can be fun the first time you hear them, but then they can get caught in a loop where they’re literally be repeated 3 times in a row. Then a random clip can actually cut over a plot point of dialogue, so it’s very possible I missed a good portion of the story.\n\nSo TLDR: Punch Kick, doesn’t matter it’s all in your mind, just mash to victory.\n\nI hope I can dissuade anyone else from picking this up. It’s sad to see it fall flat, but it’s clear it was rushed and under budget.","September 3, 2013","false","5.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Survival is pretty damn hard, gd luck with that, took me a gd few hrs to complete. The arcade isnt so difficult but has to be done in one sitting... taking anywhere between 2 n 3 hrs.

I'm going to get down to the point of what bothers me most about this game instead, it's not a lack of online multiplayer or anything like that, I can get past the new turtle image and some of the constant turtle chatter at times.  It's the control system that really puts this game to a loss for me, the controls are terrible.  I don't know why anyone thinks the controls are good as I've seen some posts say.  So here I go pointing out why I hate the controls.\n\n-For the target market which ranges from the youth of today to the youth of Atari and SNES the controls are far more complicated than they should be.  (Think similarly to Soul Calibur or any other "Fighting" game with a lot of combos & linkages.  For an example there are 8 different counter combos.)\n\n-The controls are clunky and ill designed, particularly with the poor/slow camera control & follow.  Even the D-Pad  and Control Sticks are thrown into combo orders while still requiring direction specific input.  Yet the camera is often so out of place that it gets in the way.  I'll also add that the camera is controlled by the right control stick which is also used for some combos.\n\nThis game would have been far better and in more keeping with the old ninja turtles games if they had gone with a control scheme similar to Prince of Persia Sands of Time rather than those of the sequal or any fighting game.","April 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","0"

I heard a lot of complains about their look. Their look is 1:1 from Teenage Mutant Ninja(!) Turtles.\nI made a few screenshots, maybe you want to take a look and decide yourself if they look the way you feel comfortable with or not.\n\nThe game does not feel really polished but it's far away from bugged or bad. The gameplay is really enjoying, there is also an arcade mode included with additional two hours of gameplay. The campaign itself is about five hours long. Maybe longer if you stuck at the end boss because your ninja skills are too weak :D\n\nIf you finished the campaign and also enjoyed the arcade mode, it's possible to replay every level and continue to build up your fighting and special abilities(gravity gun for example).\n\nAs always it's also a matter how much you have spent for. I got it for around 6€. That's definitly a steal. 15€ are still a damn fair price in my opinion.\n\n...oh....did i mentioned that you are facing famous enemies and there is a coop mode to play via hotseat or internet to make team attacks where you are throwing your turtle buddies into the air and,...

The game can also be played in multiplayer, local and online.\nThe 4-player co-op online multiplayer is currently not working.\nYou take on the role of Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo as they serve up justice to evildoers and their armies of minions. All sorts of TMNT favorites show up Baxter, the Foot, Shredder, April O'Neil, etc.\nThe story missions serve up a mix of third-person brawling with light stealth, platforming and even a hacking minigame thrown in.\nEnemies will swarm you, even with four turtles, you are still going to be outnumbered in most battles. This is potentially exciting because the extra bodies let you attain high combo numbers and pull off more-powerful moves.\nUnfortunately, the camera often jerks around too wildly for you to see what is happening. Special moves yank the camera too close to the action. Depending on what sort of acrobatics you are performing, the camera might spin or zoom on its own, disorienting you in the middle of a longer attack.\nYou might not get into combat at all because enemies are often stuck in the walls. If you do not cross the invisible line that spawns enemies in the first place, you are left to roam an empty environment wondering what went wrong until all you can do is to restart from the last checkpoint.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows could have been a fun but because of all the bugs and glitches you will forget all about that potential.\nMy advice if you are a hardcore TMNT fan buy it after a few updates or wait until the price is reduced.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 5/10\nAtmosphere 6/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","September 14, 2013","true","20.1"," 50 of 99 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","50","99","0","0"

Honestly, TMNT has been going so downhill. thanks to the 2012 series and POSSIBLY the upcoming Michael Bay movie.\n\nLet me say this before I talk the game itself. I've been a TMNT fan since the 1987 series, and I've a fiery passionate hatred for the reboots. Why? For 2003, it's a 4Kids production, so you'd expect that they would butcher it, it should've cater to an old audience rather than children if it was following the dark and gritty comic series. Now... 2012, the intro is a turn-off, and I despise Michaelangelo (One of my all-time favorite characters from the 1987 series), it's so irritating it makes my ears bleed. Aside from the hatred of the reboots, I love the Konami TMNT games, the NES version of the arcade game was my very first game.\n\nNow for the review...\n\nGameplay: From what I played, the controls were just awful, I had no idea was I was doing, and the tutorial was so confusing I didn't understand what I had to do. This was also repetitive, beat 'em ups may be repetitive, but at least in those games you're given a variety of enemies to give you a challenge. Also, why can I only play as Leonardo in the beginning? I want to play as Michaelangelo, for christ's sake! Like how I can play as any of the four turtles in the Konami games.\n\nMotion Blur: This is run in the Unreal Engine, since Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, I've been having a problem with motion blur on my computer, it feels like it gives horrible framerate, and it hurts my eyes as well. At like in Chivalry, you can turn it off, but in this game, you can't! So if you gonna play a game that could potientally be seizure inducing with such a pattern, good luck if you have a history of epilepsy.\n\nMichaelangelo's voice: As I said before, Mike's voice in the 2012 series sound like a irritating kid, and they do it again in this game. Townsend Coleman needs to go back as the role of Michaelangelo so that show and this game would REALLY watchable and playable.\n\nPlease, if you don't want to play a broken, seizure-inducing, repetitive game like this.

I was really looking forward to it, but it's so short and so buggy, I fell out of the map on the first parkour jump I did...If you are going to buy this game on your laptop or computer, I want you to not. This game you are probably looking forward to after you buy it, you will go straight to multiplayer. Sorry to ruin it for you, but the multiplayer does not work and the patch hasn't come out yet. There are no video options for you to mess around with if you have a bad computer. You could either wait for the patches to come out, or you can buy it on the xbox arcade. Where you don't have to worry about any lag or having issues with the dumb multiplayer as it is on the computer version. Either way if you do, the game is so frickin short. 4 chapters and they say it's a long game on reviews. When I played it, I finished the game the same day I bought it. I finished it within merley 2 hours. The camera angles are not good at all. It's so zoomed in I could barely see what I'm doing. Or sometimes when I do a team attack the camera will go all over the place. Outside the map and finally resumes to me when the attack has been finished. I'd rather you wait for all patches to come out and wait for video options. When it does it will be no problem, and they'd better make this game MUCH MUCH longer.

Trust me on that having played/seen alot of the new games which suck this one does not. While playing i cant help but feel like I'm one/all of the turtles with how they should be. Together fight as one, yet each one different as each one has there own stats. Just like in the older, older games. Mike and Leo so far are the most OP because Mike was the only one who could damage the final boss. Leo OP powers i keep a sceret but i can say this. Once you unlock it you unlocked easy mode.\n\nIn the game you get to play as all  four turtles at once by being able to switch between the them. The computer will control will control the other 3. Yet belive it or not the computer isn't completely stupid when controlling them either. I can't ever think of a single time playing the computer "Let" one of the turtles die. Yet at the same time they fight as many bad guys.\n\nWith a split screen two-player mode it's really easy to play with a friend to. Just like Old turtle games. I always recommend playing with a friend because the bosses can be pretty hard. Often all of them having some form of never ending spawn of minons. Unless you replay a few stages to level the turtles. Having a friend play  Yes they have levels but over all they aren't super importent, You should be able to beat the game with only being level 10.\n\n\nIf your a fan of the Turtles then buy the game. For 15$ it's a real good game and if you get it on sale then its all the better.","June 11, 2015","true","13.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It doesn't matter if it's a turd with a red bandana, I am bound to like it. With that out of the way, let's get this review trucking.\n\nOut of the Shadows is a freeflow combat beat 'em up loosly adapted from the 2012 Nickelodeon reboot of the series. If you haven't seen that yet, give it a shot. It captures much of the old magic in a more modern and sensible jacket than the 80s cartoon. The game however, wears a different coat. The Turtles all have a more realistic look; they look like genuine mutants. This is probably the most striking feature of the game, because it departs from the appearances we's come be familliar with.\n\nThe gameplay itself though is a bit of a mix between Batman Arkham Asylum and Turtles in Time. You control one Turtle at a time, but you can switch at the touch of a button. You fight your way through hordes of mooks by using wel timed strikes, parries and takedowns, while also switching between your turtles to keep the combo going and the bad guys flying. It can be fast and extremely engaging to challenge yourself to do better and more stylish every time you try a stage. However, the turtles do feel like tanks, and they have the fluidity of cool magma. If you're a fan of the turtles, you can overlook this and get used to it, but if you're impartial to the heroes in a halfshell, you are right in thinking that you're holding a rather clunky game.\n\nFurthermore, the music is dissapointment. Then again, every turtle game since Turtles in Time has had dissapointing music. What's also dissapointing is its design. Certain stages throw obstacles at you that are completely counter intuitive to what you'd expect from the game. The bosses in particular are just a gigantic headache, even if you've mastered the control scheme, they're still a complete mess.\n\nHowever, the presentation is quite impressive. The main menu is an inviting rendition of the turtle lair, and each option takes you to a new place. On top of that, there are plenty of other modes to try when you've completed the short campaign. Especially the arcade mode, which harkens back to the original beat 'em up, is a treat if you're able to stomach the unfair final boss. Just get a friend on the couch, a slice of pizza, and just coop like the old day. Put on some 16-bit soundtrack goodness for the full package and you might you find this game growing on you in spite of its numerous flaws.\n\nThe online option is busted, so if you cannot couch coop, then you might want to consider getting a few friends before buying the game ;).","May 13, 2014","true","26.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Special attack is mouse wheel scroll for some reason, and counter is 2 buttons. Combat ends up clunky, and fleetingly satisfying. The graphics are okay, but nearly every cutscene is poorly drawn comic-style images. If that's not a sign of a mediocre game, I don't know what is.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled by the Batman Arkham series, and I shouldn't have expected much for $15. But compare this to Deadpool: The Game, and I'll take Deadpool anyday. At least it was entertaining while you were mashing keys.\n\nEDIT: For what it's worth, I didn't play any co-op.

BUt the satisfaction is worth it. The game is not impossible. Co=operation is key.\n\nPLay as any of the iconic turtles on the fly. Not only that, perform incredible team moves, attacks, and knockouts in your quest to beat Shredder! Going across a variety of beatuifully rendered settings, you'll find a new love for the turtles you enjoyed as a kid. RPG elements make the game treat as you level up the turtles to suit your playstyle with a variety of team manuevers, stat boosts, even combos and counters, these can make the game even more spectacular!\n\nAlso, unlock unique weapons for the turtles to use. Leo's Bladestaff, DOnnie Grav Gauntlet, Raph's Iron fist, and a Kusarigama for Mikey. (Should he be playing with something that sharp?)\n\nthese open up unique special attacks, but sadly do not get integrated into combos. The look bad ♥♥♥ though, so...that's something.\n\nThere're also other modes. Take it streets-of-rage style in arcade mode, a nice little side-scrolling beat-em-up minigame. Or, go head to head with the baddies from the areas in the story, from the alleyways and rooftops to the sewers and shredhead's throne room.\n\nNot feeling confident in your skills? Practice in the dojo! Practice makes perfect ninjas, after all.\n\nAn overall rating?...7/10.\n\nCould have been longer, could have made more minigames, and I suppose the boss fights could be a bit easier, but, the fun is in the challenge, right?

Replay value is alright, though unless you're going back through to level up each turtle, all you really have to do is look for concept art collectibles that are generally placed right out in the open. Combat itself is pretty confusing at first, and you probably won't really begin to get it until you're already at the final level.\n\nOr just continually replay the levels to smash Karai's face in. That was my goal!\n\nStory takes place... somewhere in the new Nick cartoon series. Can't tell where, exactly, but Karai and Baxter look identical to their 2012 counterparts. That's as close as this game gets to tying in to any of the series. [The song in the credits makes things even more complicated due to the fact it references the 80's turtles... wut.]\n\nMusic is something they've been hyping up, but it's little more than generic rap beats, which isn't too surprising considering they hired a hip-hop artist to make the music.\n\nGame also supports online co-op, however it seems to be buggy and the brief few minutes I played ended with a scripted event not triggering and leaving the four of us trapped eternally on top of a train car.\n\nOverall, pretty fun.

I remembered hearing about this game on launch and that it was plagued with bugs and to avoid. After watching the series I decided to bite the bullet and try out a TMNT game. I'm glad I did.\n\nThe main focus of the game is it's combat system, which plays like the Arkham Series and Street Fighter had a baby. While at the start you have some pretty basic moves, you earn XP and level up your turtles until you get some pretty awesome moves and abilities. It has the same counter-move system as Arkham does but also has button combos and special abilities that use the stick in circles to activate. You build up your combo meter until you can either do a takedown or throw an enemy. Where this gets really interesting is the other turtles. All 4 of you fight in combat at the same time, and you can do combined takedowns and throws on more powerful enemies and also do team up attacks. You can even call in a team mate to keep up an air juggle another character started, or assist in a dodge or combo. All 4 characters are playable, can be swapped out at any time (even during combat). And there is so much more. For a beat-em up game, the combat system has a crazy amount of depth to it. Fortunately every move has a tutorial in the dojo, as well as freestyles for you to practice your moves.\n\nThe game as a whole is pretty short. It is based upon the 2012 CGI series. The main campaign is around 4 hours long and while there are some minor platforming sections and a hacking minigame, the focus is on the combat system. Outside of the short campaign, you have a challenge mode (which is really just the combat challenge maps from Arkham) and an old style beat-em-up version of the story which has 4 player local co-op. Unfortunately that's it in terms of content, so it's pretty short.\n\nThe graphics are honestly pretty damn good for £12 game. There is some pretty muddy texture work here and there but the turtles themselves and the enemies look great. They went with a more 'realistic' look compared to the show it's based on. The main selling point of the graphics is the fantastic animation of the turtles. All 4 have their own style and animations and when in the thick of combat it all looks pretty awesome. Performance was not an issue at all for me at 1920x1080, but I do play on a pretty powerful laptop. On that note, the graphics settings are very minimal, pretty much just resolution and that's about it.\n\nAdmittedly, I encountered a fair few bugs and glitches during the game, but none of them gamebreaking. A few points of floating in place or teleporting during combat, and even with the camera mod it did wig out once or twice, but that was it. I guess a lot of the jankiness from launch appears to be fixed. Or I was just really lucky. One problem I did have was the game has no objective marker, and in a few of the levels I did get lost and confused as to what I was meant to do next.\n\nI cannot comment on the multiplayer as I have not tried online or split-screen. I will update soon when I drag a friend over to try it out.\n\nOverall, it's a very solid game primarily for it's amazing combat system, which in my opinion blows Arkham's out of the water. When in a big fight with all 4 turtles it is quite the sight to behold. If you are a turtles fan I would highly recommend, and if you're not watch some of the series and see if you like what you see, get this game.","August 9, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have never played it because noone of my friends own it... so i dont really know tbh. But there is a guide to open ports and such to get it working however if you got problems with it.\n\nI really enjoyed this game when i played through it, but its a fact that this game isnt polished at ALL. I encountered so many bugs so i stopped counting them. Also the game is short and the game also gets easier as the game progress because of the upgrade points to your stats you got by playing the game.\n\nAlso there IS options for the graphics... but you have to search up a guide for it, haha. I did it when my PC sucked and it worked great! Wasnt hard at all to do!\n\nI really like the style of the game. The game looks nice, music sounds godlike and the game plays fine when its working. The feeling when you hear this wonderful badass music when punching a purple in slowmotion is fantastic. Absolutely when you hear Mikey yell: "BOOYAAKASHA!!!". Never got tired of that. Never.\n\nThis game is worth for a TMNT fan who have an Xbox controller.

You'll probably see lots of people complaining that the multiplayer doesn't work, and the game is impossible without it. This is a blatant lie. I beat the Cerberus boss on my 3rd attempt, and the final boss on my 20th. Roughly. I took a month long break from the game, came back, beat it first try. I love this game, it is not only the best TMNT game I have ever played, but also one of the best games I've ever played. It's probably up there with Arkham Asylum, since that game was the worst of the franchise. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed that game, and any TMNT fan. A quick side note, I used a user guide to modify the games files and change the keybindings to something I was more comfortable with. Most people will probably get on fine with a controller, but personally, I hate those things. The Survival mode is very fun, even if it is frustrating at times. Having to play the same 4 levels over and over again to level up and unlock all the moves, also frustrating. However the core gameplay, while repetitive, is tons of fun and mostly makes up for that. I love playing the challenges trying to beat my score, and as a person who makes skin mods, I can add further playability to a game I already completely adore. In my screenshots I have some pictures of a Cyber Turtles mod. TL; DR In conclusion, the game has a few walls you may need to get past, especially if you're playing on your own, but it is completely worth it, as the game is tons of fun. Taking advantage of special moves is important to succeed.","March 8","true","70.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

I'm not sure what I expected for a movie tie in. However, there are numerous game breaking bugs, some of which are in boss fights. I just spent 3 attempts on one getting stuck in various nooks and crevices. The combat tries desperately to imitate that of Batman Arkham series but the end result is an unresponsive clunky mess  with senseless rotations of the analogue sticks. Once you slow your heart rate and higher brain functions enough to chime into the control response, you might find yourself having fun.\n\nLack of resolution support also without the use of modifying the ini, and also there are an abundance of extra settings you can apply if you so wished.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/recommended/228560/","Loganesquire","*Logan*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/","59 products in account","This game is a third person action RPG essentially, with a list of negative flaws.\nI have spent over 36 hours playing this game, and after playing everything including ONLINE CO OP (yes it works), I just can't reccommend this game to anyone for the full price.\nTMNT has you controlling all 4 turtles at once through a Story Mode that consists of only 4 stages, as well as some other gamestyles such as Challenge Mode, Arcade Mode, and Survival Mode. The game has Leaderboards for some of the gamestyles.\nI do consider this game an action RPG as it has an experience and ability point system that allows you to increase the stats of the turtles, allowing them to have a larger variety of moves they can do in battle.\nYou control one turtle while the other turtles are A.I. controlled, but you can switch to them at almost anytime.\n\nThe highlights of this game for me was the somewhat fluid battle system which I enjoyed learning and the turtles relationship both in and out of battle. The turtles combine their attacks and specials together during battle, and talk about all kinds of things during the stages.The controls and battle system take some getting used too of course, and i actually have little complaints about that part of the game. They did well with the controls.\nThe ability to switch to any character during the game was a cool idea, and it allows you to use some of the turtles out of battle skills such as Don's increased control device hacking ability.\n\nThe game does have a great look and unique feel to it, but here we run out of good things to say...\n\nThe game has horrible video settings to choose from. On my computer, it only offered me three choices on display resolution and little else useful. There were no texture settings or shadows or anything like that unless you go into the .ini file. The game runs well for me though on a Core 2 Duo 1.87 Ghz with a GeForce GT 430 @ 1280x720.\nExpect a lot of conversation between the Turtles at the worst possible times generally. You can turn voices off though in settings if you want.\nOnline co op is a big highlight here, however it does not work as well as you would hope. Steam invites do not work, but hosting a quick match seems to help. You can only play story mode though. The game seems to have in game voice chat which worked for me.\nThe big issue I have with this game is the price, the bugs, and the amount of gameplay you get here. With only four Story Mode stages I found that to be pathetic, especially compared to the other Turtles games from the past. The maps are a decent lengh, but you'll breeze through them.\nThere are some other game modes I mentioned, but they are played in the same stages as Story Mode with the same enemies. It's just doing the same thing in a slightly different way.\nFinally, there are many bugs I've seen in this game, such as interacting with team attacks when your across the map and kicking at nothing in the air, or using special moves and finding your weapon following you around like a floating object.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=488745809\n\nHow about spawning on the opposite side of a locked room because you were too far away from the other turtles and having to switch to get to the other side? (Not a big deal but shouldn't happen).\nThe camera I found to be REALLY bad. You will constantly need to adjust it as it likes to move around and zoom in and out in the heat of battle causing you view to be obstructed by floating crossbeams above you.\nThe ending was terrible too. Just kill him already, it's been like 20+ years guy.\n\nDon't buy this game for full price like I did. It's not worth it.\n\nI had some fun but I would rather play something else.","July 31, 2015","false","39.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","3"

That's a bit of a tough question to answer. As a gamer, I have a lot of problems with Out of the Shadows. The camera is bad, the combat system is overly complex, the level design ranges from generic to downright confusing, the AI is poor, the difficulty can be really cheap at times...but dang it, as a TMNT fan I can't help but get a kick out of this game. When the combat actually comes together it's just so fun watching the turtles fight and interact with each other, whether they're unleashing team attacks or just bantering with each other. And the game is littered with fanservice ranging from references to the current TV series the game is based on, to a special mode that resembles the old TMNT arcade games of yesteryear, and even usage of music from the original TMNT movie.\n\nTo put it simply, I don't think this game is standard, generic, rushed license crap. There's a lot of heart and effort on display here, so I think the game's biggest flaws come from sloppy and/or misguided design choices. But overall I just can't in good concious recommend OotS unless you're a die-hard TMNT fan, in which case you might find something of value here. Just be sure to wait for a Steam sale before doing so. Everyone else: don't bother.","September 1, 2014","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is great and stays true to the series without any redesign besides the obvious visual changes made to the turtles (which honestly aren't that bad). Certain game mechanics like counter-attacking can be clunky, but is forgivable based on the plethora of old-school style combos (Think original Street Fighters and MK), comedic team attacks, and a rather in-depth upgrade system (Which is completely unexpected for a Turtles game). Aside from upgrading combos, attack abilities, and passive skills, you can also have Donatello construct gadget weapons for each of the turtles, adding another fun dimension to the game.\n\nThis game comes across to me as a mix of old-school fighters, arcade beat-em-ups, and modern batman-esque fighting mechanics and upgrade system.\n\nI haven't personally tried the co-op, though I imagine it will still be fun as I've managed to overcome many of the game's shortcomings as a polished game.\n\nI wish that the game had been completed a little better, but overall it is WAY more than I ever expected to see in a TMNT game and I hope that there are more like it in the future.","October 5, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For martial combat fighting games, this is one of the best.  Pros:  Abilities to execute reversals, blocks, team strikes, finishing moves, and stealth kills make this a must for anyone who is a fan of games like Tenshu, Assassins Creed, Ninja Guidan, Fable, and even some of the more recent Mortal Combat games.  Skill trees that are unique to the indivdual turtle, as well as, some that cross over all turtles like combat stats, defense stats, weapon/kick stats, etc., make for fun customization of your team.  Also, a key in my book is the evade, or tumpling roll, giving the user the ability to quickly get clear of danger.  This is not a button masher and each turtle's martial abilities and timing is different!  While that does in fact work, this game has precise moments when you will want to choose a specific button, or hold a specific button, in the middle of combat to maximize your striking (or blocking) and if you mash, you will have missed the opportunity; very ninja and I applaud the game designers for their precision.  Though not a sandbox game, it does have hidden areas that can be accessed by jumping combos, and this can add to your stealthiness.  Cons:  1.)  Not a sandbox game  2.)  No wall sticking  3.)  Too few levels.  These cons are minor to me and while a sandbox game would be amazing with more stealth elimination, the focus on the fighting engine w/ weapons, kicks, reverses, and everything mentioned before makes this a must own!!  You really feel like you're in the middle of the combat and if you're fast enough, evasive enough, and use teamwork the turtles begin to just lay waste!  If you are a fan of the turtles, this will be the best themed game to date!  Will definitely be looking for a v.2.0 or second game in the lineage.","May 3, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's a bit of a tough question to answer. As a gamer, I have a lot of problems with Out of the Shadows. The camera is bad, the combat system is overly complex, the level design ranges from generic to downright confusing, the AI is poor, the difficulty can be really cheap at times...but dang it, as a TMNT fan I can't help but get a kick out of this game. When the combat actually comes together it's just so fun watching the turtles fight and interact with each other, whether they're unleashing team attacks or just bantering with each other. And the game is littered with fanservice ranging from references to the current TV series the game is based on, to a special mode that resembles the old TMNT arcade games of yesteryear, and even usage of music from the original TMNT movie.\n\nTo put it simply, I don't think this game is standard, generic, rushed license crap. There's a lot of heart and effort on display here, so I think the game's biggest flaws come from sloppy and/or misguided design choices. But overall I just can't in good concious recommend OotS unless you're a die-hard TMNT fan, in which case you might find something of value here. Just be sure to wait for a Steam sale before doing so. Everyone else: don't bother.","September 1, 2014","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is great and stays true to the series without any redesign besides the obvious visual changes made to the turtles (which honestly aren't that bad). Certain game mechanics like counter-attacking can be clunky, but is forgivable based on the plethora of old-school style combos (Think original Street Fighters and MK), comedic team attacks, and a rather in-depth upgrade system (Which is completely unexpected for a Turtles game). Aside from upgrading combos, attack abilities, and passive skills, you can also have Donatello construct gadget weapons for each of the turtles, adding another fun dimension to the game.\n\nThis game comes across to me as a mix of old-school fighters, arcade beat-em-ups, and modern batman-esque fighting mechanics and upgrade system.\n\nI haven't personally tried the co-op, though I imagine it will still be fun as I've managed to overcome many of the game's shortcomings as a polished game.\n\nI wish that the game had been completed a little better, but overall it is WAY more than I ever expected to see in a TMNT game and I hope that there are more like it in the future.","October 5, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bugs have been fixed since this game has been released and is very playable now, but the lack of graphic settings is annoying and might just be enough to keep everyone except Turtle fans away. I'm a huge TMNT fan, and I was reluctant to try the game but it's fun! It's kind of like a 3D version of the old 2D arcade beat'em up. Unfortunatly this game does feel quite cheap though: it runs on DX9 and could use a lot of AA, especially during the comic narration scenes. It feels a bit dated, but you get to bash around bad guys as the Turtles doing cool ninja action moves!","May 5, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though, I would only recommend when it's on sale.  There are a lot of great concepts that seem to have never been fleshed out.  The Multiplayer is a plain bust (as of the writing of this review).  But the single player is solid once you figure out the combat mechanics. For me, it felt a bit clunky in the beginning, but once you start to unlock combos and team attacks it really starts to shine.  The turtles are voiced and characterized well.  I found a lot of humor and fun while playing through the game.  Such a shame the Multiplayer doesn't work as it would add tons of replayability to this game.  Though as for now, I'd only go back in for challenge mode and the arcade style hack n slashing.

For the first hour, you possibly will not like the face design of the turtles compared to the known movies. But after a while, they'll grow on you and look good. The combat is really cool. Love the team work of the turtles. They even have an arcade theme just like the arcades I'd play as a child growing up. The storyline is decent for this theme. The game is SHORT, but long enough you'll have fun. I enjoyed going into the dojo and learning the combos with the team, felt like actual ninja training. Only thing negative, the mulitplayer was down, a lot of drama on the forums about how they bought the game and couldn't play with friends. :/","November 9, 2013","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For martial combat fighting games, this is one of the best.  Pros:  Abilities to execute reversals, blocks, team strikes, finishing moves, and stealth kills make this a must for anyone who is a fan of games like Tenshu, Assassins Creed, Ninja Guidan, Fable, and even some of the more recent Mortal Combat games.  Skill trees that are unique to the indivdual turtle, as well as, some that cross over all turtles like combat stats, defense stats, weapon/kick stats, etc., make for fun customization of your team.  Also, a key in my book is the evade, or tumpling roll, giving the user the ability to quickly get clear of danger.  This is not a button masher and each turtle's martial abilities and timing is different!  While that does in fact work, this game has precise moments when you will want to choose a specific button, or hold a specific button, in the middle of combat to maximize your striking (or blocking) and if you mash, you will have missed the opportunity; very ninja and I applaud the game designers for their precision.  Though not a sandbox game, it does have hidden areas that can be accessed by jumping combos, and this can add to your stealthiness.  Cons:  1.)  Not a sandbox game  2.)  No wall sticking  3.)  Too few levels.  These cons are minor to me and while a sandbox game would be amazing with more stealth elimination, the focus on the fighting engine w/ weapons, kicks, reverses, and everything mentioned before makes this a must own!!  You really feel like you're in the middle of the combat and if you're fast enough, evasive enough, and use teamwork the turtles begin to just lay waste!  If you are a fan of the turtles, this will be the best themed game to date!  Will definitely be looking for a v.2.0 or second game in the lineage.","May 3, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If steam will give me a refund for this game I'd be extremely grateful and would just spend it on a game with online that actually works.","July 30, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the little references make it a blast for fans how know a lot of turtle lore.\n\nBad stuff: The Graphics are not great and the voice acting is mediocre at best. April looks like a half melted Mcdonalds toy, you can tell they didn't spend much time on her.\n\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of the turtles this game will be fun for you, if you aren't it probably won't be.","June 14, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some bugs halt your progress as they disable your movement, forcing you to switch out characters or just reset the level. Combat is very much copy-paste from the Arkham series, but more clunky. You'll get a this input prompts that inform you to use a special attack. The one special attack requires you to hold the right trigger and rotate the right stick clockwise, but can't seem to get that to work. Voice, dialog, sound, its all good. The Unreal Engine looks good and makes the textures and normals stand out. But gosh darn is this game purple as ****.","April 15","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
