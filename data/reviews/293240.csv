No, seriously, that's all, this dude is completely naked. Not much is known about our naked astro-protagonist other than his mission to bring color and life to a dying galaxy randomly sprinkled with lifeless planets. You'll jetpack around in classic arcade fashion pew-pew-pewing all that stand in your way as you rocket between the rocky spheres in an effort to rescue these planets from bleakness.\n\nYour early career as a cosmic space horticulturist will be painstakingly difficult and a bit of a slow start. The game starts you off with the core essentials and not much else, including a basic jetpack for floating between planets, a puny peashooter and just enough seed to get you started with your first plant of each run. The planets start off barren and empty but as you fertilize them with your psychedelic plants become more and more cosmic and groovy. With each anomaly you plant a new wave of enemies approaches and you're faced with defending yourself while managing to plant more in the process. The further you get and the more you plant, the more intense and difficult the enemy waves get forcing you to skip and jump over shots and fight back the small alien creatures dropped by UFOs.\n\nLuckily, filling a planet with enough funky space plants to fill the empty heart at the core means you've accomplished reviving it, and the planet gives back its lifeforce to your missing health as some strange act of gratitude. This lengthens your lifespan giving you a chance to collect the dropped gems from enemies used for buying new equipment or items between plays. The equipment you accumulate through your many playthroughs are what take Cosmochoria from being just a fun arcade romp to a fully addictive and almost roguelike experience with persistent elements that expand on the length of each trip. You'll find permanent upgrades for everything from maximum health, speed of your character, to the amount of starting seeds you bring with you at the beginning and all will help push you on your journey to discovering the secrets of Cosmochorias world.\n\nThe world is chock full of secrets to discover, and given the randomized nature of the game will appear at the least expected of times and runs. These secrets are obviously.. a bit secret so I don't want to spoil them but can come in the form of anything from strange and mysterious turds to ancient space eggs. Their usage is generally as cryptic as the item itself, and usually involves finding another oddball character in the galaxy to bring the item to. The rewards you gain from these strange, cryptic, and secret side quests randomly sprinkled across this colorful cosmos are extremely worth the trip and usually give you permanent upgrades that will carry over and speed up your future endeavors into this trippy realm.\n\nCosmochoria makes me feel like a kid on saturday morning again, the oddly nostalgic twinklings of the opening song evoke a melancholy feeling in me that is both very happy and at the same time a bit sad. The memories of childhoods filled with imagination and creativity seem so close to us in our minds, but are also far in the past and unreachable in our adult lives. Perhaps this is the point of Cosmochoria? To remind us that even though we're adults, the world isn't so bleak, that we can still escape to worlds inside our minds the same way we did as children and forget the troubles of reality and really expand our imagination even during the mind-numbing process of growing older. This is a game without a demographic, for anyone and everyone to enjoy, it's a showcase of the kind of creativity and imagination games can and should have, and the only requirement is that you have a serious passion for fun.\n\nCosmochoria is an incredibly fun and addictive journey into a fantastically colorful world of cosmic entities.Filling each planet and watching them transform is addictive to me in the same way watching your ball in Katamari Damacy fill with the trinkets and relics of the world you roll up around you was. It's very accessible in its arcade-like execution and controls, but retains the high skill ceiling of a roguelike that keeps you pressing on to find what you need to increase your survivability in future plays. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play for a few minutes, or get lost in and obsess over upgrades and collectibles for hours on end. Not only is it just plain damn fun, but it features a stylish world with a unique cast of characters and monsters that I won't ever forget in the same way I never forget the cartoons or picture books that shaped my childhood. Yes, Cosmochoria is that kind of an experience.","September 29, 2014","true","53.6"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","74","83","3","4"

You assume the role of a naked cosmonaut (kinda reminds me of the naked mole rat from Kim Possible) who has found himself stranded in a strange galaxy far from home. You must explore this new galaxy while searching for artifacts, fighting enemies and gardening! As you play you will unravel an interesting story which tells you how and why the galaxy you are in has become the way it is. Your main aim is to travel from planet to planet planting seeds and growing enough plants to 'create an atmosphere' for the planet, doing so not only rewards you with items but also allows you to heal on said planet\n\n+Charming vector illustration art style\n+It's a very open-ended game so you're free to do what you want, if you just want to grow plants on one planet and defend it then you're free to do so for as long as you wish\n+Procedurally generated galaxy, you'll never play the same game twice\n+Lots of different kinds of enemies which are introduced as you get further into the game\n+Lots of weapons, skins and upgrades to unlock as you play through finding unique items or by collecting enough alien poop crystals to buy things in the shop\n+A number of towers to build on your planets\n+Some rather interesting mechanics, such as portals which teleport you across the galaxy\n+Challenging boss fights\n+Great writing and an interesting backstory\n+So much to discover and understand\n+Lots of NPCs to find across the galaxy\n+Very original idea\n+Awesome electronic soundtrack which fits nicely with the game's setting\n+Active and friendly devs\n+Cool, and worringly naked, protagonist\n\n+/-You have to do a fair bit of grinding to get enough poop crystals for upgrades\n+/-You can't save your game, if you want to quit you have to die\n+/-Due to how open ended it is it can be difficult to know what to do at times\n\n-The gameplay is a little too simple for it's own good and often feels repetitive particularly when you restart a game\n-You only get a mini-map by finding it(? I've never really worked out what causes me to get it when I do have it) which is irritating because it's hard to navigate without it\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nCosmochoria is a great action/adventure space game with an awesome art style, procedural generation, lots of unlocks and an original idea. If you're a fan of space games or have some strange desire to become and extraterrestrial botanist I strongly suggest you pick this game up.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 74 of 88 people (84%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","84","74","88","18","9"

You start on a planet and defend it while planting seeds to make an atmosphere appear (which helps with defending from various baddies.) After you feel you have built up the planetoid enough (or at any time for that matter) you can use your jetpack to fly to other planetoids and keep going. The game is procedurally generated with a progressive unlocking system for new abilities and weapons.\n\nEach time you play the game starts out pretty slowly, allowing you to build up your planet and as you explore your solar system the difficulty progresses at a nice pace.

Visual style is kawaii and neat, every planet is colorful and different. During exploring you will be swarmed by many different foes, some of them are annoying, some of them are really bad. Boss fights are nice but ice dragon is overpowered and the green cloud boss is really easy, you can just stand in one place and shoot around until it's defeated. When I was almost done with the game I found some kind of easter egg or boss, still don't know what was that because I was immediately terminated by blue screen of death (in the game). About artifacts - it's hard to find the place to bring the artifact back, for me it's not worth it. I think the solution would be some kind of radar to point where you need to go. There are some weapons to unlock but they are expensive, after 2 hours I was able to buy homing blaster which is worse than laser blaster that costs 15x less. Some upgrades are too expensive and I was not even bothering to buy them. And one more thing, when you accidentaly find the crystal there is 80% opportunity its a monster...","October 18, 2015","true","4.5"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","40","47","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/recommended/293240/","techbane","Techbane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/","875 products in account","It's certainly unique. So the basic mechanics are: jet around in space from planet to planet, planting trees to restore them. Once a planet is restored, it dispenses a random treasure and heals you. While this is going on you will be assaulted RELENTLESSLY by enemy aliens, which gets pretty frustrating. I was having Spore flashbacks for a while. After X time has passed, a massive boss monster will spawn, which necessitates jetting through space while managing your fuel and hopefully hopping between restored planets for healing. This is the phase where you'll usually die horribly and start over -- and if you don't, you plod on until the next boss spawns.\n\nFrom treasure chests you'll either get some gems (for postgame upgrades), bombs, bricks (build largely ineffective towers with), or artifacts. Artifacts can be traded in for mutators accessible from the main menu, such as disallowing towers, more enemies, less enemies, "no eggs" (???) and the like. Most of these are also largely ineffectual, as I've noticed no difference even playing with fewer enemies and lower enemy health. Each time you start a new game the galaxy will be mostly randomized, including planetoids, what types of enemies will appear, and whether or not weapon powerups (which are crucial, as you can't buy weapon upgrades) will actually appear. The RNG swing is kind of ridiculous, I've had games where apparently every chest has contained an artifact, and others where they don't seem to exist. I've repeatedly gotten duplicate artifacts, and sometimes I've been unable to trade a new artifact in for no apparent reason. I somehow collected a pickup from a boss after the game was over despite dying to it, which gave me a white screen and a weird three-minute musical number.\n\nIt's really hard to tell how much of this game is actually functioning as intended, what's glitching out and what's just plain dickish design, and much like Rogue Legacy the necessitation of perishing repeatedly to grind upgrades is starting to rub me the wrong way, but to a certain extent I'm still quite enjoying it anyway. I'm just not sure if it's more fun or frustrating yet.","April 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","35","39","2","4"

Not only do you get to fly around in space NAKED, (which is amazing all on its own), but the tree-planting, planet-revitalizing aspect of the game really adds a unique element to the familiar space-shooter gameplay. The planets add some interesting dimension and strategy to the game; for example, large planets take much longer to revive than teeny tiny planets but also provide much more protection.\n\nThe map is randomized each playthrough as well, which keeps the game from becoming stale or dull. There are things that spawn randomly throughout the universe that you will stumble across, (such as NPCs and other secret things) that offer upgrades or sidequests. I would tell you about them but they are seekrits. (Spoiler! PETS!!)\n\nCosmochoria is challenging, but not punishing. After dying, the crystals you collect from gunning down enemies can be used to buy various upgrades, (from increased health to new weapons, to special abilities) that will help you progress further the next time you play. (And some of the weapons are really really fun!)\n\nBut yes! Expect to die. A lot. You will be swarmed by aliens. You will accidentally fly into the sun. All your hard work will be destroyed by some angry UFO who was, apparently, having a bad day and decided to take it out on you. But know that there is always some crazy new stuff waiting for you upon your inevitable demise, and you will do better next time.\n\nBut the most important thing, I think, is that Cosmochoria is simply fun to play. It's fun to blow up enemies while desperately trying to keep your baby trees alive, and it's satisfying to watch planets come back to life after you've worked so hard to protect them. There's a zen-like quality about the game that somehow comes through despite all the crazy hectic alien killing. (And did I mention that you're NAKED?)\n\n","August 25, 2014","true","172.2"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/293240/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCosmochoria is an action game set in space where you control a naked cosmonaut that wants (and has) to explore the secrets of the universe by planting seeds, floating through space in search of other planets and by killing gigantic bosses. Got your attention ? Good. Let’s read on.\n\nThe gameplay dates back to a time when the action genre was still one of the most popular genres out there. Cosmochoria is thankfully a bit deeper than that, and even though you will still blast tons of enemies there’s more to do than just killing alien life forms.\nBy planting seeds and growing plants you’ll earn additional seeds. These seeds can and have to be used in order to save dying planets. Plant enough of them and the planet will come back to live again. This is shown by a huge heart put in the center of the planet itself. The heart acts like a meter and when it’s filled up you’re done saving that specific planet and it’s time to move on again. The meter will decrease if you have less than full health. That’s because the life of the planet is also used to recharge your own health meter. Anyway, if there’s a warp point on the planet you can use one of those to transport to a different planet and if not then you can use your jetpack to get moving again.\nWhile planting seeds you will be regularly attacked by invading aliens so it’s your job to kill them while growing these seeds into plants. Once you stop planting and you’ve killed all of the remaining enemies they won’t spawn as quickly anymore. Killed enemies will drop crystals that can later be used to buy better gear and upgrades.\nOccasionally a boss will spawn. These are extremely tough, especially at the beginning when you have nothing but your starting equipment, and they take a lot of patience and skill to kill. They’re even harder to hit when you’re out in space so let’s just hope for your sake that you’ve already landed on a planet when the fight begins.\nYour jetpack is part of your default equipment and it can be used to dodge incoming fire (by hopping around) or it can be used to propel yourself into space. Once you’re out of the atmosphere you have to rely on your jetpack for navigation. If you stop using it you will still continue to float into the direction you were moving. The jetpack’s meter will very slowly refill and it’s key to time is as efficiently as possible. There are red zones (I think they are some sort of suns) and if you come in too close you will burn up and die. If you approach a new planet and enter it’s atmosphere you will automatically drop on the ground. Then the whole process repeats itself.\nAfter you die you will lose everything but your crystals and before starting a new game you can use these same crystals to upgrade all kinds of stuff. You can select an upgrade that allows you to take extra seeds with you or to move around faster. And as I already mentioned you can also bring more powerful guns with you and even unlock new outfits.\n\nCosmochoria uses pretty, but simple, 2D vector graphics. The whole game looks sharp and has a nice style of its own. Some enemies could benefit from some extra or more animations but that might eventually be fixed or added in a later version of this Early Access edition.\nThe game uses minimal sound design at the moment of writing this review but the sounds of gunshots, completed planets and your jetpack (among others) sound perfectly fine.\nThe music is catchy and electronic, but it repeats itself a bit too often and could use a little more variety. But again, these might be implemented at a later stage of development.\n\nYou could play this game until the end of time. Unlocking every upgrade could take you tens of hours and since every galaxy is randomly generated nothing is ever completely the same. Completing a ‘perfect’ game will take you weeks, if not more. The game also has integrated Leaderboards so that you can compare your stats with other players and friends.\n\nPlenty of updates are still being planned for this game and it will take at least several months before it’s remotely complete. But what’s there is already very much in a fully working, playable state. And above all, it’s quite fun. It does start off slow, but by slowly collecting a couple of crystals with every game you play you’ll be able to afford an upgrade (or several) in no time. Things really pick up when you have a few upgrades in your possession. Still, a bit of tweaking so that you can afford something earlier would be nice (progression feels a bit too slow at the beginning) and would also be better for the casual gamers out there or those who don’t have the time to play it as much as they’d like.\n\nThe developer is also actually working very close with the community to make this game even better so if you have any suggestions or things that could be improved – anything really - don’t hesitate to post in the forums or to mail the developer himself; he's actively listening. I was surprised to see some of my suggested feedback make it into the game within days of reporting it.\nOverall, I really enjoyed Cosmochoria. So there you have it: a big thumbs up from me.\n\n[Rating: 81/100]","September 29, 2014","true","11.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","3"

I had a rather lengthy discussion with him about various aspects of the game I thought could be improved, and we talked about some of the logic and thought processes behind our opinions. These discussions resulted in an update in the game. Needless to say I now have a huge amount of respect for this developer.\n\nI am still trying out these new updates, but am largely enjoying the changes. Reasons to buy the game:\n\n-You are supporting a great dev\n-It is funny and cute, and those things will come in handy when tackling the difficult enemies present in the game.\n-Gameplay customization. The weapon upgrades allow you to change your gameplay to something that suits you. None of the initially unlocked weapons upgrades are any better than any of the other weapons by straight numbers (I still haven't unlocked two of the weapons) , so play around and see which one serves you the best.\n-It's a bullet storm with a purpose.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/293240/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an Ancient Great Black Wyrm who ate the Earth.  However, a little baby in a rocket-propelled basket, and some other generally forgettable NPCs escaped the calamity!  Somehow, everyone - except the baby - learned how to breathe atmospheres with lower pressure than the Armstrong limit, in order to facilitate the baby's future revenge.\n\nNo, this is not D&D; this is Cosmochoria, a simple and refreshing action-roguelike.  In this game, the goal is to reinvigorate as many worlds with life as you can!  However, enemies - who shoot lasers, for good measure - intend to stop you.  There are also gems that you need to pick up, so that when you inevitably die, you can buy supplies and important upgrades so that the next time takes a little longer to kill you.\n\nWhat Works\nFirst, each planet has its own gravity, which makes the shooter gameplay really interesting, because you have to learn to aim around the planet you're on.  Also, the gravity serves a more important purpose - being anchors for the deep space, Asteroids-esque travel you do through the title.  On a planet, you can move and jump as you'd expect.  In space, however, gravity goes away, and all of a sudden it's up to the supplies in your jetpack to nudge your velocity such that you intercept other planets.\n\nThere's a neat TD mechanic in this game, in the form of the things that bricks can create.  You can fortify a planet with towers of various kinds, which is oh-so-necessary, because every third planet you revive invariably leads to a boss fight, against at least one big, nasty Chinese dragon, who spews projectiles the way you spew...well, never mind.  Moving along.\n\nWhat doesn't work\nThe first parts of the game allow you to progress really fast, but for me after getting the Laser Pistol - an exceptionally useful upgrade - the game slows to a crawl for me, probably because I'm having difficulty beating the Fire Dragon.  It seems that beating bosses unlocks some upgrades, which leads to a slight balance problem between a boss standing between you and an upgrade you need to more easiliy defeat it, instead of the game giving you tools that actually help you defeat the boss.\n\nShould You Buy This Game?\nYes, if on sale.  I'd absolutely say it's worth $4.99.  I think the normal price is high for the game that you're actually getting.","January 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","3"

You do this by putting around on a jetpack, planting seeds as you go, although all kinds of aliens will try to stop you. At first, this game is going to kick your butt so hard, you'll be farting out of your eyes, but each kill, each secret item found, each boss annilated will make you even more powerful for your next playthrough.

This doesn't mean that it isn't fun mind you, though flying into this game blind will confuse the heck out of you for a little while until you get an idea of the general gameplay.  In short, you'll be planting seeds on planets to bring them back to life.  Once that happens, they'll heal you (but drain its heart in the process).  Planting more seeds will refresh the planet's life force so that it can continue to heal you.  At any time, you can travel to other planets via a jetpack and repeat the process.  While this is happening, the game gets progressively harder and throws more enemies at you.  Luckily, you can use the diamonds you pick up to purchase upgrades for your profile (which stays with you from game to game).

The player travels through a galaxy of 50 planets, planting seeds, crafting defence towers and shields, battling bosses and probably saves the galaxy by beating the so-called cataclysm\n- a variety of powerups and perks. In every stint you do you will gain credits which you can invest in powerups and perks before starting another one. Those will permanently boost your abilities and thus make it easier to progress further. Very motivating!\n- neat cartoonish graphics and funny dialogues\n- Over 20 "artifacts" (to be randomly found in chests that pop up as rewards for revived planets) to twist gameplay mechanics in either a positive or a negative way, such as half/double damage, no planet healing, fast planting etc.\n\n\nThe negative aspects:\n\n- rather short, repitive gameplay\n- simple story (galaxy is dying - please help!)\n- lack of content: galaxies are basically the same - not much variation; towers don't have upgrades; boss fights don't require special tactics most of the time\n\n\n\nResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):\n\nWhat a great and cute game cosmochoria is! Saving the galaxy and unlocking perks several times will make you spend hours ingame. If only there was more content, like additional galaxies, upgradable towers and more challenging boss fights!

Permadeath, unlockables that can be used over multiple playthroughs, procedurally generated maps, etc.. However, unlike most rogue-likes, the difficulty comes mostly from personal choice. You can unlock artifacts by finding them in the game and having them identified. Half of the artifacts will decrease the difficulty in some way, like, for example, giving you the ability to instantly plant seeds, which is how you heal planets, or have less monsters on screen. The other half will increase your difficulty, like not allowing turrets, or no healing, which will essentially turn the game into a survival.\n\nThe story is a nice addition, though not necessary to enjoy the game, and completely optional. You can learn about how the world came to an end by randomly generated messages on planets. The main issue I had with it is that there's a lot of nonsense in between the messages themselves, and while it does actually fit in to the story, it makes it a bit confusing to cope.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, you'll find yourself dying a few times at the beginning. The game has an upgrade/unlock system that you can only access when starting a game. There's a decent weapon variety once you have the currency to unlock it, and there's some costumes you can unlock in game for that added variety, all with their unique benefits.\nYou might find that a session, once you get used to the combat and pace of the game, takes a long time. A run from start to finish would take 1-3 hours, which is why the game has a milestone system, which will place you after the defeat of each of the bosses.\n\nAll in all the game is a good bit of fun.

Some be gotten evil has destroyed the galaxy and rid it of life. Your task is to hover over to each planet and plant seeds to restore life on said planets while at the same time fending off invaders and monsters.\n\nThe monsters start of simple and easy to deal with but increase in difficulty and variety as time progresses (Or as your save more planets, im not particularly sure). Every now and then, a boss has a chance of spawning in an attempt to ruin you for good.\n\nThe area you will be playing in is widely blank (It's space lol) save for a few planets here and there, big and small, which you will need to roam around to find, inhabit and restore. While it seems simple, floating in space combined with limitted jetpack fuel actually makes roaming space more lethal than it sounds since you would have to ration your fuel so you are not caught floating in space on an empty backpack towards the edge of the galaxy (Which causes death if that isnt obvious enough)\n\nThere are collectibles and artifacts that you can gather and send to the "Wise one" to be examined (Which is basically a way of cashing in your found items to be used in your next playthrough or identifying what it does). Permanent Stat and character upgrades are also available with currency you collect while playing the game which improves your chance of survival each time you traverse the abyss. There's also artifacts in the game which you can activate to change the base game mode either making it easier (Enemies spawn less/do less damage) or harder (Less Jetpack fuel). Top that off with procedurally generated map layouts to the game and you've got yourself a good replay value game.\n\nOverall, the game is completely worth getting and trying out. For the price tag they put on the game (23RM for me), I would say it is actually a pretty good deal considering how well fleshed out the game is. A discounted price is like taking Bacon and Eggs and adding MORE BACON AND EGGS.\n\nEdit: I seem to have forgotten one other thing. Im fairly certain it's obvious enough but the game has a strong childish and cartoon like art style which some might like or not. Personally it gave it a more innocent and simple atmosphere. The game would look more serious and action oriented if it was painted in another way. Like imagine Risk of Rain's explosion, art and chaos in this game. Pretty sure it'd probably be less about saving planets and more about destroying them. (Would be interesting to see the Magma Worm here :D)","December 17, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't buy this game on sale, pay full price instead because for once forget about money and other things that cause stress in your life and allow this little hooker to bring you one last true feeling of joy and satisfaction before you lock yourself in your car with a hose redirecting the exhaust into the cabin. Weirdly specific? Don't turn around, but I'm standing right behind you.\n\nCosmochoria (I pronounce it out loud a few different ways every time I read it, koz-moke-reeah, kosmo-koreeah, koss-mok-♥♥♥♥♥eah, koz-mo-fuggiteeah) is a wonderfully delightful little game. Most of the game is unexplained and as you play, you discover the quaint fun of jumping, flying, and silly jokes about assgas that you suddenly realize is alarmingly absent from anything you've played lately. You'll lose a huge chunk of time mercilessly extinguishing the lives of an alien horde who were probably just trying to provide for a family they were pressured into raising by social conditioning they never thought to question until it was too late. There's also fun to be found uncovering or learning how everything works and unlocking items that alter the game mechanics. Go ahead though, don't find out on your own, look all the stuff up; you're an iconoclast or at least consider yourself one and really like the nice feeling you reward yourself with believing that to be true.  Why not set yourself up for dissatisfaction? You do it in many other aspects of your life. Weirdly specific? That's because your own desire is the cause of your suffering, as desire is the root cause of all suffering.\n\nAfter carefully considering exactly how far never really taking the advice of others seriously has gotten you in life, should you decide to ignore caution and engage in the ego-driven, hedonistic pleasures in life as I have, and you purchase and play this game, I have one bit of advice: Don't bother tearing your hair our trying to figure out where to buy upgrades, you'll go bald. You have to first play the game and then die in order to access this screen. I spent five hours on my first play without dying and let me tell you I was practically screeching like a banshee after visiting every planet three times without finding a vendor. The loading screen tip I was given was "Buy a new weapon right away. Seriously. What are you waiting for?" My inner monologue became narrated by the Earl of Lemongrab, just a long, high-pitched wail of how unexemplorable (wait, is that it?) this experience was, and it was then that I struggled to recall who it had been narrated by previously. Was it me, I wondered? Why do I talk to myself in my head at all? Weirdly specific? Why do you talk to yourself in your head anyway?\n\nIf you read this, honestly ask yourself what you actually get from reading reviews subjective to another's experiences? The experience of consciousness, you know the feeling of being in driver's seat of your own little meat bag, the same feeling responsible for the illusion of "free will", this experience is entirely subjective. The experience of consciousness seems to universally fool people into thinking they are in charge over the course of events in their lives rather than being  instinctive, highly reactionary creatures, who's decisions are entirely based on that subjective experience; an experience that yields a range of reaction based on cultural programming, brain chemistry, and genetically predisposed personality traits. Maybe it's possible to read a review written by a family member whom you understand very well and can somewhat accurately apply the same context to their phrasing, but a person who has lived a substantially different life from you will apply entirely different context to the same phrasing. In order to effectively transplant an idea from another's mind to yours without erroneously interpreting their true meaning, you must have established a common framework of knowledge and understand without assumption what context they may be applying.\n\nBut hey, you don't buy any of that... do you? You believe in free will. You believe you can alter your circumstances through rational decision making. Somehow, you are unencumbered by the emotional biases built up in others that accumulate over a lifetime. Somehow, you are not impaired by the impressive array of illogical heuristics that rob others of neutral observance, perceiving without judging, and feeling/thinking without attachment. Okay great, do something that betrays a typically conditioned response.  Do something for someone else completely selflessly without the self-driven motivator of being able to feel good about your altruistic behaviour; buy the game at full price rather than wishlisting it and buying it on sale. Oh, and please, start clicking "no" next to "Did you find this review helpful?" when the review is absolutely useless without the missing context found only in another's subjective experience. Maybe then we can actually use the reviews to inform our opinions on whether to purchase, rather than using this space for jokes phrased like ♥♥♥♥♥ greentext posts, with the same unoriginal ending, time and time again, "10/10 would <do slightly quirky thing in game> again".","February 7","true","17.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

It just offers you a nice time wasting for your money.\nThe upgrades help you greatly in progressing further, fe you get yourself some "turrets" that will help you defend yourself against incoming threads, and a stack of them against those bosses that are regualry thrown at you. Defeat your first boss and you'll feel proud :)\n\nFurther I love the astetic.\nCharacter and world are just drawn in a style that appeals the eye and while not being too detailed its just right, its a unique stlye  thats very consistent.\n\n\nSo whats bad about the game?\nThere is little any story, the story has to be discovered by explorations and multiple playthrough, so if you are a completionist you are probably fine, if you want deep all-in dialouges you are clearly wrong here. This is not a story focused game, but yet has some nice secrets to be found.\n\nIn the end... this game is fun, considering how simple most of its mechanics are, but with the simplicity comes the requirement to cleverly manage your resources, establish bases and think about what you are acutally doing in this cute 2D game.\n\nBack to kickstarter: The game fulfilled the kickstarter promises already (at least what i wanted out from it), and is a nicely done with a uniqe astetic.\nA perfect mix of time waster vs. resource management, for (really) all ages.\nI cant think of someone who wouldnt enjoy this game.\nAs it stands, i recommend it, also i heard there is pets now :3\n'nuff said.","September 29, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fehndrix/recommended/293240/","fehndrix","Fehnnis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fehndrix/","620 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is based on a build from back in October of 2014.  Also I should mention that I received this game from indiegamerchick for her #GamesMatter campaign on Twitter.\n\nCosmochoria is a new action-adventure/strategy title with roguelike elements from developer Nate Schmold in which you, as the astronaut Cosmo, must breathe new life into a lifeless galaxy by planting seeds and fending off aliens.  Armed with nothing more than a laser blaster and a jetpack, (seriously, that's it, our little hero is buck naked) your task seems daunting at first, but all doubt washes away once you dive into the game and start shooting aliens and planting trees.\n\nGameplay\nOne of the first few things you'll notice is that Cosmochoria is by-and-large an homage to old-school games like Donkey Kong and Asteroids, complete with high scores and tons of pew-pew goodness.  The gameplay recalls a time when action games were one of the most popular games available.  To its credit, Cosmochoria goes a bit deeper than that.  Movement is done with the WSAD keys, you fire with the left mouse button and use your jetpack with the right button, and the S key brings up the action menu, from which you plant seeds and build structures.  When you start a new game, the first thing you'll see is the upgrade screen, where you can purchase things like bonuses and new equipment, as well as acquire new structures such as defense towers and force fields.  You make these purchases with crystals that are dropped by enemies, and they can come in real handy, as sometimes you will be faced with alien creatures and spaceships coming from all directions.  At some point, a boss creature will appear, with a big, red life bar as long as the screen.  These boss battles can be pretty tough, especially when you're first starting out and upgrades are sparse.  However, it's absolutely worth the struggle, as bosses tend to drop a plethora of crystals.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Cosmochoria has rogue-lite elements.  The game is challenging, but not in a way that's really punishing.  When you die (and you will, a lot), you lose all of your progress, but keep your crystals to spend in the upgrade shop.  Some of the items in the shop include new equipment, extra health, and a mini-map.  The mini-map is a huge help, as it will help you keep track of what planets you have saved.  As you start to plant seeds and allow them to fully grow into trees and other plants, the color will return to the planet.  Your progress here is marked by a heart in the center of the planet.  Once the heart meter fills up, you have saved that planet and can move on to the next one.  As an added perk, saved planets can actually heal you as well, as long as the heart meter isn't empty.  More trees means more life to give.  I couldn't tell if the planet can regress once it's been saved, but I'd imagine that isn't a feature that's being considered as it would equal a ton of micromanaging.\n\nPresentation\nGraphically, Cosmochoria is very cute and colorful.  The game is drawn with a hand-crafted 2D vector style of illustration, and while there isn't a lot of variety to the enemies at this stage, these creatures are at least presented in different color palettes to present a sense of variety, although some of them could also benefit from some added animation.  All in all, the game is very sharp and pretty, if simple.  The sound is excellent even this early in development.  Minimal sound design is employed, but the sounds of gunshots, revived planets, and your jetpack sound just right.  The music is electronic-based, and while it is quite catchy, it could also use more variety.\n\nWrap-Up\nYou could play this game until the cows come home, and far beyond that.  Unlocking every upgrade will take you hours upon hours, and since the world is randomly generated every time you start new, nothing is ever the same with each play.  Completing a "perfect" game will take you weeks, if not much longer.  For the high-score nerds, this game also features integrated leaderboards, so that you can compare your stats with other players as well as your friends.  There are a lot of updates being planned for this game, and it could take several months before it's even remotely complete.  However, what's already available is very much in a playable state.  I haven't really encountered any major bugs.  All in all, this game is pretty fun.  Progression starts out slow, but by slowly farming a few crystals with every playthrough, you'll be able to afford a nice upgrade in no time.  Once you do have a few upgrades under your non-existent belt, things will pick up.  Perhaps a bit of tweaking to make these upgrades more affordable could help, but it's not a huge deal.  Developer Nate Schmold is working very closely with the community to make this game as good as it can possibly be, and he's open to pretty much anything.  Overall, this game is enjoyable even in its current state, and it gets a big thumbs up from me.","February 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are lovely and endearing, the soundtrack is fabulous, and the gameplay rocks.  I'm 15 hours in and have unlocked most of the items you can unlock, and still haven't finished a full run yet (made it to 48 planets :) ) .\n\nI thoroughly recommend this game.  I'm not sure how well it handles on keyboard and mouse, as I played it on an xbox 360 controller, but it looks like it should handle well that way too.","February 18","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those are the adjectives that I would primarily use to describe Cosmochoria. It's lighthearted and one of those roguelikes that chooses to let you learn to play on your own rather than hold your hand - a sentiment that strikes me as particularly ironic considering that the protagonist starts as a spaceman in his underwear.\n\nVery enjoyable, albeit, somewhat short lived and singular in purpose.

There currently is no save system and since the game can take around 2 hours to do everything in, you will have to do it all in one sitting. Even though you have to start over when you die, there is a persistent upgrade system that will slowly make the game easier over time. The base gameplay of going around and saving planets can get fairly repetitive especially when you have to restart from death, but the bosses you fight are refreshing to fight against.\n\nA video showing the gameplay and a bunch of the bosses:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4L7Z3-wazc\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/","February 12, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The base gameplay is like a synthesis of tower defense and a side-scrolling roguelike shooter, and it is complemented nicely by a really compelling setting. And, being a roguelike, the game just begs you to explore it and discover the little mysteries and treasures that are tucked away within it. Because of that, and because of the general depth of the rest of the content, the game feels really fleshed out. When I spoke with the dev, he was also intent on building further upon the existing content, so this game is just going to keep getting better with time.

I love the learn-as-you-go feel. It took me only two short games to figure out the majority of what I needed to do, and then I just had fun with it. The game really drew me in, and I spent over two hours playing it the first time--couldn't stop playing til I'd beaten the first boss and advanced somewhat substantially.\n\nGreat graphics and sound effects. Also, the game runs well on my laptop from 2009 that's just above the minimum specs for this game. Slow to start (around 20 seconds with nothing happening), but I assume that that's probably my machine and/or that this will get fixed, as it's still in early access. The game ran smoothly, even on my 5+ year old laptop, for over two hours straight. No crashes, lagging, etc. even though it's still in early access.\n\nMy main critique at the moment is that even though I was playing with my Xbox 360 controller (fully supported, great controls), the commands on the screen kept telling me to push keyboard S...would be helpful to map controls to avoid confusion.\n\nI'll update this review with more thoughts once I've played the game a bit more.","January 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittutmord/recommended/293240/","tittutmord","Ongo Gablogian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittutmord/","99 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n[Updated Review for new content added]\n\nMy initial impressions of this game were very positive. My current impressions of this game: still positive! This is a stylized, fun game, with very smooth controls, great artstyle, atmospheric music, ambiguous goals (I mean that in a positive way), and just enough addictive quality to keep you playing. The premise of this game is simple; relaxing, even. But what you'll soon fine is that this game can get quite hectic at times, making you go from "ahh" to "AHH!".\n\nThis game is still in development, and with the newest update, you can tell it's further along the lines of "completion" than "development". There are lots of great components to this game, that at first felt a bit disjointed, but as it's getting updated, everything is blending in together nicely. So I'm confident that the finished product will feel as cohesive as the dev intends.\n\nSo what is Cosmochoria? At a glance, you're a naked astronaut, terraforming - gliding from planet to planet, planting seeds and buildings and mapping out a very foreign universe. Baddies show up to stop you and you blast them away with your laser. However, as the game progresses, as you unlock more, you'll find that there's more depth to it than that. You're mapping out a universe. Dodging enemies while terraforming. And there's always the sense of an impending boss fight coming up. You have to balance offense and defensive tactics, depending on the situation. Sometimes enemies show up steadily, sometimes not at all, sometimes 4 pop up with no warning. Balancing that with what to build in that moment (plant or structure) keeps things fresh.\n\nOverall, the game is fun as is, but coming together nicely!\n\nMy only minor gripes with the game, as of now, are that some of the power ups, feel a tad underpowered. And that sometimes getting hit will power down your gun.\n\n[Sugggestions]\n\nThe power down aspect: I still think this is too punishing. Especially if it happens in the midst of a boss fight. I would suggest that the power down is timed to like... 30 seconds or so. This way, you're still punished for being hit, but you can also adapt to it. It makes fights more situational, and not as dire. Like, if I accidentally get powered down twice and a boss shows up, I know that I don't have much of a chance. However, if that happens but it's timed... I know I cna just run and hide for a bit or focus on dodging attacks and play more defensively until I'm back to full strength. It could add another layer to combat.\n\nCompass/Map: I LOVE this very necessary addition. Although I suspect it was here, pre-update, and I just never thought to click the compass in order to open the map. For familiar design sake, maybe the map can benefit from being in the top right corner - only because that's where it is almost every game, and I'm just used to glancing up/right to get my bearings. But this is a very very loose suggestion because I got used to it almost immediately\n\nMapping: This is another loose suggestion. The ability to name planets, or mark certain ones, would be beneficial. That way you can look at the map and get your bearings, or if you have to escape from danger you know to go to planet X because you remember putting turrets down there and such. It could really flesh out the universe map mechanic, and help the player feel like they're contributing more to really discovering/fixing this universe.\n\nSave feature: sometimes games go on longer than I'd like, but I'm really satisfied with my progress and don't want to suicide. On the other hand... that could be defeating the purpose behind the game concept. So take this suggestion lightly too.","February 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","11"

Controls take a bit of getting used to, but before you know it you're rocketing off into parts unknown (or directly into a star, whoops) in hopes of saving the universe!\n\nThe goal is to revive planets across the galaxy by planting, protecting, and nurturing seeds. In return, the revived planets heal you as you stand on them and pop out a chest of goodies when they are first revived. If you are easily frustrated by having to start over and over from scratch (but stronger each time) this might not be your game. It's a game that is meant to have multiple takes - you can activate powerups that you've found in previous runs to keep you alive longer and get further towards your goal. Enemies are relentless jerks, constantly spawning in to ruin your day. With good fortifications, you can hold off wave after wave, but eventually you have to venture out to another rock in hopes that you can get it alive and protected before your naked little butt gets spanked.\n\nIn summary: challenging, charming, and not-too-serious.\n\nAs a side note, this is backed by one of the most dedicated and enthusiastic devs you could possibly ask for. Excellent communication with the backers and community - I mean, you could feel the joy radiating out of every word in the updates - and very quick to address problems and suggestions.

Watch our review here on Steam Punks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLwR_WXMlQ\n\nIt’s refreshing to see a chunk of new indie titles actually come off of Early Access lately. While that section of Steam has become somewhat of a wasteland for perpetually unfinished indie titles, a large amount of them have actually worked their way through to completion in recent months. One that may fly under a lot of radars is a small rogue-like platformer named Cosmochoria. Should you pay the low ticket price to shoot for the stars, or are you better off leaving the jetpack behind?\n\nThe game is focused on rescuing planets by planting seeds and cultivating them while defending yourself from enemies, travelling from world to world with nothing but a ray gun, a jetpack, and your space helmet. The concept is novel at first; healed planets in turn grant you a partially replenished life bar, as well as a piece of treasure that can usually be exchanged for small gameplay modifications from the game’s only real story character, the old bearded alien. The elder also goes on to reveal pieces of the story for this universe upon completing each boss. The game doesn’t really take its own narrative seriously; holograms of some planets’ past residents are spread out to give some strange but humorous lines. The dialogue is typically pretty tongue-in-cheek, even the menu text doesn’t seem to care too much about its own story. With the amount of light-heartedness it’s difficult to take the story seriously at all as it’s slowly revealed to you. The galaxy was apparently destroyed by a great cataclysm, and reinvigorating planets and collecting pieces of a “one stone” is supposed to make it return once more so it may be extinguished.\n\nCosmochoria is setup around rogue-like elements, when players die they can spend collected diamonds on upgrades like weapons, speed boosts, and equipment. The lack of tutorials is refreshing, as it gives you some time and space to discover every design aspect on your own. The game is essentially broken down into lives or runs. At first you’ll feel completely vulnerable to the cosmos with little in the way of defending yourself, but eventually you become strong enough to take on a large chunk of the galaxy at once. Sadly some upgrades fail to make the player actually feel powerful, which is a hugely important aspect in this kind of design. Very few buyable guns feel effective and the upgraded speed just makes maneuvers feel more jerky and hard to control.\n\nUltimately progression feels like a bit of a grind, and as you get further it unfortunately only gets worse. Summoning bosses is done by rescuing a certain number of planets, though their appearance is random after you’ve completed the correct number. This means you could rescue 6 planets waiting for an enemy that should appear after 3. This problem halts the flow of the game immensely. Planting seeds and fertilizing them is probably the least interesting thing to do, and having to do a lot of it for no reason is a real blow to player morale. This all wouldn’t be such an issue if health wasn’t so vital in each run; the AI in this game is overwhelmingly centred upon rushing the player for contact damage. Often times we would die fighting off miscellaneous enemies waiting for the boss to arrive, only to restart the game and recoup our lost planet count. On more than one occasion we experienced game ending crashes due to what seemed to be attaining too high player speed, making purchasing speed boosts and entering portals to be a reluctant affair. Space exploration feels vast and intimidating at first, but this is quickly replaced with a sense of checking off a list once the map is purchased. Bricks can be collected and used to plant tower-defense style objects, though since these can be carried between runs you’ll constantly want to save these for something, and likely forget about them altogether. The colourful but plain art is cute and appealing, but to some it can be jarring in its simplicity. Music is suiting for the ambient spacey tone, although there can be some real ear piercers.\n\nIt’s really too bad that there are so many problems to be found in Cosmochoria. There is something here to be appreciated, as the game captures a legitimate arcade feel and does so well to pay homage to Mario, Asteroids, and Space Invaders. It’s not a title that deserves to be completely skipped over, but it’s clear that this one may need some more time in the soil.\n\nSCORE: 6.5","May 6, 2015","true","14.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sounds crazy, I highly recommend watching the trailer to understand. The game more or less falls in the arcade/action genre but has a unlock/upgrade system and option to play as a twin stick shooter. It is a blast and I'm surprised that an early access game could already be so much fun and 100% playable. Bravo and major kudos to the one dude who made this game.

At first glance, it looks cool, with some fun little mechanics, and an interesting idea behind it, but it's very poorly executed... It's not even close to being a complete game, and is a beta version, at best.\n\nThe entire gameplay mechanic is landing on planets, holding the down key to plant a seed, which takes several seconds (even with upgrades... UGH), while pausing fairly often to shoot completely unchallenging enemies.  Repeat this several times per planet, and you get rewarded with a worthless item that you can carry (only one at a time) that has to be set down to build anything else... there is absolutley no reason you can't do both, it slows the game down even more.  After you plant many seeds, dependent on the planet's size, you "heal" it, and a chest pops up with either resources, or thost stupid do nothing items.\n\nYou can blunder your way around space discovering new worlds, which is awful, because the minimap icon is very difficult to read, so often your course takes you off the map, and into the sun (certain death), and the map doesn't even display planet locations, just your x,y coordinates on a blank map... it's nearly worthless, and is, hands down, the worst map function I've ever seen in a game, which is made worse by the fact that you SORELY need it to navigate featureless open space.  Eventually you'll stumble upon less than a handful of worlds with important characters on them, such as the bearded man, who will tell you what those  awful items you've been lugging around one by one do (most SUCK), and if you're lucky, you'll find some teleporters that will enable you to bounce around between planets you've rescued, although there's literally no reason to ever return to them.\n\nThe game starts off REALLY slow, since your planting speed is ridiculously slow, your defautl weapon atrocious, and your jetpack fuel limited... one of the least fun things I've ever encountered in a video game is having to blast off into space completely blind, then run out of jetpack fuel, and be left drifting aimlessly until it refills itself ever so slowly.\n\nOh ,you collect shards or crystals or whatever from killing enemies, and can use them to pay for outrageously priced upgrades between game sessions, none of which even come close to lowering the monotony of gameplay.  I don't care if I could instantly colonize the planets, instantly find worlds, or hell, even had a minimap that served any function at all... this game still wouldn't be fun, even if you removed all the hinderances to gameplay, because there are no fun aspects to be enjoyed... GD, it REALLY is this bad, and it's a shame the cute graphics and nearly free price caused me to squander hours of my life only to be disappointed.\n\nYeah, so this game has some potential, and is cute-looking, but I doubt it will ever be expanded into anything I would ever recommend to a friend... it's just a hair above what a high school student would make in an into to programming class.\n\nThis is one of the most cruel reviews I've ever written, but I believe it to be fair.  Despite the game being almost free, I wish I had never encountered it, because the few hours I wasted playing it, hoping it would become enjoyable were for naught, and honestly, I'd have much preferred to have cleaned my room instead; at least there would have been a reward for the time wasted.  I'm so turned off by how poorly almost every concept was implemented, it would take a miracle for me to ever look at this game again, even with a massive update.  If this were posted on Newgrounds, you'd play it for 2 minutes, then never, ever try it again.  Frankly, I will never try another game from this team ever again, either.","August 18, 2015","false","5.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","1"

I mostly stand by what I've said. This is a bit more than a flash game, the developer is definitley DEVELOPING the game. The map is lovely, it's nice to see what places have already been settled. Also I'd say this game certainly has more merit as a casual game. Slowly progressing through the improvement system and going through the story, which admittedly I haven't had the patience to do, is likely a rewarding experience. I'd like to elaborate on the VERY SLOW part. RPG elements, and taking a long time to progress because you need upgrades is fine, I just don't prefer those sort of games. My problem with this game is building. Sitting still and planting for a couple seconds is just frusteratingly slow. If we could drop the seeds and watch them auto grow that would be much better. I recognize that may cause planets to get inhabited too quickly, but you could make the gameplay more interesting by growing plants being vulnerable to bullets.\n\nI will keep trying this game as it is updates. I like the how the developer treats his community, and I'd really like to change this reccomendation to a yes.\n\n~Zee","October 13, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","3"

Completely out of fit from the rest of the game, essentially mucking it up, and giving us no way to turn it off.\n\nSo due to that, I'm going to have to stop recommending this once good game due to the idiocy of adding something which has NOTHING to do with any aspect of the game.

You spend a LOT of time doing the same thing. And when you die you go back to square one, which is great, but then it takes a lot of grinding to get back to where you were and the upgrades come very slowly at first.

You are just one tiny little guy in the galaxy on your own saving each planet one at at time. All the while, aliens and dragons spawn and try to ruin your day. Go along and plant tree all over the place restoring the natural order only armed with a single gun.\n\nBut don't let the gun throw you off, its far from an action game. This is probably more along the lines of casual with mild pressure.  I think it is meant to be challenge and impossible to do on your first time playing. You will have to sink a few hours into it before you make it really far, but believe me, you won't regret it.\n\nIt's got subtle jokes to lighten the mood and the art is cartoony and playful. The achievements are written in lymerick which is another bonus that has a sinister taste of challenging the riddle solving for the regular achievement hunter. But don't worry, they are TOO hard if you are looking for them.\n\nThe physics for the planets and space are nice and subtle but make a lot of sense; you have to escape the gravity of the planet and using the jetpack causes exponential accerlation. (I don't know why but I really like that part... it's cool)\n\nOo! and the best part is the upgrades! the more and more you play and longer you survive, the more upgrades you can afford and rewards you can collect. Buy new guns, upgrade your suit and add perks to your character all with a currency you collect from beating the ever-loving crap out of your enemies.\n\nLine you score up against fellow players and discover the mysterious bearded owner of the 8-ball in Cosmochoria.

I am currently at 15 hours and have completed it sorta...i won't spoil why i say sorta.  There is easily another 20+ hours of trying to collect all the different unlockables.  The game is great fun.  The graphics are simple and yet very appealing and cohesive.  The object of the game.  You start out in a universe of 50 planets.  You start on one planet and your object is to bring the planey back to life by planting and growing plants.  You have a jet pack, so you can jet around and even leave the current planet and go to another planet.  You are free to go where you want in the universe.  If you try and leave the universe you will burn up.  Also, you only have so much jetpack juice so try and conserve it while out in space and not on a planet or you could be heading towards the areas where you burn up with no way out.  There are also monsters to avoid.  while you are planting and roaming the universe, there are bad guys trying to hurt you.  You need to kill them first. They will come when you are planting or building.  Yes building, there are buildings that do specific things.  Kinda like a tower defense on different planets.  You have to collect relics in order to build so you can't just go and build everything or you won't have anything left to build.  Also you can only fit so much on a given planet (planets come in different sizes) so build wisely.  Once you have planted enough trees the planet will be renewed and form an atmosphere.  There are also bosses.  The bosses are not too varied.  I think the first three bosses are basically the same thing but they shoot different types of bullets.  Still fun and challenging.  There are lots of upgrades you can purchase.  More recently with the upgrades, the game is pretty easy for the most part.  That is ok because the final boss is very difficult.\n\nOverall the game is a lot of fun and very addicting.  I highly recommend playing it.","April 28, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why, yes, it is.\n\nIt almost seems like the innovative execution and simple premise of this game would make it a one-time indie game, easily tossed aside when mastered. The trouble is... This game isn't easy to master. At every turn, it is designed to throw a curve ball your way. As of writing this, I've sunk almost five hours into it and not gotten bored at all. There are many things to unlock, many things to explore, and many tasks to complete. I would be willing to bet I could sink another ten hours into it, easily. For a game I spent $3 on during a steam sale? I'll take it. Hell, I'll throw my money at it.\n\nI'll summarize with this: is Cosmochoria going to win the 'OMG BEST GAME EVER!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/recommended/293240/","foxamemnon","Jetpack John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/","487 products in account","[Edit: Added a little more below about the weapons]\n\nThis is a good game, a very good game.  It's also hard to describe exactly what *type* of game Cosmochoria is.  I hesitate to call it a platformer or a shooter, though both of those are well represented in its design.  I suppose the best thing to do is watch some gameplay videos and see if it's to your liking.  Personally, I've found it strangely addictive.  It has a very charming and very colorful art style, and the background music is quite nice, as well.\n\nThe author means it when he says that it is a game of exploration because that includes many of the mechanics as well.  There are ample hints dropped in-game, like what to do with the strange objects you sometimes find, so do pay attention.  One object in the game, the Moai statue, took me until just recently to learn just what it does, and that is only because the game now hints/tells you.  I bought Cosmochoria some time ago on Humble Bundle and the earlier builds gave no clue (that I could find) as to its purpose.  Now that I know what it does, it is *very* useful.\n\nOne adjective that goes a long way towards explaining this game is "strange".  The concept, the enemies, the dialogue... all very strange.  But in a good way.  Apparently, there was some drama recently concerning the introduction of a Pewdiepie enemy sprite into the game.  I guess some people felt it didn't belong or it broke the immersion.  Really?  There are plenty of bizarre enemies and nods to other games (Purple Tentacle, anyone?), and *that* is what some people choose to complain about?\n\nThe game's difficulty progression is, on the whole, fairly balanced.  The action certainly gets more hectic as you progress, and larger planets have more room which generally means more enemies, too.  Fighting a boss on a large planet can make the battle a lot harder than it might otherwise be as your attention will be divided amongst numerous enemies.\n\nThe artifacts that you can unlock during gameplay are pretty neat, as well, because they aren't all good.  Some will give you advantages to make the game easier while others won't.  This is a good mechanic since it means that, later on, you have the option of increasing the difficulty of the game (in some cases, significantly) if you like.\n\nThe only major fault I have with the game is actually the weapons.  You start with a wimpy pea shooter, so upgrading your gun ASAP is all but required.  In my game, all of the guns, except for the final two which are still locked, cost 1500.  Now, so far, each gun *has* been very different from the others.  The problem is that, with the exception of the second gun, the blaster, the remaining weapons make the game much more difficult.  They might not be automatic, which means *lots* of clicking, or they might be amazingly weak until leveled up a few times.  So far, each time I buy a new weapon, I always end up switching back to the blaster rather quickly.\n\nEdit (Oct. 19): I've now tried all of guns except for the two that are locked, and I think I can lessen my criticism a little.  The shotgun is actually usable.  It doesn't fire nearly as rapidly as the blaster, but it has a very wide spread and decent power.  I also forgot to mention the sniper gun.  I'm not sure how long I could remain alive while using it, but it is extremely powerful.  The downside, however, is a very slow refire rate and no spread.  Bullet spread is actually rather important because the surface of planets curves, in general, away from your player meaning that hitting enemies on the surface can often be difficult.  One solution is to jump up to give yourself a better line of sight, but if you're using a gun with slow reload, you'd better have a good aim.  For guns that spray out lots of bullets, like the blaster, hitting surface enemies is a lot easier.\n\nOne other issue could be, I suppose, the difficulty of the boss enemies.  The first few dragon-like bosses come across as extremely difficult, especially as you encounter them at the beginning of the game.  Expect to die... probably a few times.  That said, it's not *that* bad.  You're going to die plenty of times anyway, and each time you can spend your accumulated crystals for better stats and weapons.\n\nAnyhow, get this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/recommended/293240/","foxamemnon","Jetpack John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/","487 products in account","[Edit: Added a little more below about the weapons]\n\nThis is a good game, a very good game.  It's also hard to describe exactly what *type* of game Cosmochoria is.  I hesitate to call it a platformer or a shooter, though both of those are well represented in its design.  I suppose the best thing to do is watch some gameplay videos and see if it's to your liking.  Personally, I've found it strangely addictive.  It has a very charming and very colorful art style, and the background music is quite nice, as well.\n\nThe author means it when he says that it is a game of exploration because that includes many of the mechanics as well.  There are ample hints dropped in-game, like what to do with the strange objects you sometimes find, so do pay attention.  One object in the game, the Moai statue, took me until just recently to learn just what it does, and that is only because the game now hints/tells you.  I bought Cosmochoria some time ago on Humble Bundle and the earlier builds gave no clue (that I could find) as to its purpose.  Now that I know what it does, it is *very* useful.\n\nOne adjective that goes a long way towards explaining this game is "strange".  The concept, the enemies, the dialogue... all very strange.  But in a good way.  Apparently, there was some drama recently concerning the introduction of a Pewdiepie enemy sprite into the game.  I guess some people felt it didn't belong or it broke the immersion.  Really?  There are plenty of bizarre enemies and nods to other games (Purple Tentacle, anyone?), and *that* is what some people choose to complain about?\n\nThe game's difficulty progression is, on the whole, fairly balanced.  The action certainly gets more hectic as you progress, and larger planets have more room which generally means more enemies, too.  Fighting a boss on a large planet can make the battle a lot harder than it might otherwise be as your attention will be divided amongst numerous enemies.\n\nThe artifacts that you can unlock during gameplay are pretty neat, as well, because they aren't all good.  Some will give you advantages to make the game easier while others won't.  This is a good mechanic since it means that, later on, you have the option of increasing the difficulty of the game (in some cases, significantly) if you like.\n\nThe only major fault I have with the game is actually the weapons.  You start with a wimpy pea shooter, so upgrading your gun ASAP is all but required.  In my game, all of the guns, except for the final two which are still locked, cost 1500.  Now, so far, each gun *has* been very different from the others.  The problem is that, with the exception of the second gun, the blaster, the remaining weapons make the game much more difficult.  They might not be automatic, which means *lots* of clicking, or they might be amazingly weak until leveled up a few times.  So far, each time I buy a new weapon, I always end up switching back to the blaster rather quickly.\n\nEdit (Oct. 19): I've now tried all of guns except for the two that are locked, and I think I can lessen my criticism a little.  The shotgun is actually usable.  It doesn't fire nearly as rapidly as the blaster, but it has a very wide spread and decent power.  I also forgot to mention the sniper gun.  I'm not sure how long I could remain alive while using it, but it is extremely powerful.  The downside, however, is a very slow refire rate and no spread.  Bullet spread is actually rather important because the surface of planets curves, in general, away from your player meaning that hitting enemies on the surface can often be difficult.  One solution is to jump up to give yourself a better line of sight, but if you're using a gun with slow reload, you'd better have a good aim.  For guns that spray out lots of bullets, like the blaster, hitting surface enemies is a lot easier.\n\nOne other issue could be, I suppose, the difficulty of the boss enemies.  The first few dragon-like bosses come across as extremely difficult, especially as you encounter them at the beginning of the game.  Expect to die... probably a few times.  That said, it's not *that* bad.  You're going to die plenty of times anyway, and each time you can spend your accumulated crystals for better stats and weapons.\n\nAnyhow, get this game.  It's a lot of fun and I think you'll find yourself spending a lot more time playing it than you might plan on.","October 18, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

There are plenty of bizarre enemies and nods to other games (Purple Tentacle, anyone?), and *that* is what some people choose to complain about?\n\nThe game's difficulty progression is, on the whole, fairly balanced.  The action certainly gets more hectic as you progress, and larger planets have more room which generally means more enemies, too.  Fighting a boss on a large planet can make the battle a lot harder than it might otherwise be as your attention will be divided amongst numerous enemies.\n\nThe artifacts that you can unlock during gameplay are pretty neat, as well, because they aren't all good.  Some will give you advantages to make the game easier while others won't.  This is a good mechanic since it means that, later on, you have the option of increasing the difficulty of the game (in some cases, significantly) if you like.\n\nThe only major fault I have with the game is actually the weapons.  You start with a wimpy pea shooter, so upgrading your gun ASAP is all but required.  In my game, all of the guns, except for the final two which are still locked, cost 1500.  Now, so far, each gun *has* been very different from the others.  The problem is that, with the exception of the second gun, the blaster, the remaining weapons make the game much more difficult.  They might not be automatic, which means *lots* of clicking, or they might be amazingly weak until leveled up a few times.  So far, each time I buy a new weapon, I always end up switching back to the blaster rather quickly.\n\nEdit (Oct. 19): I've now tried all of guns except for the two that are locked, and I think I can lessen my criticism a little.  The shotgun is actually usable.  It doesn't fire nearly as rapidly as the blaster, but it has a very wide spread and decent power.  I also forgot to mention the sniper gun.  I'm not sure how long I could remain alive while using it, but it is extremely powerful.  The downside, however, is a very slow refire rate and no spread.  Bullet spread is actually rather important because the surface of planets curves, in general, away from your player meaning that hitting enemies on the surface can often be difficult.  One solution is to jump up to give yourself a better line of sight, but if you're using a gun with slow reload, you'd better have a good aim.  For guns that spray out lots of bullets, like the blaster, hitting surface enemies is a lot easier.\n\nOne other issue could be, I suppose, the difficulty of the boss enemies.  The first few dragon-like bosses come across as extremely difficult, especially as you encounter them at the beginning of the game.  Expect to die... probably a few times.  That said, it's not *that* bad.  You're going to die plenty of times anyway, and each time you can spend your accumulated crystals for better stats and weapons.\n\nAnyhow, get this game.  It's a lot of fun and I think you'll find yourself spending a lot more time playing it than you might plan on.","October 18, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

As you try to revive these planets aliens will attack and shoot at you, and the each time you kill a boss you will get new harder enemies. Each time you kill an enemy you get currency called cyrstals, you can buy permanent upgrades after each game with cystals to help you to progress further.\n\nPros Fun\nNice upgrading system\nEasy to learn\nYou can play for hours\nRewarding\nNice concept\nLooks nice\n\nCons You get items and it gives you no description at all\nCan be very repetitive\n\nFinal Thoughts All in all this is a very fun and addicting game with a unique health system and an interesting twist to rogue-like games. 10/10 its definitely worth the money.","August 12, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However developers, _please_ make the keyboard configurable. As it is, the game is only truly accessible (playable) by mainly right-handed players, or left-handers with some difficulty. Either way, it requires that one have full hand and finger mobility, and since i have a disabilty of my hands it will be impossible to play beyond the easiest tasks. A game of this type can be easily made playable by more (most) people if the keys can be self-configured - all i need for instance is to change the 'S action' button to right-ctrl or even numpad 0, and jump to right-shift, or perhaps /.\n\ni will anxiously and hopefully await an upgrade to allow key configurations, and after that it just may be one of my favorite games! Until then, i can't fully play or recommend it.\n\nThank you! Keep up the great work!!","August 11, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Once you figure out how to play and what you are doing, things get easier.  It is still very repetitive.  Having said all of that, it is still enjoyable.\n\nMy advice to new players:\n\n-- You will die a lot.  Buy your upgrades at the start screen between deaths.\n-- As soon as you can, buy the map.  It is invaluable since this game does not have and auto-mapping feature.\n-- Once you have the map, use it to aim when travelling between planets.  That way you are not floating aimlessly between planets.  It will cut down on your travel time and give you more time for collecting resources.\n-- Use the Easter Island monoliths.  After you build up 20+ seeds, build one on each planet as you start to tarraform it.  It helps a lot with the creeps that constantly spawn.\n-- When you find the portals, use them in boss fights.  They are especially usefull against the space dragons.  It will let you instantly get way from them.  When they find you again, shoot them as much as you can, then portal away again.\n-- While you are using the portals, build pyramids on your portal planets to reinforce them.","February 25","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is very bright, colorful and generally happy. (When you're not in the depths of outer space, that is.) Every planet is unique, with its own size, background objects, and possibly water or lava. Each time you play the game you get a randomly generated map, so you’re always exploring new space. The problem is, you’re exploring new SPACE. All of outer space looks just about the same, so unless you have planets evenly spaced, it can get boring. Also, there are some NPCs who, when you talk to them, activate a conversation loop that you can only escape by pausing and killing yourself. The two bosses I managed to fight (before conversation loops) were the exact same; one was big and red, the other small and blue, both of them fire-breathing worms. Another glitch I found while playing is that occasionally, the map won’t show where your planets are, which made navigation a pain. Unfortunately, until there are some updates and bug fixes, this game isn’t worth the ten dollars.","February 7","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
