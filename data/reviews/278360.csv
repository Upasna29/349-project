"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForklifterMatt/recommended/278360/","ForklifterMatt","ForklifterMatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForklifterMatt/","360 products in account","A Story About My Uncle is a narrative focused, first person platforming adventure developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios. The game has great sound and music design, surreal environments, jaw-dropping visuals, and much, much more.\n\nThe story not only puts emphasis on the main plot and characters, but also on the side plot and side characters. You play as a dad telling his daughter a story about how his uncle, Fred, goes missing and how the dad goes after him. The father comes across his uncles' invention, a suit which has a grappling hook and lets you take no fall damage, to help the dad find his uncle. On your journey you will traverse through a multitude of different environments, while meeting numerous side characters that will help you on your way. The narrative is the soul of the game, but it's done in a simple and subtle manner that you, the player, have to explore and ultimately piece it all together.\n\nThe game focuses on movement, speed, freedom, and light puzzle solving instead of violence. Movement is the core element of the game. With the help of your grappling hook, you feel so free and fast; flying without restrictions and at uncontrollable speeds. It feels so genuine and fluid that it immerses you into this unique world. WASD moves your character, shift to sprint, LMB to use your grappling hook, Space to jump, hold RMB to power jump, and Shift and hold RMB for powerleap. Almost every new platform is a checkpoint where it gives you a certain amount of charges for your grappling hook. And then you have to use your charges and your skills wisely to get to the next checkpoint. Also, Later in the game you get rocket boots to help you through the harder parts of the game.\n\nLike I said before, the graphics are very stunning. ASAMU runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and by god this game looks fantastic. It has gorgeous lighting effects, great world design, phenomenal texture work, and a fantastic attention to detail. Also the art style is very vibrant and dark at the same time; using greens, blues, and browns to convey the mood of the game. Sadly, character models are pretty outdated.\n\nThe sound and music design is absolutely brilliant. The sound is very immersive and completely engages the player into the game itself. The "Whoosh" that you hear when you soar through the massive levels is incredible and gives the player a huge adrenaline rush. The game exhibits an emotional, heart-felt, and melancholy symphonic, fantasy soundtrack. Voice acting is somewhat good and somewhat bad. The protagonist, the daughter, and the town elder are voiced well, while everyone else is poorly voiced.\n\nAdditional Notes: This game has an FOV slider that can be adjusted from 60-120 FOV. There are 15 Steam achievements and the game is about 5-7 hrs. (depending on playstyle) and has a time trial mode. The game also features gorgeous water effects, best looking vegetation I've ever seen, beautiful architecture/ cityscapes, and stunning rock designs and textures. The devs are SO nice and are on the forums to answer questions and complaints!\n\nFinal Thoughts: A Story About My Uncle is Gone North Games' very first game and it is a masterpiece with phenomenal sound, music, atmosphere, immersion, graphics, gameplay, and a gorgeous world to explore. However, the game does suffer from character models that are not up-to-date, ok voice acting, and a poorly translated script. Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive first person adventure with an unique world and tale to tell. And is most definitely worth $12.99.\n\n*Review copy was provided by Gone North Games; Thank you very much!*","May 26, 2014","true","7.4"," 208 of 224 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","208","224","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sphing/recommended/278360/","Sphing","Sphing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sphing/","477 products in account","About 	First off, a general point. This is a first person adventure platformer with an amazing storyline that fits along perfectly with the environment and overall atmosphere. The amazing parkour present will give you a rush that never ceases to excite. Not to mention the astonishing scenery- it's on par with Bioshock Infinite. The hidden puzzles are awesome, and it is always a thrill to find them.\n\nGathering gadgets and tools to get around a lot easier and have a blast doing it! Meet new creatures in a new world and discover the amazing secrets they hold, and find out the truth about your uncle.\n\nPros & Cons ++ Pros\n+ Great Graphics\n+ Easy to control\n+ Controller support\n+ Puzzles are fair\n+ Amazing ideas for character models\n+ Outstanding story line\n\n-- Cons\n- Character's have sketchy movements ( sometimes )\n- Relatively short for the price  (2 hour example)\n- Too dark in certain places\n- Cost of game ( $12.99 )\n- No Co-op\n\nSummary  -Spoiler Warning-\nV\nV\n\nYou play as a person looking for "The Uncle" that has been gone for a long time. While you search for him, you discover that he has been studying things- things impossible in this world. Not only that, but you later find that he has a way into this mystical world. The Uncle has been studying this world for a long time, as is shown through the large collection of notebooks with extensive drawings on the creatures of this world, along with strange markings in the pages. Through his discoveries, you are able to take the passage into this world to try and track him down. While you search, you find clues and leftover inventions that he could not carry with him on his journey. These inventions are normally just fun new ways of getting from A to B. After a while, you discover a village filled with some kind of frog people, who praise The Uncle, and are very kind to you. They assist you in your quest to the best of their amphibious abilities. You traverse many obstacles and solve numerous puzzles to try and figure out where The Uncle might be, but you soon learn that nobody- not even the frog people- know where he is. After continuing your grueling search, you finally find him, and receive an explanation about why he left your world for this one, and why the frog people praise him- He was not simply a traveler that they deemed praiseworthy, he was in fact their creator, and even the creator of the entire world. After this explanation, you try to get The Uncle to come home with you- however, he decides to stay with his creations, instead of returning to his home. On this somber note, you leave him to his life, and return back to your home to tell of what transpired.\n\nPersonal opinion\nI.	Love. This. Game. I have already beaten it once in under 2 and a half hours, but I plan to go back and play it again, both for secrets I missed, and foreshadowing I might not have noticed my first time around. This game gripped me like a vice with its captivating visuals and wonderful story- I really want to see more games with this much creativity. This game has a lot of charm to it, a good bit of peace, and a *shocking* lack of any rage for a first person platformer- it's very fair and lenient compared to others of its genre. It's an overall tranquil experience, but it is not without suspense for what will happen next. If you are a person who enjoys richly atmospheric games over intense action, this is the perfect fit for you. My main gripe with this game is the price: $12.99 USD for a very short game is a bit steep. While the gameplay is fun and the story is rich, the experience was similar to eating a delicious slice of pie (or cake, but as we all know, the cake is farcical)- it is great while it lasts, but at the end, you feel like there was a lot more than what you were given, and you ache to have just a bit more. I hope my opinion has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this game. Final recommendation: If you are a story and parkour fan, pick it up whenever, but for others, wait until it goes on sale. When it goes on sale you have no excuse not to buy it. No excuse. None. I hope I helped you all on your decision about getting this game. I 100% recommend this game!\n\n9.5/10  Proofread by Frey Cloudseer\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","September 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 164 of 184 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","164","184","9","10"

So keep my warnings of "difficulty" in perspective.  If you're decent at 3D platformers, you'll be fine.  I don't want to scare anybody away from a great game.  Anyway, on with the review.]\n\nIt's possible this was the most difficult game I've ever completed-- with more deaths than I care to contemplate. Of my listed 18.4 hours, I'm sure there was some idling there-- but not more than a few hours.  I also like to explore, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and take things slowly.  I never claim to be super-skilled at 3D-platformers, but this really stretched my abilities.  It was easier for me once I switched from a controller to keyboard+mouse, but I'm not much of a console/controller person.  Thank God the devs toned down a notoriously difficult section; I'm not sure I would have made it.  But the important part is that I persevered because I loved the game:  it had charm, a good story, superb graphics, and usually fun gameplay when I wasn't on the verge of a rage-quit.  ;-)  There's really nothing like flying through the air like Spiderman with a jetpack.  You really have to try it.\n\nSome folks probably won't find it overly challenging and kudos to you-- but don't be surprised if it takes some real work and repetition-- I'm not sure why this game is put in the "Casual" genre.  Some of the difficulty can be alleviated at times by finding an optimal/alternate solution.  So if you find yourself stuck, look for an alternative approach instead of assuming the game is broken, unfair, or just poorly designed.  It's not-- it's probably you.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap achievements-- look elsewhere.  They are all actual *achievements* in the true sense of the word-- and I earned none of them...and that's okay with me.  I'll let the whizzes take on those challenges.\n\nOther than the occasional clipping issue, I only encountered one bug (which actually made one section of the game slightly easier as it turns out).  So all-in-all an excellent effort from Gone North Games-- let's support them and hope they make more!","February 9, 2015","true","18.4"," 106 of 114 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","106","114","2","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/278360/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","For as much as I hated the prospect of having to sleep as a child, the allure of a bedtime story almost completely put the displeasure of ending a day out of my mind, replaced with a rapid interest in what adventure I would hear about that night, which regardless of how flimsy the tale may be always held a sort of fantastical quality to it. A Story About My Uncle is itself a bedtime story, albeit one not constrained to mere words but created in vibrant detail allowing you to explore it for yourself while still retaining that magical quality that only comes from a friendly voice telling you a story before you inevitably shut your eyes.\n\nWhile the title may lead to believe differently, ASAMU actually focuses on the titular uncle’s nephew; a daring young lad who, taking after his uncle, has an endless curiosity about the world around him and an irresistible urge to explore it. So it would stand to reason that upon visiting his uncle’s workshop and finding it empty, save a small futuristic suit in just his size, that he would strap it on and set out to find where his uncle has made off to.\n\nAside from the quick opening taking place in a setting resembling the one we ourselves live in, ASAMU is firmly planted in a marvelously imaginative world of its own creation. Huge floating rock structures populated with glowing foliage and villages of frog like inhabitants paint an enchanting local to explore, or simply admire from a standstill for its beauty. For as straightforward as the narrative is, the further I progressed the more intrigued I became about the place I was exploring, and longed to learn more about what had sparked all of it into being.\n\nUnfortunately, ASAMU hasn’t anywhere near enough time to explore everything it presents before you, or in fact touch on anything for more than a brief moment before the end is before you after only 2-3 hours. It’s incredibly disappointing because developer Gone North Games achieves so much in this time in getting me interested in the world and lore it created, but ends the experience well before it has a chance to expand on any of it leaving me with a distinct lack of closure. It’s like having an amazing dream, and just as you’re beginning to get into it you’re woken with a start and no matter how hard you try can’t find it again.\n\nWhen you art admiring the locals (or deploring their brevity), you’re soaring through the air using the prior mentioned suit, the abilities of which grant you an incredible amount of agility. The foremost of these is a grapple ability which lets you grab ahold of structures and use them to propel you forward. Combined with a super jump and sprint ability this creates an exhilarating means of travel, making you feel like a parkour running that’s made off with the claw from Bionic Commando as you rush through levels swinging from point to point. When you get into a flow it feels like little else I’ve ever played, and has me wishing more games attempted to do first person platforming this way, but here is you come up against a bit of a roadblock.\n\nWhile the tools to string together grapples and jumps are all within your hands, you’re shackled with severe limitations on how you can use them which quickly turns to frustration as you find yourself repeatedly falling into bottomless pits. You are given a set number of grapples you can perform before landing, but levels are designed in a way that requires you to take a specific path through them jumping and swinging at just the right moment, essentially removing all form of experimentation from the player. There is so much potential here that for the developers to make such an easily remedied mistake is a huge shame, and one which greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game. I’d have even accepted an unlockable cheat which removes these limitations, as being able to traverse levels without constantly having to plan each moment out would feel incredible, but instead the mechanics hurt themselves by over restricting the player and taking away a lot of what could have been an amazing platforming system.\n\nEven had it not come from a small studio, I would have been very impressed with the graphical work achieved in the environments and especially the sparse use of color to outline paths and present a contrast to the various areas you visit. Though largely taking place in caves, each level feels entirely distinct to itself, from the suffocating darkness of a deep chasm to the breathtaking vistas of a world existing above the clouds. Almost every moment offers an amazing view, made all the more exciting by the speed you typically move through them, and the fact it was accomplished by an indie developer makes it even more unexpected.\n\nI do wish I could say as kind things about the voice acting, which unfortunately is among the worst of any game in recent memory. Full of awkward inflections and strange pauses, the cast does a rather poor job masking the fact they are almost certainly not native english speakers, and the strange disconnect between them and what they are saying makes it hard not to groan whenever someone opens their mouth to try and deliver a line. I don’t mean to be so hard on a group that seems to at least have tried really hard to give a good performance, but I can’t gloss over the fact that it’s just abysmal all around and had me tempted to turn it off entirely and get by on subtitles alone.\n\nA Story About My Uncle is a hugely ambitious game for an entirely new developer, which almost inevitably didn’t manage to quite hit the mark. It’s riddled with flaws from almost every angle, which when piled upon each other make it a rather hard sell. Poor voice acting, frustrating gameplay design, and a shockingly brief length left me wondering if I could really recommend it to someone else. But for all its faults I still enjoyed the experience, for reasons I find hard to put into words. There is just something inherently charming about all of it, and perhaps I wanted so much for its mechanics to succeed that I kept going despite my annoyances. I can’t speak for others, but I suppose a lot of it harkens back to my love of bedtime stories in general, which no matter how lackluster they were I ate up with a ravenous desire for more.\n\nIn a lot of ways A Story About My Uncle left me feeling the same way as most of the stories I was told growing up; not entirely displeased with what I got, but saddened it had to end so soon.\n\nFull disclosure: A Story About My Uncle was reviewed using a review copy provided by the developer.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 28, 2014","true","3.3"," 109 of 121 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","109","121","0","0"

Using this suit, he follow his uncle's steps unto a wonderful hidden world.\n\nThe gameplay is very fluid and smooth, and I would say that is a mix between Mirror's Edge and Bionic Commando. The game continuously introduces new mechanics/power-ups throughout the game(like a rocket-powered boost), keeping the experience fresh, and it gets more and more challenging as it goes(but not too much), keeping up a good pacing between challenge, the introdution of new mechanics and the getting used to those mechanics.\n\nThe art direction is great, beautiful scenery and atmosphere.

Let's see.\n\nThe story starts with you, telling to your daughter a bedtime story about an adventure you've experienced as a child. Of course, you get to live the adventure.\nA kid of not specified age finds some sort of space suit into his uncle's closet. This suit looks just made for him. He then decide to wear it and place himself into a strange teleporter. This shoots him into another dimention, made of flying rocks that he can swing on with his special  Spider-man web  magic glowie beam that he can shoot out of his  Iron-man suit  glove.\n\nFirst thing you will notice about this game: the stunning environments. Each stage haves a different one, and they all looks very interesting. Well, maybe the last one won't be looking really cool, because it's just a ice mountain, but we'll get to the final part of the game. Oh boy, we will.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty decent, not the best quality you will find, but still enjoyable; same goes for the music, appealing, but not very memorable.\n\nThe gameplay works very well, M1 to shoot the beam that will drag you around, M2 to load up your super jump, and later on, spacebar while in the air for rocket boots (also, expect a dumb brony reference after you'll get them). The first person model animations are very well made, but the camera angle doesen't make me look like a little kid at all. And having an adult grunt when the character fall from a huge heigh doesen't help.\n\nBut here is something that bugged me a little: the level design.\nMuch more I was going on, much more it felt a little bit repetitive. Sure, the story was proceeding, but I didn't really been following that because was pretty cliché and expecially they whould spoil you pretty much all the biggest twist with some question that the character made to himself. Is like that guy that while you watch a movie says "oh, I bet now this is gonna happen", and that actually happen. Is kinda frustrating.\nAnyway, about the level design, it wasn't only done pretty badly, but also there was no sense of progression. You can take the first stage and then pass to the last stage, the level of difficulty is pretty much the same. And expecially,  there could be way more  gameplay elements then the one we got.\nFor exemple, at one point there will be a giant monster. They could have added a way to actually fight it, but nope. We got Red Light-Green Light game. Great.\n\nAnd then the last problem with this game:  THE F*CKING RUSHED FINAL.\nIf there is something that I hate more, is the feeling of not have achieved something in the end. And this game passed that line.\nAfter a boring normal puzzle, you finally get to the ending. You will then take part of a scene (pretty much like Half Life 2, there is no actually cutscenes into the whole game) and then the game ends. There is no boss fight, no final time trial puzzle, nothing. Just a 2 minute stupid,  stupid  dialog.\nWords cannot express how much I hate this kind of finals, and this really makes me even more angry, because I want to like this game.\n\nBut still, I whould reccommend it.\n\nFInal score: 6/10\n\nIt's fun, it has an interesting concept and the 3-4 hours long doesen't make it way too much boring. Still, the game fell with the final.\n13€ may be too much for this game, I would suggest getting it for 5-6€ on a sweet sale.\n\n\nEven Goat Simulator had a better ending then this, damnit.","August 6, 2014","true","5.6"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","49","56","0","0"

The player is placed in the shoes of a father telling his daughter the adventure he had as a young boy in search of his uncle, an adventurer who had gone missing. The young boy came upon a intriguing mechanical suit that fit him and a launch pad that propelled him into a world full of wonder, intrigue, and a lot of floating rocks.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe environemt is really well-made and offer enough variety to let you forget that you are in caves 80% of the time. There were standard caves, dark menacing caves with glowing plants, ice caves, caves of floating villages, and caves of artifacts from another time. All caves were enormous, big enough to contain a whole city and then some.\n\nThe art style leans toward cartoonish but fits quite well with the fantasy setting that requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (floating rocks, duh).\n\nThe sound and music were well-done and serve the mood of the game nicely.\n\nThe dialogue, though few, was quite decent and the voice-acting was excellent.\n\nAnd the mechanics are very polished and together the setting, the art style, the music, the sound, and the gameplay made up a very immersive experience. It is hard not to feel the pounding of your heart as you run, jump, grapple and slinghshot yourself through various terrain with incredible speed. The rush is there, but gravity never did forget you. I remember countless times where I miss the right timing to connect my grapple then look up as all rocks around me shoot up, the wind swoosh by. and everything fade to black.\n\nThe bad:\n\nWhile the mechanics were quite good. There were definitely a few places in the game where I felt there could be more  cues as to what can be connected with the grapple. In one instance I was supposed to connect to the stalacites on the cave ceiling to swing myself across, but no sound or environmental cues were provided. And I felt frustrated as I tried to super-jump myself across but inevitably fell to my miserable death every time. At another time, there were these glowing crystals where the player is supposed to use in mid-air to charge the grappling hook and further the swinging distance, but for a quite a few of them no matter how close I get no charging was possilbe. And so I had to plan my route not using them. Note that these frusrating intances are far and few in between, and the developer are still releasing patches, so I remain hopeful that they will be fixed in due time.\n\nfinal words:\n\nIf you are looking for a neat game you can enjoy in an afternoon, and the idea of being Tarzan swinging in fantastical caves intrigues you, then consider "A Story About My Uncle." It is an atomoshperic, narrative-driven experience that takes you away to a different world one swing at a time.","October 26, 2014","true","3.9"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","42","47","0","0"

The design and gameplay is awesome. All the controls are very smooth. You can jump, high-jump and far-jump between platforms and you can use the grappling hook to reach each platform very easy.\n\nHighly recommended for all indie and platforming fans. Even if you don't usually play platformer you should give it a try.\n\nDesign and SoundThese developer like details. Its is awesome what you can discover in your journey through this world. I didn't expect that much from such a (relatively cheap) indie game. I made so many screenshots and will most likely use some of them in my desktop background cicle. The designer made sure to create a wonderful dream land.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497022343\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497022499\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497021976\n\nGameplay and ControlsWell this a platformer, so you will mostly jump and grapple between platforms. Using static and moving objects to reach your target. Although I enjoy most games with a gamepad I had never tried it with this game. But in the options the gamepad was availabe for use. You can change key mappings, but I choose not to, because the default mapping was just fine.\nIt was a little hard at the beginning to use the right mousebutton as power jump, but I got used to that after couple of minutes.\nBesides the story (which I finished in about 2.5 hours) there are time challenges, collector and minimum-grapple-use challenges. To be honest, they are not easy.\n\nAchievementsThere are not many story based achievements. In fact you don't have to do any of them during the story. There is the typical "Collect everything" and "Explore everything". But the other are just skill based. For example do every part without failing or with at maximum of grapple uses. These achievements are really challenging, so you will have to exercise each level a lot.\n\nRatingI will rate this with a solid 10/10. The story and graphics are so good. And the challenges extend the gameplay by many hours.","August 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","1"

(ASAMU)\n\n\nWhen I saw this game on the Steam frontpage it was love at first sight. Normally I wait for a discount, and then just tuck the games I find interesting in my backlog, but ASAMU was different: I bought it at full price, downloaded it and finished it in one sitting. Even though I throughoutly enjoyed the game, admired the visuals and find (most of) the story interesting I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, I'm not sure if I can even say that it's a good game. Third person platforming is one of my favorite game genres which is sadly neglected, ASAMU much like Mirror's Edge offers the thrill of leaping through huge depths, and the feeling of freedom (have you ever dreamt that you can fly? well it's a bit like that) Let me elaborate:\n\n1. Graphics:\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful scenery and landscapes.\n+ True feeling of depth below you.\n+ Smart camera movement making the jumps and movement more immersive.\n+ Perfectly optimized, runs flawlessly on a mid-spec laptop maxed out.\n\nCons:\n- Low-res immersion-breaking character models.\n- Somewhat inconsistent art-style.\n- The visuals don't really support the story.\n\n2. Gameplay:\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting equipment upgrades like "laser grappling hook", "rocket-boots"\n+ Smart platforming puzzles.\n+ Constant sense of adrenaline-rush and challenge.\n+ Intuitive/easy to learn controls\n+ The lack of any violence, and death when falling makes the game unusually soothing and relaxing.\n\nCons:\n- Unintuitive checkpoint system where the distance between the chekpoints grow larger and larger.\n- The fast-paced gameplay slows down and stalls in the later levels.\n- Unfair difficulty spikes.\n- Trial-and error puzzles (you can't do it at one try, you should die 5-50 times before you figure out)\n- The hardcore precision-platforming requirements at places may scare away newcomers to the genre.\n- Short gameplay time (I finished it in around 6 hours in my slow-pace most people finish it in 2-3 hours)\n\n3. Story\n\nPros:\n+ Sort of interesting premise\n+ Interesting narrated gameplay (like Bastion), however it becomes inconsistent and scarce as the game progresses.\n\nCons:\n- Terrible, terrible ending (oh god why), I just stared at the screen feeling cheated. It would have been better to not have a story at all!\n- Uninteresting characters, cliché dialogues.\n\n4. Music/Sound Design\n\n+ The music is cool, but nothing to write home about.\n+ The sound design gets the job done, nothing impressive either.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf I'd be objective I'd give ASAMU a score of 60/100. It was sort of a financial flop, and not a commercial success either (according to Steamcharts 166 players played it the most, currently has 2 players active).  It has an interesting concept but sadly it falls short in delivering, the story feels terribly rushed (like they wrote it 20 minutes before released) the gameplay although fun has it's flaws which combined with the story (in a supposedly story-rich game) just can't make it.\n\nHowever I still recommend it, why?\n\nBecause I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game, I mean I finished it in one sitting that's something right? It's just a lovely short game that I recommend to pick up on a -60%+ sale, and you will enjoy it if you are aware of it's limits and lower your expectations accordingly.","July 28, 2014","true","9.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

The world is just beautiful (the foliage in particular) and as far as platform games go, the idea of this game is quite fun.\n\nHowever, there are two main downfalls of this game:\n\n1) It is extremely short! With only six levels taking approximately 15-20 minutes (if that) to complete the first time round. The majority of people writing reviews have completed the game in just 2 or 3 hours.\n\n2) The game gets VERY repetitive very quickly; the gameplay is almost (if not) identical in each level and there isn't a large enough variety of modes to support more types of gameplay, multiplayer for example.\n\nSo if you love games made to look beautiful, by all means try this game out, but don't expect to ever play it again after your first completion of the game (I who have OCD about getting every achievement for every game am even struggling to find the motivation to play this game again for as long as it takes).\nBut if you want a game you won't get bored of easily, has masses of content and you'll want to play for more than a few days (which is the majority of gamers), I wouldn't recommend this game.","November 4, 2014","false","7.0"," 126 of 199 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","126","199","3","13"

From the team behind Goat Simulator, it was one of their earlier titles and it flew under the radar for most. It's a relaxed, sweet story world to explore which doesn't do anything special, and that's fine.\n\nHighlightsA Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer that isn't anything special, it's not unique, it doesn't have a new incredible story, it doesn't go above the norm on any of it's design choices. But it's great fun, the story is interesting, the characters and atmosphere all work and it's just a good honest game.\n\n* A compelling enough world and story with enough lore to go back and look harder on a second playthrough.\n* Absolutely gorgeous artefacts and atmosphere.\n\nMistakesSurprisingly, there are very few faults with this title. It lacks the polished feel the triple A's command, but that adds to it's charm.\n\n* Some annoying level design problems from time to time.\n* Collectibles are pretty bland and boring.\n* Plot/story is great, but runs thin at times.\n* Far too easy overall.\n* Short play time, even for it's low price.\n\nRecommendationsIt clocks in at just 4-5 hours play time and doesn't have much re playability, so getting your moneys worth matters with this one. At £9.99 or $12.99 at the time of review it's not going to break anyones bank, but like most games on Steam, it's probably worth picking up on sale, perhaps at -50% or less. I haven't seen it in any Bundle deals so don't wait for it to appear on HumbleBundle et al.\n\n* Gathering the collectibles will lead to unlocking Goat Mode, a reference to one of Coffee Studios' other titles, Goat Simulator.\n* This game uses the Unreal Engine and includes console access to modify/play with your world including flying, and taking better screenshots.","May 9, 2015","true","8.4"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

There are hidden collectables that unlock unlockables, like\nchanging your beam color, to turning into a goat (yes, really), and story collectables, which add\nextra narration. Removed a point for shortness, maxing out my run at around 5 hours, and the\nreplayability isn't that great. So, 1 point off there.\n\n\nStory/Lore\nThe story of this game is fantastic. It is narrated by the protaganist, telling the story as a\nbedtime story to his daughter. The story is amazing, and the ending is absolutely fantastic. The\nhidden story collectables really add on to the story, making it a lot better. What this game lacks\nin game time, makes up for in story.\n\n\nControls (Keyboard}\nI find this game best played with a keyboard, which is  a rare thing for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/278360/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platforming adventure created by Gone North Games and representing Coffee Stain Studios' first foray into publishing.The game follows the story of a boy searching for his lost uncle, finding himself in a wondrous place he never thought existed, a faraway planet where his uncle stumbled upon something incredible.The game is presented as a bedtime story that a father is recounting to his young daughter, detailing his adventures on the strange planet while tracking down his inventor uncle, with the assistance of various technological implements that he devised.As you venture deeper into the world, with the help of gadgets that allow you to jump incredibly high and soar through the environment, you will discover what kept your uncle from returning home. Movement is a big part of the game, as it mainly focuses on the exploration of vast and beautiful environments, swinging through the air with a wonderful feeling of freedom by making use of an energy beam that pulls you toward certain objects, like a grappling hook.You can only utilize the grappling hook a limited number of times while in the air though, so you have to use the energy charges carefully, in order to make sure that you're going to land in the right spot. Once you land though, your charges are refilled, probably by the mysterious force of the crystals found all around.The main attraction of A Story About My Uncle is the free-form movement afforded by the grappling hook and the rocket boots, and the tense moments between jumps, wondering whether or not you'll be close enough to your next tethering point.Although it's a first-person game, it completely forgoes the shooter component that is usually associated with such titles, offering a completely non-violent experience, that is driven entirely by narration and exploration.The environments are pretty varied, going from an underground cavern to out in the open sky, beneath a frozen mountain, through the floating jungle islands looming over a massive river and then back in a different kind of underground cavern.The movement is pretty varied as well, and you'll find yourself not simply cruising forward, but also falling to abyssal depths, climbing to dizzying heights and slowly making your way along the walls of immense underground caves, seeing your destination clearly and struggling to find an adequate route, gliding along the walls and jumping from ledge to ledge.That being said, the game has a strong puzzle vibe to it, almost all of the time imposing a strict route for you to decipher in order to progress, and not letting you experiment with the environment enough.But the main thing you'll be doing while playing A Story About My Uncle is falling to your death. Although the game is very linear, it's not always very clear about the direction you're supposed to go in, and so you'll end up doing a lot of experimenting to see whether you can reach a certain point or not, which equates death most of the time.This coupled with the fact that the story begins by being genuinely interesting, raising a bunch of questions, but then falling flat on its face, is another aspect that marks down the entire experience.Frankly, I found the lack of a great story the most disappointing thing about the game.The grappling hook gimmick is fun enough, and the game looks great, but that's not enough to carry the whole thing.The game ends very abruptly, and so does the story, raising many questions but answering none and making no sense, making you feel like the kid you were telling it to fell asleep and you no longer had to explore it in its entirety.It feels very unsatisfying when a story presents you with an interesting premise that it then can't figure out what to do with, so it just ends everything right then and there.Especially since going around the environments is usually quite fun and would have been even more fun if it were just a means to an end, and not the entire journey itself.The game also has some really nice graphics, blending light and shadow, glowing effects and colorful vistas, both underground and up in the sky, making for a great visual journey.You'll find yourself simply checking out the interesting view a lot of the time, especially in the more populated areas, but overall, the world just feels very disconnected from what it should be.","January 8, 2015","true","90.2"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","29","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EasyUltra/recommended/278360/","EasyUltra","Ultra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EasyUltra/","39 products in account","Where do I begin with a game that is so adventurious yet repetitive. First off let's start with what most people come to see for the first time with this game, the graphics.\n\nThe Graphics\nThis game is nothing short of beautiful, for it to have been made over two years ago (as of the time this review is being made). The game has aged very well, some triple-a titles can't even look this wonderful, from the gorgeous lighting and shadows to the smooth physics and motion that you receive while grappling, but I'll talk more about the way the game works shortly. This is singlehandedly one of the prettiest indie games I've played and well worth the $5 that my friend spent on it in order to give it to me as a gift (Thank you Ryan c:). Even the landscapes and models are well detailed, from pieces of paper and bottles that you'll find laying around, to the beautiful skybox that inhabits the world, this is a masterpiece of an adventure. The only downfall is the character models, the (lizard?) people that you encounter seem to look a lil cartoonish and have strange ways of walking, it seems like the developers kinda skimped on them entirely, but not on the scenery, which I guess I can forgive since they made such a pretty game.\n\nGameplay\nNow this is one of the best parts of the game, in my opinion. The parkour elements and skills that you need in order to dodge and seemelssly jump from platform to platform, from ice spikes to landing pads, it's wonderful, really! The way that you run and grapple onto platforms isn't clunky or too difficult, the right amount of timing and luck will get you through the levels in no time at all. Overall the gameplay itself has a unique feel, if I could change anything I'd make the height of your character just a tad taller, you seem to be a lil too close to the ground when you're freerunning through caves.\n\nStory\nOkay this is the bread and butter for this game and there will be spoilers ahead so if you haven't beaten it yourself, stop here.\n\nThis game starts off so spooky and strange, the atmosphere is dark and omniscent and hell I'd even say it looked like a horror game if it had some depth of field, but it doesn't. You play as a man, telling his daughter a story of his Uncle and the adventure that he undertook in order to find him, and then return back home. During the story of this game you come along a girl by the name of Maddie, she rides on your back for a majority of the time that you'll actually be playing, and she helps you along the way by giving you hints and decoding the texts on the wall in order to reveal where you are and where you're going. The parkour elements that I discussed earlier really do set the stage for the adventurious feeling that this game gives off, you actually get immersed within this short story. As for the ending of the game, well the way that you find your uncle and then leave him within meer seconds of seeing him kinda disappointed me because you only said a few words to him, and then left. He didn't even thank you for finding him, he just left you on your marry way and he stayed behind in the chasm to live out his adventure. After the credits there is an epilogue and you find yourself walking through your uncle's abandoned home, explaining how the adventure you undertook meant a lot to you and your daughter and you are proud you could undertake such a journey in order to find your uncle and bring your soul serenity and peace from the worry of wondering what might have happened to your uncle if you never went after him. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up when you let go of the note/picture of you and your daughter and it flies up into the night sky, as you say thank you to your uncle for making all of this happen.\n\nSummary\nThis story is wonderful, although short and sweet. If a game can make me cry, laugh, smile, and feel angry within a playthrough, I'll give it a solid review. And this game, well it did all of those including the first one, which is rare. Overall I'd say this game is a solid 10/10 and you should pick it up if you have the chance, you can find it on sale here and there or cheaper on some third part sites, but it's well worth it. It took me a lil over 2 hours to complete the story, and it's a story I'd play again if given the chance.","May 14","true","3.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

It look's great, the scenery is beautiful, music excellent and the voice acting isn't half bad either, but it stops there.\n\nThe core game play is first person swinging physics, you have a grappling hook with a limited number of grapples each time you jump to get from platform to platform. This starts out as a lot of fun, but quickly spikes in difficultly. Your grappling hook only has a limited range and limited uses between jumps, this isn't a problem at first but after one or two levels, the surfaces you need to grapple to start to become only just in range to the point of Limbo difficulty where if the jump/swing is not done perfectly you will fall to your death, a lot.\n\nThe swing physics are fairly tricky as well. Quite a few times I found my self clinging to surfaces around me to try and build momentum, letting go when I had speed, only to slam into what I just let go of and fall. You also receive upgrades however they do not make it any easier as the difficulty again increases. This makes sense but it would have been nice to have an area or time to just enjoy care free these features.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it quickly becomes frustrating and I can't help but think it would have been better with a little more polish and better placement of surfaces to grapple to.\n\nI wanted to swing from platform to platform with ease, get lost in the world and while I'm sky high look down and watch everything become bigger as you slam into the ground like iron man; but I just couldn't.","July 17, 2014","false","2.4"," 51 of 82 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","51","82","0","7"

Let me tell you why:\nI expected a (very) good story at least, because this was mentioned by many players in their reviews.\nTo be honest the story is rather basic and too short to be very touching or thrilling. If you would cut out all story parts of the game and make a video about all the narration and conversation parts it would barely exceed 10-15 minutes. It's sadly not a (story) gem like e.g. "To the Moon" or "Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons".\nThe gameplay itself was ok, but very frustrating at some parts, mostly the final level.\n\nPros:\n+ nice environment & design\n+ gameplay is ok, but repetitive\n\nCons:\n- Disappointing story\n- Very short about 2-3 hours walkthrough (isn't that important for me)\n- Achievements are very hard (most players will finish the game with 0 achievements)\n\nI would only recommend it, buying during a sale if you are looking for a short filler.","February 27","false","3.1"," 90 of 153 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","90","153","3","15"

A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer, a genre which until this game, I insisted could never measure up to its far superior third person cousin. Surprisingly though, the tight handling and impeccable accuracy in this game was enough to rival and even surpass that of most third person games with ease.\n\nWhile the gameplay is amazing and is enough to support the game on its own, the amount of gameplay the game consists of isn't so great. The story is rather brief after my experience playing it. Moreover, the models' graphics seemed pretty low end, however the environment was astoundingly beautiful. Consequently, the game did work extremely well with what it had. While the graphics might have been below AAA quality the environments were amazingly done and the creatures were unique and imaginative. I can only imagine what the developers could have done with a bigger budget. The soundtrack really helps complete the atmosphere too. I’ll admit that there was one point that genuinely had me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself. Now if that doesn’t speak wonders for a game's atmosphere than I don’t know what does.\n\nA Story About My Uncle is an amazing and completely unique experience. There is only one big problem with the game and that is the length. While the gameplay and world is perfect I just don’t know if I could justify buying a three hour long game for the price it is at the moment. The game was easily good enough to have been much longer without wearing out it’s welcome and I was genuinely disappointed that it ended so quickly. If you can stomach the price then I would completely recommend it and if it’s ever on sale then seriously, waste no time!

The gameplay entirely consists of platforming, with various powers available to the player as you progress (floating, swinging multiple times between different points, power jumps).\n\nIt's relatively short, taking about 2-3 hours to complete. It does have the benefit of having achievements for completing different segments without dying/under a certain time/under certain constraints, which allows for a little replayability, but those are obviously not for everyone. Graphically, the world is excellent but the character models can feel a little rough. Voice acting is mostly hit or miss, but typically above average for this sort of budget game. The gameplay itself is excellent - very responsive, and the level design is relatively straightforward for how wide open the areas tend to be - I only found myself feeling lost one time and that's ASTONISHING given how large some of the areas are.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game is well worth playing if you enjoy 3D platformers - you may just want to wait for a sale depending on what price you're interested in playing for a game which can be completed in a rather short time.","February 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevspace/recommended/278360/","kevspace","kevspace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevspace/","502 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately this game really wanted to hate me. On paper it's everything I like: first-person movement, no unnecessary combat, good art design and music, a mysterious short story with heart. But if you can't get the hang of the controls-- after three hours, I certainly couldn't-- the entire game is nothing but frustration. If I was playing it improperly, the game didn't give me any clue as to what I was doing wrong. Or right, for that matter. If this game wants to be about swinging, why does the main grapple mechanic yank you to ledges you can't grab? This is A Story About Hitting Your Head And Falling A Lot. At least the music is nice and calming... though that makes it seem like it shouldn't be so infuriating to play.\n\nI think the problem is that most of the gameplay environments are tiny platforms suspended at maximum distance in empty space; with no quick way of judging relative depth, perspective, target size or distance, there's no reliable way to know how fast you're going or in what direction, or how close you are to your destination-- moving platforms are particularly hard to judge. Maybe some floating stationary particles in the air, or some kind of on-screen meter would help? The stationary skybox, while pretty, only helps you know what direction your head is pointed. Your body is only a disembodied hand. Speed lines and subtle wind clues are all you get to calculate 3D physics trajectory with precise timing. Checkpoints are the only mercy. At one point, your only friend in the game will taunt you for using your best tool... it's really defeating. If you buy this, just hope you're "more hardcore" than me, I guess.\n\nI've beaten Mirror's Edge on every difficulty and I can finish Jumping Flash without dying so I'm no stranger to first-person platforming-- maybe it's just that those protagonists had visible feet?-- but this game never clicked with me. I'd try dozens of times to pass one checkpoint, agonizingly almost-but-not-quite-reaching the next one, only to land on it the 35th time with no idea what I'd done "right." There are no difficulty options. I got to the final level, tried for a half hour without even seeing the first checkpoint (let alone reach it) and I gave up. This makes me wonder if the game was artificially made more difficult to disguise how short it is. It also makes me think that if you get the hang of the controls and find a good flow, this game's less than an hour long. I would have preferred an easy hour than three hours of nonstop frustration. Or at least some sort of aim assist option. I don't even think it's priced too high... I just don't want to pay any money to feel that frustrated.\n\nMaybe if I played more twitch-based super-demanding multiplayer games, I'd be used to this sort of pixel-perfect trajectory-based movement, but this game presents itself as a child's bedtime story in a peaceful world and then asks you to have the reflexes of a lifelong speedrunner. If your favorite thing about FPS games is rocket-jumping and exploiting glitches, give this a shot. As for me, I can finish Half-Life 2 in less than four hours but I couldn't finish this game at all. So I watched the ending and it turns out I had already guessed it; the developers spoil their own story by getting cute with 'hidden' text and a simple letter-substitution cipher that they show you the key for early in the game. Oh well. (They also hobble the story with some clumsy writing and awkward voice acting, but I assume it's a small team for whom English is not their first language.)\n\nI really appreciate that they tried for something unique and emotional, but in the end the nice art design couldn't hide a super-hardcore frustration-fest with fiddly controls. Make a sequel with a main character who has a visible body and can grab ledges, and test out its difficulty curve on a wide range of gamers before you ship it, and I'll be on board. This game, though, was just too much frustration and not enough fun.","June 24, 2014","false","3.3"," 43 of 72 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","43","72","0","1"

But one that deserves your attention.\n\nYour character's daughter one day asks for a story and you start telling about your uncle you were once looking for, a long time ago. So, the game starts with a younger you, trying to find your uncle.\nThe story isn't deep, it's even simple, but it's told in a way that it's realistic, you know, like how one would tell a story to his or her child.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, and the attention to detail in the environments is sublime. The characters are a bit off, but fortunately, there are only a handful of characters you'll meet. There are some citizens to be found here and there, but you won't likely see them up close.\nThese sharacters have excellent voice acting, even if there aren't that many conversations and they all sound like one would expect. No problems here.\n\nGameplay wise the goal is to work your way to the end of the level by using a glove/device that allows you to traverse great distances. You can attach it to certain surfaces and that way swing across the many platformers you'll encounter.\nSometimes it's a little bit unclear where you have to go to, but by looking around you can usually figure it out quick enough.\nIt can become a bit frustrating because -although there are checkpoints- there's also a bit of skill and luck involved. It's not always clear how far you're away from a certain object and that ocassionally results in you falling to your death. Thankfully, death has no real penalties and the game doesn't need to reload anything. You're instantly transported back to your last checkpoint.\nLater on you'll earn upgrades that allow you to recharge while traveling, the ability to jump, use a jetpack or to use more charges.\nThere are several worlds to explore, with different settings and physics but in the end there are only a handful of them (not even that I think). There are also some secrets to be found in each level (each level lasts about an hour or so), but I have no clue if it adds anything to the game or story or if they're just there for the challenge of it.\n\nA Story About My Uncle is a clever game with some excellent gameplay mechanics. It could've benefited from a little bit more narration and a couple of extra levels/worlds, but what's there is already lots of fun (mixed with some minor frustrations).\n\n[Rating: 81/100]","June 9, 2014","true","4.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

(~3.5 euro on discount)\nEnding of game leaves the feeling of being incomplete somehow but I guess alot people will like it, as it leaves place for "thinking" about what might happen next\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 21","true","8.3"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","17","26","4","1"

The first-person platforming works well at the start, but 1/3 of the way through the game, it becomes overwhelmed by its own clunkiness.\n\nTake one look at one of the NPCs and you'll know what I mean: The developers have some good ideas, but (for whatever reason) they just don't execute them well enough. Beaming to rocks is neat, and the sensation of flying through such tremendous space is exhilirating. But you'll fall to your death over and over as you realize how tricky the mechanic really is.\n\nI came really close to rage-quitting 3/4 of the way through, because the stalactite-jumping scene is simply TERRIBLE. Beam, beam, recharge, all while falling, all while trying to maneuver around falling rocks -- who needs it?\n\nWorst of all, this tedious flinging of oneself (and it does get tedious toward the end) is rewarded with almost zero payoff. I'm sorry, devs, but the story here is just paper-thin. I felt no sense of accomplishment or awe when I was done.\n\nThis could have been the next MYST, and I really wanted it to be so. But it's not.\n\nI enjoyed parts of it, and in general the mechanisms are okay. But the lack of satisfying story (or really any story) nudges it over the line into a thumbs-down.","June 7, 2014","false","4.8"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","22","36","0","1"

Does the game make it fun to just...move around?\n\nFor "A Story About My Uncle", the answer is most definitely yes.\n\nWhat makes this game truly amazing is its balanced sense of scale. The developers had to juggle size, linearity, and the player's mobility. It would have been easy to end up with something too easy or too straightforward, but the devs did a bang-up job.\n\nYou'll learn to grapple and glide through a massive and hauntingly beautiful world.

It is really relaxing and challenging to play. and you can always try again and again, with no need of going through the level from the start again. The game also includes some collectibles that are fun to try searching for, and it's always fun to swing through places using a grappling hook. You also gets the options to replay the chapters so you can complete the rest of the achievements and get all th collectibles.\n09/10\n\nStory:\nThe story is what truly is amazing about this game. It's so interresting to hear, and when you start playing it, you really want to know what the ending is, so you keep trying to swing you through the world, in search of the story about my uncle. And at the jurney, you gets some of the story a bit by bit, from the main character when he speaks to a little kid.\n10/10\n\nGraphic:\nThe graphic are just so amazing, the particles flying around and the shader effect really makes the game look great.\nThe edges of plants are round and and mostly smooth and really makes it looks like you are looking at something that could be true.\nAlso the game does not require an super gamer pc to run on maximum settings, and the game can give some amazing screenshots for you.\n09/10\n\nSound:\nThe subs supports the voices from the characters, but not the sound from The huge monster in the cave, But instead it have been writen in the subs, the enviroment vibrates, so you actually gets a feeling that there was something loud that just happened.

And that got me to check it out, saw that it was on a pretty wicked sale, and decided to pick it up, as she has a really good taste on platforming games. And you know what? I don't regret it. Now as usual, I will start my review on the negative parts of the game. Granted, I didn't find many stuff to talk about...\n\n...But the biggest downside to the game is how short it is. I barely reached two hours on it. (EDIT: 2,7 hours to be precise) Sure, I will come back and probably try to get all the achievements and hidden stuff on it, but it's sad that a game with such potential decides to just last two hours. Infact, when I reached the ending and saw the credits roll in I was shocked and dissapointed, as I expected it to keep going. It's a 13€ game without sales. I do NOT think a game that lasts 2 hours is worth that. At all.\n\nThe other complains I have about it are rather minor stuff:\n\n-When doing a Sprint-jump, you can't steer yourself in the air. You can steer in ALL other jumps except that one, and it feels more like they forgot about it.\n\n-There are plenty of areas where you can sort of cheat through a section. If you manage to land somewhere, your hooks and rockets recharge, but I found plenty of areas where I was NOT supposed to land, keeping me away from falling to my death and cheating the area entirely. You can also clip through some rocks and walls in weird ways, for similar effects.\n\n-The voice-acting and music is good... But the main character and narrator of the story sounds bored. I don't know, it's almost like he doesn't care at all at times. There are moments when he says stuff like "This is awesome" while sounding extremely bored and that's just anti-climatic.\n\n-The hookshot range seems to be a bit random at times.\n\n*EDIT*-The animations on other characters are really weird at times. Maybe those needed some extra polish, as they usually feel unfinished.\n\nThat being said, is the game good? Yeah, I do.\n\nThe story is good enough, and it gets the job done. It would do better if it was longer, but you know...\n\nThe sound design is really good, and if the main character didn't sound so bored, it would be even more amazing. The soundtrack is also really great, fits perfectly with the relaxed gameplay.\n\nWhere this game trully shines however, has to be n the levels. It's rare to see games push the engines on making levels this big and with so much detail. And it also doesn't run badly at all, it's really well optimized. The loading times are also nearly non-existent, which is great.\n\nGameplay, as I said, is really relaxing and simple. You can jump, you can use your suit to jump really far, you can use a weird laser-hookshot and later on even get something extra. There were a few areas where the gameplay conflicts with those weird bugs I mentioned above, but it was fresh throughout the entire game.\n\nThere are also unlockables and collectables. I didn't really mind them much, but found most of them on my first run. I will say that it's cool to change the color of the laser... But why the hell did the game need a Goat Simulator reference on them, I have no idea. The achievements are also REAL achievements and not like most other games, being harder to unlock. I only got two out of 15 or so on my first playthrough, and that gives me prupose to get back to it at some point.\n\nSo, in the end... Is it good? Yeah. However, I do NOT recommend it at the current price. I got it for like, 2€ or so. That's a really great deal, but I'd say more than 5€ could be too much. Bellow that, it's a garanteed must buy.\n\nTL:DR edition: Good platforming game but with a really high price. Wait for a sale, then enjoy it.","March 11","true","2.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

A beautiful, well made adventure, however short it may be.\n\nI've spent quite some time with the game, doing three full runs and looking in every nook and cranny for any optional story tidbits and seismograph-things, and I have to say I've come out feeling like the game was worth my money.\n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable and new, (at least for me) and I love the first person perspective's way of making me feel like I'm at near cruising altitude while swinging over the cloudline, or a dark cave's unknown depths.\n\nThe story is quick, but then again the game is as well. I liked the co-protagonist's personality. Adventurous, fearless... or at least we're told.\n\nShe even is okay with risking her life to challenge you to try to get through an area without using the grapple device. (And while I'm on the topic she's also quite annoying on telling you that she "knew you couldn't do it" when you fail to complete the challenge without saving her life as you fall to your doom.)\n\nWhile I won't elaborate on the features of the Unlockables that you get from collecting all twenty-five seismograph-things, I will say this; the last one is AWESOME.\n\nIf I had to point out some negatives, the character models can be sort of weird to look at sometimes, and during the parts when you have to watch them talk you can just wander away and not look at them and they don't care in the slightest. I sort of wished I could skip the interaction sections while trying to go for the flawless run and the grapple challenge achievements for the areas.\n\nThere's also the MASSIVE difficulty spike in the final level, which I was not expecting, but the hardest challenge there has been patched to let people flow through it easier. (Lifesaver for the low framerates I had been dealing with from time to time.) But that's really all I can remember that I straight-up disliked.\n\nA Story About My Uncle is one of the best platformers I've played, and a good change of pace from the standard formula. The ending left me wanting more, and believe me, going for gold on the time trials?\n\nI'll be with this for QUITE some time.\n\n8.7/10","November 3, 2014","true","20.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You play a young boy thrown into an unknown world in search of his uncle who has gone missing.\n\nThe main feature of this game is, of course, all of the jumping puzzles.  You use a unique suit to launch and grapple your way through the beautiful caves and islands.  Even though you will fall countless times, all of the puzzles are very fun to navigate, and they often include many surrounding areas that can be explored.  This element of exploration is one of the greatest features of the game.  Even when there are not extra areas to explore, there are always fascinating environments to observe, which, at times, easily resemble Terry Gilliam or Studio Ghibli films.\n\nThere is no violence, no language and it is not often aggravatingly difficult.  The story is fantastically well written as well, and even though it is not terribly complicated, it is very relatable and interesting.  There are few characters in the game, but the ones that are present are very easy to get attached to.  The game would certainly still be functional with no characters at all, but if that were the case, this game would not be half as good as it is.\n\nA Story About My Uncle truly has something for everyone.  An overall job well done.","September 20, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You have to launch yourself across deep chasms by hooking on to floating rocks and platforms and, my god, is it fun. While the aesthetic and story give off a casual feel, the gameplay itself feels fast and exciting and it never gets old.\nWhile playing the game, it is impossible to note the beauty and astounding level of detail brought into each map.

What you do find however is the special suit he built, a suit that let's you fall from any height without taking any damage (think Portal), execute some really long or high jumps, grab onto any surface and proppel yourself to it and (later on) use rocket boots to extend your air time. And that's what most of the gameplay is about: air time.\n\nThe gameplay is really fast paced, with you moving like the wind in a number of different locations, making use of speed and momentum to keep going forward, hoping the next jump will take you closer to your uncle. It's a really fun combination of plataforming with some puzzle elements that works wonders and there's really nothing out there quite like it: it's simple, but requires some degree of skill to move on quickly (especially if you're trying to beat the time trials). It's also a breath of fresh air that there's absolutely no kind of violence of any kind in the game. Not even singing turrets of doom.\n\nThe game is also worthy of praise regarding the design of the levels. They are really, really huge and open but you will never feel lost or need to stop to look arround and find your way for more than 5 seconds. It's mostly linear when you come to terms with how the game was designed, but it doesn't feel like you are being "forced" to go somewhere, but rather right. That's where uncled Fred went, and that's where you are going.\n\nHowever, the game is REALLY short (probably arround 2 hours for one playthrough), with low replay value, but there are the extras of the Time Trials and collectibles to be found in each level (some of wich add to the plot), if you're into that.\n\nBottom line, a different game that does what it set out to do very well, but goes by far too quickly, especially for a 15€ game... but it's still a worthwhille game that deserves to be played.","August 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It shows much of that indie aura, as it is centered around a simple but nicely told narrative. The game's setting is future you telling a bedtime story to your daugher about your unfathomable adventures as a 10 year-old on his quest to search for his Uncle.\n\nGraphics - OKThe game's focus was obviously not the graphics, but the simple yet catchy gameplay. While you won't have any impressive textures, the game makes up for it in ambient. Lots of light sources and a colored evironment will keep your eyes entertained during playthrough, however if you are a graphics elitist you might be set off by some, but few lowpoly models. The character animations are pretty lifeless, however they are mostly there for decorative purposes. Overall, I wouldn't complain about the graphics, since they look decent and not the focus of the game.\n\nGameplay - Fun but Frustrating This is another easy to play - hard to master game. It involves you wearing a power suit that alows you to jump high, run fast and grapple via an energy beam to different objects. The goal is simple. Get to the end of the level. However, doing so won't be that easy, and you can easily find yourself repeating the same sequence over and over. A warning for completitioists: the achievements are bloody hard. They involve completing levels without dieing or using a limited ammount of grapples. A very hard thing to do. The game isn't so lenghty campaign-wise, but trying to complete these challanges will surely keep you busy.\n\nSound - Soothing AmbientalThe sound is very nice in this game. Not intrusive, only calm music to serve as background stress relief, along with narratives at certain points. Decent voice acting, a nice touch overall.\n\nPros - Interesting Story\n- Simple but fun gameplay\n- Relaxing Atmosphere\n\nCons - Hard to master\n\nFinal Thoughts The game isn't much for replayability, however given the price I would easily recommend it as a casual experience.","December 18, 2014","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Not only is the concept cool, but it also shows off what this developer, who also created Goat Simulator, can do.\n\nThe story is very touching, although cut a bit short in my opinion. The very idea of swinging from platform to platform in a first person setting is amazing, and it was executed very well. With different attachments that you get, such as how many times you can swing from objects before having to land and thrusters to boost how far you can fly through the sky.\n\nThe only thing I have against this game is the achievements. Although when I played this (when it came out), it did have timed challenge maps, the original game did not have achievements, adding it a while after I had beaten the game. And though I had already played through the game, I feel the achievements detracted from the storyline and the game itself.\n\nBut overall, this is a good game to buy, and for those who have played Goat Simulator, this game actually has a point. (I enjoy Goat Simulator, but it has no plot line and little purpose besides being a goat, which is understandable why that is the only point since it is a goat sim.).

According to their website, Gone North Games was founded by 9 students who have a passion for making games. Since it's advertised all over their website and apparently important to the developers, I'll repeat it here - A Story About My Uncle is a completely non-violent video game. This isn't really an entirely novel concept for a game, but it is unusual I suppose. For better or worse, most games do rely on some sort of violent combat as their main game mechanic. I do think it's cool that games like Gone Home or To The Moon are using video games purely as a story telling medium. But unfortunately, A Story About My Uncle doesn't tell a very interesting story. It is a pretty fun platformer though which is really what this game stands on\n\nThe game begins as you, the narrator, are reading your daughter a bedtime story. The entire rest of the game is played out as a flashback as the narrator recounts how he, as a boy, used to play with his uncle at his uncle's house. One day, the narrator's uncle went missing and you soon find out that he was transported to a distant magical world through some transporter device that the narrator's uncle invented. The game is a little vague on the details of how exactly this transporter was invented or how it works, but the narrator of course uses it to travel to this other world in search of his uncle. That's pretty much all the exposition you get. I mean that's it for the rest of the game. You meet some other characters and go to new locations, but the story never really progresses at all. You're just searching for your uncle the whole game. That's it. And then (spoiler alert) the game just kind of ends abruptly at a certain point and the credits roll. Nothing is really resolved and nothing really changes, just "The End". It was very anti-climactic and disappointing. It almost seemed rushed, like they might have been trying to go somewhere with the story, but had to cut a lot of it to meet deadlines or something like that. In any case, I somewhat ironically found the story in A Story About My Uncle to be underdeveloped and uninteresting.\n\nNear the beginning of the game, the narrator discovers some magical super-bouncy boots and some magical grappling tether thing which serve as the game's platforming mechanics. I can't remember what the game actually called the boots and grapple device and I'm too lazy to look it up, but these definitely are what make this game fun and interesting. The boots allow you to jump crazy high and crazy far and the tether allows you to pull yourself closer towards certain parts of the terrain. Most of the terrain in the game is made up of small chunks of floating rock as shown in the cover art above, so the platforming can be kind of challenging in certain areas. Quick props to the graphic artists for this game, I found a lot of the floating terrain and world design to be really interesting from an artistic point of view. Very cool and imaginative artwork.\n\nI prefer to play games laying down in my couch with a controller as opposed to sitting forward with a mouse and keyboard, even while playing PC games. So I'm not sure if it was just because I was playing with a controller, but there were some parts of this game that were really tricky to pull off. And I'm usually quite good at platformers. And that's fine, I enjoy a good challenge, but the difficulty curve with this game was a little wonky. There was one particular section near the end of the game that was insanely difficult, it probably took me 30-40 attempts to finally do it right. And then the rest of the game was mind-numbingly easy. My only other complaint, from a gameplay perspective, was with the level design. It was quite often not very clear where the game wanted me to go next, especially in the later levels where the terrain is separated by great distances. I had to jump around and try to grapple to things trail-and-error style until I finally found something that worked. The difficulty curve is forgivable, but in a linear platformer like this I feel like the player should always have a pretty good idea of where the game wants them to go next.\n\nIt is definitely a flawed game, but if you like 3D platformers, you could do worse than A Story About My Uncle. It's got some really cool art design and fun platforming, but it has some design issues and the actual story might as well not even exist. It was also kind of short, I finished it in about 5 hours, but I found that length to be appropriate. All in all, not too bad for a small team making their first game. And as its developers insist, it's completely non-violent, if that's a selling point for you.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","September 5, 2014","false","4.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The game weaves a touching but simple story through the gameplay.  The gameplay focsus on the use of a grappling hook mechanism, which is well implemented, and gives the gameplay all the of the potential complexity that the orange/blue portals have in the game Portal.  There is a pretty hefty difficulty spike at the end of the game, but rest assured, if you are observant and a little patient, all of the physics puzzles are more than solvable.  I finished the game in about 10 hours.\n\nInteresting trivia: made by the same team that made "Goat Simulator"... go figure!\n\nHighly recommended!","January 8, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While you can jump, power jump and long jump to make your way around you are eventually given the power to grapple from surface. Wisely enough this power is not infinite and has a charge system to prevent you from gliding through the scenery too easily. At first it's incredibly fun and feels rather nice, but the game eventually introduces another mechanic along with more complicated pathing and numerous leap of faith type situations.\n\nPerhaps that was my own issue though since by the end of the game I never had a good feeling for either the jumping or grappling, particularly jumping which I could never judge the distance properly leading to some embarassing deaths or having to re-climb sections. Grappling later on requires you to release yourself at rather precise moments during your arc and then keep your cursor trained on the next object waiting for it to light up for barely a second and hoping you have the right angle to get onto the next object, that is if you make it.\n\nWhich is unfortunate because the set pieces are genuinely beautiful and well-detailed but are enjoyed only briefly as you search out the next path or as you're grappling with the poor controls. The story is simple, cute and very child/family friendly which would make the game a potentially fun gift for a younger sibling or relative. I would very hesitantly recommend this to anyone else though, while the unique platforming may be intriguing it quickly devolves into a a frustrating chore.","January 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","6"

Later on you find jet boots, which allow you to dash mid-air. Some of the later levels are pretty challenging, and a game with this type of moveset hasn't quite been done in first person before. It feels great to chain grapples together and propel yourself high up, then hold your breath as you struggle to reach the landing platform.\n\nUnfortunately the game tries to shoehorn a story element in, which doesn't work at all since the voice acting is abysmal and the character models are atrocious. Luckily these elements are not essential to the game, but it's a shame they couldn't polish this aspect more.\n\nIn the end though, it's all about the high speed jumps, grapples and mid air dashes.

It isn't. But it gets pretty close. The movement mechanics are really enjoyable, and you rarely get a jump that feels badly designed. The level design is good.\n\nMy biggest praise with the game is its overall universe design. It really tries to go for its own thing instead of settling in on "fantasy cliché #81672", it invents its own outlandish alien world, and that's something that video games desperately need, as those have been really scarce since the late 80s/90s. It misses the mark on a couple occasions, but the execution is solid and I would have commended the game even for just trying.\n\nThe "production value" has lows and highs. While the landscape is flat out gorgeous, the characters definitely have something weird about them. The good kind of weird (outlandish design that's not afraid of itself), but also the bad kind of weird (model and animation quality). Although animation-wise, I do like that for dialogue, the game went for entirely hand-animated the whole way through; there is no re-use of dialogue poses, and they never stand still, not gesturing, Oblivion-style.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the audio. The voice acting is alright, nothing's really bad but nothing's really good either. The sound effects lack some "punch", some clarity (I'm especially thinking of charging the glove, which sounds really weak). I thought it was really weird that the sound of wind in your ears when going through the air at high speeds was so faint. More atmospheric sounds could have REALLY enhanced the experience. And then there's the music... or lack thereof. There is almost no music, which in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but it really feels like it should have been there. The lackluster ambient soundscapes make its absence all the more noticeable.\n\nMy first reaction to the game ending was that it was pretty short, and that I wish I'd seen one or two more locations in this magical world... but on the other hand, it's good that the game doesn't pad itself or overstays its welcome, and lasts just the right length before making all that grappling and jumping lose its charm.\n\nThis is unlikely to happen at the time of writing this review but I wouldn't mind seeing some DLC that expands on the world, maybe from the point of view of the uncle. That'd be pretty great!\n\nIf I had to assign this game a rating, I'd say 8/10. But despite its flaws you should absolutely buy and play this.

All be it a short one.  But i am not sure i would say its a good game. The world is pretty but the people models look mediocre to say the least. Some of the challenge comes from the inconsistency in the physics but its a fun kind of challenge most of the time. The way you move about feels good and the overall Storybook feel to it has a ton of charm. Rich and vibrant colors and good sound design leaves you with a good feeling all the way trough as well. Or well that is untill you get stuck at a part.\nYou also have the ability to try speedrun versions of the stages and there are collectibles to find in each part of the game, that unlocks things for you to play around with. Which gives it a little bit of replayability.\nAll in all i would say its worth the money, i got it on a sale myself and i almost felt bad about it after i finished it.","November 10, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I had so much fun going through the levels and I love that you can go through the level in so many ways with some challenges along the road. This game is a combination of Portal and Mirrors Edge and I see nothing wrong with it. Mechanics are done really good and you really have a feeling and a burst of adrenaline when you jump, run or do a leap of fate. It takes you around 3 hours to finish it if you explore every bit of it or 2 and a half hours if you want to just run through the level. Design of the levels and the overall map is beautiful. Also even when you finish the game you can go for another run becuase its a lot of fun.

A Story About My Uncle is one of those games where the gameplay takes place as your character relates a story about his uncle to his daughter. In this case the story is the narrator's fantastic journey through an alternate dimension to find said uncle, and the gameplay is some straight-forward first-person puzzle platforming. The main gimmick is your grappling beam, which honestly is more like the grapples from those ancient Quake II mods than the one from Tribes or even Super Metroid. When you hit something with the grapple it pulls you straight towards it, making Tarzan-like swinging a bit of a dicey proposition and most of the challenge centered around not catching your grapple point with your face. Your "adventure suit" has some other nifty tricks baked into it though, like a super jump and rocket boots, and these are unlocked as you progress and grant some much-needed variety to the platforming. The levels are fairly varied as well in terms of look and layout, though one is unpleasantly dark and the last is unpleasantly hard. This wouldn't normally be an issue, except the game is only about five levels long. It'll still take you a good three or so hours to get through them all, but it makes the weaknesses in the level design that much more apparent.\n\nA lot of this can be forgiven when you reach the game's set-pieces, though. ASAMU has some gorgeous levels and scenery, and regardless of how you feel about the gameplay are worth seeing for yourself. Screenshots don't really do them justice, as you'll be observing them while plunging through the air at otherwise fatal speeds. The presentation does a great job of imparting vertigo when you disengage from a grapple at a peak, or plunge to your demise. The story is also quite strong, as should be expected from any game with "Story" in the title. Your narrator muses in a heartwarming way about his wayward uncle, spinning a fantastic story for his daughter. There are secret story beats to discover as well, which flesh out the narrator's relationships with the rest of his family. You get to interact with a few colorful NPCs, too, including one that actually gets some character development. It's a charming package through and through, only spoiled by some particularly frustrating bits of platforming near the finale.","September 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a bit short, but to be honest, I would rather have a short, high-quality game than a long, low-quality game.\n\nI really enjoyed the first-person gameplay in A Story About My Uncle, and I think the devs did a great job with the mechanics. Games like Mirror's Edge and Dying Light have always been enjoyable to me, and I think A Story About My Uncle is actually better than them in some respects. Take Mirror's Edge, for instance. When you could really land jumps and time everything right, it felt great - like you were flying. In A Story About My Uncle, you get this feeling much more often. Sure, sometimes you get stuck on a puzzle, but for the majority of the game, the movement is fantastic.\n\nThis game is visually fantastic as well. The world that the devs have constructed is absolutely gorgeous, and I loved the architecture of floating structures, the glowing caves, and the enormous mountains. I feel like a lot of modern games have lost the ability to project that objects in-game are big, but A Story About My Uncle does it very well.\n\nAs far as my complaints, there are few. I noticed many people complaining about the last parts of the game being awful to navigate, however I did not have any trouble with it. Personally, I would have liked to see the final bits of the game be a bit more visually perfected, as the previous bits of the game looked measurably better. The other problem I had with this game was the voice acting. Let me say that this is VERY FORGIVABLE, but I still felt the game would have been better, had there been better voice actors (and maybe more emphasis on narration in general).\n\nOverall, A Story About My Uncle is a very fun, beautiful, and interesting game. As I said, it's a bit short, so you might question paying full-price, which is understandable. However, if you think it's worth it, you should definitely give the game a try.","December 18, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCentu/recommended/278360/","SirCentu","Sir Centu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCentu/","163 products in account","It's getting late, honey...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXBjs3WKnL0\n\n\n\nAntes de recomendar este juego, mi análisis merece un poco de trasfondo. Jugué por primera vez a este juego allá en 2012, y  me quedé con cierto sabor agridulce. Se trataba de una versión temprana con un apartado visual y sonoro mediocre. No obstante, la historia era muy potente. Para mí sorpresa, A Story About My Uncle fue terminado y publicado en 2014 aquí, en Steam. Fue entonces cuando volví a rejugarlo en Steam hace poco.\n\n\nA Story About My Uncle es simplemente increíble.\n\n\nA Story About My Uncle (ASAMU), como nos dice la sinopsis de la tienda, es un juego plataformero en primera persona en el que el movimiento forma una parte importante de la mecánica. Mediante un traje, el jugador podrá balancearse o hacer saltos de gran distancia y altura a gran velocidad con el fin de superar niveles con un entorno fantásticamente conseguido.\n\n\nRespecto al apartado de mecánica y gameplay: está muy conseguido. La sensación de velocidad, el vértigo, el sentimiento de ser pequeño comparado con el escenario... todo, mediante una mecánica audaz y muy entretenida combinada con una calidad de sonido excelente, hacen de este juego una experiencia única, viva y fluída. Sin embargo, con la dificultad creciente a medida que se avanza, el juego puede llegar a cabrear a más de alguno. Presenta en ocasiones situaciones donde es bastante difícil marcar un gancho, prever lo que hay que hacer o atinar a la hora de medir distancias. Un juego de plataformas siempre trae de por sí la mecánica de 'tanteo'. Aprender de los errores propios e intentar ir mejorando. Decirse a uno mismo “Ánimo, que tú puedes…”, romper contra la mesa tu preciado teclado gaming de 195 euros....\n\n¿Hay fallos? Pues claro, chaval. ¿Acaso la vida es perfecta? Pues este juego tampoco. A veces el jugador puede quedarse atascado en alguna falla del mapeado, puede accidentalmente (o no) atravesar el mapa, o incluso caerse en el famoso "inframundo". Pero vamos, fallos típicos de un videojuego, muy poco comunes, y que en una partida normal difícilmente uno llegue a experimentar.\n\nLa historia a primera vista puede resultar simple: un padre narra a su hija un suceso de su juventud en el que su tío Fred desaparece sin dejar rastro. La búsqueda así del narrador por su tío le llevará a un mundo lejano y sobre todo, extraño; repleto de flora, criaturas y paisajes imposibles. Y todo ello dentro de un apartado visual excelente, inmenso y lleno de detalle, con el que ASAMU llega a ser un juego rebosante de vida[/b], algo que no tantos juegos logran conseguir de manera exitosa. Un verdadero paraíso para los sentidos.\n\nAunque eso sí, esta historia es completamente lineal. No existe toma de decisiones y lo único que puede complementar la trama reside en buscar, encontrar y asimilar ciertos detalles esparcidos a lo largo de los niveles. Mediante estos detalles, el jugador se sumerge en la narración aún más.\n\nAsí pues, tomando el intencionado y típico cuento para niños, ASAMU nos trae a los jugadores una auténtica joya narrativa. Los personajes son carismáticos y poco idealizados, que de forma compleja demuestran tener su propia historia y origen. Su aparición resulta inesperada, así como su apariencia y trasfondo. Por otra parte, son capaces de hacer reflexionar al jugador sobre asuntos de la vida misma, representando un constante dilema moral: la pérdida de un ser querido, la soledad o alienación en una sociedad, el avance de la tecnología frente a las tradiciones populares… en definitiva, temas humanos y profundos. Pero hablar de ellos más detalladamente sería hacer un spoiler en toda regla. Es mejor que lo descubras por ti mismo.\n\nY aún no os he hablado de la banda sonora. ¡Brillante! ¡Simplemente brillante! ¡Chapó para el señor Santiago Ferrero!\nQue sí, que quizás no es excesivamente variada ni larga, pero cumple su función a la perfección: acompaña cada momento y situación, haciendo que el jugador se sienta parte del mismo. Es un auténtico placer el detenerse a escuchar la música.\n\n\nEn definitiva, ASAMU es un juego creado con amor y cariño, que presenta una buena historia, personajes memorables, escenarios surrealistas y mecánicas de infarto. Cierto es que que puede llegar a hacerse corto, llegando a durar aproximadamente 3 horas y media su historia principal, pero existen bastantes coleccionables dispersos por los niveles, así como desafíos de contrarreloj bastante difíciles, que invitan a exprimir la vena speedrunner. A fe de que ahí sigue el primer nivel, invicto, riéndose de mí y humillándome.\n\nEs posible que su precio completo resulte un poco caro si buscas una experiencia larga y rejugable, y puede que no nades en piscinas de oro (como yo), pero si lo pillas de oferta: ¡Házte un favor y cómpratelo!\n","November 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, there were so many negative aspects that I found myself annoyed more often than not.  This game is a platformer which requires you to be extremely accurate, but often places you in very dark places or has jumps that are frustratingly too large.  And every time you mess up in the slightest, you have to start again from the last checkpoint.  The lack of a quick reset button makes it really annoying to watch the falling animation over and over again.\nEven though it promotes itself as a puzzle game, there are no puzzles.  There's simply one right way to move through each section.  At one point, you literally have to turn around and go back through what you just did, only with greater difficulty.  While the store page says "Explore the World", you don't actually get to do any exploring.  You just have to jump from platform to platform over and over again, and it gets quite repetetive.\nThe story was very short, almost nonexistent, and with an anticlimactic ending.  You only really meet one character.  A few others have speaking parts, but don't really contribute much to the story.  The store page says "Emphasis on Story", but the amount of time the story is actually presented is about 15 minutes.\nAll in all, I would say that this game is rather mediocre.  It has some interesting mechanics, but the poor story and gameplay make it fall flat on its face.  I would not recommend purchasing this at full price.  There are 15 achievements to get, but they are all so difficult, I didn't even get one during my playthrough.","April 11","false","4.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Along the way I expected to visit a glorious fantasy world rendered in the Unreal engine (which is very nicely suited to this sort of thing), and grapple my way along floating upon the breeze. Unfortunately, I kept running into difficulty with wonky physics, inconstant detection, and levels designed to be about as intuitive to navigate as a 300-car pileup.\n\n"Nevertheless I persevered until I happened upon a village of frog-people, none of whom could I interact with in any meaningful way. It was pretty creepy. But then I met this girl named Maddie, whose voice actress ought to have been ashamed of the performance she turned in. She was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying Susie, let me tell you. I hated her almost instantly, so of course she came right along with me."\n\n"Why, Grampa?"\n\n"I guess the developers had enough credit left over at the Trope Emporium after the uncle storyline that they couldn't resist throwing in the MISUNDERSTOOD NONCONFORMIST WHO JUST WANTS TO GET OUT OF THIS VILLAGE™ arc. The weirdest thing was, no matter how many times I tried to fling us both into the depths to escape this hellish part of the game, we'd just respawn and she'd keep burbling into my ear about every little thing as if nothing had happened."\n\n"She sounds annoying as ♥♥♥♥, Grampa."\n\n"She sure was, Susie. I could not wait to ditch her webby ♥♥♥, let me tell you. So anyway, I pressed on solo into these ice caves, only to find that the level design got so oblique that I had no ♥♥♥♥ing clue where I was meant to be going or why. Then there was this weird platforming section where I was meant to grapple across a series of cubes as they were falling, then something about stalactites, then I jumped up some more platforms, and then some more, and then some more. Oh, and I kept falling to my death and having to watch an obscenely long animation every time because it never occurred to anyone to hotkey in a command to restart from the last checkpoint. Then I jumped some more platforms, then I kept jumping the same platforms over and over and over and over—"\n\n"This story is boring, Grampa."\n\n"It sure is, Susie."\n\n"How does it end?"\n\n"Beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of me—I uninstalled it and went to play something else."\n\n"And you lived happily ever after?\n\n"Yeah whatever."","March 17","false","3.4"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","53","18","34","15","2"

I loved the grapple mechanic in Tribes Vengeance and it's story, even if it's multiplayer was weak. The grapple mechanic in this game is very good.

The power jump is delayed so you have to time your jumps instead of just "mash mash" to success like other games I have played.\nI have played a mod called "Call of the Fireflies", a singleplayer Crysis modification.\nWhat they did in this game with the visuals and design was close to that Crysis mod, but with power jumps and energy grapples!\nThe one thing I love about this game is that my 9 year old nephew can play it in that there are no guns and therefore no killing people or other things.\nIn a way, this game is much like portal, not in it's core game mechanic, but in the way it makes you think and solve problems without throwing ammunition at it.\nThank you for putting this title out and I hope so see competent sequels.\nOne thing I would love so see in a sequel is maybe a co-op version with more complex puzzles ...

Those scared of hieghts need not apply.\n\nThe story is presented as a tale from the unnamed player character after the events of the game. It starts off as a you begin searching for your uncle Fred in his house but instead find one of his "adventure suits" tailor made for you, and after you find a secret launch pad you get flung into space to follow the trail of crumbs he laid out for you. That's about as much of the story I feel ok with revealing as it is the games main focus and what I would guess something many people want to experience for themselves. Even though it was an aspect that I found thoroughly underwhelming.\n\nFrom a story perspective I just flat out didn't care what happened. The game pushes you towards a few characters the it presents, but due to a lack of investment it just comes off as a hollow experience. It didn't ever really feel like the gameplay moved the story along and instead felt like the story was there to take you to the next amazing vista or cavern. Which is a bit odd since the big marketing point for this game was its story. Heck, it's the title, but I would be more upset over this issue if the movement mechanics weren't so dang fun.\n\nAnd holy crap do I love the movement system. Seeing what next awesome view the game took me to, along with getting into more and more crazy platforming situations was easily the best part of ASAMU. The levels seem pretty linear at first but each one has a some room for exploration and each of the five brings something new to the table that allow you to explore them in different ways.\n\nYep, five levels. It's a short game, no way around that. I played the entire story in just about two hours and I imagine, for many will be the biggest issue when looking into buying it. At thirteen U.S. dollars the game probably sits a little outside the value range for most. It does try to add some replayability with a time trial and a few unlocks here and there, but even in these area's it feels like more missed potential. The time trial is nice but the imprecise nature of the grapple, something that isn't an issue in the story as you can quickly reset, just isn't as fun when put under a time requirement. And the unlocks from what I can see are just small cosmetics that may add a few giggles, but don't add much real value.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing A Story as short as it was, and even if the game just didn't follow through with some of the things it set out to do. The simply joyous nature of flying around the beautiful landscapes overcame those pitfalls. I would love to see the developers to more with this system even if it was a couple levels disconnected from the story entirely.\n\nIf what you've seen interests you then I would absolutely recommend it, but you may want to wait for a sale first.","May 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is charming, the gameplay is original, and the backgrounds are gorgeous.\n\nHowever, the game has some serious flaws. The character models came off as cheap and cartoony and seemed out of place. Up until I encountered one of the frog people I felt pretty immersed in the game... but they kind of pulled me out of it. Also, and this is probably my biggest issue with the game, the difficulty comes off as artificial. I like platformers that require quick reflexes and I also like games that require you to think through puzzles instead of just rushing through. This game unsuccessfully mixes the two. Progressing through the game requires a lot of trial and error. I found myself taking a lot of blind leaps just to see if I could grapple to an object in the distance. Some places that look accessible aren't. Some areas are hard to see and only become obviously visible after messing up a few times. So even after getting through a tough area...it just doesn't feel all that rewarding.\n\nEven with these flaws though, there's something about flying through giant glowing caverns that makes the game appealing enough to play. And like I said earlier, the story is quite charming. It's innocent without being childish or trivial. I probably wouldn't recommend it to the average gamer, but for those who enjoy platformers and are looking for something new, I'd say give it a shot.","September 12, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But first, the hate: so f'ing frustrating at times. I wanted to finish the game before doing a review, but with how the final level is going I'm not sure that will ever happen. The platforming difficult jumps randomly from comfortably challenging to annoying, sometimes within the same segment between checkpoints. Which is one of my other main gripes, the checkpoints are occasionally too spread out, which means constantly repeating an easy section (which was fun at first), because of failure on a difficult bit. This also makes it harder to get into the rhythm necessary for the more difficult area. My final complaint is that some places make it hard to tell where you're even supposed to be going. Trying to find our destination while flying through the air is not a good time.\n\nOn the plus side, most of the areas are gorgeous, and it's a pleasure to traverse them. The story is interesting, if not exactly mind-blowing. And the easier platforming sections are a joy to swing through, even if they take a few attempts. All-in-all, if you have patience and good hand/eye coordination, this is a small gem that's worth your time.","December 23, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The central mechanic of grappling onto surfaces is an interesting one and is rarely ever done well, yet A Story About My Uncle pulls it off flawlessley. The environent is beautiful and completely out of this world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetherus/recommended/278360/","Zetherus","∞ Koma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetherus/","165 products in account","A story about my uncle first came to my attention when I noticed two things from the trailer. It was a first person game without a gun in anywhere in sight, and  is that platforming? Usually when you mention Platforming,  you think of games like Mario, Mario, Mario, and Mario. Alright there's plenty of other platformers out there that aren't mario. Without mention mario again, there's Little big planet, supermeat boy, freerunners, Fez, Limbo, braid and "I wanna be that guy" take the cake for this generation of modern platformers. And fangames, can't forgot those.\n\nGames like these usually get one simple idea in your head in the first few minutes. "I'm dying alot..." Skill is the one thing  games like these demand, and of course trial and error. Which is what most games lack now a days, inorder to help sell their products, and I don't really blame them, but doesn't mean I have to like it. I expected more from an indie title and  unfortunately this is where "A Story About my Uncle falls victim to right off the bat, with the first and second part of the story. The game holds your hand as you try to complete the next jump, making it rather unchallenging about going through the first few levels. The idea of a well structed level design is there, its just excuted poorly, making me think either it was because they were lazy or in a rush. Or perhaps it was purely intentional, Because in the last act and level of the game, things finally do become somewhat challenging which I'll get to later.\n\nI'm a little kid again... thats what I first thought of myself as I was jumping and swinging around in the first few levels, but then the main characters narrative kept reminding that I'm in the past. I'm consstantly reminded that he's just telling a story to his kid inorder to help her fall asleep. The beginging of the game excuted my imagination as a kid fairly decent, only to be ruined by the questionable plot points in the story where things start to get a little ridicdious once you start to think about it, and the constant cut scenes where the main character starts talking, ruins and breaks the illusion that I'm playing as kid, when they could've just mentioned that part in beginging, only for me to forgot about it later.\n\nThe story is okay, nothing too complicated, it's simple and obivious by the beginging, and by the title of course. However towards the end, I felt alittle cheated as if I had gone through all that for a simple pat on the back, with some small uninteresting dialouge and being rushed home. Basiclly like having sex, and the person you're with telling you get off because they already finished before you and thus satisfied.\n\nNow I did enjoy the game to a degree, it was admitly fun having the ability to reach long distances with this suit that grants you Tarzan parcoring abilities without the climbing portion. The game failsto change things up enough with  the exception of one or two occasions was this idea taken further, the potenial for an even more fun and enjoyable level design was missed, you can only jump and swing from rock to rock for so long, While the setting may change, the basic simple now jump on this wall, now swing off these rocks becomes too repetitive, where at least in other games, the frequent  challenging levels is what keeps me or anyone coming back. And it finally did, in the third act. So much I almost raged at certain parts, but I was also happy because now they finally make it harder, more difficult. and  rage indusing. I remember remember dying a number of times at one point where I was asking myself do I suck or is the game finally starting to wake up. It had earlier but died down.\n\nYou only fight one boss in the game, which was a breeze, but I loved how it finally through me off from the repeititve level design that I had to endure until then. I would've like to have seen at least one or two more bosses, but one could suggest the final act was final boss.\n\nIn the end I feel the game could've had more to offer, but it just offered below my expectations. The games has achivements and side challanging yourself scenarios, but I could myself ask to make things harder on my own without being asked or suggested to.  I really appericate the developers and the folks behind this game for their effort and I wouldn't mind at all seeing what they come up with next. Hopefully next time it won't feel rushed, and it'll be game I and many other will always remmeber.                         3/5\n\nI'm neutral about recomending this, if its on sale get it, if not well there's other games out worth your time. Portal, Portal 2, the talos Principle and the much anticipated game from the creator of Braid, which I forgot the name of.","December 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Those scared of hieghts need not apply.\n\nThe story is presented as a tale from the unnamed player character after the events of the game. It starts off as a you begin searching for your uncle Fred in his house but instead find one of his "adventure suits" tailor made for you, and after you find a secret launch pad you get flung into space to follow the trail of crumbs he laid out for you. That's about as much of the story I feel ok with revealing as it is the games main focus and what I would guess something many people want to experience for themselves. Even though it was an aspect that I found thoroughly underwhelming.\n\nFrom a story perspective I just flat out didn't care what happened. The game pushes you towards a few characters the it presents, but due to a lack of investment it just comes off as a hollow experience. It didn't ever really feel like the gameplay moved the story along and instead felt like the story was there to take you to the next amazing vista or cavern. Which is a bit odd since the big marketing point for this game was its story. Heck, it's the title, but I would be more upset over this issue if the movement mechanics weren't so dang fun.\n\nAnd holy crap do I love the movement system. Seeing what next awesome view the game took me to, along with getting into more and more crazy platforming situations was easily the best part of ASAMU. The levels seem pretty linear at first but each one has a some room for exploration and each of the five brings something new to the table that allow you to explore them in different ways.\n\nYep, five levels. It's a short game, no way around that. I played the entire story in just about two hours and I imagine, for many will be the biggest issue when looking into buying it. At thirteen U.S. dollars the game probably sits a little outside the value range for most. It does try to add some replayability with a time trial and a few unlocks here and there, but even in these area's it feels like more missed potential. The time trial is nice but the imprecise nature of the grapple, something that isn't an issue in the story as you can quickly reset, just isn't as fun when put under a time requirement. And the unlocks from what I can see are just small cosmetics that may add a few giggles, but don't add much real value.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing A Story as short as it was, and even if the game just didn't follow through with some of the things it set out to do. The simply joyous nature of flying around the beautiful landscapes overcame those pitfalls. I would love to see the developers to more with this system even if it was a couple levels disconnected from the story entirely.\n\nIf what you've seen interests you then I would absolutely recommend it, but you may want to wait for a sale first.","May 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is quite interesting - definitely original as I haven't seen such a story in any other game - and the game leaves that nostalgic sensation after you finish it. Visuals are on a high level and so is the soundtrack. At the begging the game might seem a little bit difficult. But this level is kept through the whole game. It's a casual platform game with an interesting idea of using the grappling device as well as boosted jump and rocket shoes. What differentiates this game from majority of others is also that the environment is just beautiful. A few times I even stopped moving forward to just look around thinking ,wow'. The game is neatly made. I haven't encountered any bugs (you can eventually get stuck if you keep straying form the path but then you can just tap F7 to go back to previous checkpoint). There are some collectibles which unlock some options in the game and achievements here on Steam (they are very difficult to get though).\n\nOk. What are the cons then? I have found just one: the game is too short. Therefore I wouldn't really buy it for 13€ but as soon as it gets cheaper I totally recommend buying it.

A longer game would have supported the story too as you continuously stumble upon more villages, constantly hearing about how you just missed your uncle by a few days, adding an air of mystery around him.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NullandHoid/recommended/278360/","NullandHoid","Hoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NullandHoid/","324 products in account","A Story About My Uncle is a narrative driven first person platformer from gone north games and coffee stain studios. Those scared of hieghts need not apply.\n\nThe story is presented as a tale from the unnamed player character after the events of the game. It starts off as a you begin searching for your uncle Fred in his house but instead find one of his "adventure suits" tailor made for you, and after you find a secret launch pad you get flung into space to follow the trail of crumbs he laid out for you. That's about as much of the story I feel ok with revealing as it is the games main focus and what I would guess something many people want to experience for themselves. Even though it was an aspect that I found thoroughly underwhelming.\n\nFrom a story perspective I just flat out didn't care what happened. The game pushes you towards a few characters the it presents, but due to a lack of investment it just comes off as a hollow experience. It didn't ever really feel like the gameplay moved the story along and instead felt like the story was there to take you to the next amazing vista or cavern. Which is a bit odd since the big marketing point for this game was its story. Heck, it's the title, but I would be more upset over this issue if the movement mechanics weren't so dang fun.\n\nAnd holy crap do I love the movement system. Seeing what next awesome view the game took me to, along with getting into more and more crazy platforming situations was easily the best part of ASAMU. The levels seem pretty linear at first but each one has a some room for exploration and each of the five brings something new to the table that allow you to explore them in different ways.\n\nYep, five levels. It's a short game, no way around that. I played the entire story in just about two hours and I imagine, for many will be the biggest issue when looking into buying it. At thirteen U.S. dollars the game probably sits a little outside the value range for most. It does try to add some replayability with a time trial and a few unlocks here and there, but even in these area's it feels like more missed potential. The time trial is nice but the imprecise nature of the grapple, something that isn't an issue in the story as you can quickly reset, just isn't as fun when put under a time requirement. And the unlocks from what I can see are just small cosmetics that may add a few giggles, but don't add much real value.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing A Story as short as it was, and even if the game just didn't follow through with some of the things it set out to do. The simply joyous nature of flying around the beautiful landscapes overcame those pitfalls. I would love to see the developers to more with this system even if it was a couple levels disconnected from the story entirely.\n\nIf what you've seen interests you then I would absolutely recommend it, but you may want to wait for a sale first.","May 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This suit is equiped with something similar to Anti-Fall boots, and a very cool grappling hook. In the game you also find Rocket boots to add to the suit.

The art is gorgeous, the music that accompanies you on your adventure is soothing and the mechanics, which are simple to use, are introduced to you at a perfect pace. I'm only about twenty minutes into it and I can already tell some of these puzzles are going to stump me later on.  I'm having a lot of fun flying around.  No complaints as of yet.\n\n\nUPDATE: Now that I have played more I have realized that each of your grapples and jumps must be perfectly timed, especially in later levels where you must be extremely precise.   It was quite frustrating as the simplest misstep resulted in missing the target completely.  It's also important to note that if you're going for the achievements, be patient because if you make a mistake on a level, you will have to restart that level entirely.  An example is the "no fall" achievements. Personally, I am not a fan of these sort of achievements, including the time trial ones, but that's just me.

Some of the leaps and jumps can get quite tricky and take a second to work out exactly where you need to go. you get rocket boots mid-game that help a lot and the grapple, jumping plus the boots let you approach the terrain in different ways. I'm pretty sure I got through some levels in ways the game creators never designed them to be traversed. It sort of felt like cheating at times but also satisfying that you could think outside the box.\n\nThis isn't an action game and there is nothing to kill. If you are looking for that, look elsewhere. This game is played as part of you(a Dad) telling his daughter a bed time story. I played at night so when you save and quit you/the Dad says "it's getting late maybe we should continue tomorrow." which had its own kind of immersion for me as he was right it was getting late.\n\nThe story is quite simple and it has a few unanswered questions but it ties the jumping sections together and serves well enough to weave an interesting tale. This won't make GOTY anytime soon but it is enjoyable and what it does it does really well.","November 24, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its graphics are nice and the plot is set quite nice. Frustrating at times but a very nice game. The 20% Cooler refrence kinda put me off about the game now knowing that the game creator is a brony (no hate) but the game is really good but there was one million other jokes you could have made for that moment you had to make the 20% cooler reference XD or perhaps it was a coincidence. But to be honest i wouldnt have got this game without the coupon, even if i noticed it and it was kinda cool the 66% off was what made the game nice. And dont hate on the game too much it seems like it had alot of effort put into itand is a game that steam gives free coupons for it.\n\n10/10 -IGN Would drugs again","November 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I very much enjoyed this game that I got for my birthday, but it does have some flaws that hurt the immersion that makes the game so enjoyable.\n\nPros:\nGameplay is fun and moves at your own pace\nThe First Person View makes the flying through the air feel absolutely incredible\nThe environment textures are very good, making it feel like you're exploring real and awesome places\nCons:\nThe gameplay is very challenging at times, but for the most part the difficulty curve is linear\nThe First Person View can make it extremely difficult to find where you need to go. (Sometimes your can't find where you need to go at all and have to take a leap of faith)\nThe textures for the people lie somewhere in the uncanny valley\nThe dialogue is bad. The english is awkward and the voice acting is off. It doesn't sound like real conversation. When people start talking it snaps you right out of the feeling of exploring. Thankfully it's a small part of the game\nOverall, it's fun, moves at your own place, and feels amazing. It has its fair share of problems, but the game is still lots of fun even with them present.\n\nI would give it a 7.5/10","November 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amalicorn/recommended/278360/","amalicorn","SparklyChaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amalicorn/","66 products in account","A Story About My Uncle is a visually stunning first person, swing-type platformer where you as the protagonist must journey through an unknown world to find your uncle. This strange world is inhabited by these equally as strange anthopromorphic frog people, but only like four of them talk and only one is actually important.\n\nNow before you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that I really liked this game, it's just much easier for me to critisize than praise. Also ****Warning: There's going to be SPOILERS, especially near the end of the review.****\n\nSo first things first, this game is absolutely beautiful. The bright starry skies and glowing crystals and floating islands in general make this game very appealing to look at as you travel from place to place. The atmosphere that each location portays is pretty spot on, with the warm, bright yellows in the village and the dark, cold blues in the caves. I never got used to the scenery, every place I went I was astounded by the colors and expansiveness of the world, even in the ice caves where all the walls and platforms mixed in blues and blacks, the glowing crystals just made everything so alive.\n\nSecond, the frog people. They're not inceredibly appealing to look at, but it's to be expected, since, you know, they're frogs. I wish there could have been a lot more interaction with them, because it would have be really cool to hear their accounts of their lives in the caves or maybe how they came to know your uncle, to give him a little more characterization, but I suppose they weren't really the main point of the story. The first person you meet in a young frog girl named Madeline, though people always call her "Mad Maddie" (I actually have no idea why that is, even after finishing the game), who seems to be very close to your uncle, saying she's "known him all her life" even though he's only been gone for a couple of months. She's your generic 'I don't wanna stay in my hometown cause it's boring but no one will let me explore cause it's dangerous' character. I hated her, mostly cause she was annoying to me and follows you around for the half the game, but she's not actually that bad. Just a little underdeveloped, like a lot of other things.\n\nNow, ASAMU is supposed to be praised for it's story, but I honestly see it more for the puzzles and visuals.; the story is actually pretty lackluster. And the ending, wow, I did not like the ending. So you fly and fall your way all the way through the crazy, difficult-to-navigate, challenging world, dying about 300 times, just for your uncle to tell you he's staying there and he's going to send you home. Honestly, it's so plain and badly planned, I would compare it to the ending of Firewatch. But, unlike Firewatch, this ending more or less to be expected, since nothing was ever built up throughout the game. You just travelled from place to place to find out that your uncle had gone somewhere else.\n\nThere's a lot of mysteries and questions that go unanswered in this game. Like, what's the point of the weird symbol language? And what was with that weird fish monster thing? And why was there a dead whale on the floor of the ice caves?!? The game left off on a weird note, with the cliche "and you never saw him again, " and it kind of makes you question why you played it in the first place.\n\nAgain, this is not supposed to be a bad review, but it's ending up like that, sorry.\n\nSo, to wrap this up I'll say, wait for it to go on sale. The game itself is only about 3 hours long, and there isn't much to explore beyond the striaght path so the most you could end up with is proably 4-4.5 hours. If you don't like challenging, limited-range platformers with easy stories, then don't get the game. It's no Tale of Two Brothers, or, hell, Firewatch proabably had a more extensive story, so if your expecting that, then wait for a really really good sale, or just don't get it.\n\nBut, if you like difficult platforming with amazing graphics and a plot that's only there to give you a reason for your journey, then this game is what you want.\n","March 19","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(goes from 60-120, I played it at 100 just fine.)\n\nNeutral:\n* completed it in about 4 to 4.5 hours. Probably could have gotten through it in 3 if I wasn't screwing around so much.\n* seemed that there were multiple ways to get through several of the levels.\n* no map or minimap, easy to get lost and not know where to go, but more realistic I guess.\n* need a mouse and keyboard to play. it's a precision first person shooter/action platformer, you need to be able to make fast and accurate shots to the next grapple area while freefalling down.\n* mouse acceleration on by default, but easy to turn off in the options.\n* the game gets dark and hard to see sometimes, but makes for a great appeal when you fall down to the dark abyss after you miss a grapple. Adjustable gamma in options, but that's not enough.\n* graphics options are just acceptable imo. ( https://i.imgur.com/RO5WWnQ.jpg )\n\nCons:\n* not too much replayability (aside from trying to complete the levels faster/with fewer hooks)\n* there were several times I got confused and had no idea where I was going or where the next objective was. Several times I just jumped off the cliff without knowing where the next grapple spot was.\n* one time during the story, your "double jump" gets arbitrarily broken and unusable, only to get fixed in the next zone.\n* there is no obvious way to make a followup. The way the game ends makes it obvious that it's a standalone game, which is a shame, I want to explore more of the wonderful world that they built and fly around in the air more.\n\nIt's a great little piece that more people should play. Perhaps not at the full ($13-ish), but if you pick it up for $4 or less, then absolutely get it. It's gone down to $2 a few times on other sites (check isthereanydeal) and for that price you can't afford to not get this game.","January 13","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can take advantage of a power suit to navigate the five bizarre areas the story will take you to in the roughly four hours of gameplay.\nThe main beef of A Story About My Uncle is indeed Fred's power suit and the various moves you can pull off with it: you can jump to greater heights, sprint, resist great falls, dash in mid-air thanks to a pair of rocket boots and use an energy beam to hook upon certain surfaces and cover large distances. The game makes a good job and introducing the different mechanics gradually and offers a steady increase in challenge as you go on.\nWhile the title does have a story of its own (and a rather good one at that) and introduces few characters to you, the interation with the NPCs is minimal (save for two major characters): what really drags A Story About My Uncle is the platforming and the tale is told mainly in-between the various sections. The game primary appeal is the scenary: the environment is especially rich in design and always plentifully detailed, reaching scenary porn more than once.\nApart from the main story, you are given a time trial mode and a hunt for collectables around the areas you visit, which unlock mainly cosmetic goodies.\nA Story About My Uncle is a little gem of a game, both very entertaining to play and plesant to look at that.

A Story About My Uncle is one of those that was literally made for speedrunning and it does have a time trial mode. Searching for the best shortcuts and choosing the best moves to overcome certain obstacles, planning and executing the perfect run is much more exhilirating than the basic gameplay. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you can significantly stretch the 3-5 hour average playtime. On the downside, there's only a handful of maps so you can grow bored with it pretty quickly.\n\nNow, I'm rather bad at platforming so it probably took me significantly longer to play through the game than almost everybody else and there were a few times I had trouble navigating myself through the 3D environment as well as a few times when I knew what I had to do but had difficulty executing it. All that sprinting, jumping and basically flying can be very exhilirating but since there isn't any other aspect to the gameplay (except the speedrunning potential), you may feel unmotivated to get through the more difficult/annoying bits. If there were other puzzles and a more extensive (and compelling) story, it would be an epic game. As it is, it feels more like a promo.\n\nI probably don't have to mention that this game is simply gorgeous. Yes, the quality of the surroundings and of the NPC models seems rather incongruous but the overall impression doesn't suffer from it much.\n\nThe story could have been interesting if they developed it a bit more. As it is, I feel it's only there so you wouldn't be swinging through otherwordly caverns just for the hell of it.

Well, additionally to that, there were some noticeable bugs and the "People" you meet (pretty early in the game) are... well... ugly as hell. The graphic of the surrounding areas etc. is amazing (Especially because of the great level/world-design), it's just the character models (and animations). But well, why do I rate this game as good? It's pretty buggy and "unfinished" and only pretty, you could say.\n\nWell, first of all, this game offers amazing gameplay and an unique experience. It truly offers a journey, a journey in a new world, where you have to search your uncle. The story is good (but pretty predictable), the setting is very good, and the few dialogues that exist are at least believable. Except the last one, but adding information here would be a spoiler for the already short story.\nPlus: This game offers options for speedrunning (Tracking your time and a level choice after beating it). Still, to be honest, this game is not worth 13 € in my opinion. Get this game when the price is reduced, or if you are into amazing experiences, or if you are a really ambitious type of human being.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend anyone who could think he likes it, to get it, when it's price is reduced by 50% or more. This is an amazing game, but too short.","August 25, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is fairly short so keep that in mind in relation to the price its at (its been on sale a couple of times). Some of the leaps and jumps can get quite tricky and take a second to work out exactly where you need to go. you get rocket boots mid-game that help a lot and the grapple, jumping plus the boots let you approach the terrain in different ways. I'm pretty sure I got through some levels in ways the game creators never designed them to be traversed. It sort of felt like cheating at times but also satisfying that you could think outside the box.\n\nThis isn't an action game and there is nothing to kill. If you are looking for that, look elsewhere. This game is played as part of you(a Dad) telling his daughter a bed time story. I played at night so when you save and quit you/the Dad says "it's getting late maybe we should continue tomorrow." which had its own kind of immersion for me as he was right it was getting late.\n\nThe story is quite simple and it has a few unanswered questions but it ties the jumping sections together and serves well enough to weave an interesting tale.

A Story About My Uncle, is one of these modern art installation games, but features actually challenging gameplay in the form of 1st person platforming. The game has a bunch of really well made movement mechanics, which I won't explain in detail because they are very fun to discover along the story.\n\nI said beautiful before, and I meant the graphics too. Really nice art style, atmospheric environments, every chapter has its own distinct look and they are very enjoyable to look at. The beauty is also in the narration, the spoken lines of the narrator are good stuff, and they help you along this adventure. There are also many subtle things going on in the game world, relating to the story, for example: you can encounter lines of text written in a weird language, which you can learn to translate yourself. I recommend figuring things out, it really is worth it. Going into detail would once again spoil the experience.\n\nI'm one of those people who enjoy experiencing visual stories, even without actual gameplay mechanics, but I know some people really don't like such experiences (e.g. Dear Esther). I strongly recommend this game to anyone who didn't like Dear Esther because of the lack of gameplay mechanics, I think this is a game that has what you were looking for.\n\nGo on an adventure, play A Story About My Uncle, figure things out and overcome the platforming challenges, in the end you might be surprised by how beautiful this story is.","December 30, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a mixture of Puzzle, Jump n Run and to some extend, First Person Shooters, none of these are among my favored game genres, "A Story about my uncle" captivated me regardless.\nThe game seems to revolt around the idea of moving onward in a wold where you can't see the ground bellow the flying stones, and the creators executed the idea well.\nWhile I admit there are certainly some flaws in the game design, such as ocasionally not knowing which way to move onward to, not making a leap because the stone that was supposed to guide your way slowed you down or even blocking your view of the next step on your journey, it is overall an incredibly fun and forgiving game. Even if you, like me, love to take a moment and just look at your surroundings and take in the little details that the creators strew around everywhere, you will take a lot of joy from the details this game has to offer.","January 1","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it's heavily flawed\ntl;dr - Good game, could be better, a bit frustrating, but short and fun enough. 10/10.\n\n\nEver heard of a physics-based game with a broken physics engine? Well, now you have!\nHitting walls makes you bounce off them, which is the single most annoying problem this game could have.\n\nFor example - sometimes, the game gives you very small opportunity windows to hit rocks with the grappling beam, and when you do hit them, you fly straight into them, which results in hitting them and flying backwards or simply stopping, resulting in getting to the next stone impossible, and having to repeat the same sequence many times. Also,  Using the rocket boots slows you down after the initial boost, what the hell?\n\nAside of that, gameplay wise, some of the puzzles are not intuitive at all and are quite frustrating, most of the time it's really hard to see where you're supposed to go, forcing you to fail multiple times for no reason before you actually see the path.\nIt feels as if whoever made this game tried too hard to be innovative while challenging the player at some areas but completely missed the point, this game is way harder than it should be.\n\nGood thing is, it's still REALLY fun to play, all of the problems I stated ARE frustrating, but the concept of the game and the fact that in the end it's all solveable are good enough to enjoy it, in addition, this game is short and yet ends exactly in the right spot (took me about 3 hours), not too long, not too short.\n\n\nGraphics wise, this game is phenomenal, even when running on my machine which is based on a simple intel graphics cards, the world is beautiful and colorful and fun to stop and look at when possible. However, at some points its acting a bit weird, but since it could only be on my machine I cannot judge it.\n\nStorywise there isn't much to say - it's a sweet and fun adventure, not much background to it, but it's okay, because it doesn't need to be much, it's nice and simple, my only complaint is on the voice acting, especially the narrator's, the man almost sounds like one of those computer generated voices.\n\nIn conclusion - I feel like this game could have been 10 times better, the main idea is wonderful, but the devil is in the details, it feels somewhat unfinished, not polished, as if something is missing, but it's still a good game as it is, I don't recommend buying it for full price, get it on a sale and have a short fun adventure.\n\nSidenote - the achievements system on this one is a bit too much, could I at least get an achievement for completing the game? :P","March 5","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When it works, it's amazing, but sometimes the physics seem arbitrary and there are some sections that are immeasurably frustrating.  I didn't quite rage-quit, but I did have to take a break on multiple occasions.\nEven though I finished the game, I'm not very good at it; I think this is the first game I've beaten yet managed not to earn a single achievement.

It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the whole game (just main story, I didn't go through collecting or exploring everything I could have). The atmosphere is very calm and serene, and the gameplay is pretty fun. If you like platformers, you'll enjoy the gameplay - while simplistic, it does make the best use of your abilities and having to chain them together to get past obstacles. The story isn't super deep; it just kind of guides you through, and it is one of those 'heartwarming' ones in a way. There were a few parts of gameplay where I found it to be pretty frustrating with chaining the grappling hook onto jumps to land just right, but there were only about two of those parts. Otherwise, a very nice and calm experience.

However, it's heavily flawed\ntl;dr - Good game, could be better, a bit frustrating, but short and fun enough. 10/10.\n\n\nEver heard of a physics-based game with a broken physics engine? Well, now you have!\nHitting walls makes you bounce off them, which is the single most annoying problem this game could have.\n\nFor example - sometimes, the game gives you very small opportunity windows to hit rocks with the grappling beam, and when you do hit them, you fly straight into them, which results in hitting them and flying backwards or simply stopping, resulting in getting to the next stone impossible, and having to repeat the same sequence many times. Also,  Using the rocket boots slows you down after the initial boost, what the hell?\n\nAside of that, gameplay wise, some of the puzzles are not intuitive at all and are quite frustrating, most of the time it's really hard to see where you're supposed to go, forcing you to fail multiple times for no reason before you actually see the path.\nIt feels as if whoever made this game tried too hard to be innovative while challenging the player at some areas but completely missed the point, this game is way harder than it should be.\n\nGood thing is, it's still REALLY fun to play, all of the problems I stated ARE frustrating, but the concept of the game and the fact that in the end it's all solveable are good enough to enjoy it, in addition, this game is short and yet ends exactly in the right spot (took me about 3 hours), not too long, not too short.\n\n\nGraphics wise, this game is phenomenal, even when running on my machine which is based on a simple intel graphics cards, the world is beautiful and colorful and fun to stop and look at when possible. However, at some points its acting a bit weird, but since it could only be on my machine I cannot judge it.\n\nStorywise there isn't much to say - it's a sweet and fun adventure, not much background to it, but it's okay, because it doesn't need to be much, it's nice and simple, my only complaint is on the voice acting, especially the narrator's, the man almost sounds like one of those computer generated voices.\n\nIn conclusion - I feel like this game could have been 10 times better, the main idea is wonderful, but the devil is in the details, it feels somewhat unfinished, not polished, as if something is missing, but it's still a good game as it is, I don't recommend buying it for full price, get it on a sale and have a short fun adventure.\n\nSidenote - the achievements system on this one is a bit too much, could I at least get an achievement for completing the game? :P","March 5","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead I got a surprisingly heartfelt game with a fun premise. The narraration was top notch, and the interactions between the father telling the story and his listening daughter often made me chuckle. The game's mechanics are also pretty excellent. They take a couple minutes of getting used to, but pretty soon you'll be zipping from platform to platform with ease.

Being a mixture of Puzzle, Jump n Run and to some extend, First Person Shooters, none of these are among my favored game genres, "A Story about my uncle" captivated me regardless.\nThe game seems to revolt around the idea of moving onward in a wold where you can't see the ground bellow the flying stones, and the creators executed the idea well.\nWhile I admit there are certainly some flaws in the game design, such as ocasionally not knowing which way to move onward to, not making a leap because the stone that was supposed to guide your way slowed you down or even blocking your view of the next step on your journey, it is overall an incredibly fun and forgiving game. Even if you, like me, love to take a moment and just look at your surroundings and take in the little details that the creators strew around everywhere, you will take a lot of joy from the details this game has to offer.","January 1","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I say this because within the game you will come across quite a bit of jumping segments that will challenge you and make you think about what move's you need to make.\n\nThe story\nThe story for this amazing game is that you are a father of a little girl who wishes to hear a story about a adventure because she cannot go to sleep. Thus the name of the title. As it begins with you finding out that your uncle has gone missing for months without any note or notice. Walking around you find a Bionic suit and glove that give you the ability to Jump higher, and stretch you jumps out longer. And you decide to go on a Journey for your missing Uncle.\n\nLength\nTo be honest it took me 4 - 5 hours to complete the story. After completing the story you are given time attack mode where you must beat sections of the story's area's in a limited amount of time which could give people who actually want to do this about a lot more of time with the game but in the end might not be attempted at all by most people. And this is a quite a problem for most people. Because to my opinion The game is great, has a strong story and has some amazing gameplay. But the price point is a bit over the top for this game. In my opinion I would wait for when it is on special to get the game. (Yes i got it on a discount if your are wondering).\n\nOverallThis game is something special in a way. It is fun, sweet at time's, emotional, challenging, and overall a great experience. I would recommend to anyone that wants to try something new. But like I have said before in this review, with what price it is on sale for I would wait till it is at least on a discount.","February 29","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it's heavily flawed\ntl;dr - Good game, could be better, a bit frustrating, but short and fun enough. 10/10.\n\n\nEver heard of a physics-based game with a broken physics engine? Well, now you have!\nHitting walls makes you bounce off them, which is the single most annoying problem this game could have.\n\nFor example - sometimes, the game gives you very small opportunity windows to hit rocks with the grappling beam, and when you do hit them, you fly straight into them, which results in hitting them and flying backwards or simply stopping, resulting in getting to the next stone impossible, and having to repeat the same sequence many times. Also,  Using the rocket boots slows you down after the initial boost, what the hell?\n\nAside of that, gameplay wise, some of the puzzles are not intuitive at all and are quite frustrating, most of the time it's really hard to see where you're supposed to go, forcing you to fail multiple times for no reason before you actually see the path.\nIt feels as if whoever made this game tried too hard to be innovative while challenging the player at some areas but completely missed the point, this game is way harder than it should be.\n\nGood thing is, it's still REALLY fun to play, all of the problems I stated ARE frustrating, but the concept of the game and the fact that in the end it's all solveable are good enough to enjoy it, in addition, this game is short and yet ends exactly in the right spot (took me about 3 hours), not too long, not too short.\n\n\nGraphics wise, this game is phenomenal, even when running on my machine which is based on a simple intel graphics cards, the world is beautiful and colorful and fun to stop and look at when possible. However, at some points its acting a bit weird, but since it could only be on my machine I cannot judge it.\n\nStorywise there isn't much to say - it's a sweet and fun adventure, not much background to it, but it's okay, because it doesn't need to be much, it's nice and simple, my only complaint is on the voice acting, especially the narrator's, the man almost sounds like one of those computer generated voices.\n\nIn conclusion - I feel like this game could have been 10 times better, the main idea is wonderful, but the devil is in the details, it feels somewhat unfinished, not polished, as if something is missing, but it's still a good game as it is, I don't recommend buying it for full price, get it on a sale and have a short fun adventure.\n\nSidenote - the achievements system on this one is a bit too much, could I at least get an achievement for completing the game? :P","March 5","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TribalHARRY/recommended/278360/","TribalHARRY","TribalHARRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TribalHARRY/","77 products in account","A Story About my Uncle is a lovely little game that will occupy your afternoon.\n\nThe game is basically narrated by a father telling his daughter a bedtime story about the fathers Uncle, Fred. The story is narrated as you play through it. You start off in Fred’s house, you make your way upstairs and there’s a funny looking suit made to fit you. You put it on only to find a ‘waste disposal’ platform. After activating it, you are transported to a distant land of frog people and floating islands.\n\nThe gameplay is very enjoyable (what little there is of it unfortunately). You use your grapple and jump abilities to move from island to island, upgrading your grapple and eventually even getting a pair of rocket boots you can use to fly with. You then move on to increasingly difficult levels to find your Uncle as you tell your daughter the story. The narration and story are a sort of background so that the player doesn’t feel like they’re on an LSD trip, flying through floating islands. It does add to the game, but not significantly enough for you to really care. It’s a nice addition, but mainly there so it’s not a silent jumping game with another mute protagonist.\n\nOverall the game was very enjoyable. The playstyle is something that is relatively new to me and very arcade-esk. There are also little collectables that unlock certain modes (such as goat mode, but I’ll let you find out what that is) and time trials. I feel though, that this game could’ve benefited from a workshop feature so that people could create their own levels and share them with the community. This would’ve changed it from a 3-4 hour game, to a 15-20 hour game if you enjoyed it. But unfortunately this was not to be.\n\nYes you heard correct, the game is only around 3 hours long. However, if you are a completionist, you may be looking at a bit more as the achievements are extremely difficult to earn. Would I say this game is worth it? Yes, but not for £10. I purchased this from EBay for 99p, and for that it is a fantastic game.\n\nIn short, really enjoyable, too short, could’ve benefitted from a Steam workshop to add to the games length and diversity.\n\nTribalHARRY","February 29","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes it seems a little bit unpolished, but it sure is crafted with love. This is one of that stories that dwell in the back of your mind after you finish the game. Puzzles exellently alternate between slow-paced calculation and fast-paced action. They are not that hard, but can be challenging, especially if you want them to. Controls are not very tight and collisions are weird sometimes, but mechanics still feel good.\n\nIn summary: great story, nice narrative, stunning visuals, and breathtaking experience of jumping really high, running really fast, flying, falling and swinging.

A Story About My Uncle, is one of these modern art installation games, but features actually challenging gameplay in the form of 1st person platforming. The game has a bunch of really well made movement mechanics, which I won't explain in detail because they are very fun to discover along the story.\n\nI said beautiful before, and I meant the graphics too. Really nice art style, atmospheric environments, every chapter has its own distinct look and they are very enjoyable to look at. The beauty is also in the narration, the spoken lines of the narrator are good stuff, and they help you along this adventure. There are also many subtle things going on in the game world, relating to the story, for example: you can encounter lines of text written in a weird language, which you can learn to translate yourself. I recommend figuring things out, it really is worth it. Going into detail would once again spoil the experience.\n\nI'm one of those people who enjoy experiencing visual stories, even without actual gameplay mechanics, but I know some people really don't like such experiences (e.g. Dear Esther). I strongly recommend this game to anyone who didn't like Dear Esther because of the lack of gameplay mechanics, I think this is a game that has what you were looking for.\n\nGo on an adventure, play A Story About My Uncle, figure things out and overcome the platforming challenges, in the end you might be surprised by how beautiful this story is.","December 30, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a mixture of Puzzle, Jump n Run and to some extend, First Person Shooters, none of these are among my favored game genres, "A Story about my uncle" captivated me regardless.\nThe game seems to revolt around the idea of moving onward in a wold where you can't see the ground bellow the flying stones, and the creators executed the idea well.\nWhile I admit there are certainly some flaws in the game design, such as ocasionally not knowing which way to move onward to, not making a leap because the stone that was supposed to guide your way slowed you down or even blocking your view of the next step on your journey, it is overall an incredibly fun and forgiving game. Even if you, like me, love to take a moment and just look at your surroundings and take in the little details that the creators strew around everywhere, you will take a lot of joy from the details this game has to offer.","January 1","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game-feel is also pretty good which helps make the platforming really fun.\n\nWhile the graphical fidelity is not exactly state-of-the-art, the art style more than makes up for it.\nThe environments and scenery are beautiful from begining to end. It's only when the story sections appear with in-game animated characters that you remember that this is a low budget game.

A good idea just waiting for somebody to make it great. Get it for the idea and experience, nothing else.\n\nLonger review\nThis is indie as it gets. Visually different, story is a interesting, the mechanics are wonderfull....but thats it, there is no real hook to the game. I mean, there is a point to the game, but I personaly found that this should be played in 15-30 min bursts max, as it just gets repetative and boring.\n\nThe main issues I have with this game are:\n\nDirection. you will wonder where to go many times and quit the game because of that, as many many times, the path just wont be obvious.\n\nMechanics. They are a great idea, I love them, but the execution is really lacking and could use a few more features, most importantly, better physics, as that would solve 90% of the issues I have with thegame, as the current way is ok in the begining, but is just too basic to use in the later stages.\n\nThese are the 2 main reasons this game is not a hit, but they are a relativelysimple thing to fix, as everything else is there.\n\nBut, despite all that, I will recommend the game simply on the basis, that these mechanics ned more work being put into them and in a different game.","November 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, additionally to that, there were some noticeable bugs and the "People" you meet (pretty early in the game) are... well... ugly as hell. The graphic of the surrounding areas etc. is amazing (Especially because of the great level/world-design), it's just the character models (and animations). But well, why do I rate this game as good? It's pretty buggy and "unfinished" and only pretty, you could say.\n\nWell, first of all, this game offers amazing gameplay and an unique experience. It truly offers a journey, a journey in a new world, where you have to search your uncle. The story is good (but pretty predictable), the setting is very good, and the few dialogues that exist are at least believable. Except the last one, but adding information here would be a spoiler for the already short story.\nPlus: This game offers options for speedrunning (Tracking your time and a level choice after beating it). Still, to be honest, this game is not worth 13 € in my opinion. Get this game when the price is reduced, or if you are into amazing experiences, or if you are a really ambitious type of human being.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend anyone who could think he likes it, to get it, when it's price is reduced by 50% or more. This is an amazing game, but too short.","August 25, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/278360/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","ASAMU is a game with great movement mechanics and wonderful environments.\n\nThe game plays as an older you narrates your younger self as you go on an adventure to find your uncle. The narration, and in fact all voices in this game, are very well done.\n\nThe game is played using a series of jumps [with jump boosts] and grapples to navigate floating islands. Think of it kind of like mirrors edge with a grappling gun. The level design provides enough of a challenge for the game to not be boring, but not so difficult that it gets in the way of the story. However, If you are after something trickier, then see the achievment list for some harder challenges.\n\nI played this game with a keyboard and mouse. The store says it supports controllers, but I seriously wouldn't reccomend even trying that, as this game will require very precise movements that will be impossible unless you are very skilled with a controller.\n\nThe graphics on the environments are wonderful in this game, and the accompanying soundtrack adds lots to the experience. The vistas in this game are also beautiful, especially the ones where you can see the landscape with the sky in the background. The character design of the "frog people" is a bit questionable if you look too closely, but frankly I don't see any way that you could make "frog people" look nice. The developers did a good attempt at it, though.\n\nI didn't have any trouble installing or running the game, but I did find that in certain areas of the levels, it seems as if the designers didn't realise you could reach there and you kind of "shift through" the environment. Luckily, you don't fall all the way through. Most of the game is linear, but in such a way that it looks pretty open, and you wont encounter this problem unless you go right to the edge islands of the levels.\n\nThe only major gripe I have with this game is that it is very short. I wish they had perhaps extended the story somewhat, rather than ending it where they did, but that doesn't affect my enjoyment of the story that there is in any way. You should buy this game if you like parkour running styles [albeit with a grappling hook], and you'll get a nice story narrated while you play.","April 3, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meltron/recommended/278360/","Meltron","Meltron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meltron/","103 products in account","In short: If you want a nice looking platformer with very cool movement mechanics and a sweet little story, then the only thing you have to decide, is, whether whatever you have to pay for this game is worth the about 4 hours of gameplay.\n\nGot this for around 4 euros. I would say for that price, it is okay.\nDon't know if I would regret buying this for more, since it only is around 4 hours and I would say that I really spend my time on this game (or messed up parts multiple times ^^).\nGraphic is not over the top of course, but still beautiful for such a 'small' game, with an incredible view of field and some epic environments, altough nothing isn't really gonna blow your mind. The graphic really lives from its beautiful lightning, and it has some great details that often make  you want to jump on some more of those floating islands and see what nice little building they made there. Unfortunately, there are also many island that just look the same. Character design is nice as well, but besides the two main characters, they mostly jsut sit somewhere and do noting and react to nothing.\nPerformance was excellent the entire time, never dropped below of 60 fps for me.\nThe mechanics are very easy to learn and make this game a lot of fun. You will soon feel like a boss flying through the air and with time goes by, there even will be more useful and unique additional ones.\nIn the levels, it is not always excactly clear where you have to go, but you mostly find out easely. This could be intentionally, since you can use different  movement methods for most of the level parts which will slightly vary your ways.  However, even when you have quit some freedom on what of the devices you want to use, there is basically always only one path, since you mostly just jump on different rocks or islands. Nonetheless, the level design is great and this way you never wonder for too long where you have to go.\nThe story is nice and simple, but again, nothing that will flash you away. The game knows how to set up a very friendly atmospehre in the villages and even has quiet a  few parts where some horror feeling comes up. But the villagers are quiet static as I have said before, and also in the spookier parts, you never really get soaked into these emotions. I what I want to say is that the story and atmosphere is nice and with some cool details, but overall, it just does not have much depth.\nE.g. you spend the whole game searching for your uncle and don't know what the hell happened to him. But that alreay is all the drama in this game and spoiler alert, at the end he never wasn't in any real trouble. Not that this is such a big deal, but this game could have so much more great tension with just a little bit more dramatic story. There was one single part in the whole game, where you had to get past some scary worm monster thing wihtout it seeing you. But when you made it, that basically is all the game had to offer for a conflict or 'boss fight' as well.\n\nIn conclusion:\nNice graphics, sweet story and good level desgin. But all in all, the atmosphere/ the story could have been so much better and the game is quiet short. After all, the great movement mechanics are what make this game really fun for some hours.\nP.S.: Costum maps could significantly lengthen the hours of fun.","May 12","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TribalHARRY/recommended/278360/","TribalHARRY","TribalHARRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TribalHARRY/","77 products in account","A Story About my Uncle is a lovely little game that will occupy your afternoon.\n\nThe game is basically narrated by a father telling his daughter a bedtime story about the fathers Uncle, Fred. The story is narrated as you play through it. You start off in Fred’s house, you make your way upstairs and there’s a funny looking suit made to fit you. You put it on only to find a ‘waste disposal’ platform. After activating it, you are transported to a distant land of frog people and floating islands.\n\nThe gameplay is very enjoyable (what little there is of it unfortunately). You use your grapple and jump abilities to move from island to island, upgrading your grapple and eventually even getting a pair of rocket boots you can use to fly with. You then move on to increasingly difficult levels to find your Uncle as you tell your daughter the story. The narration and story are a sort of background so that the player doesn’t feel like they’re on an LSD trip, flying through floating islands. It does add to the game, but not significantly enough for you to really care. It’s a nice addition, but mainly there so it’s not a silent jumping game with another mute protagonist.\n\nOverall the game was very enjoyable. The playstyle is something that is relatively new to me and very arcade-esk. There are also little collectables that unlock certain modes (such as goat mode, but I’ll let you find out what that is) and time trials. I feel though, that this game could’ve benefited from a workshop feature so that people could create their own levels and share them with the community. This would’ve changed it from a 3-4 hour game, to a 15-20 hour game if you enjoyed it. But unfortunately this was not to be.\n\nYes you heard correct, the game is only around 3 hours long. However, if you are a completionist, you may be looking at a bit more as the achievements are extremely difficult to earn. Would I say this game is worth it? Yes, but not for £10. I purchased this from EBay for 99p, and for that it is a fantastic game.\n\nIn short, really enjoyable, too short, could’ve benefitted from a Steam workshop to add to the games length and diversity.\n\nTribalHARRY","February 29","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other times, the grapple will refuse to connect if I have been clever and shot past where the game expects me to grapple first, seeming to only connect if I've already hit the previous contact point first.

It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the whole game (just main story, I didn't go through collecting or exploring everything I could have). The atmosphere is very calm and serene, and the gameplay is pretty fun. If you like platformers, you'll enjoy the gameplay - while simplistic, it does make the best use of your abilities and having to chain them together to get past obstacles. The story isn't super deep; it just kind of guides you through, and it is one of those 'heartwarming' ones in a way. There were a few parts of gameplay where I found it to be pretty frustrating with chaining the grappling hook onto jumps to land just right, but there were only about two of those parts. Otherwise, a very nice and calm experience. If you're looking to spend an afternoon playing a game, this is a great one to pickup and enjoy.","March 12","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would say for that price, it is okay.\nDon't know if I would regret buying this for more, since it only is around 4 hours and I would say that I really spend my time on this game (or messed up parts multiple times ^^).\nGraphic is not over the top of course, but still beautiful for such a 'small' game, with an incredible view of field and some epic environments, altough nothing isn't really gonna blow your mind. The graphic really lives from its beautiful lightning, and it has some great details that often make  you want to jump on some more of those floating islands and see what nice little building they made there. Unfortunately, there are also many island that just look the same. Character design is nice as well, but besides the two main characters, they mostly jsut sit somewhere and do noting and react to nothing.\nPerformance was excellent the entire time, never dropped below of 60 fps for me.\nThe mechanics are very easy to learn and make this game a lot of fun. You will soon feel like a boss flying through the air and with time goes by, there even will be more useful and unique additional ones.\nIn the levels, it is not always excactly clear where you have to go, but you mostly find out easely. This could be intentionally, since you can use different  movement methods for most of the level parts which will slightly vary your ways.  However, even when you have quit some freedom on what of the devices you want to use, there is basically always only one path, since you mostly just jump on different rocks or islands. Nonetheless, the level design is great and this way you never wonder for too long where you have to go.\nThe story is nice and simple, but again, nothing that will flash you away. The game knows how to set up a very friendly atmospehre in the villages and even has quiet a  few parts where some horror feeling comes up. But the villagers are quiet static as I have said before, and also in the spookier parts, you never really get soaked into these emotions. I what I want to say is that the story and atmosphere is nice and with some cool details, but overall, it just does not have much depth.\nE.g. you spend the whole game searching for your uncle and don't know what the hell happened to him. But that alreay is all the drama in this game and spoiler alert, at the end he never wasn't in any real trouble. Not that this is such a big deal, but this game could have so much more great tension with just a little bit more dramatic story. There was one single part in the whole game, where you had to get past some scary worm monster thing wihtout it seeing you. But when you made it, that basically is all the game had to offer for a conflict or 'boss fight' as well.\n\nIn conclusion:\nNice graphics, sweet story and good level desgin. But all in all, the atmosphere/ the story could have been so much better and the game is quiet short. After all, the great movement mechanics are what make this game really fun for some hours.\nP.S.: Costum maps could significantly lengthen the hours of fun.","May 12","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The core mechanic of the game is how you traverse the vast distances you need to navigate by using what looks like a Nintendo Power Glove that functions as a tractor beam hookshot. This is a very fun way to get around, but some segments of the game can be frustrating to get through using this system. The story is serviceable enough, about a boy who is searching for his lost explorer/scientist uncle, using the technology that he left behind. I'm not sure why it was necessary to frame the story as the boy all grown up, telling about his adventure to his daughter, but that works fine, too. I liked playing this but I have to say, this is the only game I have ever played on Steam (that I liked and played through to the end) where I found the great majority of the achievements just not worth getting because the effort just seemed to be not worth the payoff.

You are drawn to all the light you see and that is brilliant and the lighting with all the delicious colors are magnificent!\n\nI really enjoyed the moment I unlocked the Beam Color and I put it to red..

XD\n\nThe story is sweet and its nice to see a game that is really just about the exploration without being about killing 500 generic enemies running towards you. I like those games too but it’s so common these days just to mash that in a game.. This game actually shows you can do it without the killing and the fighting and still be fun and challenging experience.\n\nYou should really play this game!

The script itself is awkward and the voice acting doesn't help. None of the voice acting sounds natural.  The movement of the characters also look rigid and un-natural. The full story just felt uninspired as well; not bad per se but it felt like they just had a vague idea and just built off of it, as is evident with Maggy (one of the three characters in the whole thing) just being a huge stereotype. Overall, the story and all things related to it just make me uncomfortable and detract from the gameplay.\n\nSo what about the gameplay? "Eh." Jumping around and grappling from flying rock thing to flying rock thing is fun. There is no getting around that. The big problem is some of the parts seem oddly unforgiving. Jumping from thing to thing is fun, but once you start falling down again and again... Well it loses that simple style of fun flying around gives you.\nAnd although the game is based on exploration, it's super linear. Which isn't too bad until you realize that going off the beaten path just means death. The worst part is they have hidden things in levels to encourage exploration, but once you try to explore that flying mountain you'll realize it's impossible to stand on, once you try to escape the giant creature in the cave by going into the river that's resting under it you'll realize that there was no river. Only lies. And you'll fall through and die.\n\nSo what is goo about this game? the environments. They're pretty, memorable, and look unique.  I feel like this is the part they put all their effort into (and I mean all of it) and is the sole reason I can't completely bash this game, because I did enjoy looking at all the different areas. I just wish the villiages/towns were more... Fleshed out. They had some stuff that was pretty to look at, but it had no depth.\n\nSo in conclusion, the story and characters were a let down; the gameplay is frustrating, linear, and frustratingly linear in spite of good ideas; and the environments almost make it worthwhile.\n\nThis is basically that pretty yet shallow girl you dated that one time, but in video game form.","August 26, 2014","false","3.0"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TC_TwL/recommended/278360/","TC_TwL","TwL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TC_TwL/","223 products in account","The game is graphically beautiful. The levels look very colourful and vibrant, and fits well into the narrative as one can be quickly immersed by the landscape of the imaginary world. The lighting and atmospheric feeling of the environment blends in well with the narrative, making the narrative come alive and more interesting. The settings and the encounters in the narrative, such as the boss in the middle of the game, was very well done as it spices up the gameplay occasionally.\n\nHowever, the level design is a big problem. Sometimes it is not clear where you are supposed to go because the path is not obvious.  I also managed to break the game on the second level when I accidentally skipped the third crystal core in the cave and went ahead to the next jumping pair (since I wanted to explore around first before entering the cave, not knowing that the cave is a dead end), which supposingly have to be solved with three crystals but could be beaten by using just two. I had to restart the level when I couldn’t go back the way I came in order to collect the crystal core that I skipped, when the puzzles further down the level required it.\n\nSwinging from place to place really gives you a sense of freedom, and navigating the levels could have been fun. Unfortunately the grappling hook itself is frustrating to use, and it always feel like you are trying to beat the physics system rather than trying to beat the puzzle, since the solution is clear and easy but the execution becomes highly tedious due to the somewhat funky physics system. Occasionally you can get stuck in places and you slip off areas you think you should have a firm grip on. It is hard to get a sense of satisfaction for solving these puzzles when you constantly bang your head and smack your body on the floating stones, which causes you to lose momentum and sometimes narrowly misses the ledges of the platforms as a result.\n\nThe checkpoint system is also extremely stingy. When you travel for a long distance and have to grappling hook through multiple platforms (around 5 or 6), sometimes missing one of these platforms means you have to start right back at the beginning, and redo the swings again, which is rather punishing and torturing. Therefore I feel that the game should have a way for players to tweak the checkpoint system such that players who have difficulty in playing could have access to more checkpoints, rather than expecting everyone to be a pro and manage multiple swings without restarting.\n\nThe gameplay becomes too distracting due to these problems above and therefore spoils the flow of the narrative. I rather the game being a walking simulator, instead of experiencing a gameplay that sometimes doesn’t work well and frustrates you too much to continue.\n\nThe collectives are well hidden, but I felt that these collectives could have been modified to include additional lore or info. Collecting them now feels pointless as the place that you find them is actually not very interesting to be explored or looked at to warrant the trouble of searching and collecting them.\n\nWhile the narrative and art style is fantastic, the gameplay leaves much to be desired, thus it is hard to recommend this game at the full cost of 12.99 USD.\n\n2.5/5","June 1, 2014","false","4.4"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","3"

The unique storytelling and fresh gameplay of an indie game combined with the beautiful visuals on par with an AAA title.\n\nThe visuals:The graphical options you'd expect from a good PC game, such as MSAA and a field of view slider.\n\nIt's an Unreal Engine 3 game so it has performance very good for its level of visuals; to give you an idea, I'm able to run it at 4K resolution and stack 8x Sparse-Grid Super-Sample Anti-aliasing on top of that as well as setting all the game's in-game graphical options to their maximum settings and play it at a good framerate.\n\nSo it's technically sound and the art direction is great too. Everything is colorful and a joy to look at.\n\nThe story:Simple on the surface, with a certain element of complexity to it. The story feels like it should, an adventure with surprises all the way through, but when you reach the end you realize that there's a deeper layer to it which tugs at the heart strings. I'd suggest reading this thread AFTER you complete the game and you will come to appreciate the story even more.\n\nThe gameplay:Of course it's a video game, so this is important right? It is one of the best first-person platforming experiences I've ever had. The game appropriately moves up in difficulty at a reasonable rate from start to finish; by the time you reach the final level (ice cave) you better have gotten good at the grappling because you'll get a real test of your competence there.\n\nConclusion:This is a great way to spend 3 or 4 hours. Everything about the game is crafted with love and no portion of it overstays its welcome. It routinely goes on sale very cheap so I am happy with its length. Unlike so many games which are padded with useless filler to waste your valuable time, this game is designed to respect the player's time and refrains from hoisting repetitive elements upon you in order to pad out its length. It does what it needs to do to let you explore its various gameplay mechanics for a good amount of time and tell its story, and then it calls it quits, like a good game should. It is the epitomy of what makes PC gaming so great: you rarely find an experience as unique as this one on the consoles, where everything must be a big budget cookie cutter experience designed to appeal to the mass market and only being approved for release after being reviewed by dozens of corporate suits.","February 25, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And it's as fun as it sounds, but it gets more and more fun as you advance and discover more abilities to traverse. However, around this core there's also an ultimately enthralling and touching story of what wonders you may encounter as you set off to adventure.... and what you may have reluctantly left behind.\n\nAt first you'll think it's one of those games where it's only you in a lonesome and desolate place, namely a cave... but as soon as you exit the caves, you'll discover that this world is ALIVE, full of beautiful open vistas and even living people who live there! And that is truly where the story takes off, providing emotional reasons for your adventure and even someone to join you in your exploration. The contrast is breathtaking, and very welcome, although some people may have given up before reaching this point, and they shouldn't have.\n\nLike I mentioned, although it starts off with simple swinging abilities, it gets much, much more fun further along, providing you with even more ways to fly across chasms and just have fun advancing. You may end up falling to bottomless chasms more than you'd like, but in the end you'll just enjoy figuring out how to fly across the next set of obstacles and actually making it.\n\nAll in all, this one is a wonderful adventure well worth setting off to.","July 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It can be a bit frustrating sometimes because of the difficulty, but with that that makes the game less easy to complete.\nThe voice acting is a bit bad sometimes because it sounds like the voices are a bit missplaced to the characters.\nThe story can be a bit short and not that interesting. The game does have good graphics, not much on the NPC's but in the overworld it has great graphics.\nIt's pretty cringy that it has 1 brony joke, but that is not much of a problem.\n\nOverall it's a good game to buy, I would not recommend buying this for it's normal price because that's not worth it.

It can be a bit frustrating sometimes because of the difficulty, but with that that makes the game less easy to complete.\nThe voice acting is a bit bad sometimes because it sounds like the voices are a bit missplaced to the characters.\nThe story can be a bit short and not that interesting. The game does have good graphics, not much on the NPC's but in the overworld it has great graphics.\nIt's pretty cringy that it has 1 brony joke, but that is not much of a problem.\n\nOverall it's a good game to buy, I would not recommend buying this for it's normal price because that's not worth it.

The game tries to shake things up near the end by adding a few new mechanics, but by then it's too little too late. It just kinda stops after two hours with a really anti-climatic ending and without any kind of final challenge or buildup.\nThough the environments look nice, even if they're mostly just rock textures floating in the air.

The premise of the game appealed to me.  It seemed like it should be fun.\nWrong.\nThe graphics look great (well, in most areas, in the cave areas it's dark as f*** so it's like playing Doom 3 with the monitor off).  The other characters however, looked weird and half-baked. Not that you get to interact with them in any way.  You just pass by them without even registering their attention.  I felt as if I was a ghost travelling through their villages.  All you get in the way of interaction are a few cutscenes at a few places throughout the game.\nThis could be a blessing though, because the voice acting sounds as if they grabbed people off the street and were only allowed one take while trying to read cue cards from across the room.  Okay, I get the developers are from Sweden, so English might not be their first language, but seriously, try harder next time).\nAnd who tagged this game as story-rich?  It's trite and the ending sucks.\nThe ambient music is soothing, which is good because you'll need something to calm you down given how many times you'll die.  Oh, that's right.  You will die.  A lot.  And then some more.  I can't tell you how many times I fell to my death.\nIt doesn't help that the terrain everywhere tries its best to defeat your every attempt at advancement.  Even when jumping straight up to try to get at a higher platform I have been sent flying off sideways because I hit the lip at the edge above, deflecting me to my death.  Jumps I made successfully one time I miss completely because I under or overshoot, even though I did exactly the same thing as before, but I have to keep redoing over and over because the checkpoints are painfully far apart in most places.\nOh yes, checkpoints.  The artificial difficulty enhancer tool that devs throw in to slow you down in order to cover up for the fact their game is so short.  Not being able to save the game anywhere on a PC is inexcusable and lazy.  Sorry devs, if I wanted checkpoints I'd play it on a console.\nAnd I don't mind short games either, if the quality is good.\nI've read other reviews saying they only took 3 or 4 hours to finish the game.  Well holy ****, they must be better players than I am!  Steam says I played for a total of 7 hours, and I only did the one playthrough (that's about all I could take).  Honestly it felt like twice that.  If this game was any longer I doubt I'd have the patience to finish it.\nAll in all, I gave this game a negative review because the frustration involved in getting through the game was just too much.  Others who gave positive reivews have compared this game to Portal, but I will counter with the argument that Portal was incredibly well-balanced, both in game mechanics and difficulty.  Movement in Portal always 'felt' the same.  I never got deflected to my death by seemingly wonky physics or missed a jump because the destination platform was only 2 square feet.  Oh, and there was a quick-save key in Portal too.\nAt the end of the day, all this frustration just makes this game not FUN. And that's really what makes a game good or bad, isn't it?\nFinal verdict:  Only for twitch hardcore platformers.  I guess i do not count as one.\nOn the plus side, never have I seen flailing hands and fatal death plunge speed lines rendered so beautifully.\n5/10 Would not flail again.","May 11","false","7.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

One good gameplay mechanic does not a good game make. You grapple onto things in order to find your uncle with the "help" of a frog girl and occasionally just walk, that is it. I only made it to a point where it's dark and I have no idea where to go and not one aspect of the game is even remotely encouraging me to keep going. It's just boring now.\n\nEdit: I made it past that bit, I just found myself in a dark corner that serves no purpose but still contains a checkpoint. Oh, and it turns out the big scary eye monster in the trailer is just a bit where you have to stand still for a few seconds til it decides to go back to sleep in order to flesh out the playtime a little bit.\n\nI imagine this game will go one of two ways, either you'll suck at it in which case it'll just be constant trial and error or you'll be good at it and it'll be over in a couple of hours.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as to call this game bad or even not recommend it but once again Steam leave me no choice.

For me, Gone Home had such a dissapointing payoff for your investment in it that I just like to think, what if instead of finding a letter from  your sister that ran away because her parents wouldn't accept that she was gay  what if you spent an additional 20-30 minutes at the beginning of ASAMU looking around the house for him, before stumbling into the observatory and beginning the adventure game that was made?\n\nWell, I thought it was a cool idea.\n\nAnyway, I don't know that there's a lot to say about this game, it has been reviewed by many, even featured on Steam Train.\n\nIt is an indie gem with cool 3D platforming mechanics due to your Spider-Iron-Man glove.\n\nPros:\nVoice acting is not terrible\nStory telling goes on through the background mostly\nPlenty of places you can branch off the beaten trail and explore\nBeautiful 3D environments\nFull controller support - and by full I mean you can remap buttons, and controller is definitely the preferred way to play\nThe game's length of 6 levels doesn't count against it, it's a good thing to just enjoy the experience in a couple of hours, get all the acheivements, and pass it along to a friend\n\nCons:\nVoice acting is not spectacular either\nNot always that clear on where exactly to go and how to get there, leading to repeating some parts many times to figure out the solution\nLess beautiful 3D elements such as the models of people\nSome of the more difficult platforming sections can be especially frustrating, due to the character's tendency to bounce off of things\nSome glitchy physics from time to time can send you flying\n\nFinal verdict:\n7/10 Beautiful dreamlike levels with collectables and an entertaining story. Definitely one to own, but it has wildly varying difficulty and lack of some polish for a few things. This indy game is one of the best, but one you have to treat like a different kind of beast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/278360/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","The premise of this game suggested a focus on travel, which I suppose it delivers, but don't expect any freedom to come with that. A Story About My Uncle is a physics platformer that will have you jumping and swinging from rock to platform over the course of its 3-hour length. However, swinging isn't actually what you'll be doing, despite the game's thumbnail art - rather than tethering to a point, you'll pull yourself directly towards it, hopefully catapaulting yourself to the next platform.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of giving you a sense of freedom, the overwhelming feeling here is restriction. Air control (particularly for the high-jump) lasts only a few seconds before you plummet vertically downwards, likely hitting the side of the ledge you were aiming for and sliding off.  The long-jump on the other hand is completely uncontrollable, launching you directly forward with no option to stop or turn, more likely than not throwing you into the abyss. But why jump when you can fly, right? (aside from the section you're challenged to do without the grapple, which took roughly 30 deaths due to the aforementioned controls) Well, grappling is a frustrating art to learn - too close and you'll smack into the rock you grappled to, dropping vertically; too far and you won't have enough momentum to reach the next grapple-point. This gets increasingly frustrating as the game progresses, giving you more and more sucessive 'swings' between platforms. The route you need to take is usually pretty obvious, but with the vast majority of acheivements being 'never fall in a level' and 'use fewer grapples than ___', every failure is a punishment. If you don't care about acheivements, that's fine, but you'll have quickly swung your way through the game without much to show for it.\n\nIn typical Coffee Stain form, the human(oids) are ugly and the animations are absolutely terrible. When the characters are not looping a short idle pose with their dead, expressionless eyes, they're sliding across the floor at an angle as they run. There is almost no head-tracking, making cutscenes feel staged and impersonal, with NPCs staring straight forward while you can move around freely. They remain on good form with the environments, though.\n\nThe mechanics are singular, and frankly I was bored of them within the first half an hour. The standard platforming at the beginning is quite fun, with a good sense of movement, and adding the first grapple to that is fine, but you feel less in control. From this point of the game (level 1), you've seen everything it has to offer. You'll be 'swinging' from floating rock to floating platform over and over, getting up to three changes for your grapple, meaning more rocks between platforms. Later on you get a rocket upgrade, but this is only a mid-air long-jump, and will make you feel even more powerless when you miss your target by an inch.\n\nFrankly the game does not stand up on mechanics alone, despite its short playtime. The story is enough to explain progression and told though the compelling, if unoriginal, method of narration via story-telling. However, with ugly characters, stilted voice acting (though the primary narrator is fine), boring and repetative mechanics, short length, and acheivements that are almost exclusively "don't fail once or start again", this game falls very short of the price they are asking.\n\nIf a short game about catapulting yourself from rock to rock sounds fun, then you won't be dissapointed.

The farthest I was willing to try is just shy of the rocket-pack. This is roughly 2/3rds of the game, and I probably could've completed the game within the two hours of the new refund policy. I don't want to rip the devs off when it didn't meet my expectations. That's why I returned the game.\n\n(2) I respect the intentions of the devs with what they wanted to accomplish, so I am going to probably be nicer out of sympathy. However, I don't think this is a must-have game or an experience worth buying anytime soon.\n\nPlease take any criticsm I have with these caveats.\nThe initial impressions of this game had me interested to get this game on a sale based on its short length. The mechanics looked fun and unique, and the story seemed full of wonderment.\n\nSometimes I really do like the narrative-focused games that run around 2 to 3 hours. More polished storytelling and gameplay segments for a reasonable price is what I look for in these kind of games (Portal 1 and 2, Thomas Was Alone and TRI: Of Friendship & Madness).\n\nAnd within the first thirty minutes, I was enjoying myself. Then after stopping after shortly an hour and a half to see how much of the game I had completed, I asked myself just what was I really getting out of this game.\n\nProblem with Linearity in Gameplay, Not Linear Stories\nOnce you get the intial set-up and the gist of the gameplay mechanics (grappelling and power-jumping), the game doesn't seem to progress to anything more challenging or does anything different to offer variety with the mechanics.\n\nAlthough there are sometimes small deviations in the paths you choose, you still feel like the gameplay has only one solution and you are trapped within a corridor.\n\nA similar problem I have had with games like Magnrunner Pulse and QUBE is that the puzzles are scripted with only one solution. It's not a matter of using your powers to solve a room; the puzzle is doing everything in the correct order to reach the end.\n\nBesides the story-bits, the optional seismographs are lackluster; they're not elaboratively hidden in the levels, and they don't provide much to you other than a few unlockables fpr achievements.\n\nEven though the environments make you feel like there's a whole world to explore and absolute freedom at your disposal, there was nothing to set me off-course or extra challenges for choosing to go one route over the other. A corridor with a skybox canvas in disguise.\n\nA Small Story Told as An Epic\nMuch like the environments, the story also feels like something made much bigger than it actually is.\n\nYour Uncle Fred went missing months ago, now you wander in this dimension with some small clues about where Fred went. He was some entrapenour scientist/inventor who became obssessed with his creations and they took him to another, magical world he inadverently created.\n\nGood idea for a story, but not enough for this game. And there's not enough of motivation for the player to care.\n\nThere are some optional story-bits that flesh out characters like Mad Maddie and her relationship to Fred or of the protagonist and his attachment to his uncle from one of many adventures. Moments like these are so few and far between the experience, and some of which are hidden as details on the walls as notes, that you might overlook them entirely.\n\nBut other than these small glimpses of a narrative, I didn't feel any attachment to the protagonist. That's the failure of the narrative being given towards the player; the question I kept asking, "Why should I care about this uncle of yours? He sounds like a farce."\n\nHere you have the narrator saying how awesome his uncle is and recalling some part of the in-game story in past-tense (so he obviously comes back home). I couldn't really get too attached to someone who keeps telling me how awesome his uncle is.\n\nI'm more interested in my invovlement: What am I, the player, doing? Why should I care? What makes me invovled in the plot when it's been done already?\n\nPerhaps it wasn't the story itself but the delivery of the narrator that drew me away. He is far too monotone without any reason to be--the guy has an uncle who creates jetpacks and alternative dimensions!\n\nMaybe the narrator is supposed to be a blank-character that makes you want an uncle like Uncle Fred. Or perhaps you are the son/daugher of the narrator dreaming up the story about this uncle. (I'd believe that interpretation).\n\nBut it's not just a lackluster character that ruins the story. The world itself raised more questions that were never answered. Why is everyting in this world floating islands? Why did Salamanders evolve into people (yes, I know they were transported here in a hidden story-bit by Uncle Fred when he took in those eggs) but what led to their cognitive evolution?\n\nMaybe I am not supposed to ask these questions. Or maybe I'm lef to imagine the answers. The problem is nothing from the characters or the world made me grow any attachements. Only in the visual presentation.\n\nFor example, you stop by the Salamander village for the first sign of Fred. You don't really talk to anyone other than Mad Maddie, and then you  get their crystal from the elder. Off you go again to find Fred . There's simply not enough time to spend there to grow attachments to any character or place in a game where that should be the focus of its time.\n\nThe Game is What it is\nLackluster despite all the care put into the game.\n\nIf this game was a proof of concept to flesh out a future game, I would be happy because there is the potential for something amazing in its mechanics and for the game to bring out a charming narrative.\n\nThe game, if it ever gets a sequel, needs to remember the golden rule for stories, "Show, Don't Tell", because then we might be able to immerse ourselves in wanting to find our uncle in a strange world rather being told to find him. (Maybe some harder obstacles/challenges too.)\n\nBut above all for any narrative-focused titles in the future, the game doesn't need padding for the sake of artifical length; let us immerse ourselves in the world you create at our discretion as the player. Let us discover these worlds; let us discover these bonds we create; let us learn through our involvement why we care for something.","June 17, 2015","false","0.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dramacontastic/recommended/278360/","dramacontastic","DmgCtrl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dramacontastic/","217 products in account","tl;dr- is rly gud, buy dis gaem\n\nPlain and simple, I loved it. The game is a fantastic first person platformer.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: "But first person platformers are usually awful! They're hard to control and land, and in general don't feel as good as sidescrollers!"\n\nThis game blows that assumption out of the water. The controls feel great, the atmosphere feels great, and the ability to move around freely feels great!\n\nOverall, the game starts out with a bit of a Portal-meets-Dear-Esther vibe, in that it starts out with a paced narrative in a beautiful world, which follows through seamlessly into the actual puzzle game where you use some out-of-this-world technology to think quickly in ways you hadn't thought to before, allowing\n\nThe game does have a few issues here and there. First of all, there is a small problem with depth perception. Granted, that's going to happen in a first person platformer, but sometimes all it does is net frustration. Then again, that does tend to happen more often than not in a puzzle game designed to legitimately challenge you. In the end, that frustration can lead to some wonderful moments of, "Oh thank god I finally got that."\n\nHowever, one MAJOR issue I have with this game was one point where I had just barely almost made it to the next platform before falling off. The game shoved a hint in my face, then cheated me onto the ledge. I understand why they might do that, but I felt cheated in that the game basically took the controller from me and said, "Okay, we'll just spawn you there." I didn't feel that I earned it.\n\nAnother issue ends up being character design. Some of the characters feel... awkward. While this is reasonable seeing as what they are (you'll understand), they didn't feel like living characters in a real world; they felt like VIDEO GAME NPC #37. Especially the few ended up talking to you, whose heads would spin around in order to keep their eyes on you, their necks snapping back and forth should you walk behind them. Granted, you could have it a number of other ways, all with their own flaws, but it takes you out of the experience of the game when that happens. Of course, the exception to this is the character Maddie; it felt like the developers spent time and effort in animating her every expression and motion, and she felt much more alive than any other character.\n\nThe attitude the game takes towards you wavers as well. In the beginning the game is chocked with wonderful experiences and delightful gameplay, but about halfway through, I felt the game calling back to my early childhood games, where, if you were lost, the game would whistle at you and point you in the right direction. Simply put, I felt like I was stuck in a game intended for children 8-12. I would have been fine with that, had the game decided to stick with that emotion; the challenge of the game seems higher than that needed for an 8-12 year-old child. Maybe I'm just overestimating the skill required to play this game, or underestimating the skill of a kid, but the two just don't feel like they match up. (Or maybe I'm just bad at vidya gaemz.)\n\nDespite all of this, the game does do what's most important for a game to do: Introduce a skill/challenge, teach you how to use/overcome that skill/challenge, then apply that skill/ability/challenge to future situations in combination with the previous skills/challenges.\n\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\n\n--This section touches a bit more on what I found wrong with the game, but requires describing aspects of the game that would be considered spoilers. You have been warned.--\n\nWhen I had mentioned depth perception being a problem, I also had issues with the grappling hook. Sometimes, something would seem close enough to grapple, but the crosshair wouldn't light, meaning that you have to restart and try again, because maybe you just weren't close enough, or maybe you're going for the wrong rock entirely. A perfect example is the area just after  you leave the village: you head out, and jump across to some huge rock. You attempt to grapple it over and over, and for whatever reason, your crosshair won't like up, and won't hit it. You figure, "Oh, that must just be the problem with the distance." However, later on, you come across a rock which is undeniably further than the aforementioned one, and yet the crosshair lights up when aimed over it. It could have just been a matter of perspective, but over all, it tended to confuse me.\n\nAgain, the characters seem awkward. I understand, they're frog-people, but... if you're going to do that, do it right. Maddie was perfect, in that she appeared significantly inhuman, but still behaved in very human ways. At no point did I think, "Oh, she's just an NPC integral to the plot." Every moment I was with her, she felt alive and existant. She felt like a person! In contrast, almost every one of the villagers felt... dead. Sure, they were whistling, they were dancing around, they were lounging, but all in all, they didn't feel alive.\n\nDespite all of this, the game still feels fantastic. When you're swinging flawlessly from rock to rock, when you take a huge leap and get a resounding "THUD!" on landing, when you climb your way around the map with every tool you have, you feel... free.","May 31, 2014","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Overall, one of those nice, single player games that you can get easily get hooked on.\n\nThe Bad: While the game little by little introduces new stuff for the player to use, it's not enough to make a game of 'The Floor Is Lava' interesting for 3 hours. The last level felt the worst, I was dragging on just for the story at that point.\n\nThe Ugly: Now that I've finished the game, there's something to said about unlockables in single player, story only games. UNLOCKABLES =/= REPLAY VALUE. Going through a story, but only scouting full levels for collectibles, or following along wih a youtube video for a good hour isn't fun, and in no way encourages anyone to replay the game.\n\n\n7/10, take the platforming with a grain of salt when it becomes too much.","December 8, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seriously, it is approachable for almost everybody and one of the best games i've ever played in my life, and believe me, my library is just a tiny fraction of the things i've played.\n\nThe game feels very natural, and its a shame its so short. But the replay value is great since you can go back and do time trails or try to gather all the collectibles in the game. The story is extremely well done, although the ending is pretty anticlimactic. The game is also very forgiving. There were 2 checkpoints that were a little too far back, but overall you get put back in the action almost instantly after you fail a certain part of the level. The flow of the game is great and the story is engaging and lighthearted, yet it still manages to creep in a little sense of uneasiness from time to time. It shares the style and feel of phychonauts and it is a great example of narration done right.\n\nI don't do reviews or recommendations for games very often, but this is an overlooked masterpiece that everyone should have played, and I believe it came out at the wrong time. If this were published around 2006-2007 i believe this would have taken off like a rocketship.\n\n"A great experience and a nice escape from the AAA games that dominate the market.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LagMasterSam/recommended/278360/","LagMasterSam","LagMasterSam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LagMasterSam/","232 products in account","This game had an enormous amount of potential. The basic grappling and movement mechanics are amazing, but the game feels severely rushed and cut short. The early stages have excellent pacing and aesthetics with clever variations on using the grappling and movement mechanics. There is even a fun "boss fight" near the beginning that requires timing your movement so you aren't seen by the boss. But inexplicably (other than the game being rushed), there are no other boss fights in the game. There is a fun endlessly-falling-platforms section, but I don't consider that a "boss fight" since there really should have been other sections like it with some variation.\n\nThe rushing becomes increasingly apparent as the game wears on because you mostly end up either repeating more of the same tricks or doing the same thing but with more difficulty. Requiring the same tricks with increasing difficulty is not necessarily bad but it should be interspersed with new ideas and other content. The end game just becomes a grind of doing tricks without much exploration beyond finding the necessary surfaces.\n\nThe end game also suffers from what appears to be a lack of design and testing. Sometimes you can easily and obviously skip things that would otherwise be difficult. Yet other times you have to go through a rapid and convoluted series of precise actions to just barely reach the target.\n\nThe game is also very short. I wasn't in a particular hurry, yet I beat the game in 2.7 hours. If the game were longer, and the quality from the early game carried over to the end game, I would recommend the game. However, I can't recommend the game as it is.","June 17, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I breezed through it while still enjoying the game play, scenery and music. After beating it of course, unlocked me Time Trials. From what I'm seeing to give the game some challenge is that you need to read up on the Achievements, such as using a certain amount of grapples throughout the whole stage. It's a relaxing game, has a straight-forward path (can get confusing at times, so you need to check your surroundings). The game resembles closely to Mirrors Edge and it's perspective. There are a certain amount of secrets per level (basically standing in front to rip the telegraph paper), and unlocking them gives you alternative bonuses in the options such as changing the color of your grapple. The grappling hook was something you needed to get used to, in terms of velocity, angle, reaction, and momentum. It is a unique game, but I wish there was more to it; A longer story-line to say, a stronger feel and connection with characters that gives you a sense of depth and what the main character is going through as he's trying to find his uncle as he dwells deeper into this adventure.\n\nGame-play/Visual: 8/10\nMusic/Portrayal: 7/10\nStory/Feel: 5/10\nPrice: 3/10 (It feels more of a $4.99 ranged game)\nOverall: 6/10","September 9, 2015","false","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is really nice but the characters are annoying. I detest Maddie more than satan. The narrator is annoying as are all the voice actors because it sounds like they are talking to children, which I suppose they kind of are. But the writing seems really bad and the english seems choppy. The game itself has a great idea for the gameplay but it doesn't deliver as I was hoping. It feels awkward once in a while and distances are really hard to tell. But maybe I am just bad. It is a challenging game and the achievements are difficult to get which is a nice touch. I just felt like this game wasn't as fantastic as a lot of the reviews lead me to believe it would be. My recommendation is to get it on sale. It only took me 2 hours to beat. However, at some point I just got frustrated and started doing everything quickly, so maybe that is why.","July 7, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The beginning was a wonderful start, full of details and thick atmosphere. The game develops a simple but nice story since the start. The problem is that the mechanics (although there are some changes through the game thanks to powerups or new tools) may become a little repetitive. The scenery changes for every chapter though, and there can be many good moments, just looking at the view or some accurate level design. After all, a good game, but not really a precious gem. 70/100","December 17, 2014","true","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you wish there was a game of nothing but that?  Do you actually think GW2's jumping puzzles require a little too much thought? Then buy this game.  Otherwise, buy at your own risk.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game is that the jumping puzzles, (which is all this game is, btw) don't really feel like "puzzles."  It's not about finding the correct route to go in an environment - there's only one linear path, through pretty much the whole game. The puzzle part comes into play when you realize you have to jump at JUST the right angle, swing to JUST the right arc, let go at JUST the right time. That's not a puzzle. That's just a bunch of linear jumping that's annoyingly hard... And that's not fun.\n\nI almost rage quit on three different occasions, but didn't because, to my suprise, I wanted to know how the story ended.  The story ended pretty much exactly how I expected it to end - no shocking twists - but I was still happy to finish it.  I want to say it's a bland story, but I cared (tho I don't know why), so I guess it wasn't.\n\nThe environments / scenery are very pretty.  It's all floating rocks and gaping holes, but they're very PRETTY floating rocks and gaping holes. And you'll die often enough that you'll have plenty of time to admire the scenery.  It took me four deaths to notice the washed up whale, but the game made sure I kept dying until I friggin' noticed it. (Which was a nice break of levity from the repetitive death-thing.)\n\nThe game is also strangely forgiving AND sadistic.  Dunno if I've explain this well enough or not, but you will die.  A lot.  And I thought it was really nice of Coffee Stain Studios to not draw out the death scene. No screaming or thrashing arms at the empty unforgiving space through which you are plummeting. Not even punishing death music.  Just, "Oops, I missed" and then you fall; cue quick fade out, you're back at your checkpoint.  Which is another thing the game was very kind about: checkpoints. There are LOTS and LOTS of checkpoints. Don't think that makes the game too easy, tho. Those checkpoints are there because you need them. Because, did I mention this?, you will die. A LOT. For stupid reasons, no good reasons, because friggin' MADDIE challenges you to something stupid that kills you both. You know, lots of reasons to die. Only one way, but lots of reasons.\n\nThe music adds well to the atmosphere of the games and works well with the scenery.\n\nThe characters aren't very high-speed in the graphics or voice acting departments, but it doesn't matter and won't detract.\n\nThe only complaints I have about the gameplay are platform edges and grappling issues.  The game seems to have a problem dealing with the edges of platforms. If I'm cutting a jump close, sometimes I will land on them, sometimes I will fall right past them. If I'm standing on an edge, I can't WALK forward and must JUMP towards the center of the platform instead. And if your line-of-grappling (that's the science term for it, really) runs through a platform's edge, it's anyone's guess whether or not the game's gonna let you get away with it.\n\nSimilarly, I had problems with the grappling hook and crystals.  Often, while swinging through the air, I would try shooting a crystal clump to recharge my hook and it wouldn't register, at which point I would go plummeting to my death. It led to MANY frustrating deaths.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 7/10 because for what it does, it does pretty well.  Points off for its limited definition of the word "puzzle." I absolutely do not recommend because it wasn't fun, and unless you're looking for a game of jumping from one obvious platform to another (and nothing else), you probably won't have fun playing it either.","February 23, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I, literally, breezed through some parts, while others kept me restarting again and again. Sometimes it even felt like the game was responsible for my death. (Mostly when grappling onto islands).\nThe story parts completely broke the flow of gameplay.

It became very boring within like 30 minutes. So it explains how to run, "super" jump if you will, and combine the two to make a far leap. Then gives you a glove like grappling hook. And then you just continuously run threw obstacle course like areas with pit falls that restart you back at the previous checkpoint when you slightly miss a grappling onto the next item and fall in water. The scenery makes it even harder to see the next point that you can grapple onto because it's so dark.\n\nThis game really didn't do it for me. I was surprised too because it has so many positive reviews. I got a refund for this one. In a nutshell, IMO the game is simply grappling obstacle after grappling obstacle, and then more grappling obstacles.

It's also difficult to decide whether to recommend or not.\n\nIt has gorgeous environments, but horribly looking and poorly animated creatures.\n\nIt has a good level design, but too many issues with collisions not being where you suppose them to be or vice versa. Since it's a platformer, that's a big issue.\n\nIt has an interesting gameplay mechanics with the pulling glove, but cannot provide much more. Yes, there are rockets boots later on, but they don't really change the gameplay much.\n\nIt has an intuitive controls, but sometimes you cannot grab the object for some reason. The objects you can grab are marked with a bright symbol in the first levels, but later all not all of them are marked. This is especially frustrating on the last level, where you need to go via trial and error to find a correct path through the location. Why can I grab this stalactite and not the other one? They are looking the same!\n\nIn fact, the game has a lot of small irritating gameplay issues. Also it would be so easy to make the game more enjoyable: just add more checkpoints, light the correct path, show the distance to the objects so you know when you can grab them or not, etc. This wouldn't make the game casual, but would eliminate some of those trial and error moments.\n\nOverall, not bad for an indie game, but the gameplay quickly becomes boring and clearly lacks more mechanics.

It's a pity, then, that the game is brought down by so many poor choices and bad design in almost every other department.  The floating-rock level design might have been interesting in 2008, but it's so game-y as to be boring, really.  The voice-acting is genuinely awful, and while that's certainly not unique among indie games, since so much of the narrative is expressed through voice-over, I found myself actively trying to avoid having to hear the characters talk.  Also, for a game that's as timing-based and trial-and-error as this, the fact that there's no way to quickly restart to a checkpoint when you know that you've screwed up (yes, you can pause and click the option, but that doesn't feel quite the same) means that oftentimes I was left waiting for several seconds for my character to fall to his death, which only added to the frustration of how finnicky the swinging can be sometimes.\n\nI bought this game for a dollar and I was still disappointed.","March 5","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't mind trying something time and again if I know what I am supposed to do and I am failing at it but this game has no direction markers of any kind and I fell to my death more times than not because I ever so slightly walked off the edge of a small path no wider than a foot, respectively, based off of the size of the character's disembodied arm.\n\nI was exilerated at first, the high jumps, the strange world, the bright colors, all very fetching and then the game actually started.. I was quickly annoyed by the grapples to the little floating rocks and the lack of any way to know if you are close enough to grapple onto them or not. Not to mention on many occassions I went to a rock that I thooough was the next one in the succession but alas, no, it was not and seeing as I was out of charges with my grappling hook and it wouldn't recharge, because I had gone the wrong way, I was stuck there, forever.. or until I committed suicide or quit and repawned.\n\nUndoubtedly I didn't make it all that far into the game but that's because within thirty minutes of dying over and over and over it was seriously trying my patience and I wanted to scream and throw my computer out the window. If you like an unfair challenge from a game that is too short, according to all the other reviews I have been reading, and mechanics that are rather clunky and unpolished then this is the one for you.\n\nOn a side note, I made a specific category just for this game, this game is the only one in the category and I have yet to find another that annoyed and frustrated me to the extent that this game did so I don't think it will be getting any company anytime soon, the name of this category is: WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK??????\nThat is all.","November 20, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LagMasterSam/recommended/278360/","LagMasterSam","LagMasterSam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LagMasterSam/","232 products in account","This game had an enormous amount of potential. The basic grappling and movement mechanics are amazing, but the game feels severely rushed and cut short. The early stages have excellent pacing and aesthetics with clever variations on using the grappling and movement mechanics. There is even a fun "boss fight" near the beginning that requires timing your movement so you aren't seen by the boss. But inexplicably (other than the game being rushed), there are no other boss fights in the game. There is a fun endlessly-falling-platforms section, but I don't consider that a "boss fight" since there really should have been other sections like it with some variation.\n\nThe rushing becomes increasingly apparent as the game wears on because you mostly end up either repeating more of the same tricks or doing the same thing but with more difficulty. Requiring the same tricks with increasing difficulty is not necessarily bad but it should be interspersed with new ideas and other content. The end game just becomes a grind of doing tricks without much exploration beyond finding the necessary surfaces.\n\nThe end game also suffers from what appears to be a lack of design and testing. Sometimes you can easily and obviously skip things that would otherwise be difficult. Yet other times you have to go through a rapid and convoluted series of precise actions to just barely reach the target.\n\nThe game is also very short. I wasn't in a particular hurry, yet I beat the game in 2.7 hours. If the game were longer, and the quality from the early game carried over to the end game, I would recommend the game. However, I can't recommend the game as it is.","June 17, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeekyMeerkat/recommended/278360/","GeekyMeerkat","Geeky Meerkat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeekyMeerkat/","426 products in account","The game has an interesting story, but I feel like the control scheme is poorly done. Enough so that I find it distracts from just enjoying the game. To explain, you have a sprint button, a jump button, a super jump button, and a grapple button. Super jump takes a couple moments to charge so you have to hold it down for a bit or it does nothing. The regular jump button makes you jump the moment you press it but it's not a huge jump, and doesn't seem to do anything if you hold it down. It just feels like to me that the jump buttons should have been combined into one. Tap the button to do a basic jump, and hold it down to do a super jump.\n\nFurthermore, the regular jump is A on a controller something I feel is very intuitive, but the super jump button is the top right trigger and the sprint button is the top left trigger. Grapple is the bottom right trigger. It just feels wrong that the super jump feels like the jump I'll most likely be using most the time but is also a button that is pressed with the same finger as the grapple button. But it's not like I can just switch the controller layout so that the super jump button is the A button, because you still need the regular jump for hoping over little things.\n\nPerhaps for some the control set up seems natural and fluid, and they go running around jumping and grappling onto things like in the trailer. But for me it feels counter intuitive and instead of feeling like I'm gracefully jumping through the sky I'm instead having to think about exactly what buttons I want to press to do something.\n\nWith a game like this, I feel it VERY important that the control set up feel instinctual, and I feel it fails in this. Sadly Steam only lets me either recommend or not recommend a game, so I have to go with not recommend. I trust though that if you've reached this point in reading the review though that you understand my primary complaint is the control set up. If you are all right with games with strange controls or you don't feel that the set up described sounds strange, perhaps this game is for you.","December 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you wish there was a game of nothing but that?  Do you actually think GW2's jumping puzzles require a little too much thought? Then buy this game.  Otherwise, buy at your own risk.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game is that the jumping puzzles, (which is all this game is, btw) don't really feel like "puzzles."  It's not about finding the correct route to go in an environment - there's only one linear path, through pretty much the whole game. The puzzle part comes into play when you realize you have to jump at JUST the right angle, swing to JUST the right arc, let go at JUST the right time. That's not a puzzle. That's just a bunch of linear jumping that's annoyingly hard... And that's not fun.\n\nI almost rage quit on three different occasions, but didn't because, to my suprise, I wanted to know how the story ended.  The story ended pretty much exactly how I expected it to end - no shocking twists - but I was still happy to finish it.  I want to say it's a bland story, but I cared (tho I don't know why), so I guess it wasn't.\n\nThe environments / scenery are very pretty.  It's all floating rocks and gaping holes, but they're very PRETTY floating rocks and gaping holes. And you'll die often enough that you'll have plenty of time to admire the scenery.  It took me four deaths to notice the washed up whale, but the game made sure I kept dying until I friggin' noticed it. (Which was a nice break of levity from the repetitive death-thing.)\n\nThe game is also strangely forgiving AND sadistic.  Dunno if I've explain this well enough or not, but you will die.  A lot.  And I thought it was really nice of Coffee Stain Studios to not draw out the death scene. No screaming or thrashing arms at the empty unforgiving space through which you are plummeting. Not even punishing death music.  Just, "Oops, I missed" and then you fall; cue quick fade out, you're back at your checkpoint.  Which is another thing the game was very kind about: checkpoints. There are LOTS and LOTS of checkpoints. Don't think that makes the game too easy, tho. Those checkpoints are there because you need them. Because, did I mention this?, you will die. A LOT. For stupid reasons, no good reasons, because friggin' MADDIE challenges you to something stupid that kills you both. You know, lots of reasons to die. Only one way, but lots of reasons.\n\nThe music adds well to the atmosphere of the games and works well with the scenery.\n\nThe characters aren't very high-speed in the graphics or voice acting departments, but it doesn't matter and won't detract.\n\nThe only complaints I have about the gameplay are platform edges and grappling issues.  The game seems to have a problem dealing with the edges of platforms. If I'm cutting a jump close, sometimes I will land on them, sometimes I will fall right past them. If I'm standing on an edge, I can't WALK forward and must JUMP towards the center of the platform instead. And if your line-of-grappling (that's the science term for it, really) runs through a platform's edge, it's anyone's guess whether or not the game's gonna let you get away with it.\n\nSimilarly, I had problems with the grappling hook and crystals.  Often, while swinging through the air, I would try shooting a crystal clump to recharge my hook and it wouldn't register, at which point I would go plummeting to my death. It led to MANY frustrating deaths.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 7/10 because for what it does, it does pretty well.  Points off for its limited definition of the word "puzzle." I absolutely do not recommend because it wasn't fun, and unless you're looking for a game of jumping from one obvious platform to another (and nothing else), you probably won't have fun playing it either.","February 23, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is largely repetetive with little in the way of new puzzles or new terrain styles. The objective is sometimes very difficult to see and even harder to reach. The difficulty of this game is for well-skilled gamers, which conflicts with the story. The story is something really best suited for a kid in single digits, and most kids that age don't have the skills necessary to complete this game.

I do not think it is worth your investment for the pricing on it and as a special note to that statement, here is why, it is because not only is the game short, but the filler content in  it to make the experience seem more lasting gets boring extremely quickly and is used pretty much as soon as you get to sky gardens and the ice cave\n\nDo I look forward to seeing more games from the developer?

It sounds phenominal, but... doesn't succeed.\n\nFirstly, the game is not story driven, it's a rage game. Later levels are unforgiving and seem designed for the singular purpose of having you die multiple times so that your time in game expands from the hour of actual gameplay there is. That's right- four out of my five gameplay hours were me dying- and I couldn't even finish the end of the final level before shutting off.\n\nAllow me to explain. You have three grapples- no more, and no less. You have to grapple to falling stalagtites- but once you're down to one grapple, you have to grapple one of the crystals on the walls of the hall- this will give you three grapples. However, this means that you fly free for a few moments before you manage to aim at the crystal- many of which are blocked from some angles by objects that'll take your last grapple attempt and allow you to fall and restart the section. After you've refilled the grapples, you have to continue. You have to do this with pinpoint accuracy six or seven times before you land on the ending platform. However, the challenge doesn't stop there. Stone walls lie in your path, forcing you to go higher or lower in relation to the ceiling. Finally, the stalagtites are far enough apart that, unless you launch yourself perfectly from the last grapple, you'll die.\n\nThat's the entire game in one paragraph.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/278360/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Sigh. This is a game that I'm just... really disappointed in. It's not even that bad, it's only just in the negative category, but I can't really say I enjoyed it enough to give it a positive.\n\nMostly, the game is just... confused, a lot of the time. Baffling game design choices like forced cutscenes in most levels with no way to skip them, which would be fine if you were only playing levels once, but the game encourages replayability with two achievements per level as well as three more achievements spread across all five. This is most problematic in stages 2 especially as well as 3 and minorly in 4, but it's a really huge oversight in my personal opinion; even just replaying the levels normally, some of these cutscenes drag too long a second time through.\n\nThe game also can't decide if it wants to be a challenging platformer or a story-based game with gameplay filling in the gaps. The aforementioned achievements plus the levels being generally designed okay enough seem to make it more on the gameplay side of things, but then there's weird stuff like rough terrain, random atmospheric objects that only serve to get in the way, and a lot of other things that throw a wrench in that whole level design thing. Plus, the abundance of cutscenes does abruptly halt the flow of the game far too often.\n\nThere's also some kind of cruddy level design choices at times. Most of the time you won't have to be too perfect with your momentum to land a jump, so when the few instances where you do have to be relatively precise come up they become infuriating quickly (especially with the challenges for each level, often forcing you to have to restart and subsequently rewatch cutscenes each time). The level length is also horribly imbalanced, with the first three levels combined being shorter than the fifth level (and the fourth being twice as long as any of the three before it). This isn't just a rough judgment either, just going by the speedrun times for each level. Which also vary in leniency; of the ones I attempted, the first level's was oddly strict, while the second and fourth level's not so much. The first two levels have a high reliance on cycles, as well, which are very anti-speedrun (oddly enough this mostly vanishes for the last few levels though...)\n\nThe real breaking point for me though is just how inconsistently the game behaves. The physics and controls don't feel consistent enough. Long jumps have varying distance some of the time, occasionally one will be much shorter for no apparent reason. Other jumps have weird momentum, sometimes I'll have enough speed in a jump, other times I won't; regardless of whether or not I was running prior to the jump. Occasionally the sense of scale is also screwed up such that something that looks like you can grapple onto it is actually farther away than it looks (stage 4 has this in spades, for whatever reason). Plenty of times the controls just outright fail, too. I'll start a jump charge but it won't work. I'll try to long jump but I got a high jump instead, even though I didn't let go of the run button. I'll try to long jump and not jump at all somehow??? The lack of consistency is what really kills the replayability factor for me here, it's not fun to replay because I'm never sure when I'll get screwed over by something not behaving properly.\n\nSo then, the game is probably fine as a casual experience. If you plan to play through it once and then never touch it again, most of these problems are utterly irrelevant to you. That's fine. However, it's not a particularly lengthy game and I'd expect the average player to clear the entire story in 2-3 hours, and the asking price is a bit high for that amount of gameplay. Get it on sale if you want to play it that way and you'll probably have a fun enough time. For the people who want to replay and get achievements, you'll probably get your money's worth a lot better, but the cracks in the game really show when it's played this way and make it an unpleasant experience. The latter is the experience I've had and it has pretty thoroughly convinced me that I dislike this game. It can be fun when nothing goes wrong, but I can't trust it enough for it to stay fun. I think with a little more polish and a few aletered levels this could be a really good, fun game, but as it stands it's not quite there yet, in my personal opinion.","December 29, 2014","false","12.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orangestar1/recommended/278360/","Orangestar1","Orangestar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orangestar1/","121 products in account","I've had it. This game pissed me off.\n\nIn first impressions, A Story About My Uncle is an absolutely beautiful looking game with really solid mechanics that add together to make a wonderful game to play, and it lives up to that moniker as "a wonderful game to play".\n\nThe visuals look absolutely stunning and the game is a whole boat-ton of fun to play through. If you ever screwed around with +hook in Quake servers, or even the unreleased official Q3A grappling hook, then you'll be right at home. This is an entire, single-player campaign video game based around such a Quake-style grappling device. To back it up, the player is equipped with a "super jump", that allows him to bound across long gaps or up large heights, and later recieves a pair of rocket boots that allow you to shoot through the sky letting you traverse even further distances without grip. This is probably the updates the game has recieved talking, but unlike many reviewers I never ran into an instance where the platforming solution I chose dissallowed me from continuing. If a solution was wrong, it was extremely obvious. You could even game with platforms that weren't meant to be landed on to recharge grapples. (You get 3 grapples per jump, but it builds you up to that point throughout the first level.)\n\nA quick note on the level design: There are a few "waiting puzzles" were you have to time your grapples to when a rock comes to you to use the momentum to your advantage, but these disappear pretty quickly. Later puzzles with moving parts have enough grapple points to be more like "momentum puzzles." Otherwise, the level design and gameplay is nearly flawless.\n\nThis all works together to make one of the most fun video games I've played in a long time. That's why I kept playing the levels, over and over again, looking for unlockables and seeing if I could 100% it plus achievements. It's so fun to play.\n\nHope you've girded your loins, because that's all the praise this game is getting. I'm really not sure how to begin this next paragraph, so let's right out say it.\n\nThe story is ♥♥♥♥. It's garbage. Tripe. It's so bad it made me angry. This is truly ironic for a video game where "story" is the title's first non-article word. It's practically painful. The story follows an unnamed protagonist who visits his uncle's house one day after a long time with no contact. Inside, he finds a powered suit and launch pad that send him to another planet with mysterious flora and strange inhabitants as he searches for his missing relative. This is told through the framing device of our protagonist in his old age telling the story back to his daughter as best as he can remember it.\n\nThere's nothing to examine here. He's looking for his uncle. Nothing will stop him. That's the whole story. The sheer simplicity of the actual story here makes all the attempts the game makes at detailing itself and making itself coherent moot. When it does attempt it, the game falls flat on its face.\n\nFor example, there's a very big bit about an outcasted group called "The Strays" who either left or were banished from a village encountered early in the game. Much later, you finally get the chance to meet some strays. You say hi, your NPC friend exchanges some banter, and then you leave. You only meet one other stray afterwards and nothing ever comes from these three NAMED characters.\n\nThere's a language The Strays have, and it's 1:1 to the English language. Translating them explains nothing. Only jokes and pointless phrases that are so generic they could've been fit anywhere else in the game at any time.\n\nThe voice acting is shoddy. Nobody seems to have put any effort into saying their lines beyond the intensity I would expect from an Edutainment game from the early 2000s. The best actor plays Fred, who only appears at the end of the game for a grand total of one scene.\n\nElements are introduced and then are not explained. The writing is so terribly written that it really shines how terribly plot-holey it is, not to mention the dated memes peppered about here and there. (20% Cooler, anyone?) There's so much that didn't give me any sort of closure. Take a look at this list (spoilers) for things the game never explains. It's so big it was taking up more of my review than Steam would allow.[md.osuv.de]\n\nAnd that's just coming off the top of my head. I wouldn't doubt there's a ton of other inconsistencies and confusing instances one could come up with as to the quality of the game.\n\nThere are sets of unlockables, 5 per level, that add little jokes to how you play the game. There's a "Goat Mode" which makes the character's grapple beam be a Goat Simulator-style Tongue, and make the character spout annoying Goat noises whenever you do anything. Did you laugh when I mention that? I didn't think so. The only unlockable worth anything is "Beam Color", which you obtain after 10 unlockables. After that it's just the unfunny Goat Mode, Midas Mode, which is kind of cool, but makes it hard to identify things like Power Crystals when swinging since they turn Gold instantly and stop glowing, and Acrobatics mode, that makes your camera swing around wildly when you jump, making the game completely unplayable. That's the big all-secret-machines-collected unlockable: making the game unplayable.\n\nMy last complaint about the game is the inconsistent animation. It looks like the budget ran out about half-way into the game. Everybody all of a sudden moves so stiffly and expresses only basic emotion in their face, when in Maddie's first appearance she has lively facial expressions and body movement that really brings across any sort of emotion. Maddie herself is an annoying little brat, but her animation was stellar. Suddenly the quality dropped off the face of the earth for everyone. What happened? The modeling is pretty bad too: Even on highest detail settings, Maddie's face (amongst all the other frog people) looks disgusting.\n\nSo, verdict: The game is an absolute joy to play. However, it is too short and WAY too poorly written to really make it a game I would reccomend. If a modding community can spring up and create a series of awesome levels to go along with the game, I'd probably recommend it. But A Story About My Uncle itself is not a very good video game. I can't reccommend it in good judgement.","November 16, 2015","false","10.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This seems to be the main point of the game so far. And I die / fall...a LOT like 10 times for each successful jump.

Sadly this is the only gameplay this game has and therefore I really can't recommend it. It's a shame too since I was looking forward to this game having played the demo build some years back.

Even then though, I'm not sure I would buy this game. Let me start with a brief summary:\n\nYou are looking for your uncle, who has gone to a secret world, and you get a special suit that lets you soar through the world, take no damage from falls, and use a laser beam to latch on to surfaces and pull yourself through to them.\n\nPros:\n- It's done through the first-person perspective so at times it can be very fun, soaring through the air and seeing it fly past you.\n- The scenery can be very beautiful, and some of the backgrounds are lovely.\n- There are collectables, which, I guess, add some form of replayability.\n\nCons:\n- AWFUL, AWFUL, level design. There will be so many times where you will have NO idea where to go, what to latch onto, and what the hell you're meant to do. Not to mention when it's painfully obvious that the designers had no idea what to do and so just placed some random floating windmills in a weird circular pattern so that you could reach another random floating rock. It's very sporadic, some areas are wonderful, others are awful.\n- Not to mention, so many of the jumps and timings are pure luck, and not skill at all. This, compounded with the fact that you have no depth-perception at times, really ruins so many of the best and most ambitious course obstacles.\n- The worst voice-acting I have ever heard in a videogame. Straight up horrendous and cringe-worthy. It feels like someone with a foreign language recorded themselves reading the lines one by one without any indication of what the script is like, then made someone else re-record them with different intonations for the hell of it, then gave them to someone with no concept of language to record one last time. Literally so bad I muted my sound after just one level because I couldn't stand it.\n-Bugs, such as when you grab onto a rock and it pulls you too close, so that the character falls on the ground and you have to restart. Really annoying when you're going for the 'don't fall' achievements.\n-Boring replayability, because there's no real incentive to get the collectables or do the time-trials.\n-Boring story, which whilst cute, because of the story-telling to a small child idea, isn't satisfying at all. It's a straight-up reach point A from point B and the 'village' you are introduced to has no meaning, especially when the character you are introduced to from it just leaves the story halfway through and does nothing particularly important then on. You leave the village and it feels like a small glimpse into the actual story rather than anything important,\n\nOverall, I think this game isn't worth 12 dollars, and I wouldn't get it. But if it's on sale, then do it! It's a fun little adventure that you can play when you need a small break.","December 17, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The guy's momentum is super inconsistent, with the speed just stopping once you let go of the "ropes". Then some other time with exactly similar moves there's too much speed and once again the guy falls down to the darkness It also looks like the length of the rope is determined by the developers for every single jump so you can never be sure when it reaches and when it doesn't. Than if it does, whoops, it still doesn't activate on clicks. And then there's the monster segments that just reek of garbage with the monster being awake when you come round a corner and have no chance of knowing that.

Two words could describe it well: boring and enervating. I really gave this game a chance, even though my final impressions were obtained on the second level. I'll try not to be long here (well, I tried).\nThe controls follow a simple scheme, but it doesn't help. They're sometimes clunky (and this is unforgivable in a precision-based game) and even unresponsive - boy, did I hate having to redo so much stuff at the Star Haven and the Ice Cave! Also there were parts in both these stages I only got through thanks to technical errors by the game (such as invisible unintended platforms and forceable pathways), and while I do love to explore development gaps in great games, I hate to have to use them to finish not-so-brilliant games.\nThe music is completely forgettable, and this is also inexcusable in a game that wants to invite you to explore the field. As for the visuals, they're unappealing. The colour scheme is pretty "meh" and the landscape is tiringly repetitive - to be fair, though, the colours composing the sky in Star Haven make for a quite gorgeous combination.\nAnother mistake is the terrible placement of the stones you have to grapple to. Sometimes they are so random that it seems like the gaming is forcing, let's call it... "experience" at an extremely unnatural pace. That combined with the forceable pathways makes for a playthrough full of tedium sighs. You don't feel rewarded for having been able to proceed.\nAnd finally we get to the supposedly valuable gem of the game: the story it tells. Nope. Just forget it. The story is just thrown at you. You don't connect to any of the characters - even your sidekick simply comes and goes away. There's no emotion. You don't feel like you have nor like you should find your uncle. You don't feel like you have a real purpose on this world. It tries to be touching at the end and cute from the beginning, but it also fails at that mainly due to the bad voice acting (bad enough that you don't even care about what you're being told after some time).\nYes, there are good parts, but they don't make up for all the bad ones. And yes, I get it that the game is short and maybe they didn't have a big budget, but that's not an excuse: Braid and The Stanley Parable are also short indie games that are excellent at what they're trying to do. ASAMU is not. It had a greater ambition than what it was able to deliver. Bottom line is: don't buy it, there are plenty of other great games on sale and you don't want to waste your money on a short unpleasing experience.\nScore: 3/10\n\nQue bom que eu comprei esse jogo na promoção, porque eu me arrependeria (ainda mais) de gastar nele seu preço total. Duas palavras o descrevem bem: chato e irritante. Eu dei VÁRIAS chances ao jogo, mas minhas impressões finais foram as que obti já na segunda fase. Vou tentar não me alongar (bem, eu tentei).\nOs controles seguem um esquema simples, mas isso não ajuda. Às vezes são meio desajeitados (o que é imperdoável em um jogo que se baseia em precisão) e até mesmo irresponsivos - você não tem noção do quanto eu detestei ter que refazer tanta coisa no Star Haven e na Ice Cave. Também houve partes nessas duas fases que eu só consegui passar por causa de erros técnicos do jogo (como plataformas invisíveis não intencionais e caminhos forçáveis), e apesar de eu amar explorar buracos de desenvolvimento de jogos ótimos, detesto TER que usá-los pra completar jogos fracos.\nA música é completamente esquecível, e isso também é imperdoável em um jogo que quer te convidar a explorar o mapa. Quanto à parte visual, não é convidativa. O esquema de cores é bem mais ou menos e o cenário é cansativamente repetitivo - mas tenho que ser justo: as cores que compõem o céu em Star Haven formam uma combinação linda.\nOutro erro é o posicionamento terrível das pedras às quais você tem que se agarrar. Às vezes são tão aleatórias que parece que o jogo está te forçando uma suposta "experiência" num ritmo completamente anti-natural. Isso causa, combinado com os caminhos forçáveis, uma jogatina cheia de suspiros de tédio. Você não se sente recompensado por ter conseguido progredir.\nE chegamos finalmente à suposta pedra preciosa do jogo: a história que ele conta. Não. Esquece. A história é jogada pra cima de você. Você não se conecta a qualquer dos personagens - até sua parceira simplesmente chega e vai embora. Não há emoção. Você não sente como se tivesse ou devesse encontrar seu tio. Você não sente que tem um propósito real nesse mundo. O jogo tenta ser tocante no final e fofo desde o começo, mas também fracassa nisso, principalmente devido à dublagem ruim (ruim o suficiente pra fazer com que você deixe de se importar com o que estão te falando depois de algum tempo).\nSim, há partes boas, mas elas não compensam as tantas partes ruins. E, sim, eu entendo que o jogo é curto e talvez eles não tenham um orçamento grande, mas isso não é desculpa. Braid e The Stanley Parable também são jogos indie curtos que são excelentes no que se propõem a fazer. ASAMU não é. Teve uma ambição maior do que foi capaz de entregar.\nMinhas palavras finais são: não compre. Têm vários outros jogos ótimos em promoção e você não quer gastar sua grana numa experiência curta e desprazerosa.\nNota: 3/10","December 30, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The platforming, while frustrating at times, was surprisingly tight and well done which is good considering that was the core of the gameplay.  The other draw of the game is the narrative - which is unfortunately lacking.  I finished the game knowing that I was supposed to be feeling....something, but I found only that feeling of accomplishment that comes with finishing any game.  It's mainly just another notch in my gaming belt.  I don't think enough time was spent in developing the characters.  This could be budget-based, and likely is; but that doesn't change the fact that I just didn't care about the uncle or his story, which seems sort of important considering the title of the game.  It also didn't help that the voice talent was severely lacking - lines with obvious weight to them were delivered with a droll monotone, and the narrator would consistently pause in inane spots.  This only helped to lessen the effect the story had on me, which was struggling to begin with.  I'm going to recommend this only to gamers looking for at least one of the following: eye candy, or fun trial and error platforming.  Steer clear if you're looking for much beyond this.  It's a solid attempt, and could be great with a longer development cycle and more production values, but ultimately fades where it should shine.","January 2, 2015","false","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Às vezes são meio desajeitados (o que é imperdoável em um jogo que se baseia em precisão) e até mesmo irresponsivos - você não tem noção do quanto eu detestei ter que refazer tanta coisa no Star Haven e na Ice Cave. Também houve partes nessas duas fases que eu só consegui passar por causa de erros técnicos do jogo (como plataformas invisíveis não intencionais e caminhos forçáveis), e apesar de eu amar explorar buracos de desenvolvimento de jogos ótimos, detesto TER que usá-los pra completar jogos fracos.\nA música é completamente esquecível, e isso também é imperdoável em um jogo que quer te convidar a explorar o mapa. Quanto à parte visual, não é convidativa. O esquema de cores é bem mais ou menos e o cenário é cansativamente repetitivo - mas tenho que ser justo: as cores que compõem o céu em Star Haven formam uma combinação linda.\nOutro erro é o posicionamento terrível das pedras às quais você tem que se agarrar. Às vezes são tão aleatórias que parece que o jogo está te forçando uma suposta "experiência" num ritmo completamente anti-natural. Isso causa, combinado com os caminhos forçáveis, uma jogatina cheia de suspiros de tédio. Você não se sente recompensado por ter conseguido progredir.\nE chegamos finalmente à suposta pedra preciosa do jogo: a história que ele conta. Não. Esquece. A história é jogada pra cima de você. Você não se conecta a qualquer dos personagens - até sua parceira simplesmente chega e vai embora. Não há emoção. Você não sente como se tivesse ou devesse encontrar seu tio. Você não sente que tem um propósito real nesse mundo. O jogo tenta ser tocante no final e fofo desde o começo, mas também fracassa nisso, principalmente devido à dublagem ruim (ruim o suficiente pra fazer com que você deixe de se importar com o que estão te falando depois de algum tempo).\nSim, há partes boas, mas elas não compensam as tantas partes ruins. E, sim, eu entendo que o jogo é curto e talvez eles não tenham um orçamento grande, mas isso não é desculpa. Braid e The Stanley Parable também são jogos indie curtos que são excelentes no que se propõem a fazer. ASAMU não é. Teve uma ambição maior do que foi capaz de entregar.\nMinhas palavras finais são: não compre. Têm vários outros jogos ótimos em promoção e você não quer gastar sua grana numa experiência curta e desprazerosa.\nNota: 3/10","December 30, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The platforming, while frustrating at times, was surprisingly tight and well done which is good considering that was the core of the gameplay.  The other draw of the game is the narrative - which is unfortunately lacking.  I finished the game knowing that I was supposed to be feeling....something, but I found only that feeling of accomplishment that comes with finishing any game.  It's mainly just another notch in my gaming belt.  I don't think enough time was spent in developing the characters.  This could be budget-based, and likely is; but that doesn't change the fact that I just didn't care about the uncle or his story, which seems sort of important considering the title of the game.  It also didn't help that the voice talent was severely lacking - lines with obvious weight to them were delivered with a droll monotone, and the narrator would consistently pause in inane spots.  This only helped to lessen the effect the story had on me, which was struggling to begin with.  I'm going to recommend this only to gamers looking for at least one of the following: eye candy, or fun trial and error platforming.  Steer clear if you're looking for much beyond this.  It's a solid attempt, and could be great with a longer development cycle and more production values, but ultimately fades where it should shine.","January 2, 2015","false","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Jump from rocks to rocks, gliding, using grapling hooks feels incredible. Graphics are also impressive, all the small islands forming a path, surrounded with massive rocks or caverns; art desing is beautiful, especially 'exterior' maps.\n\nBut desptie all the above point, the game is a disapointment. While you get super powers early on, you don't really get get anything else to play with. There are small variants (rocket boots, recharge cristals), but it doesn't feel different. Grappling is fine, but you always ends up banging your head on the rock you're grappling, losing your momentum in the process, and falling to your death, Except in a few areas, the game is nothing but a long corridor without any real incentive to go on.\nThe game tries to be story driven, with a narrator and a few characters, but it doesn't work really well. Despite beeing gorgeous, the world, is not credible, there are only a few 'floating islands corridor' to move in the world. You fall and die so many times when going from one village to the next, even with all your super powers that you can only wonder how the inhabitants can survive (the only one you see outside of a settlement just disappears or climbs on your back when she needs to move on). Moreover, I don't think that a story driven game works fine when the gameplay is based on die and retry mechanics.\nAnd finally, what does the story try to tell us ? It's about a boy who goes after his uncle because he misses him. On the road he meets strange creatures but he doesn't even try to  understand them and goes on after his uncle. And finally, when he reaches his uncle, he is just sent back to his world, the reason for his quest left behind. What did the boy learn ? Is he a better person at the end of the game ? The whole story feels completely anecdotal and emotionless.\n\n+ Artistically, the game is great\n+ There are some good idea for the gameplay\n- very quickly repetitive\n- unexploited and not creadible world\n- pointless story","January 4, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It does feel intriguing at first, when you enter the world of this game and try its mechanics, but soon i had to realise, that, despite the mechanics seeming rather simple (there are just 3-4), either it is very hard for me to understand the exact rules of them, or they just are inconsistent from start to finish, which resulted in a constant, unsatisfying game of trial and error, when it shouldn't be. It also becomes clear that exploration, or even just deviation from an intended path isn't planed, when interacting with objects away from that path is even more inconsistent. This results in zero immersion, ruining the rest of the experience.\n\nSo, i think it is sad, because i can see all the care and detail which went into it, but i still had no fun playing at all, nothing to think about when i stoped playing and no reason to replay it ever.

The leap where you have to sprint and let go of the right mouse button; that was terrible.  I rarely actually did the leap and instead just did the regular power jump.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JazzyJamboree/recommended/278360/","JazzyJamboree","Jazzy Jamboree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JazzyJamboree/","109 products in account","I bought this game when it was on sale for $2.50. That's like the price of a bottle of Pepsi. In that sense, I would rather have played ASAMU than have that soda, but at its full price of $13 there is no way I can recommend this game. The trailer made it look like a lot of fun, and for some brief moments it is- but the experience is short and marred by many flaws.\n\nThe first thing I noticed right away is that the voice acting is horrible. Not quite Far Cry 2 levels, but pretty close. The narrator speaks flatly, choppily and sounds extremely unnatural. At best, he sets the premise- at worst he made me want to scream at the game and rage quit. The best example of this has to do with Maddie- Jesus, did I hate this character with an unbridled passion. When the narrator offered to take her on his back I threw my hands to my face and felt like sobbing. The minute I got to the first town I tried to leave her behind because she is so shrill and obnoxious, I did NOT want her clinging to me. It actually go to be such a nusciance that I muted the voice volume in the audio settings, and that's a first for me. There is already one annoying little girl in this game, there didn't need to be two. She is completely unnecessary to the story, and only serves to highlight how poor the writing was as she is completely flat with no character arc. Starts out as a brat and a loser, ends up in the other town as a loser (and possible brat).\n\nThe concept of Fred cultivating an alien species doesn't really bother me, to be honest, but the design of them was pretty plain. Take a person, hit their face a few times with a sledgehammer, replace their feet with more hands and dump them in blue paint. Boom. You have the frog people. They just make for an extremely dull race that doesn't make me want to sympathize with them. To make matters worse, it's like the game forces you to care about them, because the game grinds to a screeching halt and confines you to the ground at the pace of  your grandma with her walker. These sections only serve to make you think that there is a real story in ASAMU and pad out the game.\n\nEven with this unncessary fluff, I still finished the game in barely over two hours. Like I said, I only paid $2.50 for this game, so the length doesn't really bother me, but damn. For the same price, I got The Fall, which I played for easily twice as long. For twice the price, I got LISA, which is easily 5-10 times the length of this game. Even with the short length, the game still feels very.... same-y. Sure, the environments change a few times, but they're really not eye catching or interesting, and the set pieces are scant with about the same amount of intrigue. If I recall them all, it goes cave, dark cave, one I can best describe as "outside", then ice cave. That's it. Special mention for the Cyclops worm that made me lmao at how cheesy it was.\n\nIn addition to the extremely same-y environments, the gameplay really feels the same all throughout the game as well. Jump, grapple rock, grapple next rock, grapple next rock, land. Sometimes with crystals and more rocks. The only real upgrade of note is the rocket boots, which really don't change the way you think about any of the platforming puzzles. When you can't make the next grapple, you rocket. That's about it. When you get the orange portal in the eponymous series, all the puzzles change. It multiplies, expotentiates your possibilities to interact with the game world- but the rocket boots simply add more of the same.\n\nTo end on a positive note, I will praise ASAMU for this: while I feel that the narrative is weak at almost every turn, I very much like the concept of  the community written theory that Fred was really dead the whole time, dead from a mountaineering accident at the start of the game and the whole story is what the child has made up to believe that he's not rotting in some frozen crevice.\n\nIn the end, I suppose it was an experience I'd rather have under my belt than not, but that bottle of Pepsi really gives ASAMU a run for its money.","June 17, 2015","false","2.1"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","21","46","6","1"

However, there is already a hefty problem.  The game describes being capable of much more than is promised: an environment in which you can ignore the world's laws and use a suit of protective gear to soar through the air in any manner you please.  But, the reality is that the game tricks you.  Instead, it decides when you are able to grapple at your destination, rather than leaving you to your promise.  If this was fore-warned, so be it, but there is no warning, only repeatable trial and error.  I can already tell, this game will be more frustrating than it is worth.  Still, I congratulate the maker on a superb attempt.","December 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Do you like the pain and agony of shaky design? If so, stop reading and buy this game. Otherwise keep reading. A Story About My Uncle suffers from something I'm going to start calling "violent design". In other words, its poor design that makes the player suffer. Is it an adventure game? Exploration? Puzzle? Platformer? The designers obviously couldn’t decide and the player suffers for it. The story is so-so and far to slow to feel story "driven". The platforming is violent towards players in that it is inconsistent, requires the player to be shrewd, yet tricks the player into thinking the design fosters creativity. For example, why is the player limited to three grapples? If its story-adventure, unlimited grapples would have helped the player ignore design shortcomings. If its puzzle-platformer, three grapples should be enough as long as the player is accurate and creative. Unfortunately, the design in this game forces the player to play exactly how they want you to. If you innovate you die. If you can't keep up with the inconsistent grapple distances and objects, you die. Each "puzzle" must be taken on its own terms, the grapple effectiveness changes with each; this forces the player to proceed slowly and with much frustration. Given that the overall theme seems to be story and exploration based, where taking in the environment is most important, the restrictive design seems counterintuitive. At one point the game dares the player not to use the grapple; here its most obvious design flaws are made clear. Platformers should be smooth and momentum based, puzzle games ought to be clever; this section asks you to play a puzzle game using platforms that is both clunky and not clever. It’s just memorization through trial and error masquerading as a free-running, open experience. It mocks the player by suggesting they should be able to travel freely and quickly but punishes them for trying to rely on any kind of design by changing the rules. I'm hoping, once my frustration cools down, to give it another try. However, I'm starting to get really annoyed at this kind of design. Most players may not be old enough to appreciate how bad this design philosophy is but that doesn't justify calling it good.","December 28, 2015","false","3.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

One of the dominant one being getting stuck at the corners of the geometry when grappling in mid air and falling slightly past the object (or grappling the side of the object from below).
