One of the most intimidating aspects of Chess 1: The Original is just the wealth of pre-established metagame that's been developed over the many long years it's been around.  With six (count em, SIX!) unique factions instead of just one, all the old material is completely thrown out the window and you have to learn Chess all over again, and that, I feel, is wonderful.  No longer is it about memorizing countless openings or having a wealth of unfathomable experience.  Instead, you play it like you would play a modern strategy game - thoughtfully pondering your own decisions and creatively coming up with your own solutions.  The midline rule also keeps the action tense throughout and prevents the more boring, drawn-out endgames of Chess 1; it feels like the way Chess was always meant to be played.\n\nIf you have ever been intimidated about picking up Chess before, now's the time to join Chess 2.  The sooner the better - joining in while the game is young will be an exciting opportunity to see it evolve, and to help shape the metagame and history of the game yourself!","August 4, 2014","true","76.4"," 94 of 112 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","94","112","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roder/recommended/314340/","roder","roder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roder/","44 products in account","EDIT: There are no more future updates (afaik) planned for the game, and IMO its a great game but wasn't fully fleshed out with all the basic features. The population has bottomed out, so if you're buying it for multiplayer then you may be out of luck in finding games. This isn't really the developers fault, as indie games have a hard time in capturing a big multiplayer player pool. It was an interesting take for a chess variant, and I hope more tactics games similar to it come out. I am always looking for that next pvp tactical game.\n\nTo Chess Players:\n\nIf you're more of a tactics player (short term captures and plans), you'll enjoy this game. Chess 2 (C2) is a much more fast-paced and unpredictable game than traditional Chess. C2 has 6 armies to choose from (there is the classic Chess army, but also new armies with unique units & movesets), and you can face any of them from your opponent, so games will have very diverse matchups each time. There are also 2 ways to win: Getting your king past midline and checkmate. This ensures games are faster and have less draws. But with the midline invasion rule, it is very "race-to-win"; there are less quiet moves, less subtle improving moves to a better position, less strategic play. Rather, its more just a string of tactical plays IMO.\n\nKnowledge of Chess can help you in C2, but it will only help you so far. You can throw most chess rule-of-thumbs out the window, as there are new pieces with new rules. Controlling the center is good, but controlling the sides is also important as the king usually tries to flank to one side to invade midline instead of going into the center where he'll be mated. Castling early and often is actually a bad move. Fianchetto is waste of tempo, as bishops are on a better diagonal from their starting position. Knights are usually better in C2 because its usually semi-closed or closed positions. And because of that, rooks are usually worse pieces because the position is closed, but also because you castle less often providing less exits for your king rook. However, pawn majority in center is still important (if not even more important), and also the knight on the rim is still grim :-)\n\nIf you liked Chess because of same teams and starting off on even foot, you might dislike the 6 different teams. They are balanced, but are balanced in a bubble (as in they are balanced with respect to Classic Chess army, but some have advantage/disadvantage versus each other). It's a case of Perfect Imbalance (Two Kings army>Reaper>Nemesis>Two Kings). So you might dislike the fact that your army performs better/worse versus the enemy team, but it is is only slight advantage. But this provides opportunity for each game and opening to be very unique. Another factor in the game is the duel system (betting system). Whenever a piece is captured, you can bet against your opponent for the fate of the unit doing the capturing (that unit will also be removed if you lose the bet). This duel system was implemented for mind games, but it is only wild guessing IMO. It is like rock paper scissors, the player that picks his weapon by thinking 7 moves ahead is just as good as the player thinking only 4 moves ahead or 1 move ahead. Although there are limits to the betting system (you only gain betting stones by destroying an enemy pawn), and it is more complicated than I give it credit for, it is still for the most part an arbitrary system.\n\nOverall, I would recommend C2 to chess players, because of its familiarity to Chess but also because it brings new life and something refreshing to it. The less you think of it as chess + new elements, but rather just a new board game with chess elements, the more you will enjoy the game for what it really is :) GL HF.","August 21, 2014","true","23.3"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","4"

The ideas behind Chess 2 seem so good. So far Chess 2 seems like a great Chess variant.\n\nThe problem is that this particular implementation just seems unfinished. You can play Chess 2 against a horribly weak AI. You can play live in 25 minutes a side games and you can play Correspondence games. Your rating goes up if you win and down if you lose (presumably based on your opponents rating).\n\nThe game looks nice and bar a few crashes, plays smoothly. But there is so much missing that you would normally take for granted.\n\nNo rankings ! You can see your opponents rating and yours in game. Out of game you see...nothing. No win/loss ratios. No breakdown of each armies win/loss. No leaderboards!!!!\n\nYou cannot challenge a friend. You play against random opponents only.\n\nFor a game that's supposed to be all about multiplayer this is just unforgivable.\n\nThere are no options. You window resize (unless you edit the game launch properties yourself). The music is nice but you cannot turn it down. You cannot even turn it OFF !\n\nYour games are saved for replay. There's no chess notation. You cannot view your opponents or your own previous moves.\n\nEven the Steam Achievements are just so boring. Again, just ... barely ... there.\n\nMind boggling. If this was early access I'd give it some slack as the core of the game is there and it is great. But in 2014 the total lack of any features is crazy. Especially when you consider the price.\n\nHopefully the game can get some much needed support and thrive but we will have to wait and see.\n\nRight now... I would not recommend this to anyone.","August 25, 2014","false","47.5"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

Chess players should feel right at home, as chess 2 still keeps true to it's heritage. Besides a selection of armies to play as, one of the most significant rule addition is the new median line. Any king that passes it wins, essentially adding a whole new win condition to the classic game of chess. Chess being an old as the hills game, the Sequel does a pretty good job at introducing new metas and strategies to really freshen up this ageless classic.\n\nVisually the game goes with a realistic look. At first glance it may not have the visual impact of a more stylized game, but I think fans of chess will appreciate it's more sophisticated aesthetic. The pieces are well detailed with intricate trimmings and most importantly off all, the new pieces look like they belong in chess, and describe's it's characteristics well.\n\nThough Chess 2's core is strong and enjoyable, it's not with out it's flaws. There are serious "quality of life" issues with the game. The lack of any sort of options, visual, audio, or even a menu is very odd. Even 8bit games have an options menu so I don't understand why Chess 2 doesn't. The game also focus on it's multiplayer. Though there is online play, there is no lobby system, no way to match with your friends currently. This is a huge over sight for a game like this. The devs did mention that they have an update planned for some sort of match making, which is great to hear, but it is missing on it's release so keep that in mind.\n\nOverall Chess 2 is a wonderful game that will have veterans giggling like school girls, delighted at the discovery of new metas. For chess fans, this is an easy recommendation, but if you are just the regular gamer, curious to chess 2, with out more features or an options menu, it's always good to do more research.\n\nPros:\n- Discovery of new metas\n- Armies are interesting and unique\n- Appropriate and detailed visuals\n- New rules are enjoyable\n- Still feels like chess, but new!\n\nCons:\n- No options\n- No Lobby\n- Low on features","August 21, 2014","true","16.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It has some bugs and is missing some features but the core is great and that is what really matters when it comes to games. Some more options and features would have been nice but it has all the essential pieces and you will certainly be able to enjoy the game for a long time.\n\nIt is simple enough that you can get into it fairly quickly but advanced enough so it will feel fresh for a long time and surprise you with new combos and strategies. A must try for fans of the turn based strategy genre or chess fans. If you want a strategy game without luck then this might be the game for you.\n\nThe six armies manages to make new games feel fresh and you have to adapt different strategies depending on who you are facing. The mid-line invasion rule makes the games shorter and more intense and often result in heated battles around the chess boards mid-line. The game feels very balanced, there are no best or worst army.\n\nIf you don't like chess or think you are bad at it I would still encourage you to try this game, I think it feels different enough that you might enjoy it even if you don't like normal chess. Also, if you are bad at chess you will feel right at home here, we are all starting from scratch and are trying to figure out how to play this game ;) However, I think you get better at normal chess by playing this game so this might be something for someone who want to get better at normal chess as well.\n\nIf nothing else I would recommend this game so you can learn the rules and play it with a physical chess against your friends because it is a really fun chess variation when you get the hang of the new rules. I was quite skeptical in the beginning, especially about the bidding and the new armies but it actually works and fits really nice together.

I think it's more fun to think more "on your toes" instead of having to invest time up-front to memorize chess openings in order to enjoy the intricacies of higher-level play (just like how some people don't like having to memorize long combos in fighting games in order to really enjoy the game at even a novice level). Chess 2 really nails this issue, as well as fixing other issues that make it much more fun to play.\n\nIt's not really feasible to have an "opening theory" due to the many different possible matchups, so you actually have to think about the strength of different moves right from the start.\n\nThe midline invasion rule really helps to keep the games from dragging on and making it easier to win without having to figure out how to checkmate or end up with a stalemate.\n\nThe "dueling" mechanic adds a fun challenge of trying to predict what your opponent will do.\n\nOverall, the experience of playing and learning this game has been quite enjoyable, and this implementation gives you a nice way to find opponents to play against that are around your level (using an ELO system), so you don't have to worry about being thrown into match after match with people who are much more experienced than you.","August 11, 2014","true","4.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

While many are skeptical that the game is in some way anti-chess, I think it has taken the best elements of chess and improved them, and it has taken the worst elements of chess and replaced them.  There is no memorization, no two games that look alike, no mobility problems, no useless moves, and (almost) no draws.  It is just you and your opponent. I learned the game before it was developed to be on the PC, which is why my "hourage" is low and why I have early access.  IMO, it is really worth the buy, when compared to the price of an "ok" chess set, with just the regular rules and pieces, the price of Chess 2 is a steal.\n\nQuick P's'n'C's:\nPros\n- extreme depth in strategy\n- elements of intrigue\n- faster (than chess) paced games\n- (as a result of the previous pro) no long games that feel like a waste of time or feel tedious\n- massive replayability (6 armies to chose from)\n- the game is simple and elegant (in its PC form) complimenting its depth and complexity\n\nCons\n- as of yet, i do not see a way of inviting a steam friend, or any friend to play via correspondence, making it a sort of hit or miss if you want to play with someon you know.  Maybe an update will add this feature someday.","August 7, 2014","true","23.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

This game has tons of different armies, each with a different style of gameplay, we have the TWO KINGS mode, which involves two kings that can move around the map very quickly. Nemesis, where multiple pieces lead a focused attack on the king. The animal army, which has a TON of power, but can't move very far.There's an army called Reapers, which have teleportation and immortality.Empowered, which has maximum mobility when pieces are in a team formation. The very last army is the most well-known, classic. The armies adds extreme replay value, and since it's chess no game is exactly the same. Each opponent you go against will never have the same strategy, but the problem is there's not many opponents to be matched up with. I was in the queue for like 10 minutes and I couldn't find a match, which is a shame. Maybe i just tried finding a match at a time that isn't the peak time. The game takes the classic game of chess, and allows many variations on the great game we've all known for a while, to be played on your PC at home. This game is great, and if more people buy it in the future, I can see a very competitive fun game to sit down and play.\n(I am currently making a gameplay video/breakdown/review)","August 25, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
