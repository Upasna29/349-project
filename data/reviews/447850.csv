I am not sure if i am just missing some elements of the game here or maybe there are diffrent pathways i could have taken but regardless it is still pretty short. It is a very interesting experience that is very surreal and i do like that sort of thing.\n\nNow for some pros and cons,\n\npros:\n+very interesting\n+looks pretty good with graphics\n+good way to spend some time\n+each level is diffrent and it feels like walking through a dream\n\ncons:\n- i have a pretty good damn computer and i had some lag at some points\n- very very short, not sure it is worth 9 bucks, i would most likely pay around 3-5 for the ammount of content\n- controls are very floaty, when you look around the camera feels like it is lagging behind (but that is done on purpose, not lag issues).\n- some of the puzzles require google to finnish, as i doubt many people will know these answers as common knowledge\n\nNotes:\n= this is not a story based game, it is very surreal and has no real storyline as far as i can tell\n= there seems to be some christan roots here in the game as god is mentioned and a huge cross is seen, didnt really bother me but i feel like it should be known.\n= aliens(!)\n\ntldr;\nI do very much recommend this game, but i dont suggest buying it when it is not on sale.\n","March 22","true","0.8"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","2"

This game definitely has that aspect, but I feel like it doesn't give you enough clues in the beginning to even figure out what is going on. I got stuck shortly into the game and haven't had a lot of desire to go back and try to figure out the spinning dials on the roof/floor depending on your view.\n\nSure, I could look up the solution on Google, but that defeats the point of playing a puzzle game. Seems cool enough, but leaves a lot to be desired.","May 2","false","1.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

I like sureal explorey type games. I'm not that far into it really but all I have from it so far is frustration. Firsly the intro is too long and cannot be skipped. I have had to restart several times so generally go and make a brew while I'm waiting. When I get into it it always crashes more or less on the first action I do, watch the intro again, or make another brew. I now have omitted the first action and can progress. The graphics are very floaty and seem to have some lag, this isn't comfortable at all, sort of detaches me from the game somehow, maybe it's intentional but I don't like it. Then there are areas with almost all white floors, walls etc. Then bits that just shake. It's almost like Tracy Emin (or whatever her name is) has brought her 'unmade bed' and is trying to convince us it's art.\nIt needs to have keybinding so I can change the defaults. It needs a save, no idea when it does and even though I've progressed a bit I don't think I can be bothered starting it up again. Might leave it for now, I'm full of tea. Recommend? neither yes or no really, some might like it,  but in its present form, and since steam insists I choose an option, no.","March 23","false","0.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It’s an experimental game that is told without dialogue or text but rather through the world itself and what a bizarre and befuddling world this one is.\n\nTo be fair I got through the prolonged introduction and then got stuck in the first room. I got the television to turn on, somehow, but the only button that was working was when I clicked on the giant piece that came from the board game Sorry telling me to remember in the box. In the box, what? I searched throughout the room – from the ceiling with the colorful letters and the room all over for a box. I thought it may have been referring to the TV and I was relieved when it turned on but nothing else I clicked on had any effect. There was a green letter looking thing but nothing I did there did anything.\n\nI admit. I lost patience with the game. There are some on the Steam store claiming that they completed the game while there are others who quit the game because it was the opposite of what they were hoping to get out of the game. Ainslie’s a much more abstract thinker than I am when it comes to these types of games so if she has something deeper to say about her experience with the game then I’ll be certain to add them here. Until then I just can’t recommend the game for the sheer reason that nothing that I did seemingly had any effect and there was nothing obvious for me to click on.\n\nI like to think outside of the box but in this instance the box is a cardboard box that has been saturated and is now limp.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","false","0.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

I was wrong.\nthis game is some sort of adventure puzzle game, and I HATE those haha\nSadly I think I wasted 9 euros but I guess why not support a new game. maybe it will improve?\nIt really reminds me of the Stanley Parable... idk why.\nAlso... I have 70 fps, yet it feels like 15 fps. dunno whats up with that.\n\nIn general I wouldnt recommend it though, its not TERRIBLE and if there was a "Meh" option Id pick that,\nbut its just not what I expected it to be and it takes way too long (at least for me) to figure out these weird puzzles.\nOh and yeah... I f*cking jumped when the Red ball at the start turned into a moon haha","March 23","false","0.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"
