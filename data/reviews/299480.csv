Long before the days of online first person shooters with dozens of players from around the globe, technologically primitive children like ourselves would gather around our ginormous radiation emitting square televisions, fighting each other for a chance to wield the controller next.  Everybody’s household on a weekend was sort of like Lord of Flies, except we had to blow into cartridges before the mayhem could begin.\n\nDieselstormers, the latest effort from Black Forest Studios, is reminiscent of those old school multiplayer shooters of the past, but without the broken controllers (and friendships).  Despite having just entered Early Access on Steam, Dieselstormers is already quite polished for an alpha.  Stylistically, the game stands out with a uniquely detailed art style and beautiful, colorful backgrounds.  Weapons hit the various goblin enemies with a satisfying thud, and the controls are well executed with both keyboard and mouse and gamepad.  Though a full featured single player campaign is already included, the real meat of the game is in the cooperative multiplayer experience, supporting up to four players at a time.\n\nAt the start of Dieselstormers, the player is taken to a main area which houses both their main crafting inventory and the mission selection portal.  The first weapon given is a weak, ineffectual pistol, but with the completion of each successful mission another gun part and crafting piece is unlocked.  Missions are short, generally taking around 5-10 minutes to complete.  Multiplayer progress carries over to single player, so players are free to jump between modes as they choose.\n\nIntriguingly, in multiplayer, your character remains alive at “death”, though with diminished powers and barely the ability to push enemies back.  Upon a player finding a health pick up, the deceased will be revived.  What’s most interesting is that death is not necessarily the end if both players die, as long as some sort of health can be found.\n\nOf course, it must be remembered the game is early access and is still a bit buggy at the moment.  During our multiplayer sessions, we had a few crashes and a bit of slowdown, but considering that this is an early alpha, the game shows great promise.  Despite the minor issues we encountered, we found Dieselstormers to be quite enjoyable.\n\nFor the adventurous, the developers allow work in progress levels to be toggled in the options menu, what they call “construction site mode”.  As the developers jokingly proclaim on the options page, “unfinished content can look like an ork’s backside and play like its underpants.  You have been warned.”  It’s nice to see a developer with a sense of humor, and of course Dieselstormers plays quite well, even in its early state.  Of course, it’s not Black Forest Games’ first foray into the platformer genre, having developed the recent Giana Sisters titles.  Expect Dieselstormers to only improve as time goes on.\n\nDieselstormers succeeds in bringing back that old school platformer vibe, and is the kind of game you can play over and over again with your friends, whether it be in bite sized sessions or for hours on end.  Pick up one copy, or grab four for some intense side scrolling co-op action.  It is available for Early Access purchase on Steam.\n\nFor more game reviews and in-depth information make sure to visit Feed Me Pixels[www.feedmepixels.com].\n\n-Evilhippie","July 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 131 of 162 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","131","162","2","3"

Seriously, break it open and play it now and you're going to be asking "where the hell did this game come from and why wasn't I playing it?"\n\nLet's go back for a moment.  When it first started out - Dieselstormers (its prior name) got dropped into EA too early and unfinished.  The premise was ok, but the overall gameplay was pretty bland, and probably kept you entertained for half an hour before you put it aside and went yup, done that, been there.\n\nIt stayed that way for a while, getting some updates but never really enough to make it awesome.  Most people set it aside and largely never thought about it again.\n\nBut here's the kicker - Realizing this, someone at BFG with large metal gonads actually convinced the team to revamp the game and give it this cool Rogue-style rework.  They added a full set of levels with all sorts of really creative critters, a bunch of bosses, and just boatloads of new content.  I mean like a really amazing LOT of new content.  It just kept getting added and added and added!\n\nWhat came out the other side is a damn good game.  There is a definite Risk of Rain air to it, coupled with much shinier art, an arsenal of unique character classes that change the gameplay, and a whole collection of twisted new items / power-ups that get unlocked as you progress.\n\nThe end result is a blast, and totally worth your time to go back and give a serious playing.  Unfortunately there's a good chance the media will miss this transformed gem now since it fumbled its initial release, but that didn't keep the developers from just pouring love into this game for years, and the end result really shows it.  If you don't already own it, buy this game.  If you do own it, play this game, again.  You'll be glad you did!","March 31","true","219.9"," 78 of 94 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","78","94","7","2"

The game got a lot of potential now that it got a bit of a Rouge-like elements in it. It has a medium pace gameplay so it good for keeping the balance in a Side-scrolling Rouge-like Action game, the pace sure rise higher when you play it in multiplay mode, but right now having people to play with is not that easy (since the game is new).\n\nThe graphics feel quirky (weird in a good way), personally I feel it has a good bright and colorful theme with some mechanical stuffs and monsters (which is a unique theme). But some stuffs can be hard to see since sometime the color tone are similar and they overlap each other. Also the guns graphic is well made, some is extremely well designed and fun to play with.\n\nThe sounds could use some improvement, more gun sounds, more BGMs, more monster noises, etc... Basically more diversity in sounds and more sounds effects. But for moment I think the sounds is decent.\n\nThe gameplay can be expand more, I would say some user customable mode and difficulty could suit this game really well (bosses rush, god mode, extreme mode, etc...). Some noob-friendly tutorial is needed too since the start could somewhat be a little boring since you are being throw in the game with no real explaination - which is important and the game can slip in some of the small story in the tutorial too. I think with just some small tweak the game could get more fun for each stage playthrough (again, Shoot Many Robots is a great example of this). Overall the gameplays should get expand more with some detail touch, so many other great things can be done in the future.\n\nI'll be sure to update this review when the game is updated in the future, but for now I recommend you to give DieselStormers a chance.","July 24, 2015","true","8.0"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","33","37","4","0"

And we bought into it, to support this idea. Then the developer changed their minds and made this into a grind-focused Rogulike with perma-death and item loss on death. Apparently, this was done because "the community said so." On social media sites, of course, not here.\n\nWhen we complained about losing both our money, and the game we actually bought, the devs blamed us for "not being there" when the decision was made. Never mind the FIRST decision we made to support their game as it existed and was promised. Nope; its out fault we didnt have a voice, because we didnt follow them on all manner of social media sites and shout louder in the forums.

The procedurally generated levels, randomized weapons, and the ton of perks you pick up in chests or from shops in the game adds that magical roguelike sauce that keeps replayability high.\n\nThe game is however in early access and is still showing some needed work. There are the occasional monsters who get stuck in walls, characters who's abilities arent complete yet, and a few systems that are either confusing or not quite implemented completely yet. That being said, even with these flaws the game is a solid buy for its price point and will only get better with time.\n\nThe coop ability of the game initially worried me as I thought it would detract from the experience but its been well done and other than a few slightly wonky camera issues occasionally is flawlessly implemented.\n\nI enjoyed my time with the game and think its worth the price point. If seeing some place holders and a few bugs will put you off then wait a bit till development completes. Either way Rogue stormers is a quality game with lots of playability for less than the price of a movie and popcorn.\n\nFor a deeper look at the game check out my video review here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv0uI6iTpiM","October 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","2"

It is then placed in an oven, and baked to a golden brown. After which it is topped with some Rogue like elements like randomized environments, and perma death.\n\nAlso it is very addictive, and has a challenge level right up there with the Dark Souls games. Ergo, you're going to lose constantly, but have fun doing it.

The city needs to recruit troopers - no, shall we say, heroes, to eliminate the despicable Hector Von Goop. . .  Sorry, I meant Hector Von Garg!\n\nRogue Stormers is an action/rogue like / twin stick shooter game where you take control of one of five characters available and save the city of Ravensdale. When you launch the game, you will be introduced to Hector and his fellow minions with a fun cut-scene. Then you will be able to choose which of the three following modes you want to play - single player, couch or online co-op. So far, I have been playing only single player as so many people seem to play online co-op.  You will start with one character available out of five and your goal is to successfully reach and beat the level seven. You will be able to unlock other heroes when you successfully beat two, four, six and the last level (seven). This game is extremely challenging and it will take you time to unlock each one of them.\n\nYou will arrive, really crash-landing on the first level, with some sort of a yellow drilling capsule (that‘s what it looks like to me). Your objective is to find where the boss is located and beat him to go to the next level. As I mentioned above, this game is really challenging and you will encounter different types of goblins, some of whom will be really easy to eliminate and others rather tough. As you move through the levels, you will find chests. Some you will be able to open straight away but others will need a key or a large amount of gold to open. The contents might consist of blue orbs (which are xp), booster items, secondary weapons, gold and even health keg to regenerate your health. Occasionally, you might come across other drilling capsules from fallen heroes (I assume) on each level; just check them out as they usually have great goodies too. Most of the goblins will appear from the Transgoop station and they usually come in a large group at once. As you eliminate them, some will leave behind either gold, health keg or even xp at the place they have fallen. Religiously collect all of the blue orbs and try to fill your xp bar. Each time you reach another Xp level, you will be rewarded with a new random perk (which you will keep) upon your glorious death. Oh, by the way, when you die, you will start from the beginning again. Very tough and unforgiving game.\n\nIn regards to the gold, you can use it at the jackpod (supply) or at the shop which is located on each level. At the end of each level, you will see how many goblins were shredded to pieces and how many points you receive for your efforts. This always make me laugh.\n\nGraphically, the artwork is very nice. Smooth animations and the game runs well. For the controls, you can either use your gamepad or your mouse and keyboard.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	5 character classes\n-	Fun and fast gameplay\n-	Great re-playability\n-	7 challenging and well-designed levels\n-	Heaps of upgrades\n-	Achievements and Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	You might get a bit frustrated at times\n-	Hard to find an online game\n\nI really like this game!

This release build? Much improved, though at some level I lament the loss of weapon-customization, which was never actually implemented to my knowledge. I first became aware of the game during its initial kickstarter campaign, when it was still called DieselStormers. I purchased it from the humble store and didn't have a chance to finally play it until about a year ago, when it was still in a very rough and bland state.\n\nNow what we've got is a tactical, side-scrolling run-and-gun platformer with rogue-lite level and item randomization, and a stylish medieval-meets-dieselpunk presentation. The city of Ravensdale is coming apart at the seams thanks to the rampaging orcish hordes of the corpulent high priest Hector von Garg. The populace faces opression, indiscriminate violence and horrific mutation thanks to the mysterious "Goop" drilled up from deep below ground. But there is hope: the Rogue Stormers, five playable rocket knights: Brecht carries a Contra-style automatic rifle and can buff the team's fire rate, Presto has a flamethrower and can throw up a shield that also doubles his flamethrower's range, Camille has a rocket launcher and can fire a swarm of missiles, Stabbygale has a shotgun and can throw a glaive and pulls in enemies, and El Cazador has a sniper rifle and can fire a huge round that pierces through enemies. You begin with only Brecht, and unlock the others after finishing the second, fourth, sixth and the seventh and final stage, respectively. You also unlock new upgrades that can drop after completing certain challenges.\n\nYour Stormer's primary weapon has infinite ammo and does not need to reload, and you can carry a secondary weapon that recharges over time. The variety of secondary weapons is considerable: Contra-style spread shot, rapid-fire volley gun, mines, attack drones, the rare health grenades, plasma shots, a melee-range claw, sentry guns and even an orbital strike, among others. You can execute a short dash that allows you to go through enemies and dodge their shots. Combat is less fast-paced then other platform shooters, instead rewarding the careful and thoughtful shooter. Enemies and their shots are mostly avoidable, and you are rewarded for conserving your health as much as possible.\n\nEnemies are aggressive, numerous and at times tiresome to kill, but you are rewarded not infrequently with gold, XP orbs, and precious, precious health pickups. Gold can be used to roll at vending machines for health, gold, keys, upgrades and secondary weapons, and also to purchase upgrades directly from shops. Aside from the vendors there are also treasure chests. A few aren't locked, but often will only contain gold or keys instead of an upgraded, but the locked ones, which require a key, 500 gold or 30 health and are color-coded accordingly, always seem to contain an upgrade.\n\nSaid upgrades are similar to those found in other Rogue-lites such as Binding of Issac or Starward Rogue, or the perk cards of Ziggurat. They provide significant boosts to your stats, adding anything from additional maximum health or secondary weapon recharge speed to extra jumps and various abilities that trigger when you take damage, but are lost when you die. However, pick up enough experience drops for a level up, and after finishing a stage or dying, you are given a choice of two random perks, such as a small boost to your damage or movement speed, or a small amount of health restored whenever you purchase something. These perks are incremental compared to the dropped upgrades, but notably, these perks are retained after you die, making subsequent runs just a little bit easier- a welcome addition, considering I have finished only one of five runs thus far. Completing said run rewarded me with a token that can be used to re-roll a perk choice, and presumably you can earn additional tokens for more wins.\n\nI should mention there are some technical problems.

It's barely out of early access, there's lots of small glitches, performance drops and probably multiplayer issues (I played solo). Wouldn't recommend grabbing it before some patching is done and even then probably during a sale.\n\nDuring development this game got changed hugely from the original vision, this final version is now a roguelite twin-stick platformer shooter, similar to Risk of Rain and other such Binding of Isaac-types. You die, you get booted back to main menu to start all over again but hopefully with some more goodies unlocked to the randomization pool. You also collect experience so you can unlock some permanent perks for your characters that persist after death, a bit like Rogue Legacy. The current XP rate is really slow though, expect lots of grinding if you intend to boost your character that way.\n\nThere's only one character/weapon available at the start and I found it the least fun one, try not to be discouraged by it. You'll unlock more characters after killing bosses, but it might take a while. This game is quite punishing and your progress depends a lot on getting good random drops.\n\nCurrently the game is 7 (randomly-generated) levels long and it does get fairly repetitive, not that many different enemy types and surroundings, with the current content I don't think it has the same longevity as Isaac. Mechanics-wise I think Risk of Rain is the more solid pick out of these two but then again I do like this game's theme and art style more, with the Warhammery orcs and all.\n\nI disliked this game for the first couple of hours, but after unlocking some more crap and getting used to the controls and game mechanics it got more enjoyable. The camera can also be annoying, especially between level segments. After all the negatives, it's not a bad game and does some things well, but I doubt it'll blow anyone's mind. I also have no idea if it is better or worse when played in co-op.","April 24","true","23.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

At this point I figure I should drop some thoughts.\n\n-using alt tab seems to let the game still dominate the screen, making it a bother to tab out and talk on skype among other things.\n\n- health is not very plentiful and feels like it should be a little more.\n\n- I'm not a fan of EVERY character other than your starter being locked wit the only unlock option for the others to finish the other various levels that in the begining, you're probably NOT going to complete and get your first character in one sitting.\n\n- You level up, yet it feels like even the stage is getting MORE difficult for leveling up, and the scaling of how much damage they can take according to who's with you can really break the game.\n\n- Sadly I still think converting everything to rogue like and losing all progress is something being over used and done in the likes to sell games with the buzz word rouge like, but I suppose that's a personal feeling.\n\n- In some cases durring online games the lag spikes really yank and unsteady the pace of everything from platform movements to character placing.\n\n- For some reason the camera can start yanking left and right on some stage lay outs, like the game confused it's self with a lay out and makes it nearly impossible to work some of the platform elements. Even if not, why the screen would yank the cam off of you left and right to the point you're nearly off the entire screen is an odd bug.\n\n-If you're paused while online, nothing updates, but the game continues. As such you could be brought back to life and getting killed, and you'll have no idea as the ONLINE pause menu seems to treat the game as if it's still in offline one player mode. Your friends continue on, may even bring you back, and if no one says anything, you will die again, costing the team.\n\n- another hard hitting point, unless you're friends with someone on steam or skype to talk, you're NOT going to be communicating with ANYONE in this game. It's not the worse thing in the world, but it exasperates the problem above.\n\n+ However, I do still like ragdolling and gibbing baddies all over.\n\n+ The enemies are interesting\n\n+ Character designs are interesting,\n\n- but I feel with the difficulty curves where they're at many players won't ever get to use most of them...\n\n+ It's nice to see that the button mapping owrks now. It's a little cumbersome and in it's self in a few details has a bit of a learning curve but it's manageable for most of us.\n\n+ It's nice that the odd design choice to allow peple to run around when they're already dead, potentialy holding up the survivors, has been fixed.\n\n----------------------\n\nOver all the game has vastly improved, but it still has more bug fixes to go, and some of the design choices still feel to really wall people off from some fun at a rate that does not feel progressive. You can get better at the game, you see yourself better at the game, but then the first and second level still climb in difficulty as you lvel up, further hindering the reasoning it feels to such leveling up. Unlocking new items for potential drops is cool with the news paper clipping bit, and the choice of upgrade that seems to happen whenever is kind of neat too, but I don't really feel like I'm able to progress much, and behold my first charachter unlock remains hidden away behind finishing stage 2 which has yet to happen for me either by just hard luck, difficulty cranks of the stages already present, or the odd scaling of various other players just trying to have fun with others actually making for miss matches that hinder their survival chances instead of helping.\n\nWithin this nugget hides a diamond in the rough. If the game could support mid game drop in and out game play when levels are in progress, that would be good. If you had some more charachter choices to suit different play styles from the get go, or at least a bit faster as I had stabagale in the earlier version after a bit of play, that also would've helped. But there are still design choices and bugs that are holding it back. Great game pay concepts, fun action, guns blazing, and the little return of the old character models as stormer interns is a grand fun experience to watch get ragdolled. But I'm just not able to play with any new characters yet, progress, and the game seems to almost punish me for keeping at it longer.....\n\nMaybe I just am not good enough at the style of game now, maybe I'm missing something, but I would've thought that after out manuvering my fellows, other players finally coming in later after mine was the only room public on a saturday afternoon for a while, and over all seem to be the leading element of various players of how to deal with obsticles and enemies alike that maybe, MAYBE, I would've gotten past STAGE 2 after about what felt like three hours or so.\n\nAt least a character unlock under a different unlock design like previous builds perhaps.\n\nBut again, I just might not be good at it, but I can say I saw just about nothing but wolf people out there, and supposedly one goo girl who quite out after getting killed early who was the only high level of us all to even have another character.\n\nSo yeah, improved, but it feels like it needs more. I'll try again tomorrow.\n\n\n[Earlier review bellow]\n\nGoing on year two and the game has gone thorugh many changes, sadly not for the better. The concept of the origional game holds place in people's hearts yet sadly converted into a rouge like that doesn't quite capture what the kickstarters wanted. These things might be forgivable if more progress has been made, but in reality the screen to re map even a game pad, or have three pre set control methods is there in the menu, but doesn't work properly for your controller re mapping pleasure.\n\nThe characters, weapons, and world design has some interesting imagination to it, but it's drowned in issues that sufficate the entire package into making a lot of people even think the game was abandoned, which is said NOT to be the case. Yet sadly the last notable update that was made recently has only further made the game unstable and thus more crash happy.\n\nAs of this writing, the game is pretty broken. Between crashing, re mapping menues that don't truly re map all buttons for controller, a hard to justify loading time for even it's launcher, and the over all heart break that is many people who hoped for a shooter with some slight RPG building elements seeming more turned into a die once start from scratch mentality with everything, makes it feel like a game that's stepped backward into alpha, tripped over it's own feet in trying to do something popular, and cracked it's crown until it forgot what it was.\n\nDespite all this, I keep it a bit harsh but real, because I do keep hope for the tittle in it's concepts and world design. If they got back to their roots, and really knuckled down into the work, this game could be a loot grab smash that would set some bars for others, teaching games like shoot many robots, how to do it right with a much more thought out plot and concept that's more identifyable with imagination. But until they dare to get back to those roots, or at least really start making progress forward again, this game has fallen into a kind of developer hell.\n\nIt feels like it indeed has been abandoned by a chunk of it's origional ideals and developers. Don't spend much on it now, not in it's current state, but do put it on your wishlist and following so you can see if it turns it all around, because the idea of the game it was MEANT to be ORIGIONALY is indeed quite the interest with what could be very solid game play.\n\nBut right now it has a long way to go, a lot of growing up to do. Still I'll be checking back on this one, because I want them to take these harsh thoughts and not give up, but move forward with them.","January 4","false","10.9"," 56 of 101 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","56","101","3","8"

The developers have put continuous effort into the game, leaving us with updates and major in-game changes every now and then, showing their interest, passion and support for the game and the community. As the game itself needs a lot of work when it comes to optimization, graphic customization options and mechanics, it's been a victim of improvements from the very beginning.\n\nGraphically the game is one of a kind - messy, vibrant, colorful, with tons of small details that almost aren't noticeable in the background amidst the action - the urban scenario presents itself to you in a unique way that gives this game its own visual signature, almost making you wish this weren't a 2D platformer and that you could explore the scenario in a depth that only a three-dimensional world could provide.\n\nWith the amount of titles in the market that follow the classing roguelike mechanic, it's hard to make a game satisfying based solely on the act of killing monsters, but Dieselstormers isn't too far from providing us this awesome sensation. I feel like the campaign itself needs to be explored more, maybe by giving a bigger objective to work with in order to make the player feel he has a bigger purpose, rather than just stepping into the world shooting anything that tries to kill him. The current diversity in weapons and enemies does create a fun enough challenge for anybody who needs to blow off some steam for a couple of hours. If you and your friends are getting this game, you'll be able to experiment the Multiplayer that in its current state is a bit stale, unless you find your own friends to play with; it's the easier way to have fun in this crazy adventure where there's still room for a ton of improvement.\n\nThere's not much else I can comment on apart from a few glitches I encountered; it's important to mention that some have already been fixed throughout development. Being this an Early Access game it's expected to house glitches, and I have no doubt all will be taken care of in due time.\n\nLooking at Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, another title brought to us by Black Forest Games, I look forward to the future of Dieselstormers. I have faith in this company and I strongly recommend you give this game a try if you wish to support its development while still having fun in the process.","July 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","2"

It is not a dual-stick shooter, however, but rather a side-scrolling shooter, gameplay-wise comparable to titles like Metal Slug and, to an extent, the aforementioned Roge Legacy or Castlevania, though obviously with less focus on melee combat.\n\nIt does offer a few unique twists though, such as complete free-aim and a plethora of secondary weapons. You won't have to worry about ammunition either, and can fire from all barrells pretty much full throttle :D\n\nThe game offers multiple playable characters with individual special abilities (all but one of which you will have to unlock by playing & progressing), plenty of unlockable pasisve perks and powerups, and secondary weapons. The latter two of which you will have to collect anew in each run, while the others are permanently unlocked (hence the roguelite moniker).\n\nPersonally, I find this game quite enjoyable and well worth the price of admission. A great pickup game to do a run or three when the fancy strikes. While the gamepad controls took some time getting used to, the keyboard + mouse scheme should feel fairly intuitive to most gamers. The comic artstyle and the over-the-top lore (if you want to call it that) might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's the type of game where gameplay counts most and this the game does very well!\n\nThe game's co-op modes offer great fun as well, both locally and online, and from what I've seen (admittedly, I'm not overly involved), the devs seem to be on the ball as well, delivering patches and update to accommodate the community feedback.\n\ntl;dr\nI would recommend Rogue Stormers to any fan of side-scrolling shooters / action-based roguelites / co-op pickup games.

It reminds me a bit of Shoot Many Robots, but it has a cool Gauntlet feel to the levels and how they're broken up and it brings that sweet, sweet Roguelite touch with satisfying character progression per play and slower but steady permanent perk progression as you collect experience orbs. It's a difficult balance to get right since it's the line between "classes" and customization, but this game has the right combination of random start and progressive unlocks, and since a recent patch has great pacing between those permanent upgrades too (was previously a little slow, but they fixed it). Some might find the character permanent perk progression a little bit less than ideal because you have to pick, blindly, between two random options...

The boss battles are varied and enjoyable, with a difficulty that doesn't let you run to the end of the game your first go, but makes you feel like you are chipping away at it more than running into a brick wall.\n\nThe most impressive part of the entire game, for me, is how I enjoy playing it solo even though it is better with a group - many games like this give you a boring or tough time going solo, and it is only enjoyable with multiplayer - not Rogue Stormers.

Weird enough to make you go "huh?" but also cool enough to make you go "...that's pretty awesome."\n- Tight, responsive controls and very few deaths where I feel cheated by b.s. kills.  If I die, I feel like it was my fault, not some rubberband AI or unavoidable things.  It's HARD, like 1990s SHMUP hard, but it feels like it should be.\n- Collecting the upgrades, perks and powerups is random and expensive(the gold drops seldom feel like there is enough), but most of the things collected are worth it, and even things I didn't particularly care for, I could see how they would benefit players of a different playstyle than mine.\n- Different characters, unlockable = YES.  I wish there were more characters, and it's hard as hell to get some of them now, but that's a minor gripe.\n- Metroidvania style map system makes backtracking and taking the chances of clearing everything out before the boss a risky and fun affair.\n\nThings I DON'T like:\n- Framerate/v-sync issues.  I don't own a powerhouse rig, but I definitely have one that will run fullscreen modern FPS without missing a beat, Wolfenstein: New Order runs on full rez and epic quality with almost no issues.  This game has so much going on - I don't know if it's rendering background as detailed as the foreground or if there are simply too many particles or light effects, but this game ABSOLUTELY CHUGS on full quality, and even on lowest quality I get kinks and screen tears.\n- I wish there were more visual variation between players during multiplayer.  A colored halo, a circle around the feet, a larger arrow over the head or something, but in all the SHMUPpy chaos it gets really tough to figure out who you are, and often. Many a time have I confused myself for a friend in local multi and end up getting shredded.\n- As much as I like the psychedelic visual style, I wish there were more variation in the roguelite elements.  I often see the same patterned rooms(roof you can't reach without a squid*, lightning pits with symmetric blade spinners, platforms you can't reach under the lightning platform) and the enemies don't change much in style.\n- Some elements in game you just have to figure out.  For instance, the *squid in the rooftops.  It took me about 15 plays finding him to realize that you had to shoot him but get close so he grabs you with his tentacles - this game is arcadey enough that I don't think it would be detrimental/take me out of the experience with some on-screen prompts with the more esoteric parts of gameplay.\n\nFor it's faults, this game is still fantastic and a hardcore challenge, especially in local multiplayer, and highly recommended - I tested it out at PAX East and was entranced immediately, and the Steam version does not disappoint.  If they fixed JUST the framerate issues, I would give this a 9/10, but as it stands it's more of a 7/10 - which is still fantastic.  Highly recommended.","May 14","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Major changes were made back in March/April 2015 and I need to play them to re-review.  It still shows promise, but is significantly different from the prior content.\n\nOld review:\nRecommended for the promise this game shows.  It was worth the coupon to grab a 4-pack with me and some friends.\n\nOverall I'd say 6/10 so far, but it's improving as development continues.  I have only played single player so far.  Currently, there are 4 level types.  Each level is a randomly generated map that consists of buildings which you can traverse through, over, or under.  Enemies show up to get in the way and sometimes drop crafting materials.  Sometimes you can (or have to) dash to the end of the map without really shooting anything.  For bonuses, you can perform some extra objectives.  The mission select screen displays 6-8 missions with randomized objectives and loot, and difficulty ("challenge level") based on your recent performance in missions.\n\nGameplay:\nI really like the combat.  It's your typical dual-stick style run-with-keyboard, aim-with-mouse sidescroller similar to the controls of Bastion or Crimsonland.  The unique grapple system and dashing ability allow for a lot of maneuverability.  It could use some polishing, but as a game control preciseness and intuitiveness freak, I don't have any big complaints.\n\nWith no story, it currently boils down to unlocking new components for your weapon and then farming the materials to craft said gear.  Even unlocked gear costs money to craft if you replace it later, which I'm hoping they fix soon because it really cripples the fun of experimenting with different weapon pieces for crazy firepower and effects.  Currently, with a very short total game time, I'm firing literal artillery shells (bigger than my character) that bounce, leavy sticky goo on enemies, and sometimes fire off their own mini-projectile launchers.  FUN!\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks great, that's for sure.  From BFG reps on the Community boards, it is an upgraded version of the engine than ran Giana Sisters.  Sadly, it's not optimized and is therefore heavily taxing very good systems based on Community reports.  The nice part is, even at the low res I'm running, it still looks very nice, runs smoothly (instead of low framerate, the overall game speed scales down; YMMV on multiplayer...), and doesn't shrink my screen real estate to the point where I can't see anything (looking at you, RTS games...).  As a power user, I'd really like to be able to customize every little bit of the graphics for ultimate efficiency (min/maxing by turning off shadows, reflections, ragdolls, and speeding up corpse removal).  Hoping they add that soon.  Changing my NVIDIA performance settings didn't have a noticeable effect.\n\nI plan to update this review as the game continues development.  It's a good bit of fun now, but I'm really looking forward to a more efficient crafting system and the upgrades to allow armor crafting as well.  They just added perks within the last week, and I unlocked (bought with materials) my first one without a huge investment from my modest pool of crafting materials.\n\nGood luck to all, add me if you want some multiplayer!","October 11, 2014","true","10.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The devs are never afraid to play with new ideas and weed out those that don't work well - even though it means discarding a lot of hard work. They are also doing a great job at listening to the community. I was lucky enough to test the upcoming build at this year's Gamescom and it's another huge step forward. While the long-term motivations (character leveling, permanent upgrades, etc.) are still a work in progress, the game in its current state is already good for a few hours of couch co-op fun. The random level generation works well, graphics and SFX look and sound great and the gameplay is well balanced. The different characters' primary weapons add variety and the secondary, collectible weapons are real game-changers and not just gimmicks, especially when you play alone or with just one other person.\n\nA few visual aids are missing that make it hard to understand what's going on at first: A clear description of what the different weapons do; different icons for collectible weapons to make them easily recognizable; a minimap to show already explored areas; a noticeably placed hint to when a character is low on, or out of health - all that would be helpful. And, of course, more levels, more badguys, more bosses. But if I understood the devs correctly, or extrapolate from my experience with the game's past progress, I'm sure we can expect all of that in a future build.\n\nI believe that the game's current state is a good representation of what we can expect from the final product. Being early access, the game is obviously still short and lacks some polishing; but that which is there is already great fun. If you are going to Gamescom this weekend, make sure to stop by at area 10.1 and see for yourself.","August 7, 2015","true","14.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You can even laugh together at its occasional bugs WHICH aren't bad as far as Early-Access games go.

I'm a huge fan of Spelunky, and was looking for an equivalent game that was more weapons oriented.  Nuclear Throne is a fun option that I really enjoy, but I was looking for a roguelike action game with more modern graphics, and with a side scrolling -- rather than top-down - orientation.  Risk of Rain is another possibility, but again, I'm not a big fan of the pixelated graphics, and I always disliked the fact that one couldn't aim diagonally or vertically in that game.  Dieselstörmers is far closer to what I was looking for\n\nDieselstörmers plays best with dual sticks.  Although the left stick does aim, the fact that you're also using it to move creates inaccuracy, and using both sticks, you can walk and dash backwards while shooting.  You shoot automatically whenever using the right stick.  As far as I can tell, you never swap out your primary weapon, but you'll find more  powerful secondary weapons in short order.  You also have a cool-down ability that enhances your weapon's capabilities.    You can find temporary upgrades to weapons and armor that expire when you die, but whenever you complete a mission, you receive a permanent "perk", that stays with you as you repeatedly die.   I'm generally not a huge fan of permanent upgrades in action roguelike games, as I prefer a game that one can complete in a single run.  One shouldn't have  to die hundreds of times in order to earn enough gold to buy sufficient upgrades to complete the game (as with Rogue Legacy).  That said, this game doesn't seem to verge too far in that direction. Gold doesn't purchase permanent upgrades -- only the completion of missions does, and if one were to complete the game in a single run, they'd have access to the same "perks" as one who dies multiple times.\n\nI'm hoping to see more variety in secondary weapons, as I've only counted about four or five in the first two missions.  I'm hoping that will expand in subsequent levels or in future updates to the game.  The game is not complete yet, so I'm excited to see what features they add in the future.\n\nGut gemacht, guys.

I plan to play it some more which is why I bought two pack copies as I plan to play this with someone else and see how that works. I definitely would not say it's worth $18.99 for one copy and $29.99 for two when the sale is over. Maybe they will add a ton to this game in which case it would be worth that but only if they plan on never adding DLC. If they do plan to add DLC then yes this game is over priced for what you get judging by what they plan to add to the final game and what they currently have. I do love the visual style of the game and you can see a lot of time was put into detail. I don't regret paying the sale price of $17.99 because that's basically $9 each which is about what I feel it's worth right now ($8-$10).\n\nThat aside, there are a few glitches but it's early access so it's not even worth mentioning! I like the controls and I love that you can access other windows on the computer because this game doesn't force you to keep the mouse in their game window or to be in fullscreen. Basically you can go back and forth with instant messaging, check your facebook if you have one or do other things while playing this on the side. The visual cstyle and everything looks really nice, aside from some textures feeling out of place with lower quality. The lightning/light orb does get annoying as it bounces around a lot where I'd rather it mostly follow me, so that is quite distracting. This game seems meant for multiplayer, as I'd imagine it would be really fun with others playing with you.\n\nAll in all, I'd suggest buying it but mostly if you have friends who can play with you at this stage of development. Also I'd only suggest buying it during sales because $18.99 is overpriced where the game stands at the moment.","September 1, 2014","true","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

We had a mission-based sidescroller, we had a rogue-like with generic characters with generic weapons and now we have a full crew of characters.\n\nA bit of history: this fact (passing to roguelike) has caused a lot of controversy in the community of the game. Some people liked the idea of a mission-based sidescroller with weapon customization way more than the current roguelike approach which is more hardcore.\n\nBut in my opition this change turned out to be for better. This whole idea even though it sounds good in theory - in practice it just didn't work. It was an attempt to take Diablo-like loot system and put it on top of a 2D shooter. Lack of diversity left the game content-less and somewhat boring for me in just 20 or so hours (now I have 120 and counting), I only continued to play from time to time to do achievements which were boring to complete because the diversity was completely exhausted by that time. There were also a lot of balancing issues and it was a bit hard to coop when people had different progress.\n\nSo now the game offers a unique experience with each of the 5 characters, random generation and loot (secondary weapons and upgrades) keep the game relatively fresh from run to run, progressive unlock of those upgrades makes sure diversity doesn't kick in too fast.\n\nGameplay wise there's not much to say - it's very fast-paced and quite challenging. The controls (which are the bane for a lot of platformers) are quite good. The only real problem in my opinion is that doesn't explicitly follow the "fair" roguelike spirit (which means you can complete the game flawlessly). Sometimes there're hazards which are de facto unavoidable, even though it's realtime and theoretically everything is avoidable. This might annoy the hell out of you and put you on tilt if it happens too frequently in a short timespan. Fortunately the game is quite generous on health pickups so overall it's acceptable, dying due to only truly unavoidable damage is almost impossible.\n\nAmong other pros I'd say the awesome style of the game, this "fantasy meets steampunk" theme just rocks.\n\nBeing released in the end of April this game had quite a number of technical problems but as for now almost all of them seem to be fixed (ilol'd from inivisible non-interactable barrels draining CPU when you are in the rooms with them).\n\nUpdate[01/05]: I'll write a full review when I have some time and play a bit more the final version of the game.\n\nOld "review" from Dec 2014:\nDespite being in Early Access it is already a quite playable and fun game with a lot of potential to improve and I believe in Black Forest Games (judging by Giana Sisters) that they will make Dieselstormers a great game.","December 15, 2014","true","133.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

I'll get that out of the way right now. It's not a game that I can even remotely recommend in its current state, as while I can see potential here, I don't know if this game even knows what potential it has, or where it really wants to go. This is a game I REALLY want to like, but I just can't in this condition.\n\nI was in great debate in buying this, because while I was ALL for it seeing the trailers and footage, the reviews made me wary. A lot of the recommended reviews always seemed to recommend this tentatively, while the negatives had no problem voicing why. I feel I completly understand the first ideal. Again, I see really interesting potential, but if this current iteration is "launch" quality, I think we might never get there.\n\nFirst off, this framerate completely eats when moving horizontally, which is not only murder to a side-scroller, it's not easily deflected by "your computer sucks!", as I purchased the 4-pack for friends and each of them experienced the issue.\n\nGranted, that was hardly the first sign something was wrong. The game downloaded vastly different amounts of data on each of our PCs. My install total was slightly over 4 gig. Another friend had to install over 5. Another only 2. The one who's download consisted of only 2 gigs was then unable to start the game at all and gave up in frustration immediately. The rest of us dropped off after seeing the odd issues.\nEnemies spawning into walls while their shots went through them.\nItems in co-op appearing for other players and then vanishing when they attempt to take them.\nThe frankly ridiculous amount of shots it took to kill ANYTHING, even the standard mooks, in this Contra inspired game.\nBoasting 5 character classes, and having them all locked behind a progression wall, forcing us all to have to play the same character.\nThe fact the game would LOCK you into keyboard controls in an invite-only multiplayer match, because it took the "shift-tab" input for the interface as a signal that you suddenly wanted to use a keyboard instead of a controller. The only way to fix this, mind you, is to spam buttons on your controller ONLY as you're loading into the match. Once you're in the room, you're stuck with what it gave you, and have no way to change it.\n(I was recently made aware this was just fixed, so there might be hope yet. Too late for me, though.)\nThese all frustated my group so much they all immediately swore never to play it again, and refunded my gifts back to me.\n\nThese are the kind of alpha/beta level bugs that easily should have been ironed out or addressed in Early Access, but the stories I hear of this game having changed its name and direction so often in Early Access, is immediately telling by the condition of this launch title. I know we live in the age of digital media, and developers can fix their issues, or change their games with a simple upload now, but to be out of early access, claims this is representative of the final product. Unless it completely changes from this state, I can't recommended this at all, unless you have faith this really is just another beta stage.","April 28","false","2.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","1"

After doing a quick tutorial of learning the controls which feels really smooth and very easy to learn.  Alternating between 2 types of dashes, how to pull yourself into vortex with shift, and customizing your weapons. You can either play the game with a controller or a kb+M and pref kb+m is better atm. I logged onto the multiplayer found my friends and started the journey with our guns vs a sea of orks.\n\nThe gameplay is a run and gun shooter with co-op capabilities of up to  4 players. The single player could  be pretty tough without friends so make sure ya bring a partner for this one. The goal of the game at the moment is to reach the boss and kill him to obtain  randomized loot drops. From the look of things this game will be turning out really well as stuff is being added since it is early alpha, right now you are offered randomly generated levels and yes, the levels of the area randomly goes up and down also. There are 3 types of things you can modify on a gun at the moment as you find them.  Frames, engines, and the barrel.\n\nThe game 2 of us maybe 2 times but the game played smoothly for the others, besides that there isn't too much problems except that we had a blast with it I posted a playthrough video below for you guys along with what is in the game at the moment. Cannot wait for additional content to get our hands on. Also the devs are very interactive with the community and that deserves support.\n\n\n+ Artstyle that is well done and fits the theme of the game\n+ Music that gives you adrenaline to pull triggers on every orc.\n+ Game offers randomly generated levels, drops, and contents = Replayability.\n+ Even after death, your teamate is useful for tackling little goblins\n+ Customizable guns, change frames, engines and barrels.\n+ 4 Player co-op multiplayer\n+ Multiple paths, anyone can travel bottom, top, middle, and rooftops\n+ Destructable armor pieces as you take damage\n+ Cool concept with the line showing where your party is, if someone lagged behind you can port them for lagging\n+ Devs that keeps in contact with the commnuity is a plus in my book and deserves support.\n\n\n* Stuff I can't wait to see and waiting on\n\n- Can't wait for more bosses\n- More rare drops from orks that will make us take our time killing every orc top down.\n- Locations other than the town\n- More armors and the customization\n- More orc varieties\n- The destructables!\n- More stuff to stop our speed run madness to give us the challenge ;)\n\nGameplay Playthrough Video with me, SujiEun, KashraFalls, and MLG KOY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrwHnMbo_tc&feature=youtu.be\n\nVideo review - reserved for when the game is completed :)","July 16, 2014","true","3.2"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","27","51","0","2"

You play several different levels and each level gives you different items. Those items are always materials you need to make your own gun. You can also find extra materials throughout each stage. As you progress, you get better guns, and can kill bigger and badder enemies. The game somewhat resembles Shoot Many Robots, but with more customization of guns, and no armor or any other sort of gear. Just guns.\n\nThat being said, this game definately has its flaws. One of the main things about this game that I had a problem with was that there are very little explanations for what you are doing. What is that glowing ball that they call an arc? Why am I fighting? Each stage has a difficulty level but I don't know my own level, if I even have one. Another thing that bugged me was the stages. They all felt randomly generated, but not in the good way. Some stages just felt like no human in their right mind would think the layout was a good idea.\n\nThe game does try and give you slight explanations for everything, but it doesn't really make much sense. If you look by the lack of explanations, then we can look at the gameplay. I do like the gun customization, but I don't like that there is no other gear to get. You won't get any armor or customization items besides the guns. The only thing that makes you and your co-op partners distinguishable from each other is the color. Everything else looks exactly the same.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, but it doesn't have what you would expect from a full fledged game. lt is in early access, and is the reason why I still recomend it. I can see a great future for this game once the problems all get fixed.","August 31, 2014","true","3.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Not really because of the gameplay but I cant sit by while we were essentially lied to.\n\nWhen the game came out it was dexribed as a game where you got EXP, collected loot, customized your dude and had a blast.\n\nThere are people who are rating the game positive going "It used to be a bland game, and now it's a blast with this new Roguelike design!".  Heres the thing, the idea of EA was so they could polish the game and make it better, to adjust and add to what was there.\n\nWhen I got the game I wanted it for the customization, the loot, and the EXP. I did not buy it for a Roguelike, I enjoy a good roguelike here and there, but thats not what I wanted when I purchased this.\n\nI mean, imagine going and buying an Early Access adventure platformer based on relaxing and fun platforming, and then because of a survery or something they turn it into an IWBTG style platformer. That isnt what you bought, right? You'd be upset, wouldnt you?\n\nPeople buying it now know it's a Roguelike, they're getting what they paid for, thats fine. I played four hours or so and I can safely say no, I didnt much like it. Leveling was a chore, the perks feel shallow and quite lame, often times you'll go two or three stages without any items because you'll have no gold or a key.\n\nIt was all a massive chore to me.\n\nSo in short, I dont recommend it. But if you want a Roguelike game, who am I to stop you?","October 29, 2015","false","7.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

I love shooters, I love Rogue-likes, this seemed like a solid match. Unfortunately in its current implementation the controls are still not quite feeling right, the action of the game is far more stilted than I'd like (it flows poorly, though some of this may be the random level layouts and the way enemies are placed), and it just feels empty at this point, again especially given the asking price when I've played far better games of this general kind that can easily come in at half the asking price.

This was a nice try at a side scrolling, bullet hell shoot'em up, but it seems to fall short.\n\nThe replay value of the game is somewhat lack luster and the characters are not that interesting.  Along with that the game is so reliant on you getting "level ups" while playing for you to even make your player stronger in game.  This leads me to my second issue with the game.\n\nThe game frequently crashes after a couple hours play time.  This means that any level ups you earned while playing are gone!  This is unacceptable for a game that is completely reliant on that feature of the game.  I played for 4 hours and it crashed twice each time at the end of the play through.  The first time I was even on the final boss and it crashed.  This either needs to be fixed immediately for me to even consider playing this game again.\n\nAll and All, I would not buy this game for myself or any of my friends if given the chance.","April 25","false","4.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamdrain/recommended/299480/","steamdrain","Drain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamdrain/","175 products in account","So... I originally Kickstarted this one a long time ago before its second name change. What was originally known as Ravensdale is now finally released as Rogue Stormers. I didn't have that high of expectations... but perhaps too high, as I'm quite disappointed and underwhelmed by this final release. I don't care that much how it changed over development like others seem to... I just care about what we have now. I put in over a dozen hours, unlocked 2 extra characters, got a bunch of perks... and I'm honestly bored with it, despite never seeing to the end of the game. This is probably as much as I'll ever play it.\n\nWhen you first start playing, it's impressive. The theme is clearly Warhammer, but for whatever reason, they didn't license it, even though that license is given out in backalleys at this point to anyone that wants it. Have you seen some of the Warhammer games on Steam these days...? In any case, it's space marines and orks. It looks nice. It does have good controls, and switches between controller/keyboard on the fly, something 60$ titles like Dark Souls 3 still can't do to this day. I found the map to be quite useful in this game, which doesn't spin btw, another forgotten game design concept. You have to roam around levels repeatedly in this game, so, enjoy those nice map markers.\n\nBut like every game out of Early Access or Kickstarter, it feels unfinished. It has frame rate issues everywhere, and freezes regularly in its menus. I don't know why these issues made it to release. I can't even read the "story" pages because the game just keeps freezing on that screen. It's absurd. The randomization clearly isn't tested enough either. Enemies and items regularly spawn or clip inside walls, where they cannot be reached. The fire guy you unlock after the first marine, his own fire blocks enemy projectiles on screen, which seems stupid and I don't think it's intentional. It just seems like the game isn't polished enough or they'd have put enemy effects over player effects so you can see wtf you're doing.\n\nI think the main killer for me here though is the difficulty. The game is punishingly difficult, as if stuck in hard mode with no way to turn it down for normal Human players. In this day and age, you should not expect every player to be a grand champion of platformers, or at least have selectable difficulty modes. You only get 1 life per run, and lose everything upon death. You do get permanent perks per character, but they come off a painfully slow amount of XP per run. The perks don't do much, meaning you'll have to grind for ages stacking them up. To make this worse, the perks aren't even shared between characters, of which there are 5. If it takes so long to grind them up, why can't they just be shared then? After all the grinding, if you switch characters, you're back to being fodder.\n\nBut it has Co Op! Ya, that Co Op. The Co Op, which should have been a selling point, is actually one big failure as far as I'm concerned. Cool, Co Op with up to 4 players! I can't wait! But you all share the same screen... wait, what? Really? We're over the internet here. We should be able to roam levels freely. Wtf were they thinking with this? This ruins the entire game for Co Op, and I didn't bother to Co Op right after I realized it did this. Just terrible. I couldn't imagine trying to play through the game like this. You have to be attached at the hip to every player you're with, which is a suicidal mess, and doesn't allow the freedom you'd expect on open ended levels. The game is designed for free roaming of levels but basically doesn't allow you to do it in Co Op. You can also easily be killed by enemies off screen because the camera is stuck in the other direction. Wonderful. They really should have let everyone freely roam levels. This is not like Trine or Gauntlet, games you can actually get through with a shared screen. Here, sharing the screen is a nightmare. Have fun with that. It should have been like Borderlands, where everyone can go anywhere in each area.\n\nSo... this is what you get for your 20$; a frustrating overly difficult buggy mess most players probably won't see the end of before giving up on. With better polish, a less punishing difficulty, and a decent Co OP, I would have highly recommended this. But as it stands... I honestly wish I didn't Kickstart this. I'd recommend Rogue Legacy instead, which is better in practically every way.","April 24","false","17.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Below that, I'll summarise my main points made in the video, should you prefer to read instead.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rz15cj6Dgw\nGraphics: Passable, but even compared to the earlier effort by BlackForestGames (Giana Sisters), DieselStörmers does not look anywhere as good. This probably has to do with the procedurally generated levels, which feel very generic and lack pretty scenery or noteworthy landmarks.\nSound: Barely existent. The music is incredibly minimalistic and does not underline the action gameplay in any way. The sound effects also fall short and do not properly represent the gameplay on screen. Guns sound like baseballs bats instead of mighty plasma rifles etc.\nGameplay: In short, the gunplay is generic, repetitive, without any challenge and ends up being tediously boring. The crafting is really slow as you need parts to actually use the drops, you need to at least complete two missions (later maybe even more) to equip one item. Therefore progress feels slow, missions unrewarding and the overall game does not appeal to me. Ontop of that, DieselStörmers also has to fight with a multitude of stability issues, frame drops and other problems. Currently, I cannot recommend DieselStörmers.","July 17, 2014","false","1.6"," 39 of 85 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","39","85","0","8"

The game is now trying to be like Risk of Rain, which is a good game, but it fails to really deliver interesting gameplay. The game changed names from Dieselstörmers to Rogue Stormers to most likely match the Rogue-like gameplay of, "start a new game/character and play until you die, then restart from the beginning."\n\nThe enemies' attacks can often go through walls and floors, but not always, even if the attacks look the same. Standing behind what should be cover from attacks becomes dangerous because of this. The enemies are boring (simplistic AI) and will jump through walls and floors to get to where they need to be to attack you. This often leads to an enemy being inside a solid floor shooting through it at you, while you are unable to kill it.\n\nThe camera is locked to the area you are in, so you can't look down into a hole before jumping in, which leads to a suicidal enemy immediately blowing you up before the camera even has time to scroll down.\n\nThe characters you can play as are not very different at all. The primary weapon is different and there is a single unique active ability each character has. The active abilities are poorly balanced. Essentially the long cooldown abilities are terrible. They aren't powerful enough to justify the long cooldown, when the short cooldown abilties will kill all the enemies on screen anyways.\n\nThe random chests in the world have no logic to their set up. You may play through the first mission and there will be only chests that require keys to open them, but you won't find any keys. The next mission you might get keys out of every single chest that you spend health or gold to open, but no chests that need keys. You might find only chests that require gold to open, but not find enough gold in the mission to open a single one. You might find only chests that require sacrificing health to open, but find no healing station things to recover health, so you can only open one.\n\nThe bosses are extremely easy. You can kill most of them by just brute forcing it. Stand still, shoot at the boss, and it'll be dead before it even hits you twice.\n\nIf this was the game that first showed up on Early Access, then this would be a promising start to the game's development, as all these things could be fixed during development, before release. Unfortunately, a release date was announced and this is pretty much the game that it will be.","May 27","false","1.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuehnau/recommended/299480/","kuehnau","Kuehnau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuehnau/","284 products in account","Rogue Stormers is a 2.5D platform shooter. I guess the best way to explain it, it's a little bit like Contra or Metal Slug, with 3D textures. The game gets the "Rogue" aspect from the different layouts of the stages presented, but in all honesty, the stages are so generic, that after playing it for awhile, no matter what the layout of the map, it starts all looking the same. Further, the stages always seem to have the same theme of enemies, so while the stage layout is randomized, it doesn't appear the enemies are.\n\nThere's chests, supply drops, that sort of thing, that also have random loot in it, anywhere from nothing, to weapons or upgrades, to even bombs.\n\nI have to admit, I have a chip on my  shoulder. My friend and I were looking for a game to play co-op together. We found this and I bought a bundle and gave one copy to him. My game wouldn't launch. And I'll admit I was pissy about it. To further add fuel to the fire, when I posted in the forums, a developer (I guess?) said that Monday morning they'd look into it. I didn't like this, the game just launched a few days ago and people were already having problems and instead of getting someone to look into right away, they were going to wait until Monday. Regardless of the situation, their studio, their employees, I didn't like the response.\n\nI had initially filed for a refund, which was denied because I had to get the gift copy back first. But according to my friend, his copy installed and played fine. Annoyed with this, I spent the next 3 hours screwing around with my PC. Eventually I ran Rogue Stormers as admin, I got a error, this error was related to a missing .DLL file for Microsoft C++ 2015.\n\nI already had that installed, so I uninstalled it and tried to re-install it. Nope, no dice, the new package refused to install. After updating all 16 Windows updates, it finally installed properly and the game finally worked. I don't like having to screw around like this for my PC games. The fact all my other games played just fine, but Rogue Stormers demanded special attention ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nSo we finally started playing. The first thing that annoyed us was there's only initially one character to select from. Why couldn't they have included more then one? I mean, seriously, it'd be like buying popsicles from a icecream truck and the guy splitting off the other side and only giving you half. Jesus.\n\nThe difficulty of this game (in co-op at least) is just frigging ridiculous. After playing for nearly 4 hours, we could get no further then level 2. And you know what's even worse? The progression is TERRIBLE in this game. Every time you die, you have to start over all the way from the start, you loose any power-ups or gold you've found, but you can level up and gain these perks that carry over from game to game. In this sense, you can gradually get better and more powerful as you play the game.\n\nThe biggest issue with the perks system is, your perks don't carry over to other characters you unlock. This is a huge problem because of the insane amount of time and XP it takes to level up. Theres5 or 6 different characters, which means you'll end up having to grind out possible millions of XP in order to have each character unlock perks. This is INSANE. The sheer amount of grinding for XP involved is just stupid. Why weren't the perks spread across the entire account instead of making them character specific?\n\nGuess what, after playing the game for almost 4 hours, we both gained 2 LEVELS. Can you even imagine that? Think about playing Final Fantasy, or even playing NetHack, now imagine the game hates your guts, is so hard it's borderline stupid and it takes you 4 hours to gain 2 levels. You can't even choose from a perk tree, it's randomized like a god dang slot machine, so a lot of times you might just be finding the junk perks anyways.\n\nThere's other complaints about the game I want to address:\n\n1. Random people joining private servers.\n2. The host controlling the other players screens for perks, ect.\n3. Graphical Glithces where the screen will just go insane for a few seconds.\n4. For some reason, being invited to a game resets my controls to keyboard and mouse from controller.\n\nThe bottom line is, I already went into this game upset with having to work with it to play it. When we first started playing this game, we were trying to be open minded and learn how the game played and the mechanics. After almost 4 hours playing, we stopped. We were annoyed and upset, we felt like we made no progress and felt like we wasted our time.\n\nVideo games are supposed to be time wasters, but they are supposed to be time wasters you enjoy, ones where you feel like you made at least some sort of progress. Rogue Stormers doesn't do that, it treats your valuable time as garbage and spits in your face.\n\nNot only that, it doesn't deserve the "Rogue" title. It's a generic 2.5D shooter at best with some half-arsed features tacked on. Do yourself a favor and do ANYTHING else with your money then spend it on this garbage.","April 24","false","6.1"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
