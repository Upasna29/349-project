There's also the potential of them getting stuck inbetween pillows, as well as for animals to be on the floor in unreachable areas.\nVictory conditions are glitchy (I've had levels end with tanks still on the bed, or with plushies moving in mid-air), and on hard mode, the fail condition comes with bugs like not resetting (but instead just suspending all animation) when an animal is on the night stand.\nPlushies also have entirely different physics behaviour if you are controlling them versus if you are moving them by pushing them -- for example, a ginormous hippo is light like a feather if you just push it with something else, or a Scaredy Cat doesn't get nervous if it's pushed towards something that should set it off by another object. This might be by design for puzzle purposes, but like the pillow-rocks, it's not fun.\n\nWhat is fun, however, are the nice voice-overs and the animal names (even if "MSP" should probably be a bit more colourful, like a pink/blue checkers pattern).\n\n\nWith a lot more polish, this could well turn into a positive review (extra bonus points for fluffy pillows!).","June 24, 2015","false","1.8"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","3"

You have 40 puzzles where teddy bears need to snuggle up to each other, cats jump away if you move something next to them (and hippos make everyone jump away), "Mr Stinkypants" who needs to be kept away from everyone else, unmovable pillow obstacles that you're not allowed to cross, and in two of the three difficulty levels, the floor is lava. It took me ~4 hours to do and re-do each of the 40 puzzles on each difficulty level to get the achievements.\n\nThese 40 puzzles would actually be suitable for small children, but the rag doll physics are not. It is never clear where you're grabbing the animal that you're moving, it seems to be attached to the pointer by a weak spring that elongates itself, which means accurate placement is nearly impossible, and sometimes you can grab animals mid-air and sometimes you can't. This lack of precision means that most of the time I've been fighting the physics instead of solving the puzzle. (And why don't I get the achievement for completing all levels on normal when I completed them on hard?) Sure, the children's voices are a nice touch, but I don't really know to whom I could recommend this game. Well, here goes:\n\nIf you like to fiddle with ragdoll physics, and if you like stuffed animals and childrens' voices, this is the game you've been waiting for. If you don't, it's probably not.","November 30, 2015","false","4.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

It's a fun puzzle and is very easy to learn. My biggest gripe is the little kid that makes comments continuously as I am going through levels. It's just incredibly annoying. I understand it's based around placing stuffed animals on a child's bed, but said child does not need to say "why are ponies so silly?" and "it's Mr. Biggenbottom!" 75000 times when I'm trying to focus on arrangement. I can only play the game in very short intervals because I find the kid so annoying. Maybe there's a way to turn it off but I haven't found it yet. Overall, great game.

That was until i played Plush. Its just a wonderful idea and possibly therapeutic as well. Each toy type has rules about what will make it happy so in each level you make all the soft toys happy to win that level. So what's great about that? Well everything about it relaxes you, from the music, to the lovable toy designs - unicorns are my fav - to the level of challenge. It provides just enough challenge but never gets frantic or frustrating.\n\nIf you've had too much shooting, killing and blowing up stuff, and need to calm down, making soft toys happy is just what I'd recommend :)","May 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unicorns only like ponies and hate everything else, including other unicorns. Cats hate hippos. Tanks hate little girls. And everybody hates skunks. Man, I don't envy the person who has to place them all on a bed together the right distances from one another so that a little girl can finally go to sleep!... What?... I  have to do that?! WHOA SHIIIIIIIIIIII...\n\nPlush is a ragdoll physics game set in a small girl's room at bedtime. She can't sleep unless all her plush toys are arranged on her bed in exactly the way they prefer, and each of them have their own picky preferences. The goal is to move the toys around the bed and place them according to their preferences, taking care not to knock any of them on the floor and lose the round. There's a little bit more nuance to it, but that's basically the overall gist of the 40 stages this game contains.\n\nI played through the first tutorial stages on Normal difficulty then restarted on Hard once I got the idea, taking about an hour to complete every challenge. There's an additional Play Room mode available from the very start that allows you to place any number of any toy you want on the bed (limited only by the power of your computer) and see what happens, but it's pretty much just a physics demo with little else to really do beside some mildly amusing chaos. And that's all the content there is for the game.\n\nIt's presented in a nice enough way with adequate visuals and some really nice, relaxing music, and the little girl's voice-over is adorable. The narrator/father(?) isn't quite so lovable, though, and sounds a little gruff and not exactly what you'd immediately imagine being the soothing voice for a bedtime story. I'm guessing the voice work was done by the developer and his daughter? If that is the case then it makes sense and I guess adds a certain charm to it. But if they were outside help hired for the job then it seems an odd choice.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have about this game, though, is the controls. It's done entirely with the mouse as you click on a toy and drag it around, but there's a huge disconnect between cursor and toy, and often you'll find the former getting far ahead of the latter as you try to drag a plush around, get it jammed in something, then struggle as it either fails to respond at all, or else suddenly flies off wildly and causes you to drop it and lose the round. You can essentially take any notion of precision you have and check it in at the door, coz you won't be needing it for this game.\n\nAs hugely irritating as that was, I did still love the basic premise and breezed through it quickly enough to not stay too mad at it. Although I feel the price is a little steep for what it is and couldn't recommend it for any more than half the current €4 asking price. More content or modes would have been nice, but if you have the patience for the controls and want some cute little puzzles to solve, this is worth trying out.","January 25","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are both cute but pretty well done, and the little girl's voice reactions really add some charm. Most of the levels are relatively easy, but they do get more difficult the further into the game you get, to the point where you need to be very careful in how you move that hippo unless you want all of your other stuffed animals all over the floor.\n\nThe only problems I really had with the game were the controls. When you pick up an animal, you never know if you're going to grab an arm, a leg, or their butt, and when you drag your mouse, the animal follows behind it like it's tethered to a bungee cord. While you learn to adapt to it, the gameplay would be much better with more precise controls. Otherwise, it's pretty fun just to fling stuffed animals all over the place.\n\nBuy it on sale and enjoy a relaxing casual game.","February 4","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
