Learning the patterns of all the enemies is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in any game.  When you start out, you're just fumbling around, faceplanting into enemies and getting torn apart.  If you practice enough, though, you'll be able to take on any situation without suffering so much as a scratch.  Every part of the game is very doable with the default equipment, so you're never just screwed because the right items didn't drop for you.  The weapons and spells that you can find all work differently and cause you to change your method of attack, but they're all pretty balanced.  There are a ton of different weapons types with their own unique advantages and drawbacks, rather than traditional "tiers" of weapons (1 damage, 2 damage, 3 damage, etc.)  And there's an instant replay feature upon death, where you can look and see what you could have done differently to save yourself (there's always SOMETHING).  This is quite possibly the most well-balanced game I've ever played, and I adore it.  Pick this game up right now if you can.\n\nEdit: If you have any doubts, just look at how many hours I've logged on it ;)\n\nEdited again, after launch day: Early access is over!  The game is complete and it's AMAZING.  I cannot believe how much better the game has gotten with time!  The final area and extra bosses have been added, and they really went all-out with the monster designs for the last zone.  And suddenly there are two entire new soundtracks to choose from?  Yes, please!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with how the final product came out.  I still play this all the time :)","July 27, 2014","true","616.2"," 570 of 592 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","570","592","0","12"

It's all in the mind."\n\nThese words were spoken by the great Tamanegi Sensei (better known as Chop Chop Master Onion) over 15 years ago when music-based games were first making a name, and they ring even truer today as the rhythm genre takes an evolutionary step into the dungeon crawling arena.\n\nNecroDancer is the holy matrimony between addictive rhythm game grooviness and challenging roguelike complexity, and I'll be damned if it doesn't hit the spot. It's amazing that a concept this unique took as long as it did to come to fruition, but it's been more than worth the wait.\n\nNot only is the concept unique but it's done right, something we hardly ever see when a new mechanic or gimmick is introduced to the gaming world for the first time. We see so many "new" ideas that are merely just a melting pot of previously established genres. Lo and behold, these developers have obviously set out to refine and perfect their concoction of varied gameplay elements on their first attempt and that is highly admirable. Necrodancer stands not only as a magnificently well-realized combination of genres but as a completely new experience of it's own and the start of what is hopefully a new trend of taking fun and risky chances in game development.\n\nThe in-game music is dark, fantastic and quite danceable itself lending to the blissful feeling of hitting each beat of the song with perfect timing. The precision of the music-based movement has lead lots of early adopters of the game to swear by playing with DDR dancepads which apparently add a lot to the fun and engaging nature of exploring the Crypt. This shows a serious level of dedication from the rhythm game community and has already garnered enough attention to spawn it's own design of custom NecroDancer dancepads[necrodancer.com].\n\nAnd if you somehow are crazy enough to get tired of renowned composer Danny Baranowsky's heavy electronic horror jams, the game features an intuitive beat detection function for usage of songs from your own library. The detection of beats in your songs is generally spot on, and makes trying and discovering those perfect tunes for the game infinitely explorable and replayable for audiophiles in the same way games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard Ultra provide endless entertainment. Even for those songs that might be a bit too fast or slow for manageable NecroDancing, there's a feature to alter the speed of in-game beats to give more accessibility for a wider range of genres. No form of music shall go undanced in the heart of these Crypts.\n\nThere are four main floors to the game with three levels and a boss-type enemy each, but beating any single one of them won't be an easy task. You will retry many times being forced to scour every diamond, buy up all the upgrades, and loot your way through multiple plays before you succeed, but what makes this so much more of a pleasure to replay than any other games which borrow rogue elements is the musical nature of the game. NecroDancer replaces the repetitive and stale turn-based combat of traditional roguelikes with the fun and engaging audio interaction of the best rhythm games made to date.\n\nWith a touch of the strategic approach of traditional tactics games, the enemies each have a very distinct pattern to their movements and attacks that the player must learn through multiple failures and awareness. Starting out you encounter the easier monsters such as slimes that move passively back and forth as well as skeletons that follow behind in a predictable way that is easy to counter. Protecting the exit of each floor are the harder and more complex mini-bosses, ranging from hulking Minotaurs that charge towards you in a straight path or determined Dragons that you must outsmart and keep just out of harm's way in order to retain your doomed life just a little longer.\n\nThroughout your journeys into the crypt you'll have two different forms of currency, first being gold coins that you can spend within the levels at merchants on equipment and items to help you on your current run. Second, and most importantly are the much harder to find Diamonds which are the only thing that carry over into the lobby after death, allowing you to purchase upgrades to the gear and loot you come across during your runs. This adds an insanely addictive level of persistence in the same way that the character growth in Rogue Legacy or shortcut system of Spelunky do.\n\nThe shops you purchase these upgrades from won't be made available to you that easily, however, as each of the different merchants and trainers you need will be imprisoned and strewn about the various dungeons forcing you to dance deeper and deeper to rescue the people you will rely on in the future. The game is hard and you'll die many times, but the deeper you go the more you discover, and the more you discover the easier your respective trips will become. This adds a ridiculous amount of replayability and persistence to an already engaging and genre defying new formula.\n\nHere I am hopping and slashing away to the beat of Castlevania's 'Vampire Killer', and I come across a Blood Whip. Things could not be more perfect. Necrodancer isn't just a gimmick, it's the start of something beautiful, it's a new kind of entertainment that can be enjoyed from the hardecore-est of dungeon delving roguelite aficionados to the most casual of rhythm game fans, but there is one thing that all of these demographics must have in common; a dedication to the sound of music.","July 30, 2014","true","32.7"," 312 of 348 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","312","348","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedeadskin/recommended/247080/","thedeadskin","TheDeadSkin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedeadskin/","371 products in account","I've played this game for last 4 months of its Early Access. It already looked very promising and awesome. With the release it took me only a few hours of playtime to confirm everything I was ready to write about.\n\nThis is a rogue-like rhythm dungeon crawler, as you've probably read on the store page. The genre is quite unique - its gameplay is a blend of turn-based combat but it's constrained by the boundaries of the "beats" of the music of the level (unlike a lot of rhythm games it's very forgiving on beat accuracy and there's a reason for that: it's quite action-packed, so when you have a few skeletons, fiery dogs and a dragon converging on you - you can't really follow the beats within 20% margin what is usual for rhythm games).\n\nFirst things first: this is a rhythm game and its soundtrack wirtten by Danny Baranowsky is just pure essence of awesomeness. Randomly generated levels are extremely well done. When I say extremely I mean it. This game doesn't have unbeatable generations. It may be easier or harder, but it's a fair rogue-like, if you die - it's your fault. It's not like rogue's tale when you can be killed on first turn the moment you spawn. So you won't really be stomped by something you can't beat.\n\nWith the release the game has been augmented with some kind of plot which makes it a bit more beautiful than a rogue-like w/o a plot. Also this game even during Early Access didn't have any gamebreaking bugs. In 80h I never had a single crash or anything else that'd ruin my gaming experience, since technically this is kind of a day1 for this game - it's exremely polished, which is a good example what Early Access system should be used for and how.\n\nWith cutscenes you are being rewarded with when you complete "zones" with different characters, with easier and harder characters themselves, with a big variety of items, leaderboards, daily challenges - delivering beatdowns to the beat in this game is guaranteed to be one your best rogue-like experiences ever.","April 23, 2015","true","165.0"," 140 of 149 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","140","149","4","5"

It's unfinished right now, still having some placeholder art and more things being added, but the core is there and it's a blast.\n\nThere are two main components to the game - rhythm and pattern recognition. You'll need both to survive this game. The first is simple, just stay on the beat and you'll be fine. The second is the trickier one and more important one in my opinion. Each enemy has a defined movement and attack pattern, and you need to slip in at the right time and attack when you won't be hurt. Sometimes it's easy, like with slims that only move up and down, or skeletons who raise their hands before attacking.\n\nSometimes, it's trickier. Mushroom people who throw out AoE attacks. Dragons who move every second turn, or bats who I have yet to figure out the pattern for. Of course, if you get bit by a bat, it's likely not such a big deal, but missing the dragon could get you clawed or charred, a one turn death.\n\nThere's no "gotcha!" kills to this roguelike, though plenty of dying to do as things get frantic and you fail to keep up, misjudge the enemy attack pattern, and suddenly find yourself cornered, and you'll do more than a little dying as you learn the patterns of some of the more dangerous enemies.\n\nRarely frustraing, lots of fun, occasionally repetitive due to the single assigned song per level - hopefully this increases. The rest is headed in the exact right direction.","July 18, 2014","true","14.8"," 113 of 118 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","113","118","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/247080/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Crypt of the NecrodancerDeveloper: Brace Yourself Games\nPublisher: Brace Yourself Games, Klei Entertainment\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm rogue-like dungeon crawler. You navigate your character through randomly generated dungeons divided into zones, while avoiding traps, defeating enemies, and collecting treasure, weapons, and armor. The game encourages you to move to the beat of the tracks played in each zone, offering you a coin multiplayer as long as you stick to moving with the beat. The longer you stay in rhythm with the beat, the higher your multiplayer goes. The multiplier affects how many coins you earn from defeating enemies, as well as providing boosts to some of the items you find. So it's really in your best interests to try and keep a good rhythm going as you explore!\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAs said above, you move your character in-time with the beat of the song being played on each floor. The starter character, Cadence, has the perk of having an assistive tool at the bottom of the screen, which helps you to time your button presses with the beat. The game is divided into 4 zones, each consisting of a few floors and a boss floor. Each floor has a different tune playing, which in turn has a different beat that allows you to move at a certain pace. Some floors have a slower beat, some have a faster beat. Also important to note are how monsters move with the beat. Certain monster types have specific patterns, and learning these patterns will help you greatly in navigating the dungeon safely. Some move every beat, some move every other beat. If you happen to move onto a square at the same time as a monster, you take damage, which further emphasizes how important it is to learn monster movements.\n\nYou are also able to utilize several tools, including a shovel, bombs, and various charms that have different effects. Also scattered about are shrines, which offer several different effects depending on it's type. Some are positive effects, while others are negative. Smart use of every tool at your disposal is crucial to survival. One tool I really like to utilize are bombs, as they have several exploratory and combat uses. The shovel is used to dig through walls, which can lead to lots of hidden rooms with secret items! Some walls cannot be dug if your shovel isn't good enough, and there are several tiers of shovels, as well as weapons and armor. Gold, Blood, Titanium, and Obsidian are a few examples, each providing different modifiers for the items.\n\nThe game also features a level editor, with which you can create and upload your own dungeons to the Steam Workshop for others to play and enjoy. The only downside is that you need to clear Zone 4 with a character to unlock it initially. It's also a bit odd in that it's very difficult to use until you learn how to navigate the menus and how to place items. Despite this, it's a powerful tool that works. One thing I'd like for them to add in the level editor is the ability to have specific enemies drop specific items when defeated...such as keys!\n\n\nGraphics\n==========\nBoasting a pixel art style, everything is surprisingly detailed. The sprites are amazingly rich and colorful, and often times you are able to tell where monsters will move and what they are about to do, as well as spot secrets hidden in the walls...like the glinting tip of a diamond in a stone pillar! Such small details are what make this game great. Armor also shows up on your character, so it's easy to tell what they are wearing. Some weapons have battle animations, such as the whips, but most you don't actually see the weapon. Instead, you see a sort of "slash" animation depending on the weapon type. Needless to say, these are minor graphical grievances that are more than made up for by the rest of the game's details. Traps are easy to spot, and items laying around are easily identified as well.\n\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music of this game is where the game shines. Catchy tunes accompany every zone and floor, offering a variety of beats and toe-tapping goodness. Danny Baranowsky is the one responsible for most of the songs in the game, and he has done a fantastic job in really giving this game life. Sound effects are basic and they work, signalling damage, movement, and enemy presence. There really isn't much to say here, other than the soundtarck is amazing. You can check it out or buy it here[dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com]. It's 100% worth a listen, and even a buy if you like it! There is even an extended soundtrack available for you to further customize each zone. The game also allows you to use your own MP3's in-game for endless fun.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThis isn't really a very-demanding game, so most people should have no issues running it. If you have any doubts, make sure to check the minimum and recommended specs for the game on the Store Page. During my playtime I did not run into any bugs or glitches. I expected to run into at least 1 bug during my several playthroughs, but surprisingly not a single one appeared. Bravo! There are options for several resolutions, as well as Windowed and Fullscreen modes.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is a worthy additional to the library of anyone who is a fan of rogue-likes, music-based games, dungeons crawlers, or people who just love fun unique games. There hasn't been a game like this before, so it's worth diving into if you are looking for a new experience.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niHOpQ7ldTE\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must-Play\n\nA special thanks to the friend who gifted me this game!\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 19, 2015","true","17.1"," 133 of 147 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","133","147","9","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/recommended/247080/","cheeseness","Cheeseness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/","533 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOver the past several months, I've had the pleasure of testing an alpha of Crypt of the NecroDancer[necrodancer.com], a retro styled rhythm based roguelike.\n\nA what?\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is a procedural dungeon crawler where the player and enemies movie on the beats of the game's music tracks. That may sound like an eclectic mix, but it works. It works really well.\n\nYou play as Cadence, a firey young woman who, against the better judgement of her elders, descends into the NecoDancer's crypt in search of answers. The intro cinematic shows Cadence prone, her head against a blood smeared rock whilst her narration says, "I don't know how I survived that fall."\n\n\nCadence is resurrected by the NecroDancer, who makes her heart beat to the rhythm of his music. Armed only with what she learned about the undead from her uncle Eli and the equipment she discovers along the way, Cadence must descent farther to find her answers and hopefully free her heart in the process.\n\nInspired in part by Spelunky, developer Ryan Clark has pointed out that they've tried to create something more accessible than typical roguelike, focusing on making the player feel like any deaths are their own fault rather than the game being unforgiving.\n\nTo help convey this, each enemy has its own behaviours which players can anticipate and respond to after learning their movement patterns. For example, skeletons move on every second beat, whilst ghosts move on every beat, but only when the player is facing away from them. The game's complexity is emergent and comes from the combinations of enemies which make each encounter feel unique and challenging. Each of the game's four zones is populated with its own enemy types, which become more varied as the game progresses.\n\n\nAs you play, Cadence comes across many weapons and items, each with their own behaviours that lend themselves towards different styles of gameplay. The properties of each item seems to be something you're expected to learn as you play, discovering that a broadsword will let you hit enemies on any of the three adjacent tiles, or that a karati gi will enable Cadence to move past traps without setting them off.\n\nIn addition to buying and finding items whilst playing, the game's lobby features a number of shopkeepers from whom items which impact on the game can be brought. Some items will be permanent buffs, such as health increases, whilst others will be more subtle like giving a particular weapon the chance to spawn in a chest within the game. Items from these shopkeepers are purchased with diamonds rather than the gold you buy items with in-game, and provide a way for players to feel a sense of progression as they complete the game's zones.\n\nRather than progressing onto the next zone when completing one, you are returned to the lobby area to find a staircase leading down to the next zone unlocked. In this "normal" mode, players are encouraged to explore and master each zone before moving onto Crypt of the NecroDancer's Hardcore and Daily Challenge modes which allow players to forego any items bought from the lobby shoopkeepers and play through the entire game with one life.\n\nBeyond Hardcore mode and Daily Challenge mode, the game also offers some additional challenges and characters for varied gameplay.\n\n\nThe game ships with an absolutely rocking soundtrack from Danny Baranowsky (Canabalt, Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac and Drifter, amongst others), but also features the ability to load custom tracks.\n\nCurrently, testers run a utility which generates beat definition files that the game uses to track whether your movements are done in time with the music. A Linux build of the utility isn't yet available, and there's some path/case issues which haven't been resolved yet, but the developers seem to be attentive and I expect these to be resolved soon. Eventually this functionality will be built into the game, but for now, there's a little bit of manual handling.\n\nThe game also offers game pad and dance mat support (if that's exciting, you can keep an eye out for some NecroDancer themed dance mats[necrodancer.com]) in addition to keybaord controls. I found that I had to configure custom bindings for my Logitech F310 gamepad and a "Dance UK" dance mat (which overrides the keyboard bindings), but after doing that, both were usable.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer feels rich with atmosphere. Small things, like the subtle screen shake when striking a successful blow, or the shopkeeper's voice as he sings along to whatever music is currently playing really show the kind of attention to detail that is going into this game, and I find myself eager to see what each update brings.\n\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer will be launching on Steam Early Access on July the 30th (which is just over a week away right now).\n\nThere's no solid release date at this point, but it's expected to be released this year. You can find a few bits and pieces on the Brace Yourself Games dev blog[blog.braceyourselfgames.com] (recently, they've been showing off some enemy art) and Ryan is quite active on the Brace Yourself Games forum[braceyourselfgames.com].\n\nI've been streaming the game a couple of times a week on HitBox[www.hitbox.tv]. People are welcome to subscribe and watch the game in action when I play.","July 21, 2014","true","221.2"," 116 of 125 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","116","125","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/247080/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm game, developed by Brace Yourself Games. Releasing in April 2015 on Steam and then later released on PS4 and Vita in February 2016.\n\nNecroDancer is a really unique gaming experience. Every action you take must be in line with the beat of the soundtrack. This includes moving and attacking the enemies. The reward for hitting the beat each time is getting a higher coin multiplier, failing to hit the beat resets your multiplier. Not hitting the beat does not deal any damage to your character, it is just a pain as sometimes your multiplier can often be the thing between successfully completing a level and not. There are a handful of different enemies in the game, which you can learn their pattern of movements if you pay close attention. They all have a predefined path which you should learn to do damage to them or avoid them completely.\n\nThroughout the dungeons, you will find loot; these can be weapons, armour, and useable items such as bombs or potions. The coins you earn can also be used in the dungeon’s shops to let you purchase upgrades on the fly.  The game also has a central hub; this is where you can purchase upgrades that will stay active throughout your play through, such as unlocking an extra chest to spawn on each level for example. One of the ways in which the game forces you to keep moving, is the hidden time limit on each level. Once the song ends you will be forced to move onto the next zone, which may result in you missing out on the reward of more coins or upgrades. I think this is a nice addition as it stops people from using a slow and methodical method and force you to keep up with the tempo and beat of the song.\n\nGraphically, NecroDancer uses the 8bit pixel theme very well. It looks really pretty and very vibrant with colours the majority of the time. The UI is clean and clear with all of the relevant information, especially the Heartbeat sensor at the bottom, which after an hour or two, you won’t need to pay any attention to as you will be so in tune with the soundtracks that you can move on your own. Of course a game that revolves around rhythm needs a half decent soundtrack, NecroDancer certainly delivers there thankfully. With some original music composed by Danny Baranowsky.\n\nAs with most roguelike games, the more you play the easier they get. Since NecroDancer requires more skill than anything else, this is more so the case than ever before. Once you get the beat down, you can conquer pretty much anything the game throws at you. Throw in a few permanent upgrades and you really won’t have any problems. The game has a handful of really unique boss fights too. The end one is probably the most memorable of them all though as it adds some very unique game play mechanics in which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nAll of the levels and stages across the game are randomly generated, so you will never run into the same dungeon layout twice. This of course adds to the replay ability of the game already; but NecroDancer doesn’t stop there. In the main game hub, you will also have access to a daily challenge, in which every player who plays the challenge will face the same map, and your aim is to get the best score possible at the end. This definitely makes the game have plenty of longevity and gives you a reason to load the game up every few days to take part in this daily event even after finishing the story mode.  The main story took me seven hours to complete which I think is a decent amount of time; where you will get the most content is from re-running the stages unlocking new characters, playing the daily challenges and working your way up the leader boards.\n\nI really wanted to play the game using a controller, but I couldn’t get my 360 pad to work sadly. Whilst the keyboard controls are fine, I feel the controller would have been that little bit better to use. Everything else works as intended in the game. A neat little feature is that you can import your own music collection to the game too, having you match the beat of your favourite tunes!\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is an absolute god send a roguelike game. The originality of the gameplay is something which every other developer should take note of. The gorgeous pixel graphics art style is really well done too. This game just screams of character and pure fun. I cannot recommend this game enough for roguelike fans, and fans of the indie scene. I urge everyone to pick this game up for the low price of £10,99. It will not disappoint.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theheap/recommended/247080/","Theheap","Beeps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theheap/","50 products in account","Keep in mind that I've been dreaming of a proper top-down rhythm game for years. Quite a lot of what I have to say is based on the fact that I think with a bit of work this game could have potentially been my favorite game of all time.\n\nIt's excellent concept, straight-to-the-point presentation, great use of color, more than functional randomization, a very nice shrine mechanic, the ability to dig through walls, fully functional and easy to to understand beat counter, some interesting boss fights, speed/scorerun support and a huge number of different ways to play the game all do a very good job of distracting the player from realizing that the core rhythm/roguelike concept is actually used in quite a uniform and unimaginative way.\n\nThe way the game works is that you have a beat counter that multiplies your gold the more you move and attack in accordance with the beat. This is a really interesting mechanic and doesn't require any outside knowledge or athleticism to get good with (like some dancepad games do) but it's actual implementation leaves me thinking it was not realized properly.\n\nFirst off, the only punishment that you get for missing a beat with Cadence (the standard character) is that you cannot move for about a half-second and you lose your gold multiplier. This is ok, I suppose (certainly instant death on missed beat would be far too cruel, though there's a character for exactly that purpose) but it doesn't really hinder you in anyway. The most blatant example of how little the beat mechanic matters are the Blademaster enemies in Zone 4, which parry your attacks on reaction and then lunge forward,  then becoming vulnerable. If you are constantly moving along with the beat these "range-proof" enemies can group up with time and become a real nuisance, but if you stand still killing them is almost effortless. You can bait out their parry, step backward, and then strike immediately to kill them.  Of course, you can do this along with the beat if your footing is good enough, but doing it without beat sync completely removes any risk in this case.The amount of enemies and gold in Zone 4 is excessive, to say the least, so even if you were to walk around with a gold multiplier of 1.0 you would have more than enough gold for the shops.\n\nSecond, absolutely none of the levels seem to have been designed with the rhythm mechanic in mind, behind the simple concept of allowing the player to dig through walls if they get trapped behind a wall. All four zones are fairly entertaining, but really, none of them would be out of place in a pure roguelike. The source of difficulty in all four zones comes not from keeping the beat or engaging a "dance routine" with specific enemy, but something totally irrelevant to rhythm. Zone 1 is difficult because the areas are cramped, Zone 2 is difficult because the areas are too wide open and the enemies are nimble, Zone 3 is difficult because of the ice/fire hazards, Zone 4 is difficult because it forces the player to edge along walls which are full of traps. Zone 4 is the only zone where I would actually say the player is free to engage in rythmic pattern without beng forced to go along a very distinct path, which is overshadowed by the zone's overwhelming number of brutal enemies and traps.\n\nLastly--and this is runnng FAR against the grain here, I have not found a single person besides me that has this opinion: the music isn't actually that good. As far as it's intended purpose goes, anyway. Surpisingly, few of the tracks are particularly fast or even energetic. This leads to a lot of levels where, if you even care about the beat at all, you are stuck moving at a clumsy and slow rate. There is only one track in the game that has players move more than once per beat, and only one track in the game which has rests--both of which are the same track, King Konga. King Konga is by far the best boss in the game because he is not only the only boss which has irregular rhythm elements, but the only boss where your accordance with the rhythm actually matters. Death Metal has one of the fastest tracks in the game but it ends up being practically meaningless because the boss is so easy you could beat him without stepping in time even once.\n\nAll in all this is quite a fun game but not really the ultimate rhythm/action hybrid I've been waiting for. Ironically the people I would reccomend this game most to are people that have don't have much interest in roguelikes or rhythm games, but like the "idea" of both. If there's some sort of update to the degree of randomization I think the game would be a tremendous platform for fangames--without actually touching the level editor, I actually think I could make levels far more interesting than some of the less fortunate randomizations I've seen. Some sort of compilation of levels made by hundreds of modders would be excellent.","July 15, 2015","true","20.4"," 71 of 83 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","71","83","4","2"

I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. I was hooked on this from the first moment I saw it, and 120+ hours later I'm still playing. If the rhythm aspect of it worries you, don't worry - the way the game is set up, the beat detection is forgiving and there is even a mode where rhythm is *not* a factor. This game is, as someone put it, "easy to pick up but difficult to master." You can learn how the game works fairly quickly, it takes a bit of time to get through all the Zones normally and unlock the items - but wait, there's more!! - there is a Daily Challenge, speedrun mode, Hardcore mode (requiring you to play through all levels with no upgrades and get to the last level without dying), and other challenge modes (Aria: 1 hit or miss a beat and you die; Bolt: everything is 2x speed). There is a huge amount of replay value, as the dungeon maps in this are randomly-generated and there is a wide variety of items (weapons, equipment, items, etc.) with a variety of effects. It's a different playthrough every single time. If that wasn't enough, you can even put your own MP3s into the game and play by just about any track you want, as long as it has a beat.

Monsters also move on the beat, and they move in routinely predictable patterns so that over time you learn how to anticipate them and counter them, and in fact some monsters require you to learn these patterns and match the beat in order to even damage them. The skill cap is pretty high, the amount of replayability is immense (there are 9 playable characters and a 10th 'challenge' character, all of whom greatly alter the gameplay in different and interesting ways), and there's even a 'beatless' character that allows you to play the game like a traditional roguelike (monsters move when you do, and you're not forced to stick to the rhythm). And if you want a real challenge, you can even play on a dancepad...\n\nAs someone who has been playing roguelikes ever since actually growing up playing Rogue, and who used to religiously follow rec.games.roguelike, I am so delighted to see an injection of 'newness' into the genre like NecroDancer. It's sorely needed, and while I doubt we'll ever see it emulated, I hope it inspires another developer to merge *their* love of two genres into something as incredibly engaging, challenging, and outright *fun* as this.\n\nI am so happy for Brace Yourself Games, and I'm so incredibly excited that this game has finally surfaced for others to experience and play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/247080/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelite game based on the "bump to kill" mechanic. Games based on it (e.g. Desktop Dungeons) are usually turn-based, focusing on the strategy and effective enemy killing. But necrodancing is different, everything is done in microturns - All actions (both yours and enemies's) have to be correlating with the soundtrack's rhythm. Each beat is a single action for every character.\n\nThat makes the game pretty hard, especially in later levels - but it's definitely a pro for the game since I'm talking about roguelite game. This genre only deserves hard but fair difficulty. You have to deal with the press that requires you to feel the rhythm and remember specific dances of your enemies; you need to train proper dodges for each enemy and keep yourself concentrated (and if you don't, you'll can consider yourself dead in less than a minute).\n\nAs I already mentioned, all attacking is done just by moving to enemy's place in the grid (to "bump" them). If you do that at the beat the enemy's ready to fight, you lose your health instead and you have to quickly reconsider your (necro)dancing. There are many pickups through all levels, you can find both melee or ranged weapons, spells, armor pieces, or other passive and consumable items. There're also two resources: Gold, used to buy items for your current run, and diamonds, which are used to unlock more items for your runs (in the game's menu).\n\nYou might be scared about the controls for dancing, but they actually couldn't be more simple. All you need is arrow keys (or a dance pad), since you can only move in basic four directions on a grid. All spell casts and item uses are done by combinations of those keys, e.g. arrow up + arrow right to cast a fire spell.\n\nAll levels have procedurally generated groups of enemies and rooms, that's nothing unique for roguelites, but I am really happy for secrets in Crypt of the NecroDancer. In most roguelite games I've played, secrets were mostly placed somewhere in level's corners but this game does something completely different - secrets are always somewhere near the level's center, that means you don't have to explore borders in each level to get an advantage. On the other hand, secrets can have many deadly enemies and traps, you have to be wary. Also, you can dig through all walls in every level (besides the border blocks), making your own way through the level!\n\nTalking about graphics, there's nothing to criticize. I love the precise pixelart design with sweet animation the game has! Since it's all about dancing, seeing every NPC to dance with the rhythm is truly satisfying. Soundtrack is amazingly well made, each level has its own song that has even more variations: There is a shopkeeper in every level, and when you'll be near him, you'll hear him sing to the current song. Also, there's a level that perfectly uses genre variations for a song - in hot parts full of lava you'll hear heavy metal, and in icy parts you'll hear electronic version of the same song. In the later levels (zone 4) the soundtrack isn't that good (for being more on the hard electronic genre, so it may be just my personal issue) and it's hard to move with the rhythm of the song properly. Considering everything about the game, I think it's rather another feature to bring the difficulty even higher near the end of the game.\n\nConclusion:Crypt of the NecroDancer comes with an unique idea for a roguelike game; to change casual turn-based strategy into rhythm driven game. This change may seem small, but it makes the game distinct, harder and much more entertaining! The game also have a lot of replayability for all achievements (which are hard to unlock), so don't expect getting just few hours of gameplay from it if you want to get everything. Add great pixelart graphics and perfect soundtrack (mandatory for a rhythm game) and there's nothing to stop me from recommending it to you. It's great! Now let me go "necrodance" a bit more, I haven't got enough yet.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 26","true","17.6"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","33","34","0","0"

You have entities like health, and item slots for armor and weapon and magic, etc. However, the whole gameplay is composed of moving around to the soundtrack.\n\nIt's exciting keeping your mind on two things at once, and mastering it in the end. Enemies all have their own movement patterns according to the music, so you're not the only one that has to deal with the beat. I must admit it's very exhilirating to learn every little bit of enemy movement, and gracefully going through the dungeon with the head bopping tunes in your head.\n\nHowever, if you wanna add your own music to the mix, you can! Any MP3 file you have can be implimented in the game. Experiment, and see what you get.\n\nOverall, this game is tons of fun, and is looking to be one of my favorite indie games out there. I'm not even that big a fan of dungeon crawlers, but I'm a sucker for rhythm games. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good, repetitive time.","October 23, 2014","true","51.5"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

It’s a roguelike that’s played to the rhythm of whatever song is currently playing in the level. Being a fan of dungeon crawlers in general, this rather ingenious spin on the genre got me interested. On the bottom of the screen is a heart with animated bars getting closer and closer. It’s like a simpler Guitar Hero; jump to the beat of the heart to keep your coin multiplier from depleting. If you’re attacked, you’ll lost the multiplier. Aside from things trying to kill you, traps in the environment will also try to ruin this multiplier. If you fall in a puddle your multiplier will be lost. Spike traps will injure you, trapdoors will send you to different areas in the level, sometimes surrounded by monsters, other times you are greeted by a singing merchant who will sell you armor, food to heal, weapons, anything useful. You’ll earn money by killing monsters such as skeletons, bats, ghosts, even monkeys.\n\nYou start every playthrough with a dagger, shovel, and a bomb. Chests will drop larger blades, crossbows, armor, and more items once you’ve unlocked them with diamonds. Diamonds are scattered throughout the map, sometimes hidden in walls that can be dug up using a shovel. Items found in chests can also be purchased from the aforementioned singing merchant.\n\nLevels are divided into four zones. At the end of every zone, there will be a mini-boss (often a dragon) that needs to be killed in order for the stairs to the next level to unlock. However, if you wait around in a level for too long, the song that’s playing will end and you’ll be dropped to the next level. This is similar to the ghost that is sent after you in Spelunky when you’ve spent a long time in one level. Or like the music that’s used to cut actors off during their acceptance speeches when they’re boring. Whatever floats your boat. I mean, the game allows you to use your own MP3 files, so you could totally kill monsters to the Oscars’ “get off the stage” music.\n\nCharacters can sometimes be found locked in cages. If you haven’t found the key in a chest prior, there’s a good chance the merchant will have one on sale. Once these characters are unlocked, a new room will unlock in the lobby. These rooms contain practice courses and shops. You can use the diamonds you collected in your last playthrough to purchase upgrades and new items that will show up in chests. Also in the lobby is where you’ll find the entrances to zones, different game modes like Hardcore or an easier mode with fewer enemies, local co-op, character select, and more. Unlockable characters carry different abilities, such as Bard, who can move freely and not to the rhythm of a song. He’s a great character to use to take a break from the rhythm-based combat of Cadence, the story’s frontliner. Though there isn’t much of a story; it’s all set up in the opening cutscene, featuring Cadence falling into a dungeon and being taken over by the NecroDancer. Which would explain why she’s tasked to move to the beat of a song.\nThe Verdict\n\nThere isn’t much I could dislike about this game. I would totally understand your feelings if you dislike dungeon crawlers; it’s a love it or hate it situation. Crypt of the NecroDancer is available now for $14.99 on Steam. It can be played with a controller, keyboard, and even a DDR pad. If you dislike the genre, it’s likely you’ll dislike this rhythmic take on it. If you’re like me and enjoy roguelikes that put your persistence to the test, chances are you’ll enjoy it, maybe even love it. Hell I’m already addicted.","December 4, 2014","true","3.7"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","35","41","2","0"

For years, people have been mixing rogue-like with many different genres. 2D platformers, Real-time strategy, dungeon-crawling, there's been all kinds of hybrids. But this mixture really blows the rest away. A rogue-like, with rhythm? At first, it might sound ridiculous. It might sound like it would never work. But, Brace Yourself Games made it work.\n\nAnd boy, did they make it work.\n\nThink of Crypt as a Mystery Dungeon game. A turn-based over the head dungeon crawler. That is basically what it is. The turns are every beat in the music, and both you and the enemies move each beat. The soundtrack was specifically made to have an easy to keep beat, and the visuals at the bottom of the screen guide you as well. If you've had any kind of experience with rhythm, from playing Osu on insane to tapping your foot to your favorite song, you should have no problem easing yourself in. Don't let that make you think the game is easy, though. The rhythm is just the tip of the iceberg. Learning how the enemies move and attack is what really makes this game lovingly abuse you like other rogue-likes.\n\nSo, I'm sure there's a couple of people reading this who just can't keep a beat. Hey, I'm not judging. I'm sure you have your reasons. But, if that is the case, good news! There is a character unlocked from the beginning that doesn't use the rhythm mechanic. Everything just moves when you do, and you can experience everything the game has to offer with that character. So, really, if you're a fan of the rogue-like genre, there is no reason not to give this game a try.\n\n+ Nicely done pixel art, characters are colorful and easy to identify\n+ Tons of unique items and enemies that keep every run fresh\n+ There's a boss that's literally a chess board\n+ Rhythm is a simple and fun mechanic, not an annoying gimmick\n+ Special character unlocked from the start for those who can't keep a beat\n+ Very active devs, big updates come out every few weeks\n+++ An amazing soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky, composer for Super Meat Boy and the original Binding of Isaac\n+ Add in your own MP3s if you're a weirdo who doesn't like the soundtrack\n\n+/- Simple, four button controls. Activating items usually means pressing two buttons at once, which can be a bit weird sometimes. These controls can be changed in the options, however.\n\n- Bit of a high learning curve. Playing individual zones with upgrades is far easier than playing through the entire game starting with only three hearts and a dagger.\n- Still in early access. You'll probably find some minor bugs, (nothing gamebreaking) some items/characters are still being added, and the final level is yet to be released.\n\nOverall, Crypt of the NecroDancer in an amazing game and I recommend that you buy it. Yeah, yeah, it's in Early Access, but the game is already enjoyable. I mean, just look at my play time. If Early Access really bothers you THAT much, then just wait. They're planning on getting the game out sometime in the next few months.","January 22, 2015","true","100.5"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","0"

Crypt of the Necrodancer (CotN) should be given a ton of credit for pitching a title that perfectly melds rouge-lites and rhythm-based gameplay.The main mechanic revolves around moving and attacking to the beat of the music and failing to even miss one beat results in a multiplier reset, which altogether works very well. CotN also deserves points in the style department; enemies dance, the floor lights up when the multiplier is up, and the shopkeeper sings along during the high points of the songs. Even though the game retains many rogue-like tropes, it truly separates itself from others with the way it was designed. Music is absolutely stellar (composer of the original Super Meat Boy). Controls are intuitive (you only need the four-directional arrows!).\n\nLike in Rogue Legacy, you can unlock equipment after each subsequent run if you have enough crystals (which you can find after each level). The lobby serves as a way to access this content. Here you can also find individual monster training rooms and various other modes like Hardcore or Daily Challenges.\n\nFor the price, it's definitely worthy of the admission.

Never before a game like this has been seen in the gaming industry which combines the elements of a dungeon crawler and rhythm-based gameplay that is produced with such quality and immersiveness.\n\nGameplay\nIn this game, you are forced to move to the beat of the soundtracks (except for one character) where the tempo of each beat is shown by the meter on the bottom part of the screen and will vary depending on the track being played.\n\nViolating this rule will reduce your multiplier to the lowest set value (though the permanent upgrade addition will still persist), and is also the same if you were to take damage. Players are able to build this up by landing successful hits to an enemy and is kept level by staying on the beat.\n\nAfter every session on any mode (either by clearing the zone or by dying), the items and coins you gained will be removed and reset back to your default equipment except for "diamonds", which is used for certain upgrades/locks/unlocks to various NPCs in the game lobby.\n\nThe game modes are basically divided into two, separate zones and all-zones mode. The only difference with either mode is that the upgrades that you have bought are only present on separate zones and that the player is required to play through zone 1 to 4 on all-zones mode for it to be cleared.\n\nThe Pros\nExcellent Audio - As a rhythm game, the audio should be flawless and on-spot to the theme as it is the genre's main attribute, and this is a perfect example to it. The soundtracks may vary depending on the stage the player is in or by the character they are using (which are remixed tracks of the original version, for example, playing as Aria will play the metal version of the tracks).\n\nLarge Array of Playable Characters and Game Modes - This standard element of every session-based game is also present, in which it gives longevity and versatility to the game play. These new characters can be unlocked by clearing zones, and each and everyone of them have their own perks as well as rules and restrictions (aside from the default unlocked characters) to follow. Violating these rules will result in immediate death if you don't have an item that could save you.\n\nHigh Replay Value - A sign of a great game is that it will always have you longing for another round even if you failed miserably or even rage-quitted. May it be from the satisfaction of clearing a difficult zone or unlocking achievements or revisiting your favorite tracks, a game with a high replay value makes the money you spent on it worthwhile.\n\nSteam Integration - From the very helpful Steam Cloud feature up to the Steamworks' additional mods that you can add, this is great for those people who wants to spice the game up more and modify it to match their taste.\nThe Cons\nRepetitive Audio - Given the nature of rogue-likes, you will die and restart the levels more than you would like to and this means that you will be forced the hear the soundtracks of each floor again and again. Supposedly, this is only minus if the soundtracks of the game are bad (which is not the case in here), but still I would like to cover all bases for those who are interested in buying the game.\n\nImmense Difficulty Levels - By no means that this is a BAD thing, BUT if you are a casual player who enjoys more of a relaxing game play or just aren't good at playing the game or has bad body coordination, then this game MIGHT not be for you (though it doesn't mean that you shouldn't give it a try). Honestly, I am bad at this game that I could only clear levels with Bard (which is easy-mode) and barely with the other characters.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game is the fruit of undeniable passion and love of the developers, and indeed is a masterpiece of its own genre to be said at the very least. Also, if you are a fan of games with great soundtracks, you won't make a mistake buying this!\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 3","true","15.7"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

CoND beautifully integrates tile based combat with music.  Each turn lasts for a beat of the current level's song, leading to fun, fast paced action.  Even during early access it felt like a complete game, and the full release is a masterpiece.\n\nThe controls are easy and straighforward, requiring only the arrow keys to play.  The graphics are simple but well made.\n\nThe music is great.  The soundtrack was composed by Danny B, and each song is edited masterfully into the game.  CoND lets you use your own music for the levels, but I have never done it because I love the core soundtrack so much.  Despite hearing the songs hundreds of times, I never get tired of them.\n\nThe various weapons and equipment provide a wide variety of play styles and item interactions.  The enemies are well designed, each with varying movement and attack mechanics.  The boss fights are unique and wonderful experiences.  Each one is musically themed, and the varying musical styles reinforces the awesomeness of the game's music.\n\nThere is a very large amount of content and replayability.  Between items, enemies, and floor layouts, there is a lot of variation between runs.  There are high score and fastest time leaderboards which are very competitive, and people frequently race the game live.  CoND can be very difficult at first because you have to learn each weapon's mechanics and each enemy's attack patterns, but there are many tutorial and training mechanisms built into the game.  Practicing is well worth the time, and mastering the game is very rewarding.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone.

Even incomplete, the available game is extremely satisfying to go for increasingly flawless runs with the beautiful music and very fair randomization.  Even if you have a "poor" run (being a "roguelike") it's all dependent on your skill, as there is absolutely no guaranteed damage done to your character - the only time you may get hurt if is you make a wrong move.\n\nThe enemies are varied enough, the random generation is -usually- never rediculous, the item choices are unique and feel very meaningful and dramatic, you can set your own difficulty with different characters (from the no-rhythm-required Bard to the insanely hardcore Aria that is limited to the starting dagger and half a heart and losing rhythm kills you instantly), your own music can be uploaded and danced to, the pixelated aesthetic is very well-done and doesn't come off as tacky...\n\nWorth every dollar, and I even got it on sale.  I'd pay full price for this, easily.  Also, as a warning, the songs are -extremely- infectious and I will find myself humming a random song throughout the day and I often wake up each day with one of the songs running through my head.\n\nEDIT:  Just wanted to say the release version of this game is beyond legendary.  The 4th zone absolutely blew my mind, some of the music got noticably polished up, the cutscenes are cool, there's actually a damn transition between levels now, the escape menu got a border... there's a lot of love in this game and I appreciate every ounce of it.","March 5, 2015","true","64.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","1"

You would never expect a rhythm-dungeon crawler combo to ever work, but boy does it.\n\nI like to put games into two categories: Games with "Behind the scenes" devs, who make a great game but stay in the background; and active devs, who update their game frequently, respond to reviews, etc. Necrodancer falls into the second category.\n\nThe premise of this game is a dungeon crawler roguelike where you move to the beat. All enemies move to the beat of the Danny B. music (who also wrote music for Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac), and learning the enemy patterns (which include moving every beat, or moving up and down every other beat) is vital to your survival. You find items to improve your survivability in shops and chests, with items including rings that add effects or better weapons like longswords. You start with a dagger, which you want to try to replace as fast as possible, because it sucks for combat. All weapons also come in better qualities, like blood, which heals you for a half heart after you kill 10 enemies, or titanium which does 2 damage as opposed to the one damage most weapons do.\n\nThe game has three bosses, which each come with their own great song and are actually quite challenging. Necrodancer is being updated VERY frequently, and it's really a blast, even in early access.\n\nThis game has freaking singing shopkeepers. Just buy it.\n\nPS: Check out one of the boss songs here","November 11, 2014","true","83.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

This game is worth getting as it is. The developers dish out updates constantly, even if it's just a little bug fix.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer combines Rogue-Like Elements with Rythm-Based gameplay to make up for one hell of a game. It's an 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of game that promises many hours of entertainment. The game consists as of this moment of 3 Zones (with 3 floors or levels each), a Hardcore Mode (in which you have to beat all 3 zones in a row), a Level Editor, 5 playable characters (each of which has a different trait!) and even a Steam-Workshop for User-Created content. The music is simply amazing (as expected of Danny B.). And the best part: You can play to your own music!\n\nLike in every good Rogue-Like game, every run is randomized, but thanks to the way the game is played, even a hardcore run can be completed with the most basic equipment if you have enough practice. A run usually doesn't take that long, so it's good for a bit of fun in between as much as it is to play the game to death.

It can be walk in the park, or run on a thin edge of a blade, but still, there's always a way to win.\nEvery playthrough is different in terms of enemies you meet, map and items.\nMost of the items have both good and bad side - what saves you in one situation can lead you to death in another.\nSoundtrack - if you know Danny, there's nothing else to add, all of his works are brilliant, and this one isn't an exception.\nCharacters - each of them is actually unique, and will totally change the way you play.\nRhythm - you don't actually need to always follow it(with SOME secretly secret exception), but following the rhythm is rewarded in many different ways.\n\nCons:\nSome characters are incredibly hard(think Blue Baby/Lost from BoI:Rebirth), but you knew it wasn't an easy game,right?\nLearning enemies movesets is necessary for winning, and takes trial and error. Luckily, you can unlock special training grounds that let you kill them until you are sure you mastered all the ways of eliminating them.\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic.

But it is more than that. The first guideline is fairness : It is one of the only fair roguelikes. When you die, you will be able to watch the replay of your last few moves so you can understand what killed you and why. I have played this game for almost 100 hours, and never have I felt like my death was unfair. It was always my own fault, so I couldn't blame the game for anything. And that takes the frustration out of the experience.\n\nThe second one is mastery : while you will have to learn a few patterns and item effects, they are pretty straightforward, and the game has a training room where you can learn at your own pace everything you want to learn. But the real difficulty comes in when you have to adapt to those patterns, dance with the enemies without making a mistake, and when there are multiple enemies, you'll have to keep track of what each of them is doing and adapt to the situation. This would be easy to do if it wasn't for the time restriction : you can't stay here and think, you have to keep moving to the beat. That is why you need mastery : the ability to master the patterns to a point where they become second nature, for you won't have time to think, only react.\n\nPut these two wors together, and you get Crypt of the Necrodancer : difficult but fair.You won't need luck or knowledge, you won't need any wiki to remember what every item does, the only thing you'll need is yourself, your brain, your reflexes, your skill.

It condenses everything you need to know into what I hope is a very concise and informative video, so do give it a quick view if you're thinking of buying the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MhrYHkjif4\n\nFor those to whom it appeals, rest assured that Crypt of the NecroDancer is something unique, beautiful and hilarious. I've never found such a good substitute for sleep in all my life. It's made me laugh many times since I bought it, and it's more than lived up to my expectations. It's a seriously great game that seems confident in its own abilities and rightly so.\n\nStudying and countering the attack patterns of each enemy you encounter is unbelievably rewarding. For most people, you'll start the game throwing yourself into a roomful of monsters and watching with fascination as you get utterly demolished. But the game relies on its own addictive nature to keep you playing, because the more you play, and the more you die, the more you learn how to stay alive for the next time.\n\nRather than just repeating what I say in the video, I urge you to watch it and leave you with these remarks in summary:\n\nThere is very little in this game that is not a reason to buy it. The gameplay, the variation, the creativity, the music - oh, god, the music - all of it is just astoundingly well-done.\n\nThe game doesn't feel like it's in Early Access. Aside from the couple of features not yet programmed in, such as the full selection of characters to play as, everything is as polished as you'd hope the finished game would be.\n\nDespite dying more times than I care to count, I have yet to feel frustrated with the game. And I can get quite easily frustrated with games that kill me a lot. But with NecroDancer, I'm only ever frustrated with myself, for not quite moving fast enough, or panicking at a crucial moment. In a world of unfair gaming experiences, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a beacon of light that invites to you blame yourself, rather than the game!\n\nYes, the game is challenging. Despite having played it long enough to know the attack patterns of most monsters in the game, the monsters frequently - shockingly often, in fact - get the better of me. It's not just a matter of learning the game. Thanks to the fast-paced rhythm aspect, it's instead a matter of calling upon your knowledge at a moment's notice, and staying calm even at the sight of a minotaur charging towards you, or a red dragon preparing to unleash fiery chaos upon you in the next half a second.\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a game.\n\nThere is simply nothing to criticise - at least, nothing apart from the most minor issues, such as monsters occasionally getting in each other's ways and forcing each other to remain stationary until you kill them. But that rarely happens, and it's certainly nothing even close to a game-breaking issue - it's just a quirk of the game. And seeing as it's still in Early Access, I'm surprised that's the only one I can think of!\n\nClosing remarks: Crypt of the NecroDancer is amazing. One of the most flawless games I've ever played. If it appeals to you then buy it. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it.","August 11, 2014","true","42.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

How many runs had I failed this far? And another boss after what already seemed like an impossible ordeal.\n\nIt only took me a few moments to realize the new mechanic I had to juggle in the last fight, and it was an amazing surprise which immediately filled the dancer floor with new energy.\n\nI spent the first minute of the encounter with the Necrodancer keeping my heroes side by side, getting used to the beat. The easy beginning really affords those fighting Necrodancer for the first time the time they need to get ready.\n\nAnd then, one by one I begin aligning my heroes, triggering bombs to the stage--not too difficult.\n\nWhen the Necrodancer took to the dance floor, indeed was my heart beating at the  120bpm step, in sync with the Necrodancer himself.  I begrudgingly set aside my Obsidian Crossbow and equipped the Golden Lute, determined to do this right. At first, I ran from his reanimated fiends and explosive spells, trying to realign myself and regroup with my ally, but as soon as I understood his rhythm I slided in for a hit. The Necrodancer skips away only losing a single heart from my note, summoning more monsters between us.\n\nBlack Knights began to flank me on all sides and it's a challenge to keep them off with my ally's Flail. At one point I realize the Golden Lute can only sing its music if Cadence has a empty tile to move to, so being surrounded by shield bearing skeletons on two sides and a wall and ally covering the other two, I struggle to make any movements at all, all while rapidly losing health. For an instant I fear the worst, but in the next beat does my ally bash his Flail fowards, knocking back one skeleton--I immediately pounce on the next beat, allowing my Lute to sound the minions to dust.\n\nThe fight continues with me piercing again and again with my Lute, bringing the Necrodancer to a third of his health, while monsters continue to scratch my ally and I. In the fight I've lost four of my nine hearts, leaving both my ally and I at one and a half hearts left, and as I continue to hit the Necrodancer do increasingly powerful monsters seem to appear.\n\nEventually, there are too many skeletons in erratic formations I can't easily line up to attack, their pursuit herding me to one side of the dance floor where an Ogre has just joined. I've died many times to Ogres in the fourth zone, but I know the brute, slow, can be defeated if I merely kite around it. However, I worry that in the process, the new ally by my side would then get smashed in the ensuing blow. I move in, hitting him again and again as I circle to his back.\n\nIt was at that time, checking the hearts of my ally and I, going over the directional combinations to use bombs, switching to my holstered weapon or beating my war drum, as well as predicting the path of the many dancers of the Necrodancer did I make my fatal error. My attention split, I panic and move one tile away from the Ogre, immediately attracting his singularly directed club.\n\nMy obsidian armor, then powered down and thin as paper from the onslaught of reanimations is cleaved in two, Cadence immediately perishing under the mighty blow.\n\nI will now begin talking about my opinion of the game:\n\nI spent 20 hours trying to get farther and farther than before.\n\nBeing able to dance with the Necrodancer was an incredible experience, despite dying, my body is still flowing with music high. Please try this game. There are very smart design choices evident throughout every aspect. The music, the level design, the enemies and items all progress so well. Timing each act to the length of a song, having enemies which all have simple but broad ranges of dance moves to overcome make them easy to approach but brilliantly challenging in hoards. You feel extremely rewarded for your experienced-earned dexterity the roguelike demands--the game is a fantastic challenge that's never too easy.\nA great example is in certain circumstances (secret vendors and trapdoors) do you find yourself in an incredibly confined space with two minibossess and two small minions. The first time you see this your fear and greenness lead to your immediate demise, but after enough of dancing do you begin to, not only feel comfortable with these, but even actively seek them out for the item and gold reward from defeating them.\nOnce you can beat bosses, your greed begins to demand you defeat them without a single misstep, for the glorious Flawless Victory that rewards your ego as well as giving you an additional chest to bolster your hero. I thought being an indie game this would be a quick fun change of pace but it's so much more. I've only played twenty hours but I don't intend to stop any time soon. It's a game I would recommend to any friend who comes over, it's a game I would play when I have a short break or if I have a few hours. Sometimes it can be tough if you keep dying but the rewards essentially beg you to succeed.  I keep coming back for more Crypt of the Necrodancer!\n","May 17, 2015","true","45.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/recommended/247080/","2d_invasion","RoX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/","1244 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n[early access - review]As an avid musician and part time gamer, Crypt of the NecroDancer was a "have to" buy for me. The idea of incorporating music as the mode for a metronomic gameplay system was intriguing. After finally getting this loaded up, I thought for sure that I had an advantage in this game given that I've honed my own internal metronome for nearly a quarter century and my gaming skills for nearly 3 decades but little did I know that this game puts a whole new meaning into the expression "beat down." To elaborate on that further frankly, I got beat down to the down beat.With NecroDancer, it takes more than just timing and gaming experience to survive, as this is a calculated, quick-witted, speed chess match and really is not a game you are going to get far in if you are distracted or not all in to it.\n\nThe sound track is great and is one of the biggest reasons (for me anyways) to play this game. Being that I am a musician, my rig is setup with an audio controller and studio monitors, so that I can pump out some decibels and at high volumes this game sounds even better! If you don't have a decent sound setup, a good pair of headphones is crucial. The sound track has a wide range musical styles from the trancey-technoish electronic, chillin mellow reggae-ish, flowing hip hop beats, beatnik jazzy swing, to the grinding heavy metal; all of which is synthesized and composed sequencing. This is understandable considering the game play is tempo driven, though from a musicians point of view, some music wasn't meant to be synthesized and even though musically it is written well, the metal doesn't feel right. A minor gripe. Regardless, every style has a lot of energy with a beat that really delivers the tempo when playing. My last gripe, though petty, I think a little more could be done with the sound effects during gameplay to incorporate them into the music a little cleaner, being that attacks and movement must be done on beat. It is still early access, so we'll see.\n\nThere are 2 things that bothered me about this game. One I can look past and most people do not mind the uncontemporized 8-bit graphics but I'm hoping there is a little bit more updating to set it aside from the rest (again, early access). My other issue I had was perplexing and that was the controls. After calibrating to compensate for the latencies, I went to the options to personalize my joystick controls. The devs offer a lot of options in this screen, which is nice, but they have controls labeled 'Combo: Up + Down', 'Combo: Left + Right', 'Combo: Up + left', etc... that you assign to a button. What? This was confusing at first. Well, turns out that these are for using items and using some menu functions. It gives the controls an additional method by using both the movement combinations as well as assigning it to a button. This gives a huge advantage for using a keyboard over a joystick. I also found that when using the keyboard, it was much easier to keep the timing, as though it felt more "instrumenty' than the joystick. My last gripe about the controls is that they are not actually "full controller supported" as stated on the store page. Stick 2 on my 360 controller could not be assigned controls during setup. Oh well, I like the keyboard more for this game anyways!\n\nThe gameplay is simple. Using the directionals, you move and attack on beat. The enemies will too, though they all do not move the same manner or count and as I mentioned earlier, this really makes it more of a speed chess match. If you are in the wrong square, miss a beat, or move incorrectly, it could mean game over. This adds a whole new dimension of difficult and for those of you that cannot keep a beat there are additional modes, like turn based, so even the musically challenged can enjoy this game. There are a lot of power ups and items available, though at the moment doesn't exactly feel "rouge-like" just yet but I'm sure that'll change. There are also a multitude of in game mutations that ramp the difficulty level up significantly. Even without them, this game is hard, which should appeal to anyone who likes a challenge in gaming.\n\n*Also note: do not expect a huge amount of content out of the box, at this stage in early access there are few levels offered in Crypt of the NecroDancer. At the moment 4 levels consisting of 3 stages and a boss level. (I'll update this review as the developers do... can't get enough of this game) There is also a daily challenge, though I'm not sure why these resources are not allocated to coding, sprites, music, sound, etc...\n\nOverviewGameplay: Music Driven Rogue-Like.\nGraphics: 8-bit. They are okay but would like to see them a little more contemporized.\nSound: Sound Track is Phenomenal (by gaming standards)! Sound effects are good but again, I'd like to hear them mixed in on tempo with the music, making them one and the same.\nControls: Great with a keyboard. Though, as of now it’s a little disappointing with a controller but still decent.\nReplayability: Yes. The addition of seeding gives this game a ton of potential.\nOverall: 8/10 – Though it is nothing to scoff at, once new features, updates, and fixes are implemented; I'm sure this rating will be much higher in Crypt of the NecroDancer's fully released state.\nThe element of music and gameplay make this a great game and one that I truly enjoy. I recommend this to everyone and is a must buy for anyone who likes musically driven games.","November 4, 2014","true","15.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

The game is addicting and pretty much complete, and the updates keep coming hard and fast, bringing more and more variety and fun to the table.\n\nThe gameplay feels complete, looks, sounds and feels great and is immediately addicting. Replayability is available aplenty via custom music, roguelike-characteristic difficulty, replays, leaderboards (for gold score and speedrun time, respectively), unlockables and a hardcore mode with optional seeds input.\n\nThe only missing feature is a zone; there's 3 zones à 3 levels right now, which are plenty to bite your nails out already.

Think traditional turn based rogue like/lites but each beat of the game's music is it's own turn. It's a simple, but very well executed catch that adds a lot of flavor to the game.\n\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, with detailed textures and animations, the up beat electronic music, though seemingly off themed from the game's more fantastical setting, is catchy and works well with the designed mechanics. If you're not a fan of the music (because you are probably insane), you can always play your own music which the game will build stages out of.\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer also comes with a variety of different modes and features for you to explore, including hardcore, training, and a pile of items and upgrades to unlock. Even as an early access (or perhaps, especially because), it feels very complete. Further improvements from this point will feel more like free DLC than the game subsidizing for missing content.\n\nOverall, Crypt of the Nectrodancer is a very unique take on the rogue like/lite genre. It executes it's genre blending perfectly, offering easy to understand, but challenging mechanics, catering to the hardcore and beginners.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent music\n- Great pixel art\n- Unique genre blending\n- Lots of features and promotes replay\n\nCons:\n- Those unfamiliar with rogue-like/lites could find this repetitive\n- Custom music could use some tweaking","August 2, 2014","true","5.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

As Cadence, you move through dungeons, dig through walls, use spells and items, attack enemies and bosses, all while staying in tune with the music.  You can not do these things if you do not match the music.  The longer you go without messing up, the greater the gold multiplier you have.  Which means more gold to buy an awesome variety of weapons, armor, and other items from the shopkeeper.  You can also find items hidden behind walls and in chests.\n\nThere are plenty of different maps, different songs, and different game modes, along with a bunch other special things you will unlock in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/247080/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nMy 4th best game of 2015, and for good reason. One of the best mashups of genres that I've seen over the last several years, Crypt of the Necrodancer has that addictive quality that will keep you playing the game over and over again, and enjoying every moment of it.  Strong internal game design revolving around the movement, not the rhythm, and yet the rhythm enhances every moment of gameplay. Dancing in between enemies and getting in the first hit while protecting your precious little health does keep you super aware of your surroundings, and enemy pattern movements force you to think outside the box, digging into the environment to escape or just give yourself a breather. A great solid soundtrack that's designed with the gameplay in mind, and yet importing songs works rather nicely too in a majority of cases. Look, I could go on and on about Crypt of the Necrodancer's design, it's smart gameplay, it's hours of re-playability, but I'm just going to get down to the chase. Everyone who even remotely likes roguelike/roguelite elements will have a fantastic time with this game, and those looking for something out of the rhythm genre will find something fresh and new here. Well worth the full price of admission, no questions asked.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRRT-A5-v80\n\nLists:\n+:\nStrong base gameplay that doesn't need the rhythm to succeed, because the base roguelike gameplay works on so many levels.\nAnd yet the rhythm enhances things on multiple levels, forcing quick decisions on the part of the player, forcing mistakes for those not ready for what's to come..\nGreat variety in weapons and characters, forcing different play styles that still all work on basically the same principles, but you may not realize it. The different characters in particular add some clever elements into the game, forcing you to think about things that you may not have before, like using the walls wisely or avoiding enemies rather then confronting them.\nEnemy movement patterns are very smartly done, force you to change up your expectations and react to the situation at hand.\nGreat soundtrack that is designed for the beat to be consistent, so players get adjusted to the game, but hits a variety of genres, and the remixes are something you'll want to put in your collection. Never get old, and I STILL wanna get up and dance at the opening theme. This coming from a person who has two left feet.\nVisuals work surprisingly, and you never get lost in the smart selection of color scheme versus background. Everything is clear and up front.\nAfter first hating it, like the final duel they set up, as it takes the gameplay more to a completely new place I wasn't expecting. In fact, would love to see a mode entirely centered around it.\nImporting songs works in a lot more cases then I thought it would. Good open source library used to detect the base beat, and is able to detect even if those really odd cases.\nSome good mods out there, even if half of them are only visual. I personally recommend the Mega Man mod. Because ITS THE GOD DAMN MEGA MAN.\n-:\nMinor bugs here and there. For example, it'll exit on the second time you go into import song after playing a round with the new one, and can't handle accented letters.\nIn terms of importing songs, The dog song from undertale doesn't work well with it =(.\nHonestly, I'd love some DLC just for the fact that well, I just want more. Granted, what's there works, but I still love it to this day. Honestly I'm literally coming up with flaws out of nothing. That's how fun this game is.\nThat it took me this long to do a steam review on this game.","January 18","true","33.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/247080/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","I waited way too long to pick this one up. On one hand, I love rhythm games and was huge into Rock Band's drums back in the day. On the other hand, roguelikes are a bit overdone at this point and even a game with a huge amount of depth can be a turnoff when you play for 30 hours and only see less than 10% of the content, often because RNGesus hates you.\n\nI'm going to assume that you enjoy rhythm games if you're considering this one, Crypt of the NecroDancer does three things that roguelikes in general can learn from.\n\nThe first is that everything is predictable, even when it's random. The majority of enemies follow a strict algorithmic pattern and the better you are at discerning these patterns and reacting to them quickly, the better you will do. Red Bats' random movements are countered by paying attention to what tiles they are on and what tiles you're on. Bosses have reliable strategies that allow them to be taken out with zero damage suffered, even the ones like Death Metal who have aspects of randomness included. Item drops are random, but this matters less as you unlock higher and higher difficulties that are designed to deprive you of gear and demand perfection.\n\nThe second thing is that the majority of things are unlocked within a relatively short span of play for a roguelike, about 10 hours. Furthermore, competitive modes such as the Daily Challenge and All Zones/Seeded put everyone on a completely level playing field from the start. No system of unlocks that favors 300+ hour players over the new installs, which is frankly a very good thing. It's not just even popular roguelikes, competitive has become a joke across a wide array of genres due to the industry's addiction to progression systems. It's used as an artificial longevity tactic and even though the store page isn't all 100+ hour reviewers, you know those reviewers' time wasn't wasted by grinding either. This trait gives Crypt of the Necrodancer more of an arcade feel, which is appropriate as all zone runs generally last under an hour. (with the world record seeded speedrun being under 2 minutes)\n\nThe last kudos goes to the fact that you can enable an option (off by default) to make item names/descriptions visible. I love this feature -- a certain other mega-popular roguelike lacks this feature and as a result it feels like a Mediawiki simulator, constantly disrupting the flow of play. There are a few items without descriptions but these are clearly cursed or "double-edged sword" type items, so that's fine.\n\nAlthough not tagged as such, it's worth mentioning that this game is very difficult. You have a lot more information to process than other rhythm games, especially as enemies start becoming more numerous. The difficulty spikes drastically once you unlock the final story mode character, who can only survive two hits or missed beats. Needless to say the YouTube rendition of all the cutscenes is very popular as a result, but just looking at the global achievement stats (and the lack of achievers) will tell you that this game isn't messing around. This isn't a huge problem due to customization options being robust enough to suit any difficulty level, though the one thing they got wrong was hiding the "double time" character behind the "gold one-shots you" character. It's probably justifiable by difficulty scaling, but it's not all that justifiable by locking what many would consider to be the "fun hard" character behind "tedious hard" one. But this is a small nitpick honestly.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to customize the game. The options menu supports a wide range of preferences, always important for letting people feel "in the zone" in a rhythm game. There's a modding system, though I haven't used it much yet. The song importer is pretty good, and it accurately timed songs that I ripped from my CD's as WMA and then turned into OGG with Audacity. (only mp3 and ogg are supported) Digital purchases will probably fare just as well. PC rips will require manual timing, which works well enough. It also gives you options to play songs at half or double time, which you might want with higher BPM genres like Metal. Necrodancer seems to have a range for where BPM should be, and halves any that exceed that range -- so you'll want to either play your Dragonforce CD as Bolt, or manually set it to 2x speed.\n\nOne final positive to mention, and also advice for new players -- it's playable with a dance pad, but you probably need to be superhuman to have a chance in the more difficult modes. Keyboard is also supported, and if you're playing on keyboard, remap the spell/item/misc keys right away and disable the default combos. This seems to make the input more responsive...or maybe I expected it to and it just seems more responsive. It's also good to get used to your own layout right away as the inprecision of two key input will eventually end up biting you the more the game demands perfection.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game...and I'll be there on day 1 if an expansion or sequel comes out.","November 18, 2015","true","23.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

Danny Baranowsky does a beautiful job at making the music catchy and fit the theme of the levels. The game is incredibly hard, split into 4 zones (4th zone is locked as of the early access). Once you beat one zone (each zone is made up of 3 normal levels and a final boss, all of which are amazing and the music to the bosses are amazing as well) the next zone opens up. I've unlocked Zone 3 and it's nearly impossible for me. I mean, come on, there's a chess boss where the pieces move exactly like in chess, it's absolutely badass.\n\nThere's a daily challenge much like Spelunky and SpiderMod for Isaac, and I've seen scores of people who have beaten the game, so it IS possible, it's just really hard. Don't let the challenge discourage you from getting it. Enemies have a distinct pattern (except bats, ♥♥♥♥ those guys), and you have to attack the enemy between their attack pattern to hit them unharmed, however if you stay in a square or attempt to move into a square that an enemy moves onto at the same time, you get hit. There is some knowledge you gain only by playing the game, such as attack prioritization. For example, the game prioritizes your attack over all enemies', so if you attack a 1 health enemy that's going to attack you at the same time, your attack is registered first and the enemy dies without you getting hit, but if the enemy has more than 1 health, you get hit because you didn't kill the enemy on that beat.\n\nWhen you get hurt or die it's ALWAYS because you messed up the enemy pattern, I've never felt the game cheated me on damage or death. And don't think the game is trial and error on knowing the enemy patterns, they nearly always have a tell when they're about to attack so you can attack them in between.\n\nThere are very, very minor bugs in the game, sure a good amount of them are userend, meaning you might mess up thinking how something works and try to use it incorrectly only to have it mess you up (such as learning how the Cat of Nine Tails works, I hate this weapon), but the actual bugs in the game are barely noticeable and the creator does an absolutely fantastic job of updating the game and squashing bugs, he's very very active on the /r/necrodancer subreddit as well as the Brace Yourself Games forums where there's a bug database that you can add to or search through to see if a bug you found has already been seen.\n\nThe visual style is nice, the pixelated art works fine, the level art is looks good. Most enemies groove out to the music so it's pretty cool.\n\nThere's also a feature where you can use your own music and the game will process it and determine the beat of the music, so far it's pretty accurate though it does seem to have very minor issues with certain songs. But I really like the original music so I'm probably not going to change it.\n\nThe more I play this game, the more I'm loving it. I fell in love with the Binding of Isaac and have about 230 hours in it, I can EASILY see myself outplaying that game in this one. Seriously, the music is some of the best I've heard in a game, the gameplay is fresh and the creator is constantly updating and improving the experience. Is it worth $15? ABSOLUTELY. I would not skip a beat even if this game was $30 dollars or even full retail at $60. The replay value is immense and if I get 200 hours in this game, even if the game was prices at $60, I payed $3.33 per hour, and I say that's an amazing deal. What makes this hypothetical even better is the game is FIFTEEN DOLLARS, NOT SIXTY. Come on, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. If the game is on sale (which it is for the Winter Sale), I say with 100% certainty that it is worth your time to buy it.\n\nAt first I said this game is an 8.5/10. ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥, this gets 10000/10.","August 4, 2014","true","293.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's also my first, so excuse me if it's a little useless.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is built on a fairly simple concept: it's a turn based dungeon crawler, except each turn is restricted to the beat of the music, so if you don't think quickly enough or mistime your move, you miss your turn (and your gold multiplier, which can be crippling with certain items).\n\nAs you might expect, enemies become tougher as you move through each stage of the game, with their movements becoming more complex as well. You can find new tools and weapons as you progress to give yourself a better chance, but ultimately, you have to learn how each enemy behaves to succeed.\n\nThere are a total of ten playable characters, two of which are unlocked from the start (one using the  default gameplay and the other allowing you to move off the beat, effectively removing the time pressure). The unlockable characters offer more challenging scenarios such as:\nInstant gameover if you touch any gold dropped by defeated monsters\nInstant gameover (yet again) if you miss a single beat or take a single hit\nElapsing turns two times faster than usual\nA ludicrous horror that combines everything above\nNot being able to deal any damage, and instead having to dodge enemies while going for the exit\nThere's plenty of replay value thanks to the different characters, and the game also generates daily challenges similar to those from Spelunky: everyone gets one try at the same dungeon each day, and your final score is uploaded to the leaderboard for that day only.\n\nYou can import your own soundtracks and play along to them, provided you have them stored locally. There's also modding support, which is always nice.","May 20, 2015","true","137.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","12","13","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GlickWick/recommended/247080/","GlickWick","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GlickWick/","332 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNote: I've only played the alpha build, so some of this may be subject to change.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is an incredibly fun take on the Rogue-like genre.\n\nAt its core, NecroDancer follows the same tenants that most Rogue-likes do. You enter a procedurally generated dungeon with basic equipment and attempt to reach the exit. Along the way you defeat enemies, avoid traps, buy items, and make generally strategic decisions before you take each step.\n\nNecroDancer throws an unusual wrench in the works, however. You're no longer allowed to move or attack unless you do so in sync with the rhythm of the current song. Doing well increases the number of coins you get from enemies, and missing a beat resets this bonus. Additionally, if you miss, the enemies essentially get a free turn. No longer can you sit and ponder your next move, you have to keep moving with the song. Additionally, enemies follow a generally fixed pattern and will only manage to deal damage to you if you neglect to keep this pattern in mind.\n\nThe result is a highly skill-based Rogue-like where decisions need to be made quickly, and mistakes are punished harshly. The game is definitely balanced around this mantra, as it's very possible to win without ever purchasing an upgrade for your character.\n\nIn order to cater to a variety of player-types, the game includes both a "standard" mode and a "hardcore" mode. In the standard mode you're able to purchase upgrades that permanently boost your character, and there are essentially checkpoints that allow you to start from later levels. In contrast, "hardcore" puts you on the first floor with no upgrades and requires you to clear the game in one go. There are time and score leaderboards for hardcore, along with character unlocks that serve to boost the difficulty even more. The terrifying "Aria mode" is unlocked at the end of hardcore, and features a new mechanic where any hit or any failure to match the beat of the song results in immediate death.\n\nThe end result is a very fun and refreshing game. Even in the alpha build the mechanics feel very polished, the enemies are varied and interesting, and the strategic gameplay is downright engaging. Much like Spelunky, you'll find yourself excited to die repeatedly as you learn to conquer the game's increasingly difficult floors. The less hardcore players will also likely find enjoyment in collecting new upgrades and unlocking new features as they slowly make their way to the end.\n\nThe music is also incredible, featuring the composer from Super Meat Boy. If you want additional variety or don't like a particular track, you can replace any level's soundtrack with an MP3 of your choosing. I haven't played around with this much yet, but it likely adds a considerable amount of depth to an already deep game.\n\nSadly, the Alpha Build doesn't have the 4th (and final) zone yet. However, if it is anything like what I've seen so far, it will be both devious and incredibly fun to play.\n\nIf you enjoy Rogue-likes or music games, this is a great purchase.","July 22, 2014","true","57.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

You can play as various characters, some are easy, some are extremely difficult (i'm looking at you, Aria). The easiest character in the game is Cadence in my opinion. You walk as the hearbeats go, and the enemies move if you don't. If you don't like the whole heartbeats stuff, you can play as Bard and be free of all that crap. Other characters are a variation of Cadence, like not killing enemies or not picking up gold.\n\nRight now, there are 3 zones and 4 bosses, Mines, Underground Forest (?), Icy Hot place (???).\nNot going to spoil any of the bosses, but there's an extremely easy one, easy one, medium one (probably my favorite), and hard as balls one.\n\nYou pretty much always are carrying a sword and a shovel. You can upgrade it the sword to a broadsword, spear, longsword, whip, and even a bow and arrow which all have glass, obsidian, blood, gold, platinum, etc... variations. Same for the shovel.\n\nYou will also get Headpieces, Shoes, Armor, Potions, Maps, Scrolls, Food, Magic, and other stuff.\n\nOne complaint that i have with this game is that it recycles the enemies way too much. Want a example?\n"Oh look, it's a green smile"\n"Wow, it's a blue slime"\n"Watch out, it's a yellow slime!"\n"Please don't kill me mr. lava slime!"\n"This is getting repetitive, right ice slime?"\n\nAnd then there are white skeleton, white skeleton with shield, white skeleton with horse, yellow skeleton, yellow skeleton with shield, etc...\nThey are all different but they're pretty much the same thing with different colors/health.\n\n8.5/10","April 6, 2015","true","12.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

You don't just buy equipment to start with though, there are randomly generated chests in each level, you unlock better items to be found in those and/or more spawned chests. Which is an awesome way to keep the procedural feeling alive and not just making the game considerably easy to blast through.\n\nEach enemy has a certain pattern and rythm of moving and attacking, so due to the many different types of enemies there's a lot to learn and adapt to, which I love. If you don't quite have rythm in your blood, doing the constant moving to the beat and concentrating on visual patterns at the same time might get frustrating. Don't fret though! The game offers a training mode for both the basic monsters and minibosses - only ones you encountered yet, no spoilers.\n\nThe music is fantastic and the artstyle just nails the whole serious yet not serious mood of the game.

The action unfolds according to the unholy beat of the Necrodancer - you must move with it, attack with it, dodge the enemy onslaught with it. The literal pulse of Cadence's heart drives a deadly crypt and the twisted monsters within.\n\nBut underneath it is something more. Dig deeper, and the player uncovers a surprisingly deep gameplay experience, especially for one still in Early Access. Each weapon type sports a unique attack pattern. A cavalcade of items and equipment provides benefits ranging from immediate health recovery to phasing through walls or limiting the number of enemies. Spells can give you an upper hand against the thralls, freezing them in place or blasting them to ashes with a fiery bolt. Shrines, hidden shops, secret enemies, multiple playable characters... they all contribute to an experience unlike most other rhythm games you've played.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer falls into the "roguelike" genre and as such you'll see many of its usual trappings: procedural dungeons, high difficulty, an emphasis on discovery, bombs and consumables, etc. What sets this apart from other similar games, aside from the rhythm aspect, is that luck only plays a minimal factor in your success. Every level and every enemy is balanced in a way that completing a run from start to finish without ever upgrading from the starting dagger is entirely possible, and in fact has been done multiple times. If you're into other roguelike games there is a lot here for you to love and be familiar with. I, for one, never cared much for the genre. Games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac I've played a few times, but ultimately I grew tired of them. 120+ hours later, Crypt of the NecroDancer has me completely hooked.\n\nOne of its biggest strengths is its absolutely stellar soundtrack composed by the well-known Danny Baranowsky. It was a smart move to focus the gameplay around this music - it provides just the right atmosphere and you'll find yourself bobbing your head to the beat as you play without even noticing it. One of the other aspects that really drew me in was that the game feels completely fair. You don't need one specific item to get a good run, and you don't need lucky shops or good spawns to make it to the end. Skill and familiarity with the enemies can carry you 99% of the way. Learning enemy behaviors and discovering new items become fun exercises. If you die, you know exactly what mistake you made and learn to avoid that for the next run. You can play with a keyboard, a controller, or even a dance pad, and you can even add your own music into the levels! The game also has a welcoming community and great forums you can visit to seek advice or share your latest victory.\n\nThere's even still more to come! One more "zone" will be added to the game, there will be more boss fights, as well as the possibility for more items, equipment, mechanics, etc. Even in its "alpha" state Crypt of the NecroDancer is a deep and rewarding experience, and I personally can't wait to see more!","July 30, 2014","true","227.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

However, as you become more invested in the game's unique on-the-beat movement system, you'll begin to realize that NecroDancer is much more than that! Strategy comes into play when dealing with enemies with increasingly complex movement systems, especially when you get the urge to compete for a top spot on the speedrun and gold high school leaderboards in each Daily Challenge.\n\nDannyB's soundtrack for this game is fantastic and somehow hasn't gotten boring to me even after hours and hours playing the game. There's also always the option to enchant the Crypt with your own MP3s with ease!\n\nThe story is surprisingly deep and well thought out - cutscenes are quick but pack a lot of meaning. They flesh out the lore of the NecroDancer very well, and offer a very satisfying resolution that ties up all loose ends.\n\nBrace Yourself Games handled Early Access like champs - there was and still is a huge amount of community involvement, and I've seen many community suggested features be implemented!\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer WELL WELL WELL worth the cost.

Dance pads compatible but not required. It may technically be in Early Access but I'd never know, the game seems pretty complete as is and I keep getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me before I can even clear Zone 2 (there being 4 zones at present).\n\nThe gameplay is pretty self-explanatory once you've gone through the quick tutorial, but is ever a matter of reflexes and quick thinking to keep yourself in one piece. Enemies are deviously varied to give you all manner of headaches to fight in conjunction with one another. Diamonds acquired through play are spent in the hub to unlock new equipment to appear in chests (as well as some passive upgrades like health). Rooms are available to help you practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses, and one character is available to let you just play the game as a regular turn-based roguelike. There's a local co-op mode of some sort too, hell if I know how that works. Hardcore mode is available for a no-upgrades run, and there's a daily one-shot hardcore challenge available, ala Spelunky.\n\nThere are a few minor sticking points.\n1) You can import your own music for any of the levels you like, which is fantastic, except when the automatic beat detection--which, granted, is impressively accurate on the whole--doesn't work quite right and there's no way to attempt a manual fix.\n2) The game doesn't require you to keep on the beat perfectly, there's a fair leeway in the timing and you can miss beats if you don't mind losing your current cash multiplier (that is, unless you've invoked a risk shrine); this is open to some strategizing with skipping a beat to ready yourself for an enemy, but there's no actual control function for 'skip beat' and so you're left waiting for the input grace period between beats for enemies to make their move, after which it's hard to get right back into the rhythm.\n3) There's no "count in" between levels at all, so to keep your multiplier up you have to start moving again before you've even processed what's immediately around you or what the new rhythm actually is.\n4) Practice rooms for monsters are great, but having to defeat a monster or boss once during normal play to unlock them seems a bit counterintuitive.\n\nMinor gripes. Very solid soundtrack, very solid gameplay. Would probably be a HELL of a party game, with big picture running on a nice TV and a DDR mat set up.","July 31, 2014","true","3.5"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

It's the perfect blend of music, plot, voice acting and a beat to get me hyped all the hell when I start it up. DROP DEAD!\n\nThe game is really enjoyable. It's a Roguelike, but it feels less dependent on luck, and more on skill and planning then most others. I don't generally feel like I was screwed too hard when I die; As far as I can see it, you should be able to clear the game without getting hit, or at least close, if you're god-like at pattern recognition.\n\nEvery enemy has it's own pattern, which, I can't believe the game didn't refer to as it's unique Dance. Maybe it's too corny. As Cadence (oh, there's the corniness. Works, though.) remarks, 'learn that, and they'll never harm you.' (something like that.)\n\nI think the one negative I've had in dealing with the game is in using items and spells. It's not impossible, but it takes a good deal getting used to. You only have 4 keys, the 4 directions. To use items, you combine them. Ex, an apple is Up+Left, or whatnot. Keeping your combo going while using them very rarely works out for me in the heat of a battle.\n\nBut, even then, you can bind those combinations to other keys, if you like. Up+Left could be bound to Ctrl, or Shift, or Left trigger.\n\nYes, it works with gamepads. Personally, I bound XBAY and the Dpad to all directions applicable. If your one hand gets tired, switch to the other! Or, if you have a Left+Right item, it works well using both hands, I find, so it's Left+B instead.\n\nAaaaanyway. Graphics are fine. Gameplay is fun (first level's tempo is a liiitle slow for my taste), and the feeling on beating a boss is rewarding. King Conga and his Zombie Conga Lines (yes) confused the hell out of me the first time, but when you learn it, it's just plain fun.\n\nIn short, I love installing large screen televisions in doghouses, and Crypt of the NecroDancer is a good game.","December 24, 2014","true","10.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The other half of the game is rhythm: each dungeon floor has a unique music track with a visually emphasized steady beat. Your moves are (ideally) made to that beat. Enemies also move to the beat, so the pace at which things happen is determined by the music. Having a steady rhythm locks the participant into a timeframe in which to act, not unlike speed chess or the rate at which a block lowers in Tetris. By removing the infinite time in which a player could decide which move is most optimal in your traditional turn-based dungeon excursions, the game becomes instead one of relying almost wholly on experience. After a while, experience becomes instinct, leading to creative leaps of strategy made entirely in the moment, in the space between the game’s figurative and literal heartbeats.\n\nYou play as Cadence, a headstrong delver who - through an unfortunate combination of a terminal fall and an evil NecroDancer stealing her still-beating heart - must now travel down multiple dungeon floors, fighting monsters and finding useful items. You technically don’t have to move to the beat, but not doing so will cause you to lose a vital multiplier that increases how many coins you earn from defeated monsters. The higher the multiplier, the more likely you can afford powerful weapons and items found in dungeon shops. You know when you’re moving to the beat, because the dungeon floor starts pulsing with light, making it your very own little dungeon rave.\n\nThere is very little randomness to the combat in Crypt of the NecroDancer. Everything behaves according to very set rules. You move into a monster to attack it, different weapons change the shape of your attack. If an enemy moves into a square you were trying to move to, you’ll take damage instead. Certain enemies take advantage of your urge to rush in, waiting a beat before moving, or moving in interesting patterns. Monsters have unique little dance animations, their movement sounds become a part of the melody of what’s happening on the screen. These sounds are often a clue to defeating them. As you delve deeper, the music becomes faster, the monster patterns more complex. The game is ingenious, fun in ways indescribable unless you’re there, in the moment, taken by the rhythm and amazed at how well you’re doing.\n\nYou can use your own MP3s for the soundtrack, and there’s even a DDR mode for use with a dance pad. The DDR mode makes a game a bit easier so you don’t kill yourself. There’s permanent progression via character upgrades, like a health increase and magic spells, unlocked by collecting diamonds.\n\nThe music is being provided by the excellent Danny Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy, Canabalt, Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeons).","September 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Miss a beat, everything around you takes a turn anyway.  At first it sounds weird to not have all the time in the world to plan a move in an RL, but NecroDancer makes it work with basic patterns to all creatures.  The main challenge is balancing keeping the beat up with putting yourself in a good position to deal with whatever comes at you.  You need either quick decision-making or good muscle memory from repeated plays to deal with complex situations.\n\nUnreservedly recommend it once the game is completed.  $15 for early access is alright, but you'll probably have to be interested in the concept beforehand to feel fully happy about your $15.","August 4, 2014","true","14.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you haven't experienced them together, you think it's a bizarre combo that won't mesh well. Then you try it and you wonder why you haven't had the two together before. Where has this magical combo been your entire life?\n\nGimmick aside, the game is still beautifully designed. The enemies all have tells and literally have choreographed attacks. Everything gives signs before the action takes place, much like many roguelikes. It's just that this game took that dance and set it to a kickin' soundtrack. You can even practice against enemies without needing to throw yourself into the deep end to figure out their tells.\nEven the characters are more upbeat and lively than your average roguelike. The little things, like how they greet NPCs (shyly VS boldly VS force of habit) and their surprised reactions to teleportation make them seem less like digital avatars and more like humans. A little detail that adds a lot of magic to the game.\n\n[edit] THE STORY. Add the story to another fantastic bit of this game. Only frustrating bit is how hard it is to complete story mode, but hey, it's a roguelike. That's to be expected from the genre.\n\nTL;DR - A wonderfully charming game that blends two very different genres in a lovingly-designed piece.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/247080/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Crypt of the Necrodancer is a cross of both rhythm game and turned based  RPG in where you have to move along to the beat of the song and keep a steady rhythm to get a higher combo count. Every note counts as a turn and missing a note resets your combo as well as costs you a turn. This is a game in where you must have must both quick reflexes and foresight since you don't have much time to think. Your enemies also move along to the beat of the song so you can estimate how long it will take them to reach you and plan accordingly. Movement is grid based so you move square by square and the only buttons you will need during the game are the arrow keys. You attack by moving next to an enemy and hitting the arrow direction they are in and stranger still is that you use your bombs by holding the down and left arrow. There are also spells and other items that are activated by holding the up and right keys. As you can no doubt tell this is a rather strange control scheme and it does take some time to get used to. It is a strange gameplay concept to explain properly and there is nothing else like it on the market so I would suggest looking up some gameplay videos to see if this is your cup of tea.\n\nThe levels are split up into 4 zones accessible via the hub-world where you can also purchase new items and weaponry that randomly spawns in the level once purchased. To purchase these items you will need diamonds which are semi rare collectibles scattered around the levels. Once you either die or pass that zone you will be tossed to the hub-world and will be able to spend your diamonds. Be wary though as entering any level will reset your diamonds back to zero so always make sure to spend them before heading back into the action. Another important collectible found in levels is gold which can be used to purchase unlocked weapons and items from shops. If you don't have any gold when you find a shop you can also blow up the golden walls of the shop to collect the debris and buy your items that way, the shopkeeper won't mind his walls being blown up funnily enough. One of the really neat things about this game is that the levels are destructible and you start off with a shovel that allows you to create your own paths through them and search for hidden goodies. There is a time limit for each level however, so if the song finishes you are immediately dropped down to the next level via a trapdoor. Each zone  has three levels that lead to a boss fight and you will want to be well equipped when you face one of them.\n\nBosses are randomly generated so you will not face the same boss each attempt but all of them will take quite a bit of skill to defeat. One of the easier ways to handle bosses is to pick up a spear if you are lucky enough to find one as it can attack from two blocks away meaning you can attack it from a safe place. That is easier said than done however since missing a beat will cost you a turn which can have dire consequences. You need to have a good rhythm at all times and that is very hard to do when you have to press two keys at the same time to use an item or spell. Keeping an unbroken rhythm also makes any gold you collect be worth much more, so the better you are at doing that the higher your chances of survival. If you find a key and save someone from a cage you will unlock a new character which play differently from our original heroine. One of them fights by only using bombs, another character can't attack but all exits are unlocked and one of the characters even gets rid of the rhythm part of the game entirely, allowing you to move whenever you want and take your time. There are quite major changes to the gameplay from character to character which makes this game's replayablity really high.\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is brutal and you will be dying a lot until you unlock some better gear with diamonds. It has randomly generated levels so learned the pattern of them is not an option and it is more than happy to toss out a bunch of enemies. Learning how to fight each enemy is integral to be able to hold your own as some will roll toward you on sight leaving you with little time to move but hitting it on time will send it spiraling back to whence it came. Weapons also have their own quirks to them such as crossbows having to be reloaded but give you great range and rapiers will cause your character to rush in to attack an enemy two blocks away. Finding armor will lower the amount of damage you take and a torch will increase your view distance. This game is much more complex than it may appear and knowledge will be your greatest strength in these funky crypts. On the hubworld, the Beastmaster’s area allows you to pick any enemy you like and practice against them to your hearts content. It is not unlocked from the beginning as he is locked in a cage and must be freed in order to show up in the hubworld. There is a story but it is very forgettable and unimportant.\n\nAs is expected of a rhythm game the music is very catchy and fit the tongue in cheek feel of the game very well. Each stage has its own unique song and if you ever get tired of them there are a few other remixed soundtracks you can choose from, such as a Metal version. You can even use your own music but the notes don't match up at all to the songs making it very hard to keep a steady rhythm. It is an extra option so I can't really knock it but I can't imagine too many people wanting to use it. Crypt of the Necrodancer supports Steam Workshop and there are quite a bit of mods to keep you entertained such as one that changes your character into Hatsune Miku and even one that overhauls the whole game to have a Mario Bros aesthetic. There is plenty of content in the base game and the levels being randomly generated insures that you will have a different experience each playthrough. What it ultimately comes down to is if you like the strange gameplay on offer here and would like to once again suggest looking up a gameplay video. I'd imagine it would be much more fun to use a dancepad and a large TV to play this but using the keyboard works well enough too. Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique experience you can't get anywhere else and tons of fun to boot.","February 7","true","5.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

Although this game is not a pure beatgame, it has the full characteristics of one. The concept of two different game genres put into one is incredible, but it is just EPIC when the execution of it is perfect.\n\nThe soundtrack of this game is simply amazing. I've never really had a taste for electronic music or jazz, but the stuff they put into this game definitely made me change my mind. The way they've designed everything, I think, was so you, the player, could jam to any music that would hit you. Every moving object in the game has an animation that moves to the rhythm of the BPM (beats per minute; determines how fast a song is) of the song, the shopkeepers' singing is just perfect, and the rest of the sound effects (voices, attacks, monsters) flow so astoundingly. Sometimes I play this game just because I want to listen to the soundtrack. Custom music is a plus, and I have not found any errors working with it so far. It has it's own BPM detection that works fine.\n\nRandomly generated-ness (well that's rogue-like, isn't it?) makes this game never get old. The story mode is of moderate length, and surprisingly, or at least, for me, I have gotten tied to the characters and I have grown to have sympathy for them! If you don't have a thing for rogue-like games, this will surely change your mind (That's what had happened to me).\n\nThe pixel art is adorable, and the character concept art for those monsters are.. dark and horrifying. Think you have a slow/old computer and can't run this game? This game ran at 60 fps on mine, so you're fine. (In case you didn't get it, my computer is very bad.)\n\nWhen you first start playing, the thing that you need to remember is to never give up. If you die five times in a row, you should either take a break for a while and come back to the game later or keep playing. You will  see that improvement and it will just feel amazing. You actually feel accomplished about something, which is what very few games are able to do.\n\nAs for going into more depth about the gameplay, no need for that. It is all for you to discover yourself. But here's something to remember: although the content of this game doesn't seem that abundant, trust me. It was way more stuff than you think. They also have a level editor after you complete the game (or should I say, a fraction of the game [Note what I said to remember]), so you can upload your creations to the Steam Workshop that is connected to the game or just play them alone. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nTo sum it up, this game deserves every one of those awards that you see to the right. If not, more than that. This review cannot express how much I enjoy this game. It is one of the most unique and unforgettable gaming experiences ever. Get this game if you're looking for something new to enjoy.\n\nHighly Recommended\nAlso, sorry if I have any grammar/typing errors.

A lot. Now, take into account what most of the high-rated reviews say, because I agree with them. But what I'm going to touch on is something specific that I find most interesting and perhaps wholly unique about this game. Put simply, it reminds me of chess. In fact, one of the final boss room types is a chess set, which you can see briefly in the trailer, but that's beside the point. All enemies have set actions (or perhaps reactions), and will always make them according to the rhythm and how you move. For instance, the red dragon will move once every two beats toward you unless you are any distance directly to the left or right of him, in which case he will shoot a row of fire. The goblins will run away if you approach them, but pursue if you move away from them.\n\nNow, normally, if you had all the time you needed, you could plan out a perfect attack and kill everything without taking damage, but in this game, you have to move with the beat. You have to think quickly if you want to work your way out of a tricky situation. When you die, you feel like it was your mistake and the game had not cheated you, which is generally the case (though there is a small chance of the game generating an absurdly difficult enemy encounter). Even so, due to the random generation, it is possible to find a good weapon or food early on, making giving you an advantage. I always hope for an awesome weapon, but sometimes find myself doing surprisingly well with just a standard dagger.

Great concept here, total lack of content hidden behind frustrating layers of difficulty.\n\nEdit: To clarify since people seem to think I'm "just doing it wrong". I love a lot of the ideas in this game... a unique rhythm based dungeon crawler is right up my alley; but when you strip it all back what we have here is a shallow rougelike experience wrapped behind some incredibly charming art / style and a great soundtrack.\n\nThere are 4 levels and a handful of enemy types, and no matter what the folks in the comments say you're going to die... a lot. The soundtrack is good, which is nice because you're going to be listening to the same 3 songs over and over as you attempt to master the enemy movements.\n\nI don't personally recommend it because I found the experience frustrating and unrewarding.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/247080/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAbsolutely amazing. I never thought there would ever be a roguelike-rythm game, but here we are, and it's executed in such a way that this will probably end up being my favorite game of the year. The game is played using just arrow keys for movement and item usage, and it works really well.\n\nThe game appears as a standard roguelike dungeon crawler; you make tactical choices in turn-based style battles, find equipment and try to battle your way through dungeons. The difference is that the game focuses on forcing the player to keep in step with the beat of the song for movement and actions (traditionally what you'd consider to be "turns"), giving the player a bonus in gold which can be used to buy equipment if done without flaw. Failing to move with the beat will result in a missed action while all the enemies take a turn and losing this bonus.\n\nI don't think I've ever played an RPG so easy to get into, yet challenging on many levels. It has a fun plot that works with the premise of the mechanics and the voice acting is actually very good. The music is superb, and if it's not your thing you can use your own music to power the gameplay.\n\nI don't even think I have anything I could say needs improving. It supports controllers and even dance pads. There's a slightly less difficult mode meant specifically for playing with dance pads. They already have a character that doesn't need to move in time, turning the game into a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler if you want to get used to the game or want to take a break from the rythm aspects of the game. I mean, they thought of everything and the game is super polished, all that seems to be missing is four characters and the last zone (which I haven't even reached yet). This is seriously a game I wish I had helped made.","August 9, 2014","true","16.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You have to move and act to the beat of the music, so you must assess the enemies, traps, and walls around you and act very quickly. The enemies start out simple enough, with easy-to-tell movement patterns. However, subsequent zones become muh trickier, with things and foes that mess with your position or require you to be very attentive of your surroundings. Managing and understanding is key in reaching the end of the game.\n\nThere are a fair amount of extras here. In your regular runs you collect diamonds, which you use to unlock new items to find in your runs, upgrades like more life or a higher money multiplier, the opportunity to practice against bosses, and more. There are several different characters to play as, who all change the game in some manner, which can be as simple as requiring you to act in double time or as substantial as restricting your weaponry to bombs.\n\nThe music is fantastic. As you may expect from the title, it's all very dancable stuff. I seriously would listen to this at a party. Perhaps the best part is the various ways it's mixed when you enter certain areas. The graphics are in a pixel style and it looks and animates well enough.\n\nIn summary, Crypt of the NecroDancer takes rhythm and dungeon crawling elements together and brings out the best of both of them. Combine that with a great soundtrack, and the end result is a game that comes highly recommended.\n\nAlso, NecroDancer is a superb pun.

By forcing the player to time their next move to the beat, the game not only adds a welcome challenge, but also gives a sense of immersion as everything on the board pulses with the click of the key. I almost felt as though I were orchestrating the entire dungeon's movements as I chose where to go next.\n\nThe game definitely captures the typical rhythm game's infusion of motion from the screen to the game controller to the player himself. I was tapping away with my foot and humming at times unawares as I got absorbed further into the game. And I'm only about an hour and two zones in at the moment.\n\nWhich is why calibration is extraordinarily important to this game. While you could manage by with a slight offset in rhythm, the game really benefits from having a tight link to the beat as you progress further and encounter harder enemies. This is especially so when fighting the various level bosses and when you fall into one trap, which teleports you to a special level, in which any mistiming of the beat automatically kills you.\n\nDefinitely an easy game to pick up immediately and start playing, but also full of challenges along the way to keep you going. Just make sure to calibrate well.","July 30, 2014","true","37.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A Hardcore Rythm based Roguelike? So I watched the trailer and got hooked. Then I got it and I am absolutely amazed.\n\nthe basic priciple is like a turn based roguelike - when you move the enemies move according to their pattern. You crawl through randomly generated floors, try to find a boss monster, kill it and find the exit to the next floor. But what sets this apart is the rythm component. Because you can only move on a beat of the background music. And every beat makes the enemies move as well.\n\nThe Pixel art, albeit simple looks amazing. the Music gets you pumped and theres allways something new to discover.\n\nthe Gameplay and Action itself is tight. As in, you could take it slow, but if you so much as miss a beat, your multiplicator gets reset. Which means less gold and probably less equipment in turn, so you have to keep the rythm, move every beat and make quick decisions. And if the song runs out, the floor is over.\n\nthe music, Kick ♥♥♥. The way it should be for any rythm based game. But if you dont like it, you can use your own library to fill the floors with life.\nthe geme itself keeps you frustrated enough to make you wanna try again, because every enemy behaves in a certain way and you can train combat against them pretty early on - so if you die its because you got careless.\n\noh, and the shopkeepers voice is divine.

Crypt does not disappoint in the slightest with its amazing tunes, composed by the one and only Danny Baranowsky as well as awesome remixes by FamilyJules7x and A_Rival.\n- You can use your own music in the game, and this feature is implemented well.\n- The game provides a hard but fair style of gameplay, something that is sure to keep people doing runs over and over again.\n- Each of the characters adds an interesting twist (such as moving in cut time or being able to only use bombs) that provide an additional challenge for players to overcome.\n- This game has high replayability as no two runs are exactly the same.\n- A mix of items provides players with multiple ways to beatdown enemies to the beat.\n- The devs constantly provide updates and work hard to fix any bugs that people encounter along the way.\n\nCons:- It can take awhile to get used to. You're probably not going to be able to get through Zone 1 on your first try. For some people, this may be a turnoff, though, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can really get a lot of enjoyment out of completing a run.\n- If you're trying to 100% this game... think again. One of the achievements may be impossible to get, which may turn some people away.\n- Pausing the game and regaining your pace can be rather difficult. While this may not sound like a big deal at first glance, there are some characters who will die if you miss a beat (Aria and Coda).\n\nSome people may complain about the price, but you can find some 33% off coupons floating around on Steam. It's not much, but 10 bucks is less than 15.\n\nTL;DR: If you like rogue likes, rhythm games, or dungeon crawlers, get this game. This game is an astounding combination of the three that works harmoniously.

I was frustrated because I found the rhythm aspect of the game overwhelmingly difficult, not because it is necessarily, but more likely it’s my lack of ability to time my movements right, and I found it hard to watch the in-game metronome while doing everything else. This is more of a personal problem though, and it doesn’t really reflect on the game.\n\nHowever, I learned that there is another class called bard available from the start of the game. The bard can move freely without the concern of coordinating with the beat, and the monsters move when the player moves; more akin to a traditional roguelike. Playing bard has made the game enjoyable to me, and I look forward to possibly taking on the challenge of playing with the other characters later.\n\nThe game is well designed, and I’m impressed with the level it’s at for still being in development. The soundtrack is worth noting, it’s really good, and the pixel art is also very nostalgic, and in my opinion, it fits the game perfect. Everything you would expect from a roguelike is there too, but with a spin, and I respect the developers creativity coming up with something so unique. The play style may not be appealing to everyone, but the game will (and should) still be recognised as a good game.\n\nEverything considered Crypt of the Necrodancer is a pretty cool game for alpha. I sincerely hope that development continues, and the game is finished. A successful pre-release all to often results in games being abandoned and pretty much just left in their current state.","July 30, 2014","true","4.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

There are plenty of games in which the player displays their ability to comprehend music and beat, and there are a fair number of games where the player explores a dungeon, travelling deeper and deeper, growing in strength as their enemies become tougher and tougher, where any misstep will result in a "game over" screen and the option to start over from square one. I don't think mixing these kinds of games has ever been done before, and I'm in love with the result!\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer isn't just a groovy music game, nor is it just a dungeon-crawling roguelike - it's both. It's a very demanding game, as it requires quick thinking and decision-making, and throughout the whole experience you will absolutely want to groove in place, getting as deep into those juicy tunes as you can. Play it with a keyboard or a dance mat; you'll have extreme fun no matter which way you play.\n\nI have nothing but praise for this game, and it isn't even finished yet.

There are plenty of games in which the player displays their ability to comprehend music and beat, and there are a fair number of games where the player explores a dungeon, travelling deeper and deeper, growing in strength as their enemies become tougher and tougher, where any misstep will result in a "game over" screen and the option to start over from square one. I don't think mixing these kinds of games has ever been done before, and I'm in love with the result!\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer isn't just a groovy music game, nor is it just a dungeon-crawling roguelike - it's both. It's a very demanding game, as it requires quick thinking and decision-making, and throughout the whole experience you will absolutely want to groove in place, getting as deep into those juicy tunes as you can. Play it with a keyboard or a dance mat; you'll have extreme fun no matter which way you play.\n\nI have nothing but praise for this game, and it isn't even finished yet. Even when I began playing in advance of the early access hitting steam, I never once felt like my money was misplaced. Even if this game were never finished, it'd still be worth every penny I spent on it.\n\nAre you even slightly interested in what this game has to offer? No need to wonder any longer; snag this one and lose yourself in it for a while.","August 15, 2014","true","51.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a mix of Spelunky and Binding of Isaac's zone and random item mechanics, all smushed in with a dungeon crawler and a rhythm game. It's fairly unforgiving but not deathly hard (unless you do hardcore mode or above, but that's expected).\n\nIt's definitely worth a play if you're a fan of rhythm games or dungeon crawlers regardless. The soundtrack is probably one of the most solid soundtracks I've heard on a game in quite a while, and even after 16 hours I'm still not tired of it and want to keep playing (though trying to resist due to waiting for missing content to be finished).\n\nThe game's in Early Access but you wouldn't notice it if it weren't for zone 4 being unfinished, so it's definitely in a fun playable state already and the only places it can go is up. There's a lot more content on it's way but there's no harm picking it up now, you'll definitely get your money's worth if you enjoy any of the genres within.","August 2, 2014","true","53.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This review is going to be in a pro-con format so yah. Review Time!\n\nPros -The story is very well made and interesting, and a good motivator to keep trying to beat the first character (Cadence)\n-Rhythm and Roguelike mashups that works perfectly\n-Nice difficulty curve\n-Lots of variety in runs and characters, so as to not feel repetitive (which it doesn't)\n-Amazing soundtrack with now 4 different variants (2 of them you can only get through workshop mods)\n-Every death is your fault, not the games\n-The gameplay is spot on, with each weapon feeling really fun to play\n-Local Co-op is very fun to play and is executed well\n-Amazing community\n-Practically infinite replayability with all the achievements and things to unlock\n-Steam Achievements/Steam trading cards\n-And so much more\n\nNeutral -The game is very difficult to get the hang of, considering its very different from other roguelikes (this isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing I thought I'd point out\n-Some of the characters are pretty difficult (Once again, not a bad thing, just something I thought I would point out.)\n\nCons -Part of the story is unlocked by Aria, who is a VERY difficult character to beat, or even get anywhere with (luckily youtube exists)\n-Coda\n-That's it really\n\nOverall I give this game a 10/10. This game is honestly the best roguelike Ive ever played, with its awesome replayability, cool characters and a very interesting story, and its gameplay is spot on\nVery much recommend!","March 20","true","104.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This has to be a joke."\nSaid everyone ever when they first saw this game.\n\nI didn't come in expecting much. "Oh, it's a 8-bit 'rythm based rogue-like'. Bet the devs made this on their coffee break at Starbucks."\nMy expectations were blown out of the water.\n\nFirst of all, it's hard. Like, actually hard. Yes, a ton of challenge comes from keeping the beat. And yes, the musically-challenged will suffer with this game. (Assuming you don't pick The Bard, who isn't affected by the music at all.)\nBut the real challenge comes from all the enemies. They all have different patters that you have to memorize learn. It never felt like memorization. You can see every enemy well in advance, and the paths aren't too complex outside of the bosses.\n\nSecondly, it has a ton of depth.\nThere are dozens of items. Nothing out of The Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain, but enough to make the average indie rogue-like feel scared. They all fit into specific item slots: Head, Chest, Feet, Ring, Bag, Item, Magic, Weapon, and I'm probably forgetting something. Not only that, but all the weapons have specific types that alter in power and fighting style. No spoilers as to all the different weapons, but you will very quickly discover the strengths and weaknesses of all the weapons.\n\nAnd lastly, it's fun!\nThe story is surprisingly strong. All the enemies are fun to fight. All the items feel unique. The music is great...\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is a game I'd highly suggest at least checking out. It might not be worth buying for those who aren't interested in Rogue-Likes or aren't very musically tallented, but I'd beg you to at the very least watch some gameplay footage of it.","June 16, 2015","true","29.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But it does, so very well.\n\nA soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky means it's going to be good, and the tunes go well with the rapid, split-second pace you need to keep in order to stay ahead of the game. I'm not sure if it's extremely difficult or I just plain suck, but I still have yet to get overly far in it and consistently blunder into enemies as I try to stay on time to the beat so as not to lose my combo. It's embarrassing, really. But my own suckitude aside, this is a game that's just so much fun, especially once you start getting into the zone and responding to things before your brain can really process them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/247080/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Crypt of the NecroDancer has ruined my life. I hear its catchy tunes in my head while I eat. I tap out the rhythm of dungeons in my car. And my children keep asking me what that funky song I'm humming all the time is. I can't stop thinking about this game, despite the fact it is deceptively hard and I may never actually get past Zone 3. So let me tell you why you should suffer the same fate.\n\nIn classic roguelike tradition, Crypt is an adventure through randomly-generated dungeons with randomly-generated loot to find and use on randomly-generated monsters. It's all laid out in a pleasing grid of pixel art, controlled solely with the arrow keys. Special items are used by pressing two directions at once, and attacks are as simple as pushing towards an enemy in range. Unlike other roguelikes, there's no random element to attacks. Everything has a set number of hearts, and if you hit it (or it hits you), you take the prescribed amount of damage. Monsters have set patterns to their attacks, meaning there are really no surprises to combat.\n\nThe catch here is that everything is set to the music, and you have to move on the beat. Enemies won't wait for your turn, either, because they're jamming to the same rhythm. Miss a beat and you effectively lose your turn. Suddenly this otherwise simple, predictable game becomes one of concentration and quick thinking. You need to be moving or attacking with every beat, and if you're focusing on keeping cadence, you're not focusing on strategy. Fortunately the game is desgined with this in mind, offering a robust tutorial, multiple practice modes, and even a second character unlocked from the start that can ignore the beat. There are four zones to conquer, each three levels and a boss. Beating the previous one unlocks the next, allowing you to skip ahead. You can also collect diamonds to purchase upgrades and new items to add to the random pool.\n\nThere's a terrible secret behind this welcoming facade, though. All of this is essentially an elaborate, extended tutorial for All Zones mode, which challenges you to beat all four zones in order, starting with the full item pool unlocked but no upgrades to your character. This is the proper roguelike mode for the game, and it is incredibly difficult to get through. Missed beats and damaging mistakes mount up fast enough to make beating individual zones a challenge, and starting essentially from scratch means your strategies have to be second nature. Unless the rhythm is in your blood, mastering Crypt is going to take a lot of time and a lot of practice.\n\nDon't let that dissuade you from trying the game, of course. There's plenty to see and do even if you never touch All Zones mode. The many characters to unlock play like entirely different games, and you can access quite a few just by playing the individual zones. As expected from a rhythm-based game, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and is sure to get permanently stuck in your head. Even if you keep getting mauled by mambo'ing skeletons, you're sure to come back for more. I really may never get past Zone 3 but I'm having too much fun to stop now.","December 26, 2015","true","5.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

Whilst still W.I.P. I have not noticed a single bug so far, that or my sense of immersion to the actual game in terms of the music and the battling of monsters is just that great that I miss those bugs. Either way, the game is looking great, players new to this game will quickly get punished by the games relentless dedication to movement/rythm based fighting, often meaning that anyone who jumps in unprepared will end up dying a lot.\n\nWhat does this say about the game? Maybe for the common, run of the mill gamer it might mean frustrating and unpreventable deaths. But to the dedicated gamer, those who use tutorials or at least have played a rythm game of some kind can grasp that everything requires key timing and a suprisingly large amount of strategy.\n\nDo I reccomend this game? Yes. As of this moment its £10.99 ($17.94, €13.85), if you have the money, I fully reccomend buying and trying this game to anyone who is interested in it. More importantly I reccomend it as a backing to this genre of gaming as it is not often you see Rythm based games being produced. I know right now that more and more companies are making music based rythm games, but there needs to be a larger supply of them. With the people who made this game I do hope they make more like this as this genre is genrally underated, undersold and the variety of game titles is just too small.","September 7, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You can play it for a few minutes to kill time, or you can sit down and play it for hours. And lord knows you will.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Viridis/recommended/247080/","Viridis","Driscon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Viridis/","391 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou'd never have considered that rhythm games and dungeon crawling go together, but this game makes it work.\n\nFirst off: this isn't a very serious dungeon crawler.  Most levels are small-ish and relatively uninteresting, with just a few rooms full of monsters linked together by various corridors.\n\nWhat makes this work though is that the game is half real time, half turn based.  Based on the music playing for the level, each beat of the music is one turn, and enemies have a fairly mixed movement pattern based on the turns (e.g. one moves towards you every other turn, one moves in 4 directions each turn randomly, etc.).  This means that enemies move whether you move or not, but if you have the rhythm, you can anticipate where they will be and outsmart them.\n\nOn the easy levels, this is fairly straightforward.  As enemies progress and become more complicated, you also need to develop more complicated patterns, but what you will actually do depends on the minor variations in the level.  This means that unlike other rhythm games, you can't just memorize a button sequence for a particular song.  Instead, it is constantly changing.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is top notch, and design is pretty good.  There are plenty interesting enemies, weapons, accessories, spells, traps, etc. that make each replay sufficiently different to be fun.\n\nEarly Access note:  As of this writing, the game is In EA.  It has 3 zones (12 levels) and 5 characters ready to play, with a planned final zone and another 5 characters.  However, the current maps are plenty playable, plenty fun, and not buggy at all.","September 23, 2014","true","78.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Later that day, I sat down to play a different game, but decided to start Crypt of the NecroDancer up just to check it out.\nThe next thing I knew, two hours had passed and it was time to get ready to leave to go to my in-laws for Christmas. I grabbed my laptop and installed it real quick so I could play it while I was out of town (the system requirements are really low, so it ran just fine).\nIt might be one of the most addictive games I've ever played. I don't know how many times I've told myself, "Just one more round," only to spend another hour with it.\nIt's also very challenging in a Dark Souls kind of way. If you die, it's probably your fault. Instead of becoming frustrated, I only felt encouraged to try again and pay more attention to the movement patters of the enemies.\nAlso, the soundtrack is fantastic.

Very, very excited to try this game because I adore the rogue-like genre and enjoy beatmatching when I mix my electronic dance music (EDM) at home. Crypt hit on many of the themes and concepts that I’ve always loved, and I thoroughly enjoyed my gameplay experience. This is easily one of the best staples available in the rogue-like genre.\n\nIf you like rogue-likes, rhythm mechanics, dungeon crawling, electronic music (Danny Baranowsky’s score), and constantly unlocking new things, then you will really love this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are great – the amount of detail in the different levels and characters is well-done. The retro, pixel graphics combine with the electronic musical score to provide a very fun, fast-paced experience reminiscent of old-school arcade games (including the high difficulty that usually accompanied them). Danny Baranowsky’s music is critical to the gameplay – since you have to time your movements with the beat – and fits well with the heavy rogue-like elements found in the game. If you are partial to electronic music, then you will enjoy the great soundtrack. If you don’t, however, like EDM and/or Danny’s style, then you can always use your own music (MP3 format). There is a unique track for each level, and you have the option of loading your own playlist for each level. Note, I have a very wide taste in music, so I tried an assortment of genres – EDM tracks work very well with the rhythm mechanics (because of the consistent beats per minute), but Ariana Grande (I love her) songs DO NOT work very well. That being said, Danny’s composition is fantastic, and I don’t mind replaying levels over and over again, listening to the same tracks every time. Another advantage of using EDM tracks in a custom playlist is the length – the levels end in line with the track playing, so EDM’s lengthier (on average) playtime gives you more opportunity to explore the floor. The story involves you falling into a dungeon, your heart being magically tied to an ominous beat that you must dance to.\n\nThe controls are fairly easy to learn – a tutorial is offered that teaches you the basics of gameplay. I personally prefer using a controller over the keyboard, and I suggest you use that instead. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with rogue-likes and/or rhythm games. Before you start playing, you will have to do a latency test for visual (the heartbeats and beat prompts) and auditory (the actual beat) cues; you can redo the test whenever you want. There is an “easy” mode that you can play, however, I sincerely think you will find a fair challenge playing the regular difficulty. Also, if you want a break from the beatmatching, you can play as a character (Bard) who does not have to move in time with the beat.\n\nDifficulty is something this game does very well, especially for a rogue-like. Characters you unlock will usually have harder playing conditions (ex: cannot kill enemies, die when you pick up gold), ramping up the challenge factor. To combat this, you can unlock a character/room that allows you to practice against the different enemies you may encounter – this allows you to recognize their movement/attack patterns and how to best deal with them. A character/room also exists that allows you to train against mini- and regular bosses. I highly recommend you at least check these out once you have them available, especially if you are having difficulty progressing through the levels. There is even a room that provides levels where you can learn advanced tactics, like how to kill the shopkeeper in different ways. I appreciate this approach to difficulty because it provides you with the tools to improve your playstyle, should you so choose.\n\nGameplay involves you moving around a grid-based dungeon floor, most times in synchrony with the beat (unless you are playing as the Bard). Monsters on the floor also move in time with the beat, and they attack based on a chess/checkers-style pattern – if you move onto a tile that a monster was about to move to, you will take damage. Also, if you move into the attack range (varies based on the monster) of a monster, you will take damage if it is ready to attack – they usually have an animation cue (ex: skeletons raise their arms) to let you know an attack is incoming. To take advantage of monster movements (all units have to move each beat, or “turn.”), you can do things like backtrack or hit a wall (which will keep you on the same tile). As you progress through the level, monsters will drop gold. To increase the amount of gold dropped, you will have to build up your gold multiplier by hitting all track beats (when you move/attack) within a small window. Every time you miss a beat or take damage, your multiplier will decrease by an increment. Picking up armor will decrease how much damage you take, but will not affect your multiplier. Gold is used to purchase items from the large variety of stores available. Multipliers are especially effective when paired with multiplier-based equipment (ex: damage dealt is based on your current multiplier).\n\nOverall, the game is an immense amount of fun and always a fair, interesting challenge.\n\nIf you are any bit interested in the rogue-like series or rhythm gameplay, then I implore you to give this game a try. It definitely is one of the best rogue-like titles available today.\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","June 3, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Another rogue-like game to enjoy.  The idea of movement based on the beat makes this game require some quick thinking.  This, like most rogue-likes the random drop can make or break players like me.  I found myself replaying levels all the time and hoping for certain drops.  Once you unlock some of the characters it allows you a little more freedom to play.  I took the bard out to solve all levels to get an idea of what I was getting into before I started to attempt with the main character.  Fun game for sure and pretty cool when you start to add your own songs into each of the levels.

By the time this game turned up, I was not very hopeful. The gloomy title conjured up images of a tedious slog through yet another Tolkein knock-off world. The screenshots reminded me of a hundred junk titles that bill themselves as "retro" and "8-bit" to lure long-time gamers into parting with their money in a quest to recapture good memories from their childhood. The description, touting the unlikely fusion of roguelike and rhythm genres, left me almost certain that this was nothing more than a concept gimmick that would fail to meet even the lowest of expectations.\n\nI could not have been more wrong.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is the most inspired, refreshing contribution to gaming that I have encountered in years. This game blends the simplest and most predictable mechanics with enough variety to be challenging and so much creativity that even casual players will have a whole lot of goofy fun. I've played countless times over the past few weeks, died in most of them, and found myself smiling anyway, because it was almost always my own fault rather than the result of an impossible situation or bad user interface, and because it's easy to jump right back in.\n\nEach creature has a specific pattern of movement with consistent restrictions, and is easily identifiable on sight, so you can usually predict what it will do next. It will always move on the beat of the music. Press one of the four direction buttons, and you'll move, interact with an obstacle, or attack an enemy in that direction. Do it on the beat, or you'll be sorry. Use items from your inventory by pressing two buttons at once. Following these rules, you'll find yourself learning the patterns of movement (or dances) required to subdue each monster and make your way deeper into the dungeon.\n\nOn top of that solid foundation sits a cast of unique bosses, playable characters with different abilities, unlockable upgrades, training areas, cooperative mode, instant replays, a level editor, gamepad and dance mat support, cross-platform compatibility, a surprisingly good chiptune-style soundtrack, and the ability to import whatever music your dungeon-crawling heart desires.\n\nAnd it's still only an alpha.\n\nOutstanding work, Brace Yourself Games. You shattered the preconceptions of this linux-using nethack fan. Now take my money.","November 17, 2014","true","331.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This music is pure gold, no matter which track I listen to.\n\nThe levels are procedurally generated, and so are the enemies that go along with them, making game play change each time you load up and play.\n\nThe large assortment of items and upgrades you can purchase in the game's lobby (for diamonds you find on each level run) is large and diverse, with many different rings, weapons, spells, health upgrades, etc. at your disposal.\n\nThe player and enemy movement design is flawless, and whenever you start battling you begin this "dance of death" with whatever you're fighting. And when you die, and believe me you will (And if you're like me it will be a lot), it was never some random event that happened out of nowhere that killed you, as some rogue-likes are based around, this one is your own mistakes being your downfall, which means less luck is involved and the game is more skill-based, which I truly enjoy.\nEverything can be defeated with the stock dagger, without armour and without any fancy magic tricks, they're all just luxuries that make fighting your way through the darkest areas of the Crypt simpler.\n\nIn short, Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of the best indie-games I have ever come across, with it's blend of both musical masterpieces and enthralling game play, this is one of my top choices for games focusing around rhythm.\n\n\nAlso, the Shopkeeper Sings.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWZwltXKAM&list=PLhFC8pd7oZvwJYhjmpZVyaKG7CUNoVvae&index=78","April 27, 2015","true","66.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

This game has changed my opinion so much from the first time I played it I wanted to write this incase I can convince at least one other person who may have had similiar feelings as me when I first played it.\n\nI tried playing this game a few times as Cadence when I first got it.\nIt was somewhat fun, although not enough to keep my attention.\n\nThen I tried playing as the Bard.\n\nIt was fun not having to worry about the beat of music, and instead just learning enemy movement and attack patterns.\nWhen you play as the Bard the whole game becomes turn-based.  Each move you make causes the enemies to do one movement.\nA solid rogue-like.  You basically play over and over until you get familiar with all the enemies, each time you feel yourself getting better and better at this game.\n\nI was in zone 2.  Just doing another run, when it hit me.  Even as the Bard I found myself moving to the beat of the music.  I was using my shovel to dig through dirt which added its own sound to the music playing.  I was realizing that some of the movements I was making when fighting a particular enemy was almost like doing dance moves.\n\nIt hit me.  This game is freaking genius.  Playing through a few times as the Bard is almost a necessity and I wish the game developers would have somehow made it more obvious that this should be a first step.\n\nBinding of Isaac used to be my favorite Rogue-Like, now I can say without a doubt this is my new favorite.","May 4, 2015","true","17.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The inclusion of a rhythm-action mechanic, where you're rewarded for moving on the beat of the music is both novel and fun. It adds a sense of urgency (and sometimes panic), while also opening up a risk/reward mechanic of when it's smart to *not* move, lose your multiplier, but gain a tactical advantage in your approach to a given enemy.\n\nThe enemy and powerup design is varied and interesting, allowing each run to play out very differently. There's  a very strong feeling of ongoing progressive mastery that happens, as you figure out the right way to defeat new monster types and the best way to utilize the items you pick up.\n\nOf particular note is that you can brush the dust off your old DDR dance pad, and use that to play the game. Any game that allows you use old ludicrous peripherals scores bonus points in my book. Now, who wants to play a couple of rounds of Streetfighter with a Dreamcast fishing rod controller?

The answer is none.  None more niche.\n\nSeriously though, this is a pretty fun roguelike.  It gives me the same vibe as One Way Heroics, even though their gameplay is fundamentally opposed: They both add an element of tension that isn't present in normal roguelikes.  In the case of Crypt of the NecroDancer it's a very frantic tension, which makes it hard to play for long stretches at a time but I'm really enjoying it when I do play.  Ideal coffee break game, each run is nice and short.\n\nReplayability is similar to Spelunky: It's very challenging as you play through it, but I'm not sure how much I will feel like replaying it once I'm finally through.  Various things to unlock along the way though.  Playing with the different weapon types is a lot of fun, it feels more visceral than most roguelikes and that's very satisfying.\n\nThe music is addictive.  There's a mode that lets you play it with a dance pad, too, and I'm really looking forwards to that--will update this review when my new dance pads (with official Crypt of the NecroDancer art from precisiondancepads.com!) arrive in a month.","August 11, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game in my opinion is just amazing in every single way, the enemies, the equipment available, the gameplay, and on and on.

An extremely difficult permadeath game, Crypt Of The Necrodancer is one of the few difficult games I have that manages to be difficult, but not ragequit material. Every death feels fair- you died because you have something else to learn about that enemy, or you weren't prepared enough. It's rather frustrating for a little after you're thrown into a new zone to relearn different strategies for the new monsters, but the moment you manage to finally figure out what to do it's a wave of power unlike anything. And then you die to another monster and try again- but you don't care because now you're one step closer. The music is fantastic (though the shopkeeper's voice is slightly annoying) and moving to it becomes very simple because of how well written the music is. I haven't tried with custom music yet, but I'm looking forward to it and continuing to play the game.","January 4, 2015","true","107.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do 99% of my gaming on Linux and I really appreciate the Linux support.\n\nYou can play with keyboard or a controller, or real dance pads.  I've ordered a pair of dance pads to play it the hard way.  I might even get fit.  There's a two-player co-op option, so I can play with my wife or kids and use both the pads.  The game is challenging enough with plenty of variety to keep me playing while I lose some weight necrodancing like a fool!\n\nAlthough this is an early access game, it already has more options and features than most "full release" games:  training halls to practice battling different monsters and bosses (if you can pay the entry fee!), a huge variety of pickups and upgrades, hardcode mode, local co-op, daily challenge...  I don't recall another game with so many great options.  The procedural generation gives a great variety of levels, on a par with Spelunky.\n\nIn short, buy this game already!","August 10, 2014","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was very hesitant about the concept of a "rhythm roguelike" but the game completely managed to win me over. What this title may lack in complexity compared to a more "traditional" roguelike such as Nethack or ADOM, it more than makes up for with the fresh take on roguelike gameplay that it brings to the table by limiting each turn to the length of a quarter note in the accompanying music.\n\nI highly recommend a controller/gamepad for this game.

The game is not finished but it is still really good. If you like games where you kill monsters in classic pixel lands, then you should play this. Be wary of a steep learning curve though, it takes time to get used to moving to the rhythm and slaying beasts. While you can change the music on this game I have yet to do so. The music is good enough to listen to for hours on end. The music is made by Danny Baranowsky the creator of many amazing game sound tracks such as Super Meat Boy. There is also a hardcore mode where you get no upgrades and have to start from the ground up each death. You can also do this as a daily challenge to see how you stack up to other players traversing the same dungeon layout as you.","September 28, 2014","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As it's grown into its full release, Crypt has added multiple characters, an expansive monster bestiary, and not one, but two extra arrangements of the already-amazing soundtrack.\n\nThis game is a rhythm-based roguelike dungeon-crawling game, but rather than carefully planning each move, you're given a time limit of a single beat of music.  Everything moves one turn on each beat, whether or not you offer an input, which means that you're constantly faced with split-second decisions which will make or break your run through each zone.\n\nCrypt offers a wide variety of play styles.  Cadence, the first playable character, is a pretty standard roguelike experience.  You take on a dungeon, probably die, and return to the lobby for some purchasable persistent upgrades.  You return to the dungeon, and the cycle continues on.  Later, you'll unlock Bard, a character whose actions are not limited by the beat of the music, and enemies only move on player actions.  And for the perfectionist, Aria offers a frustrating challenge in which missing a single beat or taking any damage is instant death.\n\nThe soundtrack, which I mentioned earlier, is absolutely amazing.  Danny Baranowski (of Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac fame) takes center stage with the primary soundtrack.  Two other musicians -- A_Rival and FamilyJules7x -- also offer their talents to mix the game's music into heavy techno and metal arrangements, respectively.  Each of these remixed soundtracks is available to play in the game as well.  And, if you should ever get bored of that music, the game allows you to use your own music for any stage you please.\n\nI could go on for paragraphs about how great this game is, but suffice to say, it is absolutely worth experiencing for yourself.  It's well-made, it's challenging, and above all else it's just a really fun time.  Absolutely pick this game up if you have any interest in rhythm-based gameplay, roguelike dungeon-crawlers, or just generally challenging gameplay.","April 25, 2015","true","101.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every enemy has a pattern that can be learned and exploited. You almost always die in this game because you weren't good enough, not because the game cheated you.  Easily one of the best games I've played over the last year.

I was a bit suspicious about that, but now I really like it.\n\n\nGamePlay: You control a little man/woman, depending on who you play. The only keys you have to press are ↑ , ↓ , → , ←.\nSounds simple and not very exciting, but the most interesting part is, that you have to press them in the right rythm.^^\nListen to the music in the background may helps.\nThis is still not all. Every Enemy in the game also moves in this rythm and they have some patterns.\n(e.g Blue Slime: Moves one block up, skips a beat and then moves one block down.)\nThis is one of the simplest patterns. Others have patterns with no set directions and they'll try to get you.\nAdditional to that enemies may have some special attacks. (e. g Red Dragon: when you are in the same horizontal line the dragon will spit fire that deals damage to the entire horizontal line.)\nItems also exist which helps you to fight against enemies.\nNot to forget, other characters, other kinds of this gameplay. ;)\nSometimes it's very challanging, even with the "Bard", where you have no rythm and the enemies move after you. Simple amazing idea!\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nGraphics: This is the part where I want to remove a Point. It is a PixelGame (and I like it), but I think it could be better. So just\n★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\nStory: Ähh...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/247080/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","As an off-and-on fan of rogue-lite/like games, I am always torn determining the amount of skill and the amount of luck you will find in these games. Unseen probabilities within games are something I always am wary of complaining about when I could've had some really bad luck.\n\nHowever, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game where I blamed myself more so when I made errors than blame the odds against me. This is the first rogue-LIKE where I could tell I was improving myself, and it's the first one in the genre where the demands on the player's skill were mandatory.\n\nBecause with each failure through the familiarity of the controls and the coodrination of my fingers to the bass-line of the music I was reading the enemy telegraphed moves. Or adjusting myself to a new tempo-change. Or finding myself becoming at ease with the bizarre control-scheme. (Minus the DDR pad.)\n\nThe Rogue-Like With A Beat\nThe novelty of this game is that it takes the game of Rogue and gives it a beat. Literally.\n\nThe musical theme is not solely an aesthetic. The gameplay is interwoven into the music itself. From the way you move around/attack to the amount of time you have to explore the dungeons. Once the song ends, you are dropped to the next stage. (There are red-bars to show that the song is nearing its end.)\n\nEvery movement/action you make is managed by moving in-time of the music. You and every enemy move according to that rule, which gives the game a charming tactical feel while sometimes relying on you thinking on the fly. Enemies attack in a specific manner which usually results in them having an "off-beat" to strike them. If you simply attack head-on with no regard, you'll die a lot.\n\nIf that sounds too convulted about how the combat works, let me rephrase it like this: You are the metronome; the music is what you need to match (as the tempo can increase and decrease); and the enemies are the other instruments in play. The game plays more like reading a music sheet than another rogue-like game.\n\nThe controls are the first major obstacle to get over, which you can play this game legitimately with either a controller or keyboard (or a DDR pad, which has an easier difficulty just for itself). To get the best experience, I would suggest you map your directional keys separate from your combo keys. There are too many moments towards Zone 2 and onwards that rely on twichy relfexes in-time with the music to coordinate your fingers in combinations.\n\nThankfully, the game isn't too demanding on you maintaining a constant rhythm. If you're like me, I struggle to keep a rhythm going longer than a few seconds without going faster or slower than expected. The game is leniant on being perfect, but you cannot spam your movements. The game simply won't let you, and you won't be able to obtain the modifiers to your gold (and modified items) if you don't keep the beat.\n\nI was able to get past the first zone on my KB alone, but the second stage's music tripped me up when I had to make those split-second motions to drop a bomb or use an item. Switching out the combos to other keys fixed it for me, and I would strongly suggest that if you play the game with a controller you get the directional pad some love.\n\nPractice Makes Perfection\nMany rogue-lites rely too much on probabilites of which you can and cannot control (FTL). Others rely on attention to details of your item and the levels to spot those small benefits to get you to the end (Binding of Isaac). Crypt of the NecroDancer is a part of the trend where they provide permanent progression across chunks of the game.\n\n(There is a story mode for purists who want to play a more traditional rogue-like experience. However, I chose the permanent item/stat increases as I am not the best at these type of games.)\n\nThere are stat increases and new loot to give your next playthrough something to change it up as well as possibly improving your odds. None of which are mandatory--I wouldn't think of going without them--if you are good enough at the game to read your enemies' movements.\n\nOutside of the item/stat increases, you also have another means to improve your next game: Practice rooms.\n\nYou have a training room for enemies and minibosses that unlocks with a certain amount of kills for every enemy, a boss pratice room (unlocked via currency you accumulate in every run, diamonds), and a weapon-training selection screen to practice in either room. These rooms are unlocked by finding trapped tradders within Zone 1 and 2 and unlocking them with the Golden Master Key.\n\nHaving a story-mode option and a perma-progression system as choices is the best compromise as both the purists who prefer to learn the game on their own and everyone else has the means to finish the game. But it ain't so easy, nor free.\n\nThe bosses cost in-game currency to unlock. And you can't simply practice on all the enemies from the get-go--you have to kill each enemy type several times to unlock them. Simply, you can't cheat yourself out of a challenge without investing first.\n\n(And if you don't like some items, you can discard them for diamonds with the Janitor).\n\nIt Ain't No Stepmania\nPerhaps the game's own lacking feature is the infamous difficulty of its genre. The game doesn't feel that hard.\n\nMake no mistake; the game is difficult for all the right reasons, and you will die a lot. But there are plenty of items to circumnavigate the game's difficulty, and some enemies that make me wonder how fair the game truly is.\n\nFor example, blood items let you regain your health, slowly, with enough kills chained together. There are also magic spells that might stun enemies, blast horrizontally, or give you some buffs to become overpowered in some situations. I would chalk these up to limitations of making a novel game without all its polish.\n\nSome enemies also break the rules. There are some enemies that move in diagonal movements, which you are never allowed to do. The red-dragons also seem unfair without a "ranged" weapon (weapons that extend beyond one-tile, such as long-swords or broad-swords) to get around taking damage.\n\nZone 2 seems to have a sharp difficulty spike because you start off with nothing (even if you finish Zone 1). So expect that you may still have some bad runs when you begin new zones.\n\nThe only feature of this game I hadn't tried is adding your music into the game. This game's music was tailored for the game, and I am sure slow songs will break it while Megalovania will result in a very bad time.\n\nShake Your Groove Thang\nThis is one of few rogue-likes I'll always come back to because it's a fun experience. It's not a brutal old-schooling, nor is it coddling to the new players. The game's sense of challenge makes an otherwirse creative deviation into a worthwhile game of its own.\n\nAnd how can you not have fun dancing on a plastic pad like an idiot?\n\n(Kudos to the devs who put this through Early Access and finished the game. As well as for adding new content to the game itself with no DLCs. If they have another product through Early Access, be sure to give them a second glance.)","December 18, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's especially fun if keeping a beat is your forte, and if it's giving you treble don't fret about it, you'll get it. I am no lyre, this game is amazing!\n\nReal Review\nI have to say it now, this is my new favorite rougelike game. It is  amazing ! Once you start you are not going to want to put it down. The visuals are great and apealing to look at, and all the enemies dance! How awesome is that!? And the music- OOOOH THE MUSIC -it just works...so well. I actually started typing this review before, and when I typed, "And the soundtrac-" I immediately went and bought it without realizing it would erase what I had typed! It's that good. I completely recommend buying it. And then there's the shopkeeper. His voice is the most beautiful thing you can hear while fending off skeletons that have their hands in the air like they just don't care! One thing that is terrible great about it is that when you die, it's your fault. It's because you weren't paying close enough attention, or because you didn't react fast enough. There are some times when I die that I just have to take rest...sorry, and mourn my own stupidity. The game almost never cheats you. Unless there's a red dragon. I'm sorry, that's fate, it's going to kill you. There are some enemies that seem like they do, but maybe I just don't understand them. *cough* bats *cough*\n\n[EDIT] I do have a give a fair warning though, the difficulty spikes between levels 1 and 2, and I can't even imagine 3.\n\nAfter playing some more, I have a few things I would like to see improved:\n*I think the shield skeletons need an "arms up"-like frame in their animation, it can sometimes be unclear whether they will attack or not\n*The red dragon is way too hard. Maybe I just suck\n*The ability to go from Level 1 to level 2 and so on in one run, like in daily challenges. The later levels are just way too hard to start from scratch and hope you get lucky.\n**More permanent upgrades, the dungeon master is hardly used after the first hour\n**A option/item that makes the shopkeeper always singing (perhaps if it's an item, you can see him or the music notes all the time)\nSee, not even very many :)\n\nI haven't completed it, so maybe some things I just haven't found yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/247080/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","There have been many music-based games in recent years. I remember buying Audiosurf in 2008 and thought that it was so unique getting a game that plays on highway-like track according to the song you play. Many rhythm-based games have been distributed over the years and Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of them. This game is different because it looks like it is set in a randomly generated dungeon with a roguelike character strictly moving to the beat of the music.\n\nYou start the game as Cadence, a female character you control to collect gear, coins, and spells while a variety of monsters try to stop you. It has a very steep learning curve and it takes a while to get used to moving correctly to the beat despite the fact that the monsters have very predictable moves as they try to reach and attack you. If you move to the beat correctly, you will build up a coin multiplier while the maze turns into a disco like settings since it looks like a brightened dance floor. If you miss a beat, the coin multiplier will be lost and you will have to build it back up again. Each zone is divided into a few levels and the final level will be a boss level. Defeat the boss at the end of the zone and you will unlock a new character. There are many characters to unlock and each has such different moves that if feels like you have to unlearn the moves you used with the previous character. There is a character named Eli who can drop an infinite number of bombs and kick them to defeat nearby enemies. This means that you will have to get accustomed to the different attacks that Eli features that Cadence does not feature. Cadence moves to the beat and kills with conventional weapons like swords and whips. Another character, Bard, doesn’t have to move according to the beat whereas another character like Dove cannot kill enemies, but can exit the levels without facing mini-bosses.\n\nBesides the diverse characters in terms of number and abilities, the levels include a challenge in which you can rescue NPCs trapped in a cage that require exploration to find the proper key to liberate them. These NPCs will then become available in the lobby so that they can sell gear, spells, and other goodies that will be useful in each zone and its associated levels.\n\nThe number of diverse characters, the complexity of the movements can provide plenty of replay value. Also, you can play your own mp3s to see how challenging each level in a zone can be. When playing a song from the game’s soundtrack, it is funny to see the shopkeeper sing along to the music. The music that comes with the game is varied and entertaining. The game includes daily challenges and workshop mods to add up to infinite replay value.\n\nI think Crypt of the Necrodancer is a game that was well thought out by the developers, combining coolness, diversity, and difficulty. I think people can enjoy the challenges and the diversity of the characters and dungeons/mazes that this game offers. It is unique to combine the traditional roguelike characteristics of the game with rhythm. Just be prepared to put a lot of practice into the game that requires fast thinking since one mistake can easily force you to start over. Beating a level will always feel very rewarding due to the need for precise hand-eye coordination.\n\nMy Score: 8/10\n","July 4, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The music will enter your head and refuse to leave, but for once, that's a good thing.\nThe controls are extremely simple to learn, but deviously tricky to master. Even though it can get extremely hard, there's also easier modes and built-in systems for practicing against that enemy that you can't seem to get past, or even if you just wanna relax and explore a bit. To add on top of how beautiful the game is and entrancing the music can be, there is plenty of room for customization through the Workshop, or even just your own music! There is so much to say about this game, so many things to explore, and it's not even entirely done yet!

The level design is always different, and yet the levels overall are kept rather short and rather straightforward, which is a big plus for these kinds of games. The variety of items and unlockables to get help encourage you to continue playing over and over again. The music, no doubt the highlight of the game, the music is addicting, enjoyable and will get stuck in your head for hours.\n\nCritique: As it stands at the moment, the game is pretty solid, but there is always room for improvment.\n\n1. More variety in items - If there is one thing Binding of Isaac has shown, is that with a large variety of items that all work differently, it helps make every playthrough different, with different items everytime, so it'd be nice to have something new other then rings, boots and such.\n\n2. Floor gimmicks - It'd be interesting if on all floors of other then the boss floor, there was a chance of a gimmick happening that can change the whole experience, like being chased by an invincible enemy, having no map to use, line of sight restricted, or even having a larger level the normal.\n\n3. More traps - I think some more traps might be needed to spice up the gameplay, like spin tiles to mess up the controls, moving traps that follow a set path, and perhaps traps that trigger if you move into their line of sight.\n\nOverall: I feel overall this game is looking really good, and I know when it finally comes out, it'll be a big hit.\n\n8.5/10","October 13, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/recommended/247080/","Nitman99","Nitman99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/","2197 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI love games that make sense of old gaming tropes and conventions; in this case, how about the old idea that enemies in roguelikes only move when you do? The answer is, they're just moving to a beat, same as you!\n\nThis idea has serious gameplay implications as well. Roguelikes were always about positioning and strategy, but let you take as much time as you wanted in between turns. The rhythm nature of this game melds it into an action game with the best of tile turn-based. Fighting enemies is an absolute joy: every time you walk into a room you have to think fast, what enemy do I prioritize and how do I position myself to attack them while keeping myself out of harm from other enemies.\n\nThere are a few mechanics that really help facilitate this; for one, the control scheme is exclusively arrow keys or WASD, which means that attacking is done by pressing in the direction of an enemy, overriding a movement in that direction. This can play to your advantage or disadvantage depending on your weapon and circumstance, which just increases the layers of things to think about. It also means you can play the game on a dance pad if you want to, with no compromises. The one downside is that using subitems like consumables and spells is done by pressing combinations of those direction keys, which doesn't really feel great and you'll often forget which thing is bound to which button combo. It can screw you up in a frantic moment.\n\nThe other element really strengthens the rhythm game connection: a multiplier. If you can keep landing enemy kills without straying off beat, you'll earn a coin multiplier, which is cool because coins serves as both currency and as points or high score. What makes it interesting is you lose the multiplier for using a wait command essentially, which means you have to constantly keep moving. This not only changes the tone of the game, but it makes approaching enemies interesting too, as you'll have to find another way to stay in the same spot without losing the multiplier.\n\nThen you have different items and weapon types, and what's great is that even though the very basic "attack up" weapons will change how you fight enemies, there are a lot of different types that change properties and completely change how you approach combat.\n\nAnother big mechanic is that each floor is timed, and you'll be sent to the next when time runs out. This is probably an improvement over other roguelikes that give you as much time as you want; at the same time, it along with the multiplier makes the game feel really frantic. While it's a cool feeling you don't really have the chance to learn what an enemy's all about in the middle of a run, you'll have to utilize the in-game beastmaster mode to learn enemy strategies. Same goes with items, you won't have a lot of time to experiment like in something like Binding of Isaac, which makes learning new items with no descriptions even more difficult than in that game. At the same time, it's better than just giving it away with a description.\n\nI guess the other big thing is that because you can't move freely, because you are forced to move at the pace the game dictates, the game doesn't give you the same sense of control as something like Binding of Isaac, at least not initially. Initially you'll be a little frustrated that you can't move at your own pace in the lobby, and even when you're having an OP run you're still at the whim of the game's pacing. This feeling diminishes over time; eventually as you master each of the beats you'll get that control you were looking for, it just takes awhile.\n\nThe game has a really smart progression system early on; basically it splits each of the zones of a full length run into its own adventure, and gives you incentives to play and learn them with the diamond system which gives you permanent upgrades to your character, or new secrets in the runs. It's a really good way to learn the game but the meat and potatoes is still hardcore mode, which takes away all of those permanent upgrades and plays like a true roguelike. My problem right now is that after beating hardcore mode and unlocking the other characters there's very little incentive to continue; the new characters represent a significant jump in difficulty, and while I could dive back into each individual zone with the characters to train there's no in-game unlockables or achievements to be earned right now. I feel kind of done with it until Zone 4 rolls out.\n\nIt's also not as replayable as something like Binding of Isaac, most of the nuances in the gameplay have to do with combat. There's not as much detail optimization as BoI, aside from a few things like how to find hidden passages without a torch and what to do with excess bombs.\n\nThe game is ridiculously fully featured for an early access game by the way, with multiple characters, dance pad mode, daily challenge, seeded runs, custom music, and even a co-op mode which is a ton of fun.\n\nOh and the soundtrack is what I play videogames for, I <3 Danny B.\n\ntl;dr Combat nuances and music make this game well worth buying in its current state, only problems I have with it right now are lack of progression after unlocking all the characters, less replayability than other roguelikes, and the difficulty with learning new things and feeling in control early on.","August 27, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In order to succeed you must move and attack to the beat of the song assigned for the floor. This is both simple and wickedly difficult to keep up, but the better you manage the more gold coins you earn due to a multiplier effect.\n\nStats in most roguelikes depend heavily on luck in finding items or leveling up, but in CotND you can definitely succeed with just the basic starter gear. The reason why is because the game doesn't rely on huge health pools and in fact most monsters can be killed in a single hit and the only monster you MUST kill is the boss on the final floor. Playing conservatively is a very viable tactic because there are many ways to advance to the next floor and there is no leveling up that requires killing monsters.\n\nEach dungeon, at least for the moment, is three dane-a-thons of fun and a final boss. So game sessions are short and failure does not leave that typical bitter taste.\n\nThere's a light quirky sense of humor, especially when the shopkeeper starts belting out tunes with the music. Colors are bright and all the monsters get a little dance-y jig which makes things pretty playful. If you're doing well you also get magical disco lighting all over the dungeon, huzzah!\n\nThis is the Roguelike for people who like music and a shorter, more meaningful play session. The game itself isn't super long, but the random elements and multiple character types will keep you as busy as you would like.\n\nFinal Score: A-","August 31, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The variety of items and unlockables to get help encourage you to continue playing over and over again. The music, no doubt the highlight of the game, the music is addicting, enjoyable and will get stuck in your head for hours.\n\nCritique: As it stands at the moment, the game is pretty solid, but there is always room for improvment.\n\n1. More variety in items - If there is one thing Binding of Isaac has shown, is that with a large variety of items that all work differently, it helps make every playthrough different, with different items everytime, so it'd be nice to have something new other then rings, boots and such.\n\n2. Floor gimmicks - It'd be interesting if on all floors of other then the boss floor, there was a chance of a gimmick happening that can change the whole experience, like being chased by an invincible enemy, having no map to use, line of sight restricted, or even having a larger level the normal.\n\n3. More traps - I think some more traps might be needed to spice up the gameplay, like spin tiles to mess up the controls, moving traps that follow a set path, and perhaps traps that trigger if you move into their line of sight.\n\nOverall: I feel overall this game is looking really good, and I know when it finally comes out, it'll be a big hit.\n\n8.5/10","October 13, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The last time I got lost in a roguelike was when Rogue Legacy was released, but Crypt of the NecroDancer is just so much better than The Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain and Rogue Legacy combined. Having nearly no playtime on NecroDancer just has two reasons: First, 30 free days in a MMORPG just make the MMORPG a priority and secondly I just bought it. ^-^\n\nWhile I still struggle to get past Zone 2 with a keyboard, I honestly think its actually worth trying to play the game with a dance pad.

That darn Necromancer has your heart and is forcing you to move to the beat. Of course, you can skip the beat, but we really suggest you don't. Every enemy has its pattern, every item has its individual use and every run is sure to be completely different and enjoyable.\n\nDevs are very active and frequently adding new things, you can put your own custom music in and it's fairly good at recognising the beat (I highly recommend Hotline Miami's soundtrack). Several characters to pick from, a few more when you beat the 'hardcore' mode (a straight run through all the levels, a feat I've yet to accomplish at time of writing). Every death will have been avoidable and will leave you asking yourself why you did that, rather than blaming the game or enemies.\n\nA very satisfying game to play, could not recommend it any more strongly.","December 18, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This a truly unique game, and although the mash-up between genres (roguelike and rhythm game) may seem strange at first glance, it works brilliantly here.  Danny Baranowsky killed it with his score - I find myself humming the songs in my head when I'm at work.  Gradually learning the different strategies for dealing with the various enemy types is extremely rewarding, as you'll eventually work your way up from dying every time you run into your first miniboss to being able to complete runs in 'hardcore' mode, where the real fun is.  Add in daily challenge runs, multiple unlockable characters that dramatically change elements of the gameplay, and more content to come, and you'll be getting way more than your money's worth.\n\nEasily the best game I've picked up in a long time.

I loved DDR and I love roguelikes, but to mix the two?  What fresh madness was this?  THIS WAS THE EPIC MUSIC MADNESS OF THE DEEP!  The music is energetic and fun, the game is easy to learn and the tutorial is short (seriously, VERY short, but all you need to know).\n\nThe game is most certainly a roguelike, no saves, randomized layouts and drops.  But that's just the beginning.  Your ability to sync your movements to the beat isn't just a gimmick.  This mechanic rewards you with things like coin bonuses for the long combos you can create as you dance through the levels.  It requires you to plan while you move, if you stop, you miss a beat and you lose your combo.\n\nThe game is simple and addicting.  You never feel too bad about dying because you use the rewards you gained from the previous play to help you on your next, simply perpetuating your endless jimmy through the dark tunnels as you slay monsters with  your dance moves and your beat only legend can recount.\n\nA bit pricey at $15.  I bought it on sale and it was well worth the money.  If you love roguelikes and love awesome soundtracks, it could very well be worth the money.  If you're on the fence, wait for a sale and jump on the deal like Jon Travolta on a disco beat.","November 9, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of the titles that wears that hat like a ♥♥♥♥in' champ.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is a rythm game. No wait; it's a roguelike. No wait; it's both. It's a procedurally-generated labyrinth in which your actions come in pace with the music. It's an absolutely superlative example of the best Early Access has to offer; oodles of content that's already more than playable, and promising to only get better as time goes on.\n\nYou play as Cadence, a novice gravedigger (I think; it's not really important) who makes one shovel cut in the wrong place too many. Now your still-beating heart has been stolen. Turns out this isn't as fatal as you'd expect, and it even means you can't die permanently, but it HAS made you a Slave to the Rythm(TM). Can you make it through the NecroDancer's lair in order to kill him and reclaim your heart? Or will you be a slave to the rythm for all eternity?\n\nEverything in the NecroDancer's crypts moves and acts to the beat of the music. You can use your own MP3s for this, but the included soundtrack from Danny Baranowsky is so awesome you won't need to. Mastering the beat of the music is the key to victory in this game.\n\nRemember when I said Crypt rocks the "easy to learn, hard to master" hat like a boss? This is why. Moving with the beat is one of those things which is very easy to wrap your head around, but mastering the beat is a whole other story. It's a simple concept executed flawlessly, made all the more satisfying by the fact that it makes you angry in the exact right way - with yourself. Harm comes because YOU screwed up. Failure becomes because YOU screwed up. At no point does the game throw anything at you that you can't deal with - or at least, can't learn to deal with it. We can all name dozens of games that are plain broken, where often failure comes because either the game did a whoopsie in its pants or because the random number generator decided it hates your face. Crypt doesn't do that. There's only one thing Crypt will get you angry with; yourself. And that makes it so very compelling. When you fail, you want to do better. You want to get back in there and get further - to wipe away the shame of your earlier failure. Before you know it, you're hooked.\n\nSpeaking of which... I need to find a new vein so I can get another hit of this delicious juju.","August 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What to say. This game is 100% fantastic. A great challenge while also being incredibly fun. Moving on the beat and hitting monsters along with the flow of the music is an incredibly satisfying feeling, especially on enemies like dragons, following the pattern of hit-move-hit-move until they're dead. Every enemy design is great in its own way, as well as every character sprite. Cadence's animations are flat-out adorable.\nThe music, integral as it is to the gameplay, is incredible, and easy to listen to over and over again. Which is kind of common, in a game as difficult as NecroDancer. My only problem with the game is very, VERY minor. It's about the beat bars at the bottom of the screen, near the image of the beating heart. They kept throwing me off the beat ever so slightly. Thankfully, the devs put in the ability to turn off the beat bars. Thank you.\n\nVerdict: 10/10","August 20, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hit the keys to the beat, stretching the limits of my rythmless suburbanite white guy imagination to picture myself laying out a boogie-woogie beatdown in the only way I know how (the sprinkler, the electric slide, the macarena).\n\nWhen I fumble the beat (losing my gold bonus AND my flashing checker dance floor effect) or die to what I'm pretty sure was a zombie elvis, I frown just as hard as I was smiling moments before. But no! It's not over yet Zombie Elvis. This is a rogue-like, baby, so I know I'll be seeing your randomly generated gyrations again real soon. Assuming I dont die to a golem that likes to shimmy and shake it first.\n\nI am bad at this game, but I love it, and the music is phenomenal and fun, and the ability to customize the music makes it even better. Next time I throwdown with dancing fantasy creatues I'm gonna queue up that "These Boots were made for walkin'" song so they know I mean business,\n\nReally, at this point, this game could only dissapoint me if the final form of the last boss isn't Patrick Swayze's ghost. First we'd dance fight a la Dirty Dancing, for my life itself, but If I win it suddenly turns into a romance scene and he and Cadence have to ahhh, glaze some pots together in the lewdest possible way.\n\nBUY THIS GAME.\nThe music alone is worth the buy, and hey cool it comes with a game too!","February 3, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","1","1","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/247080/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","Crypt of the Necrodancer is about delving into a dungeon, but you're doing so in synch with the current's level music : every action you take must be on the beat, any missed beat is slightly penalized, and enemies also move on the beat.\n\nYet, to call Crypt of the Necrodancer "dungeon delving with music" would be to sell it short. A far better description would be "tactical turn-based game, except the turns happen on the beat". Crypt of the Necrodancer has you dancing around monsters in order to kill everything while taking as little damage as possible. You know all the monsters' patterns, there is no luck involved, it's just a matter of perfecting your counter patterns. Even the music aspect has been toned down a bit to ensure you focus more on the tactical aspect: the game doesn't require pinpoint accuracy to hit the beat, there is a fair beat of leaway, contrary to games that are purely about hitting beats (such as Dance Dance Revolution, Osu, etc...).\n\nThe best example of how the game isn't just a "game with a music gimmick" is the "Bard" character. Once you've played a bit, you will unlock new characters, which are new modes of play. And Bard's mode is actually being able to play without having to worry about the beat: whenever you take an action, the ennemies do too, which mean you can play as fast or as slow as you want. And yet, despite not being time-pressured, it's still a fair and interesting challenge to play and finish a Bard's playthrough.\n\nThe game is hard, but is also very fair. As I said, everything is known, and the game lobby offers several ways to train yourself and gather informations on enemies in a stressless manner. So after that, once you think you've learned everything you needed, you can delve into the musical dungeon, and then all hell break loose. You know skeletons raise theirs arms before moving, and yet, in the stress of having to move constantly, you keep moving towards skeletons with raised arms, and then getting damaged. It's going to take a lot of practice to become good and finish the game.\n\nBut well, practicing is so much fun in this game. The graphics are great, with cute zombies dancing around, skeletons swaying their hips while moving towards you, etc. All the characters have very nicely done animations and attention to details. It also has good replayability, thanks to the randomly generated dungeons and items. Each weapon has its own strenghs and weaknesses and really change how you're going to approach each ennemy. And finally the last, but greatest element...the music.\n\nThe OST for this game has been done by none other than Danny Baranowsky, one of the most famous guy in the small world of indie video game music. If you've played Super Meat Boy, Desktop Dungeons, Canabalt, or the Binding of Isaac, you already know how awesome his music is. If you don't i highly recommend checking its music on Bandcamp. I actually bought Crypt of the Necrodancer's OST months before actually buying the game. Each track is a marvel, each world has its own music soundscape, and there is a lot of music-related surprise to find while playing the game.\n\nTLDR : This game is awesome, if you like hard tactical games, buy it, and also buy the soundtrack on Bandcamp :)","December 5, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Grid-based roguelikes have been done before.  The real seller of Crypt, however, is the impact of the game being set to music and moving rhythmically.\n\nUnlike a lot of similar games, Crypt forces you to learn and memorize patterns and react fast and skillfully, instead of spending forever mulling through cluttered inventories for the exact item to get you out of your situation.  It's about speed, snap decisions, and learning, and above all is completely fair - everything in the game could be handled flawlessly with just your starting equipment.\n\nThere's a lot of other aspects that are strengths to it.  Mechanically, the game reaches an incredible level of play diversity, not just from the vastly different playable characters.  It also comes from the fact the massive pool of items are rarely just a straight upgrade over one another, and instead have different strengths, weaknesses, and benefits.  Presentation wise the game's super slick, charmingly animated, and the music is bloody amazing too.\n\nDo the thing.  Get the game.

It also happens to be the first early access that I have absolutely loved from the beginning and it's probably one of the only early access games that I purchased that actually came out as a complete game.\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer immediately caught my eye because of its unique gameplay (or was it just an impulse buy because of the pun?). It's essentially a Rythm Roguelike game. It has most of the elements of a Rogue-like, except you have to stay on beat!\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing (and now offered in 3 different variations!) and the game is deceivingly difficult. It's very easy to pick up, very hard to master and highly addictive.\n\nEven having played through the first 3 zones countless time while I waited for the fourth one to come out, then all four a bunch of times when it did, I still enjoy playing this game from time to time (I have played a lot more than Steam indicates.)\n\nI often despise randomly generated levels but in this game it works very well and follow a set of logical rules. Each level will always be similar while always offering something new. There are tons of different items that will help you on your runs and different characters that provide different challenges when you get bored of Cadence, the main character.\n\nA very charming and challenging game with a lot of replayability, fully worth the 16.99$.","February 21","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is incredibly catchy, the bosses and characters are charming, the design is delightfully elegant, and the different playstyles made available always keep things fresh. And there's still more characters, zones, and content to come!\n\nI've yet to try out the importing of custom music, nor have I used the custom level editor to its fullest potential.

THIS GAME IS SO GOD DAMN GOOD!!!\nBut now for a real review of the game on something that really stood out to me while playing, and that was the difficulty of it. On of the most popular games I could compare the diffiulty to is Dark Souls  (trust me its nothing close to as frustrating). You see one of the things I loved about the difficult in Dark Souls is that it wasnt you aimlessly attacking and just beating the game, you had to be constatly thinking and reacting to everything you and your oppenent were doing. In CotND you need to know the enemies pattern, the rythem of the current song, and your postioning relative to the enemies arround you. If you mess up on a single one of these while in battle you will most likely not come out of a battle healthy. The difficulty is based only upon how much you have planned ahead for the situation. However, you will most liely need to give every level a fair amount of tries to get the patterns of all the enemies down. There is never a moment when I would think "oh that's stupid of the game" it was always "oh I was stupid it do that." You will need to learn and them plan you attack to all of the enemies in each stages. Heck and just like Dark Souls this even applies to after you have gotten far past the first level. For example, I went back to level 1 just for the heck of it one time and thought it would be a breeze, but of course I got cocky and died very quickly because I was not thinking of every movement of the enemies.\nAnd hey, if all of this sounds good, remeber there is also a freakin' amazing soundtrack to go along with it. Seriously, it probably has to be my favorite game soundtrack ever!

The game suffers from the same problems that most indie rogue-lites do and that is that it becomes fairly repetitive after a few hours of play due to a general lack of enemy variety. Still, the game does have 10 playable characters, each with their own gimmick to help diversify time spent playing the game. The game also comes with 3 soundtracks as well as the ability to use your own mp3s so that you don't have to listen to the same soundtrack over and over if you are having trouble getting past a particular zone.

Every rhythm game needs a decent soundtrack to succeed. Not only did Danny B. (Also known for his music in BoI and Super Meat Boy) fill this quota but Rival (known for his Electro Dubstep type music) and FamilyJules (Creator of several Metal Covers on OSTs.) made this game's soundtrack amazing. Not only that, but the characters are rememberable and make you actually feel for them, giving you different gameplay for each character, which is where Crypt of the Necrodancer gets it's replayability. These are the reasons why I still come back every day to this game. The art looks fresh and actually makes you wanna stop and see how your character moves to the beat of the music. This game also supports Steam Workshop, giving you the ability to play as a jiggling piece of bread if you wanted to. All of this for the decent price of $14.99 makes me believe that ANYONE, whether you enjoy Roguelike Dungeon Crawlers or the Music Lover that listens to game soundtracks in their daily lives can enjoy Crypt of the Necrodancer.","August 17, 2015","true","228.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You think of this as impossible as Zone 3 is one giant zerg rush of skeleton horses and elemental enemies. Nonetheless you try it anyway and manage to get some decent gear. Then a red dragon comes along and says "♥♥♥♥ you!" and you get one shot by a fireball because you can't do the sacred red dragon dance at that moment. (That's my life, i cri evertim ;;)\n\nBut seriously, this game is amazing in many aspects. It's hard to find a game where a particular character dies from picking up GOLD, of all things! Since the levels are randomly generated there is no true pattern to the game and permanent death is indeed a thing. So that guy that dies from picking up gold? He's no exception, better watch your step! Oh yeah, and the only way you can move/attack/dig/open chests is by hitting the arrow key in the direction that you want to go on the beat of the song that's playing. There's a nice little tutorial in-game for that, though.\n\nHowever, there is one thing that bugs me about Crypt of the Necrodancer. That is, the diamonds that are used to purchase items to be put into the item pool for non-hardcore runs. It would make more sense to have everything unlocked already, like hardcore does, but you are forced to buy it using diamonds you find during non-hardcore runs. It's a bit more harmful than helpful and everything should just be unlocked for you to use when it's found.\n\nDespite that, this game is well worth your time. I've got 60+ hours and counting clocked into Crypt of the Necrodancer and it's not like I'll be stopping anytime soon. If you like challenging games, get this game. If you like rogue-likes, get this game. If you like rhythm based games, get this game. The point is, just buy the freaking game! What're you waiting for?

CoTND is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler with the difficulty and addictiveness of Binding of Isaac, with, imo, a killer soundtrack. This is probably because the music was made by the same guy but, I digress.\n\nAnd if for some reason you hate the music (or you get sick of dying and hearing the same bloody song from level 1 over and over again like I do (inb4 'git good')) you can substitute the level songs with your own music.\n\nYou play at Cadence, one of several musically-named individuals who must make their way through the titular Crypt for their each individual reasons, which is fun but the true awesomeness lies in the music-related combat and sweet pixel art visuals. That being said the game is hard. It's really hard. The good news is with a few proper upgrades you can become veritably unstoppable in any of the worlds. The learning curve drops into a cliff about the time you meet the Red Dragon, who can take you out with a single well-timed fire breath from across the map, and he'll show up every now and again in Zone 1.\n\nEasy to learn and hard to master are how I would describe this game, and would definitely recommend it unless you're known to break things if you get easily frustrated.

It's essentially a Rythm Roguelike game. It has most of the elements of a Rogue-like, except you have to stay on beat!\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing (and now offered in 3 different variations!) and the game is deceivingly difficult. It's very easy to pick up, very hard to master and highly addictive.\n\nEven having played through the first 3 zones countless time while I waited for the fourth one to come out, then all four a bunch of times when it did, I still enjoy playing this game from time to time (I have played a lot more than Steam indicates.)\n\nI often despise randomly generated levels but in this game it works very well and follow a set of logical rules. Each level will always be similar while always offering something new. There are tons of different items that will help you on your runs and different characters that provide different challenges when you get bored of Cadence, the main character.\n\nA very charming and challenging game with a lot of replayability, fully worth the 16.99$.","February 21","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is incredibly catchy, the bosses and characters are charming, the design is delightfully elegant, and the different playstyles made available always keep things fresh. And there's still more characters, zones, and content to come!\n\nI've yet to try out the importing of custom music, nor have I used the custom level editor to its fullest potential.

Still, the game does have 10 playable characters, each with their own gimmick to help diversify time spent playing the game.

I hit the keys to the beat, stretching the limits of my rythmless suburbanite white guy imagination to picture myself laying out a boogie-woogie beatdown in the only way I know how (the sprinkler, the electric slide, the macarena).\n\nWhen I fumble the beat (losing my gold bonus AND my flashing checker dance floor effect) or die to what I'm pretty sure was a zombie elvis, I frown just as hard as I was smiling moments before. But no! It's not over yet Zombie Elvis. This is a rogue-like, baby, so I know I'll be seeing your randomly generated gyrations again real soon. Assuming I dont die to a golem that likes to shimmy and shake it first.\n\nI am bad at this game, but I love it, and the music is phenomenal and fun, and the ability to customize the music makes it even better. Next time I throwdown with dancing fantasy creatues I'm gonna queue up that "These Boots were made for walkin'" song so they know I mean business,\n\nReally, at this point, this game could only dissapoint me if the final form of the last boss isn't Patrick Swayze's ghost. First we'd dance fight a la Dirty Dancing, for my life itself, but If I win it suddenly turns into a romance scene and he and Cadence have to ahhh, glaze some pots together in the lewdest possible way.\n\nBUY THIS GAME.\nThe music alone is worth the buy, and hey cool it comes with a game too!","February 3, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","1","1","3","0"

(And as a notorious cheapskate, that's not something I say lightly.) Don't be discouraged by the early access tag; this game is very well polished already, and recieves regular updates. Even if they never updated it again, it would still be worth buying. You will have a blast playing this single player, and if you have someone to play with the local co-op is great as well.\n\nPros:\nRefreshing concept, executed wonderfully\nNice tight gameplay\nGREAT soundtrack\nLovely pixel graphics and animations\nGood amount of content/replayability\nSteam workshop\n\nCons:\nCustom song importing doesn't work as well as you'd hope (beats are off/weird sometimes, but maybe I'm picking the wrong kind of songs)\nVery unforgiving of mistakes (but it's a roguelike so that's to be expected)\nYou have to be good at memorization (Hey, it's a con for some people)\n\nI'm sure there were other things I wanted to mention so I'll probably edit this review at some point. But all-in-all very nice game, quickly becoming one of my favorites. Definitely recommend.","January 8, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

THIS GAME IS SO GOD DAMN GOOD!!!\nBut now for a real review of the game on something that really stood out to me while playing, and that was the difficulty of it. On of the most popular games I could compare the diffiulty to is Dark Souls  (trust me its nothing close to as frustrating). You see one of the things I loved about the difficult in Dark Souls is that it wasnt you aimlessly attacking and just beating the game, you had to be constatly thinking and reacting to everything you and your oppenent were doing. In CotND you need to know the enemies pattern, the rythem of the current song, and your postioning relative to the enemies arround you. If you mess up on a single one of these while in battle you will most likely not come out of a battle healthy. The difficulty is based only upon how much you have planned ahead for the situation. However, you will most liely need to give every level a fair amount of tries to get the patterns of all the enemies down. There is never a moment when I would think "oh that's stupid of the game" it was always "oh I was stupid it do that." You will need to learn and them plan you attack to all of the enemies in each stages. Heck and just like Dark Souls this even applies to after you have gotten far past the first level. For example, I went back to level 1 just for the heck of it one time and thought it would be a breeze, but of course I got cocky and died very quickly because I was not thinking of every movement of the enemies.\nAnd hey, if all of this sounds good, remeber there is also a freakin' amazing soundtrack to go along with it. Seriously, it probably has to be my favorite game soundtrack ever! Well, thanks for reading and if you choose to buy it I hope you enjoy it as much as I am!","October 27, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You think of this as impossible as Zone 3 is one giant zerg rush of skeleton horses and elemental enemies. Nonetheless you try it anyway and manage to get some decent gear. Then a red dragon comes along and says "♥♥♥♥ you!" and you get one shot by a fireball because you can't do the sacred red dragon dance at that moment. (That's my life, i cri evertim ;;)\n\nBut seriously, this game is amazing in many aspects. It's hard to find a game where a particular character dies from picking up GOLD, of all things! Since the levels are randomly generated there is no true pattern to the game and permanent death is indeed a thing. So that guy that dies from picking up gold? He's no exception, better watch your step! Oh yeah, and the only way you can move/attack/dig/open chests is by hitting the arrow key in the direction that you want to go on the beat of the song that's playing. There's a nice little tutorial in-game for that, though.\n\nHowever, there is one thing that bugs me about Crypt of the Necrodancer. That is, the diamonds that are used to purchase items to be put into the item pool for non-hardcore runs. It would make more sense to have everything unlocked already, like hardcore does, but you are forced to buy it using diamonds you find during non-hardcore runs. It's a bit more harmful than helpful and everything should just be unlocked for you to use when it's found.\n\nDespite that, this game is well worth your time. I've got 60+ hours and counting clocked into Crypt of the Necrodancer and it's not like I'll be stopping anytime soon. If you like challenging games, get this game. If you like rogue-likes, get this game. If you like rhythm based games, get this game. The point is, just buy the freaking game! What're you waiting for?

Every rhythm game needs a decent soundtrack to succeed. Not only did Danny B. (Also known for his music in BoI and Super Meat Boy) fill this quota but Rival (known for his Electro Dubstep type music) and FamilyJules (Creator of several Metal Covers on OSTs.) made this game's soundtrack amazing. Not only that, but the characters are rememberable and make you actually feel for them, giving you different gameplay for each character, which is where Crypt of the Necrodancer gets it's replayability. These are the reasons why I still come back every day to this game. The art looks fresh and actually makes you wanna stop and see how your character moves to the beat of the music. This game also supports Steam Workshop, giving you the ability to play as a jiggling piece of bread if you wanted to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/247080/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Crypt of the Necrodancer is definitely one of the most unique roguelike games I’ve ever played, with the added bonus of actually resembling rogue instead of using roguelike as another term for “permadeath without saves”.  You play a family of musicians (or a motley crew of side-characters) determined to unlock the mystery of the magical lute and defeat the Necrodancer, a cursed necromantic bard.\n\nTrue to its name, you “dance” around each level by moving in tune to the rhythm meter at the bottom of the screen. Each level has its own tune and rhythm and the game steadily increases the pace as you progress. Keeping in tune with the music while vanquishing enemies will net you a higher multiplier which increases the amount of gold you find, in addition to enhancing certain special items found throughout the crypt. Failing to keep to the beat will cause your multiplier to go down and may also prevent you from moving. Since the monsters in the game also move to the beat, they will eventually close in on you to attack and you cannot stand still to “pause” the action (unless you’re playing the bard character).\n\nI found the soundtrack for CotN to be excellent and very diverse. Each level’s song fits its theme pretty well and there are a few tracks that are instantly catchy. The shopkeeper in each level will also sing along with the music, giving a clue to his location, and all of the monsters are either music-themed or have a name alluding to some musical term or instrument, adding an extra layer of detail to this thoroughly polished game.\n\nThere really aren’t any faults with this game that would prevent any fan of rogues from picking it up (playing as Aria is extremely hard though) and, even if you’re not normally into games in this genre, the learning curve is very fair. This game is worth picking up even at its original cost, though if you can catch it at the average sale price of $5 it’s quite a steal!","March 21","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seriously, you need to be able to hold a beat to even consider playing this game in full. And yes, this is an important distinction - I've seen several attempted runs from someone who didn't, they were very short lived. Another warning - If you have any music preferences, they're about to be formatted.\n\nAnyways, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike rhythm game. The roguelike takes precedence for the most part, but it's good to keep a rhythm-game mentality. The gameplay can be a bit tricky at first, but superb once you get the hang of it. The actual progression is a bit basic (not uncommon for roguelikes), but that's not too major a problem. The biggest issue most people have with the game is that the rhythm-based controls are a bit gimmicky or unwieldy, but I had very little problems with them and they didn't get in my way too much.\n\nBut enough about the gameplay. I'm writing this review to commend the SOUNDTRACK. This game's BGM alone is worth the $15 admission fee, and that's a bargain. I've been known to listen to the soundtrack on repeat for hours on end, and am working on burning the soundtrack onto a CD as I type this. And if the planets align and someone is born who doesn't like the music - you can set your own too.\n\nSo in summary: If you think you can manage the gameplay, get the full game. If you don't think you can manage it, already have the game, or need a new soundtrack to listen to in your spare time, buy the soundtrack. And if by some strange coincidence you neither want this game's gameplay nor it's soundtrack, then and ONLY then will I permit you to not touch this game.\n\nWhat are you waiting for... pick up the beat!","October 6, 2015","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanic of moving to the beat is an interesting gimmick, although I can't seem to get the hang of it. Keep missing some beats (because the soundtrack is incredibly excellent? Heh... not really. Just great, but not superb kinda thing). The soundtrack changes every level you go on, meaning that the beats change pace level to level. This also provides a nice variety while playing - you move at a different beat every level, and combined with the randomly generated levels (can't memorise paths - they always change) provides enough entertainment for a few hours.\n\nYou can also change music tracks if you want, which I'll be doing soon. So if you for some reason get disappointed in the music, swap to your own. The provided soundtracks are nice, but sometimes the fast(ish) beats combined with the dungeon monster aspects results in missed beats and dead characters.\n\nI do not have any significant flaws with this game - it provides what it says it will - a different approach to rogue-like dungeon exploring that is enjoyable and not buggy at all (I didn't encounter any bugs while playing). Got it on sale at 50% price or something, but even at full price it would be worth grabbing to play.\n\nPrice - fine\n\nGameplay - fun\n\nBugs - None found while playing\n\nSoundtrack - Sometimes not to my taste, but irrelevant when you're trying your best to survive in a dungeon. All tracks are enjoyable for playing.\n\n+1\n\n\n\n\n","March 15","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music in this game is fantastic. So much so that I bought the game for PS4 as well. But the gameplay is extremely difficult. It's randomly generated, but extremely based on enemy patterns. There's very little room for error, and each run can end in the blink of an eye. It's a game I really want to get better at, if only because it's so unique. If you put a bit of practice into learning each of the enemy's patterns, it is incredibly rewarding to beat each floor, especially for the first time. It's certainly not a game for everyone, but it's a game that you will enjoy if you spend a bit of time learning how to play it.

Crypt of the Necrodancer combines the roguelike/rhythm genres to produce a dungeon crawler that summons memories of Michael Jackson's Thriller. The skeletons dance, the zombies hop, and the shopkeepers sing as you navigate through the floors of the crypt\n\nIt plays similarly to classic turn based style roguelikes, except that the turns happen on the beat of the music.  You will find yourself hopping back and forth to the beat, dodging enemy attacks, and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  The soundtrack is great, but you can play using your own music instead if you wish.  There is also an easier difficulty setting specifically for playing the game on a dance pad.  It makes me wish I still had a DDR pad lying around, I'd love to give it a try.\n\nThe parallels with classic roguelikes do not end with the turn based combat/movement system.  The floors, the contents of treasure chests, shop items, and even boss order are all randomly generated.  The game is also very challenging, quite possibly challenging enough that some players won't enjoy it if they don't like difficult games.  There are several features available to the player to mitigate the challenge.  As you play you will unlock the ability to start at each zone, buy items before entering a zone, and practice against enemies in a risk free environment.\n\nThe only criticism that comes to mind about the game is the small number of zones.  There are four zones, and each zone has three stages.  The amount of content reminds me of some NES games.  Many old NES titles could be completed in less than an hour, but took much longer due to the learning required to play successfully.  While I don't feel like there are as many zones as there could have been, they did include ten playable characters.  The characters all have very different styles of play and allow for a solid level of replay value.\n\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is a lot of fun, but I think many players should be wary.  Prospective buyers may be lured in by the cute visuals and awesome soundtrack but miss an important fact about the game.  Necrodancer, at its heart, is a challenging turn based roguelike.  I've played through and finished quite a few games that most would consider to be hard.  This one is tough.  According to  Steam's global gameplay stats, 7.2% of players manage to finish the fourth zone as the main character.  If you're down for a challenge though, you'll have a great time.  I've certainly had a lot of fun with it.","April 1","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please also note that you will die a few times on your first try but thats ok, when you die you have a chance to spend any gathered diamonds on upgrades or extra items found in chests and then try again. The Crypts/zones are always randomised meaning not every run will be the same, some will be easy as in the exit is right in front of you, other times you would need to fight through a mini-army to exit the place and will bring many challenges for you to face. At the end of each Crypt/zone, ussually on the forth floor, you will face one of three bosses, all of which brings an interesting take to battle.\n\nAnd if you get board with the in-game soundtrack (no idea why since the merchants singing is quite fun) you can always add your own music and try get through with your own beats.\n\nSo far the alpha has three Crypts/zones with the forth in the making still, but what i've seen the game is really good and i would recommend this game to anyone for how fun its turned out to be.\n\nPersonally i give this game a 9/10 (c^_^c)","August 5, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please also note that you will die a few times on your first try but thats ok, when you die you have a chance to spend any gathered diamonds on upgrades or extra items found in chests and then try again. The Crypts/zones are always randomised meaning not every run will be the same, some will be easy as in the exit is right in front of you, other times you would need to fight through a mini-army to exit the place and will bring many challenges for you to face. At the end of each Crypt/zone, ussually on the forth floor, you will face one of three bosses, all of which brings an interesting take to battle.\n\nAnd if you get board with the in-game soundtrack (no idea why since the merchants singing is quite fun) you can always add your own music and try get through with your own beats.\n\nSo far the alpha has three Crypts/zones with the forth in the making still, but what i've seen the game is really good and i would recommend this game to anyone for how fun its turned out to be.\n\nPersonally i give this game a 9/10 (c^_^c)","August 5, 2014","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely worth the effort.\n\nMy girlfriend doesn't care for this game, but she's has a severe aversion to rhythm games.

Seriously, you need to be able to hold a beat to even consider playing this game in full. And yes, this is an important distinction - I've seen several attempted runs from someone who didn't, they were very short lived. Another warning - If you have any music preferences, they're about to be formatted.\n\nAnyways, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike rhythm game. The roguelike takes precedence for the most part, but it's good to keep a rhythm-game mentality. The gameplay can be a bit tricky at first, but superb once you get the hang of it. The actual progression is a bit basic (not uncommon for roguelikes), but that's not too major a problem. The biggest issue most people have with the game is that the rhythm-based controls are a bit gimmicky or unwieldy, but I had very little problems with them and they didn't get in my way too much.\n\nBut enough about the gameplay. I'm writing this review to commend the SOUNDTRACK. This game's BGM alone is worth the $15 admission fee, and that's a bargain. I've been known to listen to the soundtrack on repeat for hours on end, and am working on burning the soundtrack onto a CD as I type this. And if the planets align and someone is born who doesn't like the music - you can set your own too.\n\nSo in summary: If you think you can manage the gameplay, get the full game. If you don't think you can manage it, already have the game, or need a new soundtrack to listen to in your spare time, buy the soundtrack. And if by some strange coincidence you neither want this game's gameplay nor it's soundtrack, then and ONLY then will I permit you to not touch this game.\n\nWhat are you waiting for... pick up the beat!","October 6, 2015","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanic of moving to the beat is an interesting gimmick, although I can't seem to get the hang of it. Keep missing some beats (because the soundtrack is incredibly excellent? Heh... not really. Just great, but not superb kinda thing). The soundtrack changes every level you go on, meaning that the beats change pace level to level. This also provides a nice variety while playing - you move at a different beat every level, and combined with the randomly generated levels (can't memorise paths - they always change) provides enough entertainment for a few hours.\n\nYou can also change music tracks if you want, which I'll be doing soon. So if you for some reason get disappointed in the music, swap to your own. The provided soundtracks are nice, but sometimes the fast(ish) beats combined with the dungeon monster aspects results in missed beats and dead characters.\n\nI do not have any significant flaws with this game - it provides what it says it will - a different approach to rogue-like dungeon exploring that is enjoyable and not buggy at all (I didn't encounter any bugs while playing). Got it on sale at 50% price or something, but even at full price it would be worth grabbing to play.\n\nPrice - fine\n\nGameplay - fun\n\nBugs - None found while playing\n\nSoundtrack - Sometimes not to my taste, but irrelevant when you're trying your best to survive in a dungeon. All tracks are enjoyable for playing.\n\n+1\n\n\n\n\n","March 15","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/247080/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","With the surge in popularity of roguelikes, it was an eventuality that developers would need to do something other than merely make another punishing dungeon crawler like the original Rogue. While there have been many grand takes on the formula by entrants like Rogue Legacy, FTL, and Nuclear Throne, the last concept I was expecting was a roguelike crossed with a rhythm game. I wondered how this mashup would even work, but it turned out that the answer was quite simple; you just press the arrow keys in time with the music’s beat while traversing floors of a dungeon. Simple premise, but Necrodancer is deviously challenging because of its rhythmical movement, even if it can suffer from incredible roguelike luck.\n\nDance Dance Revolution meets a dungeon crawler is the quickest and easiest way to define the game. Both the enemies and your movements are tied to the music’s beat, where trying to move on an offbeat will result in an awkward hop in place, and skipping a beat will act as a ‘passed turn’, both dropping your combo. Most enemies have a specific pattern or interaction with the beat, like how skeletons will raise their arms for one beat before moving forward on the following one, or how minotaurs will charge in a straight rhythmic line upon direct sight. Learning these patterns and quirks will let you dance around enemies, and pulling out deft, tactical evasions of enemy mobs never fails to be incredibly satisfying. Items and equipment are available to be discovered or purchased (via a rather vocal and potentially homicidal shopkeeper), including weaponry like longswords that supply an extra square of attack range, boots that let you walk across hazards without a care, rings that bestow various effects like increasing the amount of gold dropped by enemies, spectacles that will let you see what treasure you’ll get from chests and other containers, and other fun utilities. Some loadouts of equipment are more preferable than others, and gathering them becomes a priority in order to make later sections laughably easy. No need to worry about lava or ice when you can just float above the floor! No need to worry about health when you have a blood bow that lets you kill enemies from afar and replenish your health! There are trade-offs between items and gear of course and your ‘this is the run’ loadout will no doubt vary from my own, but once you get an optimal loadout, the game’s later challenging sections become trivial save for boss fights. On the flip side, poor luck resulting in less than ideal loadouts can also occur, and raw player skill can only go so far in some cases.\n\nThe challenge in Necrodancer primarily comes from how the enemies never -ever- falter in their timing and movements with the music; The player however can (and will, on your first few attempts) make mistakes, thus making a missed beat punishing or potentially run-ending - Not to mention you lose your gold multiplier from being struck by an enemy. Many roguelikes require situational and environmental awareness in order to avoid losing a run, but Necrodancer demands auditory awareness on top of it all, what with how the music is your means of moving. Thankfully the developers included a visual aid of a heart that beats with every beat, as well as scales that close in on the heart to cue you on when movement or attacking is possible, which is both kind and intelligent on their part. I cannot list the number of times I’ve panicked and had to look at the heart beat in order to get back on rhythm. The music doesn’t last forever however, and if you’re still on the dungeon floor before the song ends and you don’t reach the exit, you’ll automatically be ejected to the next floor. Also as a kind gesture there’s a bestiary that lets you practice against encountered enemies to study their patterns and traits - Considering the later difficulty, these aids help balance the field.\n\nNecrodancer had more characters and modes of play added during its period in early access, like dance mat support, a cooperative mode, and even a custom track function to let you jive around dungeon floors with your own music. The core game doesn’t really change, it simply becomes modified with the various characters and different rules. There’s even a puzzle mode that gives you a floor to tackle using specific items and strategies that quickly becomes head scratching, and of course included is a daily seed that gives all players the same dungeon to take on and go for a high score. Once you get a solid grasp of the game and can get successful runs frequently, these various ways to play improve the longevity of a game that would’ve otherwise been rather short and easy to gleam over.\n\nYour purchase for Crypt of the Necrodancer will primarily rely on whether or not you enjoy the soundtrack; if you don’t, chances are you’re not going to have a good time. Rhythm games can only be so enjoyable if the soundtrack doesn’t sit well with the player, and in my case I’m a fan for most of Necrodancer’s tracks. Danny Baranowsky’s composition is full, vibrant and seldom with any musical downtime, which lends a very active listening experience to the game; for a game where the combat and movement is based on musical beats, having any song be boring or lacking instrumentation would result in dull gameplay. The backing synth for many of the tracks end up giving the soundtrack an almost gothic/horror feel but doing so within its techno/rocking manner. Of course, that’s when you discover later on that there are not one but -two- remixed soundtracks in later sections of the story mode, with the first striking chords of a laser disco and the second more grounded in reality with heavier, nastier rock. All three soundtracks have been uploaded to YouTube if you want to judge for yourself, which is advisable homework when it comes to purchasing rhythm games.\n\nNecrodancer’s strengths lie in its longevity, challenge and gimmick; like many roguelikes the difficulty does become somewhat trivial once you are knowledgeable of its components and mechanics. That said, the demands the game makes of the player ensures that you can know what items work well together and can dance around enemy patterns easily, but it all means nothing if you can’t execute tactfully. Back up this challenge with fantastic music and multiple ways to play, and you get a roguelike that is both satisfying and incredibly enjoyable.","February 7","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You play a family of musicians (or a motley crew of side-characters) determined to unlock the mystery of the magical lute and defeat the Necrodancer, a cursed necromantic bard.\n\nTrue to its name, you “dance” around each level by moving in tune to the rhythm meter at the bottom of the screen. Each level has its own tune and rhythm and the game steadily increases the pace as you progress. Keeping in tune with the music while vanquishing enemies will net you a higher multiplier which increases the amount of gold you find, in addition to enhancing certain special items found throughout the crypt. Failing to keep to the beat will cause your multiplier to go down and may also prevent you from moving. Since the monsters in the game also move to the beat, they will eventually close in on you to attack and you cannot stand still to “pause” the action (unless you’re playing the bard character).\n\nI found the soundtrack for CotN to be excellent and very diverse. Each level’s song fits its theme pretty well and there are a few tracks that are instantly catchy. The shopkeeper in each level will also sing along with the music, giving a clue to his location, and all of the monsters are either music-themed or have a name alluding to some musical term or instrument, adding an extra layer of detail to this thoroughly polished game.\n\nThere really aren’t any faults with this game that would prevent any fan of rogues from picking it up (playing as Aria is extremely hard though) and, even if you’re not normally into games in this genre, the learning curve is very fair. This game is worth picking up even at its original cost, though if you can catch it at the average sale price of $5 it’s quite a steal!","March 21","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senatorhurrdurr/recommended/247080/","senatorhurrdurr","Pikachu on LSD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senatorhurrdurr/","95 products in account","Completionists, stay away.  There are things that are practically impossible to obtain.\nRoguelike purists, also stay away.  The game mechanics aren't extremely deep.\n\nOtherwise?  As long as you can tap to a metronome (or at least learn to) and do enjoy action, I highly recommend this game.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer, at its core, is a rhythm-based action with roguelite and dungeon crawler elements.  People have compared this game to games such as Faster Than Light and Spelunky; I really enjoyed the former and felt iffy about the latter, and after 350+ hours, I don't know if I can really stop playing NecroDancer just yet.\n\nIt's very easy to pick up and understand the core gameplay; one or two local players act to the beat (with only the arrow keys), and everything else responds to your movements on the same beat, allowing you to plan for the next beat.  Getting dropped into the first zone after the tutorial level, you're introduced to a small variety of items, learning about this and that, buying and picking up things to figure out what your favorites are, and dealing with a small variety of enemies.  Items definitely make things easier, but it's absolutely possible to finish everything and low% a run with only default gear.\n\n(By the way, if you want to have a sense of genuine curiosity, go into the options and disable "show item hints".)\n\nAnd once you inevitably die, it's not so bad.  There's almost always a way out of whatever predicament you managed to get yourself into, and you sensibly chuckle at it and figure you'll do better next time.\n\nYou slowly progress, saving a few unfortunate NPCs from cages, buying new things with diamonds and slowly expanding the pool of items you get to find and use during runs.  You finally manage to get the boss down, start to learn why Cadence is in this dungeon of dance, and then you're back to square one, figuring out the patterns in the completely new world that is Zone 2.  And you work through it, because holy crap is that Danny Baranowsky soundtrack fantastic and motivating.\n\nAnd you keep at it.  Some things change completely, some things don't, and some things get flipped upside-down and force you to change tactics.\n\nOccasionally, you take a break from Cadence and pick up a different character.  Oh yeah, there's other ways to play the game in Zone 1 again, and some new strategies for enemies you've seen before.  All the normal characters are interesting to work with in their own way.\n\nOnce you feel that you've finished the important stuff, a variety of things open up.  Score runs?  Speedruns?  Sure thing, try to see how well you can do on the boards and in the daily challenge runs.  Low%?  Go for that, if you want to.  In terms of replayability, you get about as much as Spelunky -- everything generally stays the same, but for some reason the variations between runs always gets you coming back for more.\n\nMods are a thing, to some extent.  At the very least, many resources can be replaced and custom levels are supported and supported through Steam Workshop.  That's about it, though; there's no way to add in completely new items and content just yet.\n\nRemember what I said about completionists?  Yeah, if you want to 100% this game legitimately, forget about it.  The developers added in a character that even they think is impossible.  There's absolutely nothing except bragging rights and an achievement to gain from completing a run as said character (unlike in, say, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth), so you're not missing out on too much otherwise.\n\nIt's been great watching this game only get better from Early Access; Brace Yourself Games has been nothing less than incredible with regular development and responsive to the community.  If you haven't been driven away from reading this yet, it's absolutely worth more than the $15 that it's listed for.","May 9, 2015","true","489.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Moving to the beat of the music with four buttons; up, down, left, and right.  This is a very simple concept, but very challenging when it comes to execution, due to the amount of concentration required while playing it in order to not get frazzled.  You can pick up items, money, and consumables to take on your journey to reach the end of the game through multiple fun and challenging levels with multiple characters that have a variety of gameplay styles.  In the end, however, it comes down to the music, something in that rhythm games require great music, and that's what Danny whips up for us, along with remixes from A_Rival and FamilyJules7X, which bring us full immersion of the game seamlessly.  All in all, this is on the top of my list of games I recommend to play, because nothing can beat the beat of this game.","August 1, 2015","true","83.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just totally solid from every vantage point. Any review that places this game below at least a 90 in score on Metacritic is either using a 5 star system and doesn't grant half stars or doesn't appreciate the nuances of the gameplay / the difficulty of the game.\n\nThere is a large breadth of mechanics (there are tons of aspects of play like exploration, timing, resource management, risk/reward, etc) but all of which are approachable. The real startling thing is they have incredible depth and learning the nuances of each one give a decent advantage to the player (spotting loot in wall tiles, having perfect rhythm/decision making while swarmed in constant fractions of seconds, learning to love glass items, when to use a long-hit vs wide-hit weapon, etc). I love roguelikes but rarely find the types that I REALLY love, particularly those that emulate a style of gameplay similar to NetHack while not having any one aspect be broken. The amazing soundtracks on top of a game which is already very easy to appreciate on its own merits is just icing on top of the cake.\n\nThe difficulty is fine, in spite of a few claims otherwise. Dancepad mode is available for those who need slightly easier play. Altering the music can also allow for slower gameplay too. Hell, there's a character where you can avoid the beat mechanic entirely and which is very obviously there for players to train and get better, get a purer roguelike experience, or just clear the zones as quickly as possible. ANY review that bashes the game for not being easy in the main mode despite the many attempts by the devs to give easier options is just feeding into the mindset that games with hard base difficulty are bad. It's not only not fair but it's also greatly hindering games with permadeath and large death penalties from being developed. Hell, even I can't beat clear the second zone of Spelunky but I can still appreciate it.\n\nThe only criticism of this game that I found fair was that unlocking the full story requires beating all four zones with three different characters, the last of which is a hardcore player character (one missed beat or any damage and you die and have to restart the zone). With vanilla gameplay, even knowing the game VERY well it borders on being a slight bit unreasonable. Bottom line: if you're not the kind of person who complains about how hard and punishing a /ROGUELIKE/ can be and if you're willing to put in enough time to appreciate the depth of mechanics then you'll love Necrodancer.\n\nGet the game. Love it and be a casual player if you'd like. It's perfectly made for that too. But hopefully you'll join in the more competitive scene and see how far the rabbit hole really goes. It could certainly use some action and the game can absolutely support it.\n\nBest of luck unlocking Coda.","April 27, 2015","true","75.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't go into it looking for a deep roguelike, at least at this stage of development the actual roguelike aspects are fairly rudimentary and simplistic, but the way that the rhythm game aspects integrate with the core gameplay make it brilliant. The combination is impossibly fun. It's easy to learn but difficult to master and has a fairly large level of polish even in early access, nice pixel art, and a fantastic soundtrack. If you think that you'll enjoy it then you almost definitely will, CotN is as good as it promises to be and better.\n\nJust don't go into it expecting a deep, complex, strategic roguelike, for that you're much better off picking up a copy of Wazhack. My only complaint is that (playing with a controller), I find it difficult to press the button combinations required to use items without breaking my combo, and simultaneously too easy to activate them accidentally well moving around. Overall, though, Crypt of the Necrodancer is well worth picking up, and hopefully it will get even better as it continues development.","October 1, 2014","true","36.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kadoba/recommended/247080/","Kadoba","Blaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kadoba/","287 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is phenomenal. It gives a full roguelike experience but with a unique twist - all movement and actions must be done in sync with the background music. It really is, in effect, a cross between a classic roguelike and a rhythm game such as DDR or osu!\n\nThis is more than just a gameplay gimmick. The entire game relies deliberate consistent movement and fast thinking. All enemies have very predictable attack patterns but that hardly makes the game easy. When you have to contend with several different enemies and traps on the screen at once the difficulty can get very challenging, especially in the later levels.\n\nLike all roguelikes, you, as a player, get exponentially better with game experience and knowledge. At first even the earliest floors of the dungeon may seem impossible, but as you start getting faster at processing your situation and taking advantage of your resources, you're able to delve deeper and deeper into the crypt with less effort. Eventually you may find even the nastiest enemies have no chance against your well timed steps. The skill ceiling is so high it's actually possible to beat all consecutive areas without taking damage using the starting weapon. In fact, there is a character and achievement for doing just this.\n\nThe best part is that it's all just so satisfying. Not only does everything about this game feel well thought out and balanced, it's hard to express just how good it feels to take all of your actions in time with the music. Every living (or unliving) thing in the dungeon is literally dancing or bobbing its head in sync with the rhythm and it's all just so.. fun! Did I mention the soundtrack is awesome?

So is the game.  Players are dropped into randomly generated dungeons and tasked to explore as deep as possible without dying.  Death is permanent; when you die, you start from the beginning all over again.\n\nExploring, fighting, looting, moving, everything is played to the beat of the Danny Baranowsky chiptune soundtrack.  You are likely to die many, many times as you come to learn the various kinds of loot you’ll find and the multitude of enemies to fight.  The good news is that the game is ultimately fun to play and enjoy for players who are into rhythm games and randomized dungeons; the bad news is that getting to that point is layered underneath the frustration of not knowing what to do for the first few hours.  Stick with it long enough, and this game becomes really engrossing to play.","January 5","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So its Tibia with Guitar Hero lol\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and unique. Roguelike elements are lacking a bit (not many upgrades on death), but it does have legit concept, that you can unlock boss practice rooms. So yea, its more focused on the player skill instead of player upgrade. Think of this as, Magicite, ftl rogue elements vs Roguelegacy type.\n\nDefinetly recommend this game.

There are boss fights as well, but I didn't find them as challenging as the levels preceeding them.  That's a blessing, because sometimes making it to the boss at all is enough of a challenge.

This game provides a fun and challenging experience for all players to enjoy. From the combat and movement system, to the wonderful and energetic music, this game is amazing, while not perfect, as it is in early alpha, it still keeps me entertained. Every enemy has a pattern to it, which means you need to memorize it to do good, there is no RNG nonsense. In the game you move and attack to a beat. Once you break the beat, or you lose your coin multiplier (for cadence at least, not sure about the other characters) which can make the game a lot harder on you.

I am not a big fan of rogue-likes in general, but this game is among few rare exceptions.\n\nYou have 4 zones to beat, each one contains 3 floors and a boss fight. Every zone has its own theme and enemies. But wait, there's more. The enemies each move to the beat in their own unique pattern, and you have to recognize it and adapt quickly. For example, some enemies might be moving along a scripted path, others try to go for you specifically, some might stay still for 2 beats and then move on the 3rd one, others might move on every beat, and so on. It's all very well done.\n\nDuring your dungeon crawling, you'll also come across a lot of items of varying degrees of helpfulness. You have healing items, weapons, armour, rings, spells, and even some unusual items. Some can spawn from the start, others require unlocking via collectible diamonds. You can even remove the less useful items from the dungeons via the janitor, so that there's more chances instead for chests to contain the items you find more useful.\n\nThere is of course a fair bit of luck involved, as is pretty common with rogue-like games. At times you'll be lucky to find a nice weapon and other useful items early on, other times you'll just be spawning with enemies all around you. It is a very challenging game. You will die a lot. But you do learn to recognize the enemy movement patterns and eventually overcome them.\n\nI also really like the whole light-hearted theme the game is going for. I think the devs pulled it off perfectly. The music is also amazing and will just drag you in to the beat.\n\nIn addition to the regular mode with the main character, you also get to unlock several other characters, which seem to have their own unique abilities (for example one of them can only confuse enemies but not kill, another is only able to use bombs, and so on). It all adds an extra challenge for those who want it. You can even go and practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses if you wish.\n\nGreat game in general.

Every map feels different from one another which makes the dungeon experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nYou earn gold to buy armor, weapons, magic, food ext... While collecting diamonds to purchase upgrades for your hero at the main menu. You can also unlock different modes and characters to further your dungeon experience.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rythme games, dungeon games or just a quick game that doesn't require you to sit down for over an hour long to complete a map.\n\nThis game needs mounts added...

When we played Heroes 3 of Might and Magic back then, we called the Necromancers, Necrodancers or Negrodancers. Yeah it's a stupid little joke but heck, it gives us plenty of laughs back then.\n\nWhen this game popped up in Steam, my cousin messaged me ".. Have you seen the new game title in Steam?"\n\nHa!\n\nSo anyways, the game itself is fun but only in short bursts. Being able to use your own musics is awesome, but as of now at least in my opinion, most of the musics I use doesn't match with the in-game beat well/precisely. Could just be because its still in Early Access.

Seriously.\n\nEDIT\n\nNow that the final release is out I'm updating my review. Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of those games you really just have to play to understand the hype, and yes this is one of those rare cases where the hype is 100% justified. The game just hits every note perfectly (haha). The gameplay is increadible. Even though the look is familiar, the mechanics are like nothing else out there (which is quite a feat in todays gaming age) but still seems to satisfy on some primal level. It's kind of like speed chess if it were fun. Each enemy moves in a unique pattern and each item effects the behavor of your character. Every move could either result in success or death, but you only have a split second to decide what to do. It really puts you on the edge of your seat especially when playing "all zones" mode. Then there's the music. It's amazing. In fact it's so amazing I bought the soundtrack version and uploaded the songs to listen to on my iPod. Of course thats the kind of music we've all come to expect from Danny Baranowsky of Binding of Isaac fame. The great thing about the music is that it makes you dance. Not in the game, but in real life. I can't play this game without dancing around with a big grin on my face like a complete idiot. My fiance thinks its hilarious, whom by the way, can't stand video games yet still found this game to be entertaining. On top of all that the execution is really what brings it all together. The way the shopkeeper sings to the music, how the music in the fire/ice stage transitions from metal to classical music seamlessly, the quirky sprite animations, and the light up disco tiles, it really brings a smile to your face. Its games like these that remind me why I game in the first place. I'm really quite pleased that amidst all the Call of Duty garbage you can still find little gems like this one.\n\nI really can't recomend this game enough! :D\n\nCan't stop dancing/10","February 27, 2015","true","42.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Don't worry, there's a lot of stuff in the game for beginners, from tutorials to training rooms, to get to up to par with the better players. Wanna challenge yourself? Go right ahead! There's daily challenges, seeded runs, speedrunning, and you can remove items you've unlocked from the dungeon. Like modding games? It's got that too. Just throw some pixel art together and make yourself a new character or two, make a dungeon with the level editor, or edit some of the game's XML data for lulz.\n\nIf you've come for a fun time, the soundtrack, got a recommendation, or to introduce yourself to Roguelikes, you won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind, this game doesn't throw punches. The enemies are tough and there are a lot of them. They do however follow patterns, so try to learn them.\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot of the enemies move in ways similar to chess moves. The protagonists' attacking style (i.e., the whip weapon, follows the formation of a knight in chess). So it is somewhat helpful if you have played some chess. Then, interestingly enough there is a chess boss level. Blood weapons are the best, as it recovers your life/hearts.

Thumping.","January 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Good art style, fun and incredibly challenging gameplay, quite a bit to do. The best feature is the music. The score is by Danny Baranowsky who did the music for the original Binding of Isaac and the background music for Jimquisition. The soundtrack is better than the game itself. And that's saying something since the game is really good. One of the best I've heard. Period. Awesome game.","June 19, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
