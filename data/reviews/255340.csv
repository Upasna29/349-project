If you enjoyed the original Escape Goat, you're in for a real treat. I found the first game to be fun but felt like the main campaign was over as it was just getting good. This game isn't baaaa--ad at all. Yes, I went there.\n\nEscape Goat 2 has quite a bit more to offer. The story is richer (especially for a puzzle game), the gameplay is a lot more varied, and the puzzles offer even more profound "Ah ha!" moments than the first game.\n\nThe system for moving between levels is much better this time around. If you get stuck you can easily pull up the new overworld map system and go back to any other puzzle--no more need to start rooms over at the first puzzle just to get to that fifth puzzle again.\n\nRegarding story, the original Escape Goat didn't have much--which was part of its appeal. You won't find anything too deep here but there is more this time around. If you talk to all of the animals you'll get quite a bit more backstory and world history. I found myself feeling excited to beat the next section of levels so that I could see what would happen next; the game did a good job at keeping me coming back for more.\n\nThe art is fantastic, I enjoy the attention to detail and the new lighting engine adds a lot of depth to the feeling of the game. The soundtrack is great too; I didn't find any of the tracks to be repetitive and didn't feel the need to use my own music while playing the game.\n\nThe original Escape Goat had a few secrets. This game has so much more to offer. I was floored the first time I discovered a secret room. The mechanics for getting into that particular secret room were so clever. I don’t want to spoil any of the fun though, so I’ll leave it at that.","March 24, 2014","true","21.1"," 75 of 85 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","75","85","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/255340/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The first Escape Goat was a nearly flawless execution of what it wanted to be: a clever, compact puzzle platformer that didn't sacrifice cleverness for comprehensibility. In a lot of ways Escape Goat 2 is just more of the same, albeit with a much nicer art style, but in expanding the original experience it loses a lot of what made the first game so smart. It feels like a sequel that someone felt they ought to make instead of an outlet for the ideas that couldn't didn't previously make the cut, and although that same great game is still at the core the level of consistent direction is not, leaving Escape Goat 2 in many ways a lesser experience than the one which preceded it.\n\nThat sounds fairly damning so I should probably backpedal a moment to stress that this is in no way a terrible follow up to proverbial classic. The first half of the game is in many ways just as fun as its ever been, reintroducing many of the same mechanics as the original and reminding me why I loved that game so much. It's at this point that I was firmly in love with the game, for as familiar as it was I had been wishing for more Escape Goat and developer Magical Time Bean was here to satisfy.\n\nUnfortunately it may have been better if I had decided to quit after seeing the credits roll the first time, as upon returning to the castle to visit the other half of optional puzzles I'd unlocked the cracks in Escape Goat 2's foundation started turning into holes.\n\nWhat the first game did so well and seemingly effortlessly was introduce new mechanics non-verbally, teaching you through gameplay instead of a traditional tutorial as it switched up the puzzle hook every new world. 2 does this too, but it often operates under a presumption that you're already familiar with the systems it introduces, and freely uses them without giving you time to learn in a game that's already a far steeper challenge than the original. Where the first game was always careful to be completely clear when showing you how its world worked, Escape Goat 2 is muddy and hard to parse.\n\nThe only way for me to get around this was through trial and error and occasionally leaning on a guide for support, neither of which I'd previously felt necessary as I always had everything I needed right in front of me and had been taught how to make use of them. There were numerous recurring moments where I was completely unsure how a puzzle was even suppose to work, and the game was giving me no hints to ease me in. It's not that the puzzles are more difficult but that they feel cheap and intentionally difficult to understand, often including red herring items just to clutter the screen and usually relying on switches which you typically have no idea what will trigger until you already have.\n\nThe significantly increased reliance on timing and twitch platforming expose a lot of the otherwise serviceable control issues, most frustrating being the odd weighting which makes precision movement agonizingly inconsistent. Many puzzles begin already in motion, leaving me no time to even look over what I'm jumping into before I have to start making decisions that usually caused me to have to restart because I missed a jump or didn't hit a button at exactly the right moment. It's things that feel out of place and work poorly within Escape Goat 2's framework, like puzzles that were originally scrapped but brought back in just to pad out a game thinks it needs to be larger for the sake of being a sequel.\n\nI think it's worth mentioning again that Escape Goat 2 isn't awful, and I don't regret the time I spent with it. It's simply that coming from such near perfection to comparative mediocrity is rather more shocking than it might have otherwise been if this had been the first game. Escape Goat 2 fails largely because of the weight of its predecessor, which in its attempts to best end up being its downfall. If all you ever wanted was more Escape Goat, that's definitely here, but when I finally exited the last room I had begun to considerably question if I really did want that as much as I had thought I did.\n\nFull disclosure: Escape Goat 2 was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

Escape Goat 2 is basically more of the same, which is not a bad thing. It offers a nice balance of platforming and solving intelligent puzzles. The controls and mechanics are just great. Really nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe difficulty is very low in the first few levels and always gets a little higher from level to level. Nobody should have any problems getting into the game. And yet it is quite challenging later on. Escape Goat 1 offered some high difficulty levels after beating the campaign. I expect the successor to offer the same (I didn't beat it yet, so I just can assume it will).\n\nThe main difference to the first part is the graphics style. Instead of the basic pixel art we got in Escape Goat 1, this game now uses a new high definition graphics style, which many people will like. I personally prefer the old art style, but I am fine with either of them. The most important thing for me is, that the controls didn't change at all. Despite the new graphics the game feels absolutely like the first part. Not all games manage to do that.\n\nI like it a lot. Both Escape Goat games are real indie gems. You will enjoy your time.\n\nSome gameplay footage (first few minutes):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD_E7B0bxSI&feature=youtu.be\n\nEscape Goat 1 footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4u3KUM4UdQ","March 24, 2014","true","7.1"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","39","50","0","0"

It is like Escape Goat 1, only with a much higher level of polish. While this is a good thing for me, people who didn't like the first game, or those who mastered it might not find much to enjoy. You will find yourself doing much the same levels and facing much the same challenges. The new mechanics are fine, but they don't add anything particularly interesting that rises above the base game.\n\nFor first time players or those wanting more? It is a must buy.

It's very clever in it's puzzle and platforming. Having enjoyed Escape Goat 1 i was really looking forward to this game and it delivered. It's very much improved from the first title. There's plenty of content in the game and added stuff such as mutators will keep you coming back for more. I have really enjoyed this game. During this review i'll compare this to the first Escape goat and give my opinion on if it has improved or worsened.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThey've totally changed the art-style of the game, from the pixel art style to much sharper clean looking art-style. In my opinion it looks gorgeous and runs buttery smooth. The FPS are locked to 60 FPS, i even turned off V-Sync but still locked to 60 FPS which isn't bad at all. All in all the game runs and looks very good. The first Escape goat also had a pretty good art-style but i think this one looks much better.\n\nSound:\n\nIf you have played the first game you would expect nice music from this game. The music indeed is very nice. The music still gives that same creepy vibe which the first game gave. Each level has it's own soundtrack and all of the ones i listened to were very good.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay of this game is very similar to the first one, they've added some nice new abilities to your rat friend. The puzzles are very clever but not hard. It took me 3 hours and 55 minutes to beat the story missions. There is still some stuff to do so this game is easily a 6 hours game, add on top the mutators mode and you can have even more game time. The story is similar to the first one. You go in the castle and save your sheep friends. Still got that creepy satanic vibe from the castle. In addition the the sheep you get these ghosts from corpses of dead animals which give you some story information from time to time.\n\n\nNew abilities were added to the rat like a mini hammer power-up which turns your rat into a block, duplicate rats ability which lets you have 4 rats instead of 1. New abilities really give the game new life and makes things interesting and fresh. The game is not entirely puzzles as it involves platforming as well, you need to time jumps/drops, move with an object at the same time to avoid being electrocuted, etc. in order to complete some levels. The goat still has that same double jump and dash abilities.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is very good, if you liked Escape goat 1, you would love Escape goat 2. If you have not played the first one and you like puzzle games, you will love this game. There's plenty to do in the game. It’s addicting too as once you start you keep playing. I beat it in one sitting. Not that expensive either so if you wanna wait you Can pick it up during a sale though in my opinion it's even worth it's full price.","April 18","true","8.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

Out of 70+ levels, only the very last 2 made me open Youtube for a helping hand. You can also choose to tackle the extra levels before finishing the story.\n\nIt takes a little while to get used to the goat's floatier controls, and the duo has some new tricks up their sleeve (aside from the returning Magic Hat, there are two new power-ups): but other than that, the game is pretty much more of the same, with very improved graphics and a more vibrant soundtrack. It's also a bit longer than the original's story mode, although the relatively low difficulty means it shouldn't take more than 2 hours to get through the story, and perhaps 5 hours including the harder levels.\n\nOverall, a great way to spend some time during a weekend. If you actually liked AIP in the first game, you might be a little disappointed in the lower difficulty.

It adds a lot of new features while keeping some old ones, despite the new features being there for a few short levels. However there is a lot more to do in order to go through a lot of levels so there's more things to do rather than going through ten worlds and four extra worlds. There's a strange diffculty curve in some levels where you might spend ten minutes on one level figuring out what to do, then the next might take you two minutes. Either way the puzzles are interesting enough that you might even take some of them on in different ways, rather than going through what the game intends you to. The graphics are way better than the first, moving from pixel graphics to fancy drawn graphics and neat little idle animations. Soundtrack is also really amazing. If you liked the frist Escape Goat, you'll really love this sequel. If you haven't played the first, then I'd really recommend just moving onto this one, since there's nothing much to miss on the story.","March 25, 2014","true","3.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The graphics, lighting and sound are great.  Controls are very responsive (I used a 360 controller).  New gameplay elements include a couple more superpower-hats for your sidekick.  Generally I found the levels more varied and entertaining than the original game's.\n\nHere's why I can't rate it a 5-star:\n\n- while "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies to some extent, I'd have liked to see a couple more enemies added.  The sawblades and the reapers are back, and that's it - apart from the snake-boss (whose levels I didn't enjoy, because they were too fiddly).  How about some different classes of reapers, at the least?\n\n- some of the levels are way too tricky, while most are plain sailing (can be done within a couple of tries).  I wonder how many of those really tough levels were beta-tested?  Because the timing required on some of them is outrageous.  A couple involve your goat being stuck at the bottom of the screen on a platform which is decaying or otherwise moving out from under you.  If you jump too soon, you die; if you hesitate, you fall and die; and, if you jump incorrectly (by not hitting a high-enough jump or by brushing against a tiny pixel) you are blocked from completing the jump (and then you fall and die).  In desperation on those levels, I looked up how the YouTube experts did it, but replicating the same feat is another matter.  I always say it with puzzlers: if you can see how something is meant to be done yet can't replicate it within an hour of trying, the game has failed.  Or should be labelled: only for kids with catlike reflexes.  :(\n\nNiggles aside, I had a blast with the majority of the game, "finishing" it in around 7hrs (87% completion, it says, but more than enough to get to the outro).","April 5, 2014","true","4.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spoilsportmanteaux/recommended/255340/","spoilsportmanteaux","Miss Nomer.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spoilsportmanteaux/","692 products in account","A platforming puzzle game with a large bundle of interactive features, this game succeeds at two goals. First, at being a good challenge that causes you to think about your approach to dozens of levels instead of just roaming through and pressing buttons. Secondly, and here’s the catch, also at being fun whilst doing so.\n\nWhenever you make a mistake in this game, you know it’s usually your own fault and you mutter unmentionables under your breath before you willingly try again – because it’s fun.\n\nThere are times when, in levels with multiple buttons all being required to be pressed in order to activate something, it’s not very intuitive as to letting you know what it will accomplish and you’ll need to find the solution behind pressing all the buttons before you’re thrown into a second task in the same place. I think this was actually the idea behind the design, but I can’t say I’m incredibly fond of it. Sometimes, things move simultaneously at multiple points on the map and it can be a bit much to take in. It feels like the workings of the level aren’t entirely in your control, which is something the game is otherwise very good at not doing.\n\nThere are a few times here and there where you’ve made the right decision and have been thrown off the trail by chance bad feedback, either through a Reaper facing the wrong way at the wrong time, or your button press being just a miniscule portion off where it should have been. As such it’s a good idea to try an idea a couple of times before you give up on a notion.\n\nNot to throw you off though – these things only stand out as bad because they’re the odd ones out in an otherwise great game. The puzzles never seemed completely beyond me, but never did it feel like it wasn’t challenging. For the most part, the only stages that don’t cause you to stop and think about your approach are the ones that are introducing new ideas, and you can be sure that that means more interesting challenges ahead. Occasionally, you can find yourself overthinking a puzzle because extra bits and pieces were placed for the sole purpose of throwing you off the scent. Toward the end of the game, there’s a set of levels designed to make you react very quickly, and the true challenge is being able to work under pressure.  It’s a refreshing switch-up.\n\nThe whole theme is friendly. You’re a goat with your sidekick (occasionally magical) mouse, out rescuing sheep in a big castle with scary monsters. What on Earth isn’t to like about that?\n\nOh, and allow me to just throw this out there. You will die in this game. A lot. This will bring you back to the beginning of a level (which are never incredibly long, but it can feel frustrating to have to redo that thing you finally did right after trying and failing at least ten times first). There’s even a hotkey for making your Goat explode and die to restart the level quicker. You’ll be using that button a lot. Several functions rely on your trial and error because they’d be impossible to figure out the first time. Try not to let it get to you.\n\nThe music is fitting and blends into the background well. It keeps you from getting bored and doesn’t feel incredibly tedious. Otherwise it’s unremarkable.\n\nI’m pretty sure that whoever is behind this game must have played Pokémon Silver & Gold as a child, because I drew correlations between three particular puzzles in this game and puzzles from The Underground, Cianwood City Gym, and Ice Path. I thought that was interesting.\n\nI completed the game in 7h40m over the course of about a week (apparently mine was a slow playthrough), but like a frickin hour of that was on the last level. Just finished that one now. Sheesh. I died 625 times overall, which I believe averages a death every 44 seconds.\nThere are also apparently secret puzzles which I haven’t discovered, so I look forward to trying them out and scraping up all the (majority of) achievements I didn’t achieve through my playthrough.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, I have very little doubt that you will love this one to death whist you occasionally pull your hair out. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.","May 28, 2014","true","14.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Without the help of the friendly mouse who has the ability to get through small holes and teleport, the game itself would be really hard to beat. The goat itself has the ability to sprint, smash through boxes, and double jump. The game involves some challenging physics based puzzles and a little error requires you to restart the level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/255340/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Escape Goat – a gaming franchise named after a pun. Who’d have ever thought that the gameplay would be addictive, the controls tight, the puzzles super challenging and the overall presentation emitting as much charm and bravado as both of the games do? I didn’t always feel this way about that game or many of the better – more challenging – games in the genre. It’s taken me time to truly appreciate these games for the great works of art and entertainment that they are. A few too many rage quits at the hands of Super Meat Boy had me cursing this genre. I never wanted to play any of them again. I’d rather cry in the corner and pray that my mother was still alive so that she could give me a cuddle as I wrap my arms around her legs and she’d tell me that everything would be alright. Well no, god damn, it wouldn’t be. The genre kicked my ♥♥♥. I was supposed to own it.\n\nOr was I? Are the games in this genre intended to kick your ♥♥♥? Is that what makes them so memorable when you either have had enough to the point where you delete a game from your hard drive never to be played again – or certainly until the next time you feel as though you must punishing yourself. We live in a sadistic world when one gains pleasure from torturing ones self but that’s exactly what these types of games do. Then you have your self-obsessed freakazoids, otherwise known as gaming masters, who are able to complete games such as Escape Goat 2 within the allocated 30 minutes to achieve that mighty achievement. I shake my head at their mastery. I am certain that it can be achieved – I’ve seen it with my own eyes – but not by a mere mortal.\n\nIt makes me think back to when I was a younger gamer. I used to be that good. The jokes about being like The Wizard and the deep family discussions – especially with extended family – that there wasn’t any money to be made in just being a gamer and you needed to do something more real with your life. That I needed to get an education. I did great throughout elementary and dropped off during high school. It wasn’t that the work was too hard. I’d get B’s when instead I should have been getting A’s.  I had a real lazy bone and if I was sent home with homework I simply wouldn’t do it. Home time was all about spending time outdoors with friends playing sport and if nobody was around to play sport I’d be honing my hand eye coordination playing whatever was the latest and greatest on PC, SEGA or PlayStation. It didn’t help that I was a little bit spoilt as an only child and didn’t have a sibling that I had to outwork or outdo.\n\nBut back to Escape Goat. Great game. When I put my mind to it I found myself finishing the levels relatively quickly. Thankfully it’s not as excruciatingly tough as Meat Boy but it’s challenging enough because all of the features of the game are immaculately executed – it’s supposed to be a challenge. It probably didn’t do as well critically as what it probably should have but the market is constantly flooded with games within the genre that try and do different things – most of them failing – so other games tend to suffer as a result of the whole rather than taking a deeper look at what the individual title is trying to achieve and how well they’ve done it. Although the concept and the gameplay isn’t unique this one does it about as polished a job as a small indie company could make. It’s graphics are exactly what I would hope for from the title and everything works in the fashion that it should. Oh and special mention to the glorious stained glass window on the level select screen – a touch of imagination and pure brilliance.\n\nIf you’re wanting a smart and intellectual challenge in the form of a puzzle platformer and you have yet to play this great franchise then I’d recommend that you start with the original and build your way up to it. However, that’s more personal preference – I like to start with the beginning game – and yet the developers at MagicalTimeBean have done such a marvelous job that you really don’t need to do that. You’re not going to get into “OMG this is insanely difficult for the start of a new game” if you don’t. It teaches you the core mechanics extremely well. The puzzles gradually climb once the developers have expected that you should have gotten the core gameplay components down. It’s well balanced in that regard – again much better than many of its peers.\n\nFor a game that began its life as a pun it sure as hell plays like a champ.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","10.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The level design is done well enough that anyone can pick it up and understand the basic rules of the game. The developer, Ian Stocker, took notes from Egoraptor's Sequelitis video on Mega Man X, and has done a great job at creating the level of conveyance necessary for a good puzzle or action game. Every time there's a new element, it's introduced to the player in a safe way where the player is not in danger of dying (or is very unlikely to die), then is immediately used in several different and creative ways in the following puzzles.\n\nI completed it in about 4 hours, 26 minutes of in-game time, and I'd say for $10, plus Workshop support for custom user-created levels, it's well worth a buy.","October 30, 2014","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"Escape Goat 2" finds the magic middle ground, requiring no more from a player than he or she is likely able to contribute.  The platforming is just hard enough to be challenging, clearly not trying to be Super Meat Boy Redux.  The puzzles will make you scratch your head, but won't make you scream aloud or hurl your mouse at your monitor (or your controller, as it is fully controller-compatible).  I couldn't put this game down once I'd started playing, and once I did successfully put it down, I spent a lot of time thinking about that last room that I was having trouble clearing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamAsleep/recommended/255340/","IamAsleep","IamAwake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamAsleep/","839 products in account","Watch our review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYsluNNmXXc\n\nWritten review below:\n\n\n\nQ1: What is Escape Goat 2?\nEscape Goat 2 is a puzzle platformer by the indie development studio Magical Time Bean.\n\nQ2:What is the main draw of the game?\nIn this game you play as a purple goat who must escape a fortress by unlocking and exiting through the door in each room. Along the way you meet various friends like a mouse, who travels along with you and is a crucial part of gameplay, as well as sheep, who have gotten lost in the fortress and need to be rescued.\n\nQ2.5: What is the gameplay like?/Is it fun?\nThe gameplay of Escape Goat 2 is phenomenal, calling upon both your reflexes and problem solving skills. The controls are fairly simple: the goat can jump, double jump, and dash. Dashing is used to break boxes or push blocks, or simply as a quick traversal technique. But what really makes the gameplay shine is the mouse character. When you release the mouse, either by throwing it upward or in front of you, he sticks to the wall and climbs around the walls until you call him back. This is incredibly useful for hitting switches that are out of reach or for baiting enemies. The enemies also play a large part in the puzzle solving, the most common enemy type throwing fire at the goat or mouse when they see them, which can be either a hazard or a tool to open new pathways. But the main new gameplay feature of Escape Goat 2 in comparison to its predecessor is that you can obtain various powers for your mouse. I don’t want to spoil all the powers, but the first one you’ll encounter is the Magic Hat, which allows the goat and mouse to switch places. In addition to being able to access areas which are too small to enter as a goat or have been closed off by the fortress’s mechanisms, you can also destroy enemies or boxes in a line between the goat and mouse as they swap places. And that’s just the beginning of the puzzling possibilities. Escape Goat 2 is a game that encourages experimentation, giving only the bare minimum of tutorials; that is, at various points in the levels it suggests you press a button and then you just see what happens. Everything else is left up to your skill as a gamer. It’s rare that there’s only one way to solve any given puzzle, and that freedom is very refreshing, if sometimes a bit frustrating until you figure out what to do. But those are some of the best moments in gaming.\n\nQ3: What is the graphical style/presentation like?\nThe graphics of Escape Goat 2 are great. When compared to the original Escape Goat, they’re on a whole new level, going from rough pixel art to hand-illustrated art. The graphics are fairly standard as far as modern 2D platformers go, but the characters are very smoothly animated and a lot of detail was put into the mechanisms and gears in the fortress. Each zone in the fortress has its own unique visual identity as well, from the Woods of Duplicity to the Halls of Gleaming Crystal. The entire game somehow manages to give off a “mysterious” vibe. The music in the game is also appropriately atmospheric for each zone, and it’s pretty catchy too.\n\nQ4: What control methods does it allow?\nThe game can be controlled with either an Xbox 360 controller, which is the recommended control method, or with the keyboard. I didn’t get the chance to try it with a controller, but the keyboard was definitely usable enough with the default settings, and the keys are fully remappable, so that’s really all I can ask for.\n\nQ5: What kind of replayability does the game offer?\nI beat the main game, that is, escaped the fortress, in just over 2 hours. However, that was after only discovering 45.45% of the rooms, or so the results screen told me. Any level in the game can be replayed via the map system, and extensions to each zone are unlocked as you progress through the game. And boy, are these extra levels tough! I haven’t been able to beat all of them yet, but I can already tell that all of you puzzle-platformer fanatics are in for a treat!\nIn addition, a level editor will be added post-launch, with which you can create and share your own levels, for potentially infinite replayability.\n\nQ6: Is the game worth a purchase?\nIf you’re a fan of platforming and puzzles, and you’re not afraid of a challenge, I highly recommend you pick up this game. It’s available on Windows, Mac, and Linux on Steam, Good Old Games, and The Humble Store.","March 24, 2014","true","15.3"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

The cape sees a very rare amount of uses and that four mouse thing happens like, twice in the entire game.\n\nThere's some fresh ideas with the old mechanics, but not enough. There's a lot of retreading old ground here, needless to say.\n\nThere's a lot higher focus on execution over puzzle solving, which I'm honestly against. This is way more of a platformer than a puzzle game, at this point. Especially true in the secret areas, which are basically just lost levels from the For All Intensive Purposes level set in the original game, that I intentionally did not play because this game's engine is not very good platforming-wise, but it kind of knew that in the original game and kept the focus on puzzles.\n\nThere's also just a fair number of puzzles that are downright stupid or broken. Enjoy your mouse randomly falling off walls using the cape, enjoy having reapers walk onto spaces you don't want them to be when going up or down platforms, There's one puzzle in the second half of the library in particular that's just... really stupid and kind of luck-based. There's also a ton of "gotcha" moments, some easy to see in advance, others not so much, A lot of switches, you don't know what they're going to do until you press them, and sometimes they'll trap you and you'll just have to deal with it.\n\nGraphically, it "looks" better I guess but the game feels like it has less personality. The music's still great though. The story is still not really a thing, but it's not important.\n\nThis game does toy with decent ideas from time to time, and it's overall not an awful game, but I can't recommend it, especially in comparison to the first game. It's just kind of mediocre and disappointing, with a fair number of really frustrating moments.","April 16","false","9.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not going to discuss how long it took, because I don't believe games should be rated on the amount of time it took.  Not to mention, times vary depending on if you want to 100% it, get all achievements, or create and play through community levels.\nI really enjoyed this game, and anyone who enjoys semi-casual puzzle platformers will like it a lot, as well.  The main puzzles for completing the game to a bare-bones ending are not bash-your-head-against-a-wall difficult, while still maintaining a good level of both creative thinking, platforming, and satisfaction for solving.  The music is stellar, the art is gorgeous, and the "story" is sparse.\nSome minor issues: the controls feel a tad too floaty, hit-boxes are a bit too broad, and it took me over half an hour of avoiding any contact with Toragos before realizing that you can touch (ride) him without taking damage if you avoid the head.  That last part could have been better demonstrated, because a gamer's instinct in a game like this is to not touch any part of the enemy, lest they perish.\n\nI, for one, will not be 100%ing this game because it would take me WAY too long to find all the invisible keys, and that's not as fun as solving puzzles I can actually see.  But for what it was, I really enjoyed it, and I might even play around with the level creator, and/or speed-running.\n\nI recommend this very much, and look forward to future titles from MagicalTimeBean.","July 2, 2014","true","8.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It has been confirmed that the Level Editor is coming. So scratch that complaint. The game also (SPOILERS!!) do implement some new features, and is significantly larger than the first game. So i am changing this to a recommend. My stance on the graphic withstands none the less.\n\nStay clear!! If you own the original Escape Goat, don´t buy this. If you don´t own the original, buy that instead of this downgrade.\n\nBy all means an inferior game than the original Escape Goat, which i absolutely adored. From what i can concern, there is absolutely no new features what so ever. Calling it a sequel is actually misleading, since it´s the exact same game but with LESS content. You read that part correctly, Escape Goat 2 is LESS of a game than it´s predecessor. Why? Because the developer (s) removed the Level Editor! The original boasted an easy to use, yet extremely powerful level editor that allowed you to create anything the original campaign could offer. You could even create your own campaign by chaining the levels together. Escape Goat 2 have no level editor what so ever.\n\nThat´s right, they removed the ONE feature that allowed a wonderful community to grow up around this game. Maybe they realised that a level editor would make any DLC obsolete. Worse yet, well no not worse, the omission of the level editor is the main offender, but the new graphics aren´t really up to snuff.\n\nThe original had pixel perfect, atmospheric and gorgeous sprite art. The sequel is still made out of sprites, but it is all convoluted in an unnecessary comic look. The original had a sense of mystique, an omnious almost gothic vibe. This game looks like your random, kid friendly iOS game. To add insult to injury, the lightning effects obscures the playing field. It´s not always clear what is what, and while it certainly ain´t no big problem, the new graphics diminished the enjoyment of the game, at least in my case. It´s also unnecessary demanding! The first game i could run on my MacAir with perfect framerate and hardly any CPU usage. This game chugs even at the lowest graphics setting, and is setting my fan on fire.\n\nSo there you go. Take a game with a wonderful premise, because the basic gameplay behind Escape Goat is truly amazing, disguise it in less beautiful and more demanding graphics. Remove half of the content. (One could argue the level editor was more than half really), and up the price. And there you have it folks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/255340/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","Well, this game is pretty ok. It's a puzzle platformer type where you have to figure out ways to get to the end of the level as you climb a tower and save some sheep. The unique mechanics involving your friend the rat are pretty interesting and there were a few head scratchers. One thing I don't like about it, though, is that you don't really know what's going to happen, so with some puzzles you might expect being able to do X but you can't because the trigger does something unexpected, so you're obligated to restart the map. That's okay, though, because most of the puzzles seemed to be able to be done pretty quickly. I guess they're excusing their poor conveyance by not being just disgusting with timings, so that's cool. I got through all of the first act before I shelved this game, though. It's by far not a favorite, but I might revisit it later to claim the prize at the end.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty neat game, and not one that I hate because it plays poorly, so yeah, this thing gets a recommendation from me. To be honest, if there were a "neutral" category, I'd probably go for that; I'm registering it as a recommendation because I don't think it's a game I'd suggest for someone to not play.","January 21, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

True to genre, there are levels that are infuriatingly based in precision timing and positioning so determine your preference based on how you enjoy that kind of thing. You will fail many times before uncovering all there is to find and several of the levels will make you think for a bit to come up with a workable solution. The base levels are not entirely that difficult and the rest is optional so you can complete the game without even touching the hardest levels there are.\n\nThe music is lovely and the art is crisp and clean. The story is rather abstract - You're a goat with a mouse in a tower rescuing sheep souls and talking with the dead animals that built said tower as you continue on to escape it. The mechanics are solid and using the mouse in clever ways adds another dimension of complexity and variety.\n\nThe achievements are rather interesting. Many are standard fare such as play every level and find everything, but some involve beating specific levels with specific conditions and those can be quite the puzzle themselves sometimes. Beyond those, beating the game in under 30 minutes is the only other achievement worth noting.","June 1, 2014","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game pacing is a bit too fast for a puzzle game.\nIt is really annoying missing something by a pixel then have to do entire room again. A self-save feature wouldn't be bad. Not a fan of the dark rooms; the darkness mechanic doesnt really add anything except more trial and error.\nOn that topic, puzzles have too much dependence on trial and error.

It's essentially the same as the first game but with vastly improved graphics, new abilities for the mouse and with bonus levels extending from the branches of the previous levels. There is probably a different ending at the end of it all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/255340/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","Well, this game is pretty ok. It's a puzzle platformer type where you have to figure out ways to get to the end of the level as you climb a tower and save some sheep. The unique mechanics involving your friend the rat are pretty interesting and there were a few head scratchers. One thing I don't like about it, though, is that you don't really know what's going to happen, so with some puzzles you might expect being able to do X but you can't because the trigger does something unexpected, so you're obligated to restart the map. That's okay, though, because most of the puzzles seemed to be able to be done pretty quickly. I guess they're excusing their poor conveyance by not being just disgusting with timings, so that's cool. I got through all of the first act before I shelved this game, though. It's by far not a favorite, but I might revisit it later to claim the prize at the end.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty neat game, and not one that I hate because it plays poorly, so yeah, this thing gets a recommendation from me. To be honest, if there were a "neutral" category, I'd probably go for that; I'm registering it as a recommendation because I don't think it's a game I'd suggest for someone to not play.","January 21, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many puzzles, especially the ones with secret exits, are definite bullcrap, and yet the bullcrap clings just closely enough to a semblance of actual logic that it's obviously /possible/ for an actual human being to discover and complete everything with enough trial and error.\n\nIf you are not a completist and just want to get to the normal ending without achievements, the game is a bit overpriced. Most of the levels are some form of optional or secret, and could be considered "unfair" in either a platforming sense or a hidden-information sense.","December 29, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
