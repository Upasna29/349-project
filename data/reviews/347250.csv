It's a simulation in that there's a lot of things to keep track of (how you first successfully take off by actually getting the momentum and then getting yourself to lift off the ground, how you deploy chaff when being targeted, how you go after mission objectives and try not to be captured, etc.). I'm actually super happy it's available again like this.\n\nThat said, I recommend reading the game instructional material linked to from the game page. Back in the day, even I as a veteran player would sometimes forget which key would push the throttle to max or get the brakes to quit so that I started moving forward, and referring to at least jotting down some keys common to my play was useful since the game is spending visual space on your cockpit and not on what keys interact with that cockpit.\n\nAlso, recommend saying YES to playing with a joystick when you launch the game. The game is really played with a joystick with the keyboard having some supplemental actions on it that were too excessive for the two (at the time) joystick buttons. The way Night Dive has packaged this with DOSBox means current gamepads will work as your joystick if you wake them up before launching the game - whatever counts as the first two buttons on the gamepad or flightstick or whatever you have will be the two buttons that the game listens to.\n\nI know Night Dive released Strife: Veteran Edition and I've heard their involved in rescuing other games that have disappeared from apparent ownership before... I'm glad to see this on here and I'm about to click on their link to see what else they've rescued so far. Kudos to Night Dive for bringing this out!\n","April 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","37","39","0","5"

I'm glad I can finally absolve my guilty conscience of all those pirated hours. This must be the first time I've ever heard the sound effects as they were meant to be heard instead of just beeps and bloops, too.\n\nPRO TIPS FROM THE PROS:\n- Tired of hearing the engine whine? alt + v will let you cycle through different levels of sound. All but the highest leave out engine noises.\n- On a long boring stretch of flying back to your landing site, with nothing to do in the meantime? Alternate hitting shift + z and shift + x every couple of seconds. Shift + z speeds up time, but only seems to work for a few seconds. shift + x puts you back into normal mode.\n- The way to earn the big points is on Cold War, not Conventional War. You make more points for flying around unseen than you ever could from blowing stuff up\n- If your game is running really choppily and your controls suck, it's not the game. What you're experiencing is lag. "Lag? This game? On my modern machine? How could that be?" Well, DOSBox isn't emulating a modern machine. Throw some more cycles it's way with ctrl f12. Somewhere in the 15000 cycles range will cure all your problems (default is 3000)\n\nMore controls here: http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=603","September 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

F19 is the top Microprose game before Civilization and it has the last Sid Meier's flight simulator gameplay, the endpoint of Sid's flight evolution if you will.\n\nF19's gameplay is a brilliant mixture of flight simulator and stealth. To my knowledge, currently it is still unique. In other words, you will not find a similar gameplay in modern games.\n\nThe core idea is the following. You, as a pilot of a stealth plane, go into the night far behind enemy front lines to hit special targets. The sky is full of patrolling MiG's, a lot of SAM's keep watch, and any clue or radar blip can alarm and the enemy will start to intensively search you. To be stealthy, you need to use landscape, watch the radar's and plane's activities, and, the most important, understand doppler and impulse radars and make relatively flight according to them (skim the manual due to it is a core feature).\n\nBeware, the controls is tricky and you have to read the manual to take off and use weapons.\n\nThe game is realistic and not very hardcore, but deep and replayable. There are three types of bombs (among >20 weapons) with different way of using (bombing), more then ten types of targets (bunkers, ships, SAM, ...). Enemy units are randomly generated and you will have to think how to sneak through the enemy, hit target/take photo, and safely back home.\n\nIf you prefer better graphic you can look at the game "F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0". It has the same gameplay, but more pixels and more scenarios.","February 29","true","173.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","3"

When this game was released my Brother and I fought over who got to play it first. this game has a lot of good things to say about it like the level of realism it's almost as if the missions are part of an Admiral's handbook and you get to read it. you get to fly into places like Iran and Lybia and you can play it in 3 different modes. I can't say that I have made it through one mission I can't even say that I have made it to the first target but with practice comes perfection.  for a game that was released in 1988 this is one of the favorites I keep coming back to. this simulation is more realistic than some of the games that have been released recently. I would recommend this game to everyone Thumbs up.","August 19, 2015","true","2.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

It's back! It's really back!\n\nOne of my earliest memories from when I was a tiny micro-kid back in ancient times was going to my grandpa's house and seeing this game on his computer. He had a tendency to earn distinguished flying crosses and then die horribly before he could get back to base. ... Anyway. I naturally sank about 11 billion hours into this game before the advent of things like graphics and operating systems that weren't DOS came along and drew me into other things.\n\nBut now it's back! Having tried it out (And earning a distinguished flying cross and then dying before getting back to base on my first mission; grandpa would be proud.) I can say it is still epic and awesome. ..Probably. You might have had to have been there back when it came out to really -get it.- And by that I mean it doesn't really have graphics. Or decent sound. Or a particularly responsive flight model. But dammit it's a piece of my childhood and I love it to death for that. Plus, you know, it has on the fly generated missions that nothing else does. And who doesn't want to strive for those super shiny medals you can awarded after a mission if you do good? Or try to survive 99 missions and make it to brigadier general? You know you want to. And besides, it's super cheap to buy. Who doesn't love cool cheap things?\n\n11/10 for people who thirst for nostalgias.\n7.5/10 for people who like old school cheap things that are also good, but who might not have played the original or have any idea what's going on when they try to fly the plane or why things keep exploding.","April 26","true","95.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its not the type of shooter where you just swoop right in a blow away anything that moves and expect to win the game (although you can do this). It is a puzzle where you need to plan what you're doing carefully to avoid detection and avoid hitting civilian or friendly targets.\n\nThe only critsism I have is that your pilot can only fly a maximum of 99 missions before the game forces him to retire, which means you cant go indefinetly racking up a big score. Some people might like that but personally I don't like it when a game places limits on you.\n\nIf you're into a strategy games that you have to realistically fly a plane in, you will love this.\n\nI would also like to add that Steam have no right charging money for this game, as it is classed as 'Abandonware' which means it is legally public domain and no-one has the right to charge people money for it.\n\nI only bought it because I forgot it was on the public domain.","May 8","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It offers an incredible amount of realism and depth, especially for its time, and challenges in many ways. This is a fantastic game for anyone, as long as you can remember all the keybindings.

A wonderful flight sim, with a good amount of tactics involved.  Even the manual is worth a read with the details and tactics it provides.\n\nHowever, some machines have an issue with Dosbox not properly recognizing the = key, which prevents you from being able to throttle forward and thus leaves you stuck on the runway in game.  After some searching, I found this to be an issue with Dosbox and some Windows drivers.  Once I fixed it, the game worked wonderfully again.\n\nIf you have this issue, check if Windows has installed one of your keyboards as Japanese/106/109, and reinstall it as a standard generic.\n\nDetails: http://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=18465","April 23","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
