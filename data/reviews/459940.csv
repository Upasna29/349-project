After finishing it there are some things I would like to share that I would have liked to know going in.  Do not go into it expecting insane puzzles, or crazy action that a lot of indie games love to shove in games to pander to an audience.\n\nWhen you purchase this game, you are purchasing three things.\nYou are buying an atmosphere.  At first it seems a little creepy but by the end you will be wishing there was more.\nYou are buying a story.  It's not an over the top story can't believe.  It's a story you wish you were a part of.\nYou are buying uniqueness.  I have played games like this but they were always a puzzle game where it's an hour long game that takes you 8 hours to beat because of backtracking.  Deer man says screw that gimmick, here's the story, enjoy.  I've never had a game just deliver just a story and still feel like im playing a game.\n\nThe only downsides that I have seen are it's lenth.  I completed it in 45 minutes and half of that was trying to figure out what to do in the first chapter.  But for the price definately worth picking up!\n\nI recommend this game ten times over.  I will be following this developer for sure for any future titles that they come up with.","April 15","true","3.9"," 56 of 74 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","56","74","4","2"

This time around the game just has too many bugs, and the game play follows no path of logic that I know. After being ejected from the game about halfway all the remaining chapters were opened. I was able to see the remainder and the ending, and I don't even know what I may have missed.\n\nIf you do buy this game and play with a controller, be aware that the controller buttons were ALL wrong, referring specifically to keyboard keys. ("X" means "A".) From what I read the game is only about 20 minutes long. The hour I put in was an attempt to follow a questionable logic (and I wasn't alone.)\n\nThe music was nice.\n\nI'd rather not go any further, as the DEV seemed generally to be a decent person, and very attentive (except to bugs.)\n\nThank you.","April 16","false","1.0"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","0"

I think I cried longer then it actually took to beat the game. Never before have I had such drastic mood changes in a 20 minute period. Deer Man will create a sense of curiosity, strike fear in your heart, following it up with a feeling of understanding and sympathy, leading into anger, then back into fear. At then end you are guarenteed to cry.\n\nThats all a bit of an exaggeration, but on a serious note I really enjoed this game. Very worth the two dollars I paid for it. The atmosphere is reallly brought to life by the creative style and music. The message is actually very heart felt. I will be looking at the future works of this developer for sure. For anyone who likes cinematic and story driven indie games, I highly suggest trying it.

It's not. It is a short but powerful story about a hunter that dedicated his life to wildlife. Instead of rolling the frames, you're given a limited amount of freedom to decide where to go.\n\nWhile the story cuts down very early, I think you should jump into this game with the knowledge that it is more a call to action on its subject rather than being a 'game'. It's a interactive narrative experience, and for that it succeeds well at its low price.\n\nSo for the people that enjoy this kind of experience, this is a recommendation!","April 26","true","0.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I deinitally reccomend this to anyone that likes nature or animals. Though it has not much gameplay it still lets you expeirence a lot of emotions in the sitting. It's pretty easy to understand what you have to do in the game and it lets you adventure. There is a good amountof things you can find down paths and when you find what you were looking for it feels great. It got me really emotional while playing and I must say the voice during the game sounded awesome. I do admit that at one part I did get stuck or got frustrated that the game had started over from me making a mistake. Though those problems were just from me not realizing that I had to do something or go somewhere. I easily found out what I had to do after a little while.

It has not affected my overall opinion.\n\nThere is a lot that I like about Deer Man, and a lot that I don't. The positive and negative elements are woven together to make a back-and-forth, slightly confusing overall experience. I wasn't really sure of my opinion on this game until I took some time to think about it.\n\nDeer Man is roughly divided into two halves. In the first half, the player explores a section of woods for interactable items, and the second half is walking through linear set pieces. This is an interesting structure, since usually walking sims like Deer Man do one, or the other. I think this has a positive impact, but it means the strengths and weaknesses of the two parts are different, and must be analyzed individually.\n\nFirst off, the art is a mixed bag. The game uses an art style with smooth black-and-white assets evocative of silhouettes but with more detailed small objects. It's not particularly original, but it works well with the abstract storytelling here. The game does suffer from a lack of assets as a whole however. There are only two deer models, a stag and a fawn. This could be fine, but it contradicts a point in the game where a young fawn lays sadly next to its dying stag "mother." Secondly, I couldn't tell the difference between trees (assuming there IS more than one tree model), which caused a lot of problems with navigation, especially in the first half. Uniform trees and a short field of vision means that it is hard to find story hotspots unless you walk right into them. It means that I had to comb over the map like a grid, rather than exploring it like the mysterious forest it was supposed to be.\n\nThe navigation problem isn't solely because of the lack of assets, there is also some questionable level design. The open first half doesn't have much in the way of landmarks, and the story hotspots are a bit too spread out to have a real sense of organized progression through the level. Thankfully, the protagonist says a line whenever you're far away from a hotspot, meaning it's hard to get truly lost. The second half, while easier to navigate, is more linear than its design would suggest. In one set piece, the game spawned me facing the wrong way, and I quickly walked up to a floating sign that said essentially: "there is no content here." During this second half, I found myself accidentally walking the wrong way, or into invisible walls more frequently than is comfortable. Two of the interactive parts suffer from this problem as well. At one point you have to cross a frozen lake as it fractures into a maze, but invisible walls prevented me from crossing since I walked too far to the left. Immediately after, a herd of deer charge at you, but the area is so wide open that you can anticlimactically sidestep the entire herd. Overall, the levels could have used some more fine-tuning.\n\nThe story is the most interesting part of Deer Man. The first story event, Deer Man chasing you down, is positively delightful. You can outrun him for a very long time, and hiding from him and the subsequent ambush is very tense. After that though, the story runs into a few problems. First off, Deer Man tells you that he was originally a hunter, killing deer to provide for his family, and had a change of heart when he saw a sad fawn. Now instead of hunting, he attacks hunters. This is a contradiction, since Deer Man says that he didn't have enough food to survive without meat from deer. Did he let his family starve? If the shack in the woods is his, why is his wife's suitcase laying abandoned in the woods? This is a suspicious oversight. Secondly, the fact that the hunter that killed Deer Man was let off was surprising to me, but after some thought it made sense. Running around in a hunting area dressed in a deer costume would be considered borderline suicidal. It wouldn't be difficult to clear up that the hunter didn't intend to kill another human, although he may be traumatized because of it. Lastly, it seems strange that the protagonist would be so attached to Deer Man. He knew him for about a half hour, then he was promptly killed. I think most people would be disturbed by this memory, and would probably avoid forests from then on because of it. Instead, the protagonist has a quasi-religious experience, and is filled with a sense of wonder and love towards nature. It just seems a little unrealistic.\n\nI also want to mention that the politics of hunting are not as cut-and-dry as this game represents. Deer don't have many natural predators living in the wild anymore, so without hunters they would quickly overpopulate certain areas. When deer are overpopulated, they run out of food, mess with humans, and generally cause suffering within their own population. In the long run, responsible hunting actually benefits human and deer populations. This, combined with the problematic story elements would cause me to dislike this game story, IF it were actually about deer. However, if you look at the Steam page for this game, you can see that it is "Inspired from the wildlife, The Virunga National Park in Congo, where rangers are risking their lives to protect morning gorillas." When analyzing the game as a metaphor for poaching (very different from hunting), it suddenly makes a lot more sense. I can get behind this story as a narrative discouraging poaching, even if many of the elements don't translate properly.\n\nIn conclusion, I would hesitate to say that Deer Man is a great game within its genre, but it still has several positive qualities. The music and atmosphere is above average, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. There are a number of better free walking sims out there, but if you have played them already and are a nature lover, Deer Man is worth a couple bucks (deer puns LOL).","April 23","true","0.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I really liked the minimalistic approach and the overall aesthetics of the game, and I would recommend playing it purely for that.\n\nOn the other hand, the story was a bit lacking. It was too overly simple and I didn't feel like I got much out of it, but for the price, I guess it's fair. I just wished it had a bit more to it, more to explore, more to learn, so that I can really immerse myself into the game. Although it's open-world, it's still very limited and there's little to explore besides the story line, and even the parts relating to the story was very brief. There's so much potential to this game, I would love to stay in the world for much longer but there just wasn't enough to go on.\n\nAll in all, good game for the price and the atmosphere, but need more work.","April 20","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's too confusing to figure out what to do and where to go. There are 2 points in the game that if you make one mistake, you have to start the whole chapter again. There is nothing continuing to explain what the deal is with your uncle, the leg sticking out from the grave, and Emily. Also, the ending felt very rushed and the character's motives at the end are very rushed and kind of lame.

Some plot elements feel like they come out of nowhere because of little development, and others seem to go nowhere, feeling hardly connected to the story at all. The world is tiny, and the game suffers for it. While the atmosphere is nice, a game this reliant on story needs better plot development and more substance than a campfire story.","May 16","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm sorry, but there's just no other way of putting it.\nYou might as well go into McDonalds and shout "You're eating a once living, breathing animal!", and it's free.\nNot only is the game < 40 minutes for 2-3 euros, but it's pretty broken as well. For example, I once fell into a small river, wondering if I could get there, but I couldn't get back up.\nOh, and it's riddled with unfinished ideas, like the clothes in the woods, the painting "puzzle" and the Emily character.\nThe one single positive thing about this game other than the mini-story is the art. But looking at it more and more even that cute black and white minimalistic art is unfinished.\ntl;dr 5/10, Would rather read an essay about it or something.

Sadly I can't so I'm getting a refund and hopefully warning you guys to stay away from this terrible game. People are saying the environments nice and stuff but its just a snow white ground and the same colored trees throughout the game. I guess you could call it an A E S T H E T I C. Anyway the plot is just as thin and badly thought out as a 20 minute game can get. I can sum up the game in like three sentences. You find deer man, he tells you a story about how he became deer man because he shot a deer who had a baby, so now he fights hunters. You follow deer man to fight a hunter, and he gets shot. You then become deer man for some reason??? The plot really doesn't make sense. You know absolutely nothing about the narrator other then the fact that hes out for a jog. He doesn't seem like hes lost, or loves nature or anything. And then he just gives up everything for these deer? Like it makes absolutely no sense. And then that is the end of the game. Thankfully this game didn't last for over an hour because I can give it back now and get my money back.\nTLDR version: The graphics are meh, the story is terrible, and the game is short. Don't Buy this under any circumstances.","June 5","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
