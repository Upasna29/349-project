"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/recommended/283820/","PURESEXCELLENCY","Squire Grooktook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/","360 products in account","Kamui is the first title released in the "Tales of Alltynex" trilogy, a trio of 2d shoot em ups focusing on cinematic presentation, offbeat gameplay mechanics, and a strange and melancholy storyline about planetary warfare and rogue super computers.\n\nIn Kamui, players have access to a standard machine gun for destroying hordes of small enemies, a homing attack which only hits distant enemies attacking from the background, and a powerful beam weapon that focuses damage on a single target and nullifies enemy fire. The last two weapons are dependent on a recharging energy meter that must be carefully managed, because running out of energy can result in being overwhelmed. Destroying enemies with a charged homing attack also awards greater points, but requires players to leave dangerous enemies alive for longer and find perfect timings to blast them all, forcing mastery of the mechanics to achieve high scores.\n\nI find these mechanics give Kamui a sense of chaos. Not only do players need to dodge and shoot the usual enemy formations and attack patterns found in shoot em ups, but they also need to be careful of enemies in the background and simoultaneously juggle three weapons with precise use. Beyond the mechanics, the game's actual execution of stage and boss design is refreshingly unique. Kamui has a slightly larger hitbox than most bullet hell shooters and an emphasis on agressive enemies and bosses with quirky attacks that go beyond the usual bullet ballets of the genre. The chaos and agression combine to give Kamui a very visceral feel.\n\nThere are drawbacks to Kamui's design choices, though. At times, the bullet cancelling beam dominates the game a bit too much, turning evasion into a matter of simple timing and placement instead of complex manuevering, reflex, or strategy. Playing for score alleviates this somewhat, forcing you to hold off on cancelling some attacks, but I still wish pure survival play wasn't as simplistic. I also don't like the vast amount of health players are given. The difficulty is balanced around it, but the sheer amount of life points the player has means that no matter how bad you do on any one stage, you're pretty much guaranteed not to die till at least the next stage, removing some of the tension from the game's first half.\n\nHowever, when its playstyle clicks in the end game, Kamui truly shines. The last three stages offer one of the most intense and memorable climaxes in the genre, and the intensely visceral action throughout generally make up for some minor issues. For those looking for something a little different, Kamui is an excellent change of pace from shooting game norms.","December 28, 2014","true","20.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","27","29","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stargoat/recommended/283820/","Stargoat","Stargoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stargoat/","513 products in account","Great game, one of the best SHMUPS I've ever played. If you're familiar with Layer Section/Gunlock/Raystorm, then you'll have some sort of idea of what to expect with Kamui.\n\nAs with Layer Section, the gameplay is split into two layers, the plane you're on, and everything beneath you. On your plane, you can shoot a machinegun-like weapon and a  powerful laser that uses energy, but also destroys enemy bullets. On the layers beneath you, you can attack enemies with a lock-on lightning weapon - this can be used to destroy or damage enemies before they become a threat, or attack enemies shooting you from below.\n\nThe more you use the bullet-soaking beam, however, the less energy you have for the lightning attack, so it's a double-edged sword. This makes the gameplay significantly about energy management in the short term (as you do recharge quite quickly). The scoring system ties in to this, as kills with the lighting attack recieve a multiplier.\n\nGameplay aside, it's a nifty little game with an amazing soundtrack - and while the graphics are a bit dated, they're well made; there are really neat parallax and explosion effects to see.\n\nIf you like shmups, check out Kamui. It's a good'n.","December 11, 2014","true","7.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

I have done a little research on this one, as I buy these Japanese titles a lot and usually have no idea what they are about.\n\nSo Kamui was originally released some 15 years ago as a SHUMP for the Japanese PC doujin community. The game is actually part of the Alltynex trilogy [http://alltynex.com/] with Kamui being the third game in the trilogy, but strangely enough the first one that was released to market.. go figure.\n\nAs a SHUMP it has the standard waves of enemies in a bullet-hell type environment. Using a combination of your weapons (which includes a lighting gun - which IMHO looks really cool when you fire it), power-ups and kill-streak combo(s) you can really rack up some high scores.\nWhat I personally really like the is UNLIMITED continues so that people like me can actually finish the game.\n\nIt would appear that the game is the same as it was 15 years ago, with additional graphic and audio tweaks that bring the game in 2015 - so the DEVs should be proud of keeping the games originality intact while accessing some modern capabilities.\n\nI picked it up in a Groupees bundle, but would have happily paid full price for it.\n\nlike SHUMPS? get it.\n","September 10, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

I wouldn't really call it a Bullet Hell; the bullet count and speed are far more tilted towards the likes of Gradius than Mushihimesama or DoDonPachi, but nevermind that. This is a fast-paced shmup in which you have three weapons: the normal machinegun, which is rather underpowered; a screen-clearing shower of targeted lightning that only hits enemies on the plane below you; and shooting both at once releases a huge forward laser that clears bullets, deals ginormous damage and will be your best bet to survive the fiercer bullet spams. Both lightning attacks deplete a 'Lightning' gauge, but the lightning shower can be spammed even if your gauge is empty (though you'll get far less points per enemy destroyed).\n\nKamui is moderately hard, though you shouldn't feel discouraged, as the game offers infinite credits (though a 1 credit clear challenge is there if you feel like it, and it's bloody hard). Clocking in at about 30 minutes per run, I'd say the $8 price tag is slightly salty, though the game is VERY replayable and definitely very good. If you can get it on a sale (or a Humble Bundle, as has happened in the past), it's a no-brainer.","March 2, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It originally came out in 1999, but the gameplay stands up to the test of time. Initially I was concerned when I launched the game because the default display settings had the game so small, I found it hard to see all the bullets. They do provide a configuration utility which you can use to adjust the settings to your liking, which fixed the aformentioned issue I was having.\n\nThe game consists of six levels with multiple difficulty settings, with each taking about 5 minutes to complete. If you're the kind of shmup player who just likes to tear through shooters, you'll like that the game provides unlimited continues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roger_muppet/recommended/283820/","roger_muppet","roger_muppet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roger_muppet/","298 products in account","Yea!\n\nThis game is cool, as are all Alltynex games. Pretty difficult - but it's fun to play even if you fly the first level 20-100 times. Never gets old - and is fun to play even when you lose.\n\nGraphics/Technical:\nGraphics are... well they are good in the way they are done - but comparing to todays standards sub-par. The fact that it only supports a 800x600 resolution which is then stretched (to fit your vertical resolution) does not help much. Also the game only takes up 1/10th of your screen, when you are playing on a 16:9 monitor because the aspect ratio is locked in 4:3 and even then puts borders inside the 4:3 screenspace! There is an option to flip the display by 90° which lets you play sideways - yet sadly this does not enlarge anything. In fact it does nothing but confuse the crap out of you if you ever played the game normally. What a shame, because the game uses like something close to 16:9 flipped by 90 degrees. But these are technical problems due to the fact that the engine is badly optimized for today's standards. Essentially the graphics are great if you take it down to 16bit-era or more likely 32-bit era standards. They are "Aesthetic" and the explosions do satisfy (because this word has been getting the hype recently - like gamers never knew what looks good or something...!..!).\n\nSound:\nThe music is, well... just as the graphics, oldschool. It's something better than MIDI but not quite much more. The soundtrack is great though. Fast paced music that makes you want to dodge those bullets and shoot everything down. The music is an essential part of the game, like in "Wipeout", "Olliolli" or "Need for Speed: The force unleashed", which - to me - is proof of good sounddesign in the music department. Without the music, the game would be like 33% less fun. Yea, i can do maths with fun. The sound design itself is fairly decent as well, gunshots and explosions - there isn't much to differ anyways - it gets the job done.  It's even in stereo! Idk if the stereo applies if you flip the game by 90° though, maybe your speakers start flipping as well. If you dislike the music, for whatever reason, put some Yngwie Malmsteen on. He is just about as much over-the-top as this game is to fit in there nicely.\n\nGameplay:\nWell, why put up with all this oldschool ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? I mean i play this game not to be cool or retro or oldschool or anything. But yea it makes me feel cool. Like a real badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's hard, yea. It's bullethell - or whatever they declared it to attract those niche shoot 'em up pros incarcerated in the nineties trying to blast their way out. But there's like nothing better than a good SHMUP! Like seriously. It's like therapy. It's just you, nearly infinite enemies and bullets to dodge, and your trusty little ship with the ability to shoot infinite bullets - fly the ♥♥♥♥ all over the place and shoot rockets and freaking laserbeams across the whole screen (which is like only 1/10th of your screen, mind), all without having to collect powerups in this one! But yea, there are powerups to broaden the firing arc of your main gun. Also i think there are unlimited continues - as i managed to "die" myself thru in the first playthrough (and i'm not a real hero, more like a shmup up). Which took like only 30-90 minutes, i can't tell, it was freaking short. But that's not what it is about, it is about perfecting the levels and memorizing every last freaking bullet. There's only 5 or 6 levels i think, but beating the game using continues is like running across the field from left to right in FIFA Soccer 199X - that's not the point. Well yea it is the point - but it's the point to do it flawlessly. So if you're a perfectionist, but not a "collector" and not an "explorer" or a "grinder" - but a real man that loves to master skills and kick asses with the crap he's got - then this game is for you. Controller support is good enough (xbox360 wireless). I love every pixel of this game!\n\nStory:\nMind stories in arcade-video games?! If you are expecting anything here, forget it. The world design in itself is coherent. The visuals make sense in the scenario imposed. It is all "canon" for whatever that may account. But the story is like only a skeleton. It's just "oooh terrible ♥♥♥♥ has occured, kill everyone and fix it." - that's fine by me! If i want story, i read a book, play baldurs gate or listen grandpa.\n\nConclusion:\nMy playtime is low (somedude in the back: "excuses!" and leaves) - that is due to the fact that i got "the tale of alltynex" compilation and play the titles in rotation. All in all the games are similar in gameplay quality, though different enough to switch over to when one of the titles has siphoned your concentration and endurance. Luckily in graphics quality the titles have improved over the years - Alltynex Second is actually in 2.5D and technically quite sophisticated compared to this one. I suggest getting the whole package, i'm sure you can spend well over 20hrs with them altogether - and that is the case even if you give up before you actually turn into anything near-pro. Well i know i will be spending 20hrs with the titles for sure - and i tend to get bored of stuff very quickly. Also the games, in core, never feel old. SHMUPS never die!\n\nThe technical problems mentioned subtract nothing from the masochistic pleasure this title provides. Clear recommendation for anybody on the look for true gaming. You know... like people who are sick of Third-Person-Stealth-Action-Roguelike-Sandbox-RPGs with climbing elements.\n\n8/10, because Yngwie Malmsteen is not a number and it isn't funny anymore!","March 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Especially if you are a big BIG fan games like Rayforce which is very reminisent of this game. Every bit of the game reminds me of Rayforce and Raystom from the lock-on system to the graphics itself! The graphics itself isn't great by today standards but wounderfully replicated the effects and graphics rayforce had back then. I would only recomend this game to fellow shmup fans and players out there especially the softcore ones who played games simmilar to Rayforce and other not so maniac bullet hell shooters. oh, and if you played Thunder Force V and digging it's music like me, this game will be a treat! The game uses the same PCM instruments used in Thunder Force V! I believe it's the same instruments and I love that they did that. This game brings back old 90's Shmup nostalgia to me. I wish I still have a copy of Thunder Force V and a fully functioning raystom PCB cabinet. Hopefully steam would be brining these great shmup titles like those I said earlier.","December 27, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fans of this style of games will be pleased with this game while new fans or someone interested in this might buy it on a sales price.

It has great visuals and shooting mechanics like the rest of the series and is pretty tough, although this one has an option for unlimited credits (it's the only game in the series with that to my knowledge). Like the others, it's a great entry into the genre and if you enjoy this type of game, you'll love KAMUI.","May 24","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
