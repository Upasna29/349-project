The game is a lot of fun, and most likely what you're looking for.\nHowever, if you actually care about the PC as a gaming platform, and how it is treated by some publishers, then you might want to sit this one out.\n\nLook at the screenshots in the gallery above. You see the texture quality, the lighting and visual effects such as ambient occlusion? Not there. The nice fire and ice effects on characters? Not there. You see the rain in two of the screenshots? Not even close to that weird effect that's actually in the game.\n\nThe reason for this? It's a straight PS3 port. A port of a version that was made for a console almost a decade old.\n\nWhen you look at this comparison  http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/140253 (hover with the cursor on the picture to see the PC version), you may think that the game actually looks decent enough to enjoy it. And I totally agree with this! But I do wonder why the PC has to get the inferior PS3 port? I mean, it's almost 2016, and one might think that we've actually moved away from this practice. Especially since many PS4/XboxOne games don't even get PS3/360 versions anymore.\n\nWhat's even worse, is that Bandai Namco had several months to actually communicate that PC is getting the PS3 version, but instead they chose to not say anything and advertise with PS4 footage.\n\nAmongst others, I initially gave Bandai the benefit of the doubt, and believed that the graphic settings are bugged and locked at the lowest settings, since changing them does absolutely nothing(except for draw distance and enemy density), but it seems that they're supposed to not do anything, since the game is locked at PS3 graphics...\n\nThe game is also missing the online co-op that's included in the console versions. When asked on twitter for a reason, or if they would consider including it in an update, Bandai simply responded with: "It was stated on Steam that the online mode would not be included :)" Make of that what you will. The port also doesn't have cloud saves, so you better copy your savefile manually when uninstalling...\n\n\nNow this is the problem with Steam's rating system. I have to decide between two options. If it were for the game itself, as it is across all platforms, I'd totally give a thumbs up, just like other people who are glad that the game is on PC. But the false advertising on the store page, the missing communication from Bandai, and general quality of the port (bugs like missing textures/effects, crashes), simply keep me from doing so. I have to make a choice between fan and consumer here, and the consumer wins. I missed my chance to refund it, but you might wanna think twice about supporting this port, and Koei Tecmo's practices.\n\nEdit: Half a year later and there hasn't been a single patch. Effects are still broken for many characters.  Here's an example of Marco's body disappearing when in Phoenix form. And this happens with ALL characters with transformation, be it Ace, Sabo, Aokiji, Smoker etc.","August 29, 2015","false","51.3"," 1,310 of 1,581 people (83%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","83","310","1","52","37"

Yet, Namco kept saying on their facebook and twitter feed that the game should be on par with the PS4.\n2: Most of the Logia characters currently have issues such as missing major parts of their models.\n3: Keyboard prompts when using a controller? Seriously? Koei, you had controller prompts for Toukiden, why not here?\n4: Missing some of the most basic effect filter, like Taishigi's Taunt which should make the screen blurry, but instead reduces the brightness by like 5-10%?????\n5: Crashes on laptop GPUs\n6: Graphic options do nothing aside very minimal barely noticeable changes.\n\nAt this point, a week after release, Namco has been completely silent on all of these.  The only answers they gave are on a one on one basis, saying "We're investigating".\n\nStill no public announcement about why the quality of the game is bordeline VITA level instead of the promised PS4 quality ( I could live with PS3 level).  Furthermore, their so called community team seems to do everything in the power to make it seem like the PC version doesn't even exists.  They don't talk about it anymore, they ignore all questions regarding it.\n\nIt's Namco's job as publisher to answer to these things, not shove it under the rug.  At this point I canceled both my Zestiria pre-order, and Samurai Warriors 4-II until I get an answer on this.\n\nHow is it that small devs like Idea Factory, Ghostlight, XSeed can patch their games multiple time in a week after release, talk to people on the steam forums, and at least ANSWER questions.  While the bigger guys like Namco just do nothing at all.\n\nThey're asking AAA price for this game, but gives one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest support available, it's like the world in reverse.\n\nSept 27th Update: Today marks a full month since release, still no patches, fixes, or even any kind of public announcements.","September 5, 2015","false","78.4"," 334 of 425 people (79%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","79","334","425","19","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dhoom/recommended/331600/","Dhoom","Dhoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dhoom/","665 products in account","UPDATE: Apparently, the graphics are locked at a lower level than they should be, and Namco-Bandai are looking into the issue. Hopefully this means that the port will only continue to improve, and eventually reach PS4-level material. In response to some comments over multiple resolutions, there are a wide range but they dont exceed 1080p. Expect to use Nvidia DSR or the AMD Equivilant to get your 4k fix, if thats even possible (haven't tested), myself.\n\nLets get this over with, this is a Koei Tecmo game. Meaning the port is awful, right? Well, for once, no.\n\nFirst, this game is designed around a controller. Expect to use one, or suffer greatly. The control prompts are locked to PC keys, and the control types are a bit weird, but a controller is still highly reccomended, simply due to the ease-of-access that the right analog camera controls bring, among other things.\n\nSecondly, this game's framerate is variable between 30 and 60, but for the most part stays at 60 for me. Considering my cpu and gpu are quite high end (stronger than the PS4) if not old (i5 3570k and GTX 670), the game runs very well, and appears to use low cpu and gpu usage, making it suitable for weaker rigs. The options menu, while sparse, is fine, and for the most part the port seems pretty good. Graphically, the game is not a stunner, but none of Koei's games are so dont expect anything above the PS4 port of the game.\n\nThirdly, this is a  Dynasty Warriors game with a One Piece Skin., meaning youre going to bash and whack and cut and smack and burn and otherwise kill thousands of enemies over the course of a single stage. Tecmo Koei's main strength is their fanservice and from what I've played, it's top of the line. Of course, you should be a fan of One Piece in General if you plan to get this game, and if not, I can't advise getting it, but if youre trying to get into the series (which is very long), then this game is a great place to start. It covers up to almost the most recent arc, and does a great job so-far of condensing over 700 chapters and 600 episodes into one video game.\n\nFourth and finally, This game can be repetitive, but its great fun with its large cast of One Piece characters and amazing fanservice. Oda's legacy is well-represented in a better-than expected PC port.\n\nTL;DR\nUse a controller\nGreat Port\nLooks serviceable\nOne Piece Fanservice is off the charts\n\nWould reccomend.","August 27, 2015","true","1.7"," 319 of 431 people (74%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","74","319","431","21","27"

Join Luffy and everyone you know fight through the story all the way to Dressrosa. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nYou are Monkey D. Luffy, the man who’s going to become the pirate king! You can choose to play the main story, a free log mode where you can select any character, or play dream logs. The combat is fun, fluent and will make any One Piece fan happy as hell. I have played around 32 hours so far and I still have a lot to do. The combos are swift and the team attacks are fun to use. You will unlock more characters as you play and a leveling system is present with characters. Different combos lead to different team attacks and so on. Honestly it's a blast to play through.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nSo the graphics are not realistic, but that’s the point. The art style stays true to One piece and perfectly recaptures the One Piece story arc. The voice acting is great and the cinematic scenes are awesome. The music fits perfectly with every moment and I may or may not have cried at some moments. Graphics and the sound mix perfectly to create an authentic One Piece game which stays true to its roots. There is a problem right now which limits the game's graphics, hopefully this will be fixed soon. There are actually multiple problems existing with logia users.\n\nDoes it stay true to One Piece?\nAs I have said before, this game perfectly captures the essence of One Piece. If you have watched the show or are a fan you will not be disappointed. This is the first time I played this game series (because I don't own a Playstation 3 or 4) and I cried at how well this retold everything in some moments. I relived this series and kicked butt while doing it. The combat shows all the popular moves from Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Nami, etc. The character rooster is a perfect size (for me at least). If you are a fan of One Piece don't worry you will almost definitely enjoy this game.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Retells the One Piece storyline\n+ Graphics are perfect for One Piece (they should just fix the graphics bug ASAP)\n+ Good sized character rooster with favorites\n+ Leveling system\n+ Great campaign\n+ Free logs and Dream logs for even more fun\n+ Combat is fluent\n+ Cinematic scenes are amazing along with the voice acting\n\nCons\n\n- Horrible optimization for the keyboard controls\n- Controller buttons are not shown making it a guessing game to figure out your attacks at first\n- Certain small things in the storyline are non-canon\n- Large graphics problem existing within the game right now (hopefully fixed soon)\n- ♥♥♥♥ support from developers\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI am a huge One Piece fan (I have watched every episode to date) and I am so happy to have played this game. The release to steam surprised me and I got everything I wanted and more. This game made me remember those amazing moments One Piece has had and why I love the show as much as I do. I loved the combat and I can’t wait to continue playing!\n\nTL;DR\nOne Piece Pirate Warriors 3 is the first in the series to leave its home on the Playstation system. The combat is great and the game really does feel as if you're playing through One Piece. It stays true to everything you know and the addition of free log, dream log, a leveling system, and a decent character rooster. You should have a controller to play this or you will regret it severely as the optimization for the keyboard controls are horrible to say the least. The buttons for controller are not displayed at first and will make you guess for a short while before you get the hang of it.Currently there sadly is a graphics glitch which is very annoying to some players. Overall this game is the perfect thing for One Piece fans to get with its visuals, music, gameplay, characters, and voice acting. However I would only recommend it to fans.","August 28, 2015","true","57.2"," 173 of 225 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","173","225","14","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtarlton/recommended/331600/","jtarlton","jt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtarlton/","1410 products in account","Overall 8/10\nOne of the best Warriors games on PC. Warriors games are like cheap Chinese food: they shouldn't be good but they're incredibly satisfying, and this is no exception.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nTecmo-Koei graphics. Characters look good, environments are spare, textures mediocre. This one's cell-shaded, and less brown than DW or SW.\n\nSound 7/10\nJapanese-only audio, but they seem to have fixed the screaming baby enemies from other Warriors games.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nGreat hack-n-slash gameplay, enough combos to be interesting but not so many you get lost.\n\nBalance 8/10\nDoesn't feel unfair, but still satisfying. No rage-quitting.\n\nPlayer Investment 8/10\nLots of unlockable characters, costumes, moves, etc. Keeps you interested.\n\nLoyalty to Source Material ?/10\nNo idea, don't care.\n\nDetails:\nI've seen maybe 15 minutes of the One Piece anime in my life, and never read the manga, but I thought I'd try this since I love Warriors games. It's pretty great, but let me run through a quick synopsis for you:\n\nYou run around large open battlefields obliterating everything in your path with a selection of two-button combos and ultimate moves. This is the usual Dynasty/Samurai Warriors gameplay formula. In this case the battlefields and characters are all drawn from One Piece, which necessaruly makes them cartoony and somewhat ridiculous. OPPW3 makes heavy use of in-game objectives to keep the battles a bit more interesting than your standard DW title, but not as frantic and stressful as Samurai Warriors 4-II. Warriors games are all about gameplay, not about graphics, and that's obvious in-game.\n\nAs always with a Warriors game there's a healthy number of playable characters to unlock, all with different movesets. You'll notice I've played for something like 17 hours and still haven't unlocked five or six of them. Not that they're impossible, but they take work to get.\n\nThe game's divided into three modes: Legend, Free, and Dream.\nLegend is a series of battles that (I assume) follow the story of the franchise and unlock a lot of the major characters along the way.\nFree mode lets you replay any stages from Legend mode with different characters.\nDream mode lets you work your way through a bunch of battles, unlocking occasional characters (mostly villains) along the way. These characters can only unlock in Legend mode, as far as I'm aware.\n\nCharacters level up, as in other Warriors games, but also require the use of coins to improve specific stats further. These coins are acquired each time you beat an enemy, but only for that enemy. Some rare coins require fulfilling certain objectives, like getting so many S rank stats in a battle, or winning battles with certain characters. This system works surprisingly well and will keep you going back to battles to get rare coins needed to level up your favorite characters.\n\nI've been playing this game with an Xbox One controller, which works great with one exception: Many menus act like the right trigger is pulled and scroll to the bottom. Holding the left trigger halfway down balances this and lets you scroll as normal, but you have to hold the trigger the exact right amount. This mostly happens in the shop and skill menus, so it's not going to keep you from getting to the right mode or anything, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nGreat game, and I recommend it. If you love Warriors games it's probably worth full price, but if you're not sure I'd wait until it's on sale.","January 4","true","22.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","0"

I play with my XBOX One controller, and had no problems setting it up cause everything was set up by default for the controller. But the down side of it is that the controls are written for general controllers, so the X button was the button no. 1 and the A button the no. 2 (I don't really recall the numbers), but in the end it was pretty easy to understand which button did what.\n\nTo finish let's talk about gameplay.\nThe game is pretty straight to you, every thing is explained to you, the missions, what you're supposed to do, when and where. The combo moves are quite funny and easy to do.\nThere are 3 game modes:\n- Legend Log, where you play the main story with the crew characters, when Zoro enters the crew you can use it instead of Luffy, and when Usopp does you can switch it too.\n- Free Log, where you can play the chapters from the main story but with whoever you feel like playing. For instance you can play Buggy in the Prologue to save Zoro.\n- Dream Log, this is where it gets funny. You choose a character, for instance I chose Robin, and you navigate the grand line from island to island. In each island you are given two random allies (in my first I had Law & Chopper, in my 2nd I had Jabra and a Lapahn) and you have two Bosses to defeat in that island. In the end you can advance trough the islands and you get epic encounter (for example in my 3rd island I've to fight Ace).\n\nFrom what I've played, I can say the game it's pretty good, awesome gameplay, great combos, but a little bit repetitive.\nAwesome game for the fans of the series (anime/manga) and even for those who never thought about watching it. If you have friends and they never felt like watching One Piece, this game is awesome to start them up.\n\n\n8/10","August 27, 2015","true","23.7"," 85 of 124 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","85","124","9","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messydreamer/recommended/331600/","messydreamer","The Fun Ends Here","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messydreamer/","185 products in account","A great game, but I can really only recommend to One Piece fans\nPirate Warriors 3 is, as you can tell, the third game in the Pirate Warriors musou (Dynasty Warrior reskin) games for the anime/manga franchise One Piece.  One Piece in its self is a fantastic series with superb writing (compared to most Shonen works) and the games try their hardest to cater to those fans.\n\nPROS\n\nLots of great little touches from the series\n37 characters to play as from the series (Including characters from the Dressrosa Arc).\nThe max level is 50, but you can break the limit to raise it to Lv. 100, with even bigger movesets.\nAside from story mode, there's Dream Log, which allows for more gameplay as well as unlocking more characters.\nAnd beyond that is the Nightmare Log, which showcases a map of Lv. 100 enemies\nScratches that itch whenever Oda goes on break.\nCONS\n\nQuite repetitive (especially early on)\nStory is there, but it doesn't really present it with the drama and weight of the original series (I suggest reading the series if you're curious)\nGraphics and other things are locked off at a pretty low level, and i had to poke around on the Community Hub as well as the games' files to get it to a near PS4 level of graphic fidelity\nControllers sort of work (PS3 controllers unsurprisingly work the best, albeit with some hiccups) and Xbox controllers work as well, but might require another program to fix it.\nStory Mode has lots of annoying interruptions for scripted events, so you can lose your Kizuna gauge if activated before said event, not to mention it breaks immersion.\nIN BETWEEN\n\nAudio is in Japanese, though Text is in English.  I put this here because I prefer it, but others might not like it.\nSome of the characters have mediocre movesets and some of the good characters (like Aokiji/Kuzan) have been nerfed to a point of being somewhat mediocre, though it might depend on how you play. Also the female characters are somewhat underpowered.  [Edit (3-28-16): The movesets improve after breaking the level limit (going beyond lv 50), but that might take a bit of time]\nCoins are required to break the max levels and raise the level cap from 50 to 100, but a good many are random and it can be very tedious unlocking the right coins via chance, or just limit breaking the worst characters.  (All the good ones, Whitebeard, Shanks, Luffy, and Doflamingo to name a few require a coin that can only be unlocked after getting an S rank on all 50 or so missions in the Dream Log, so yeah).  Very tedious\nPirate Warriors 3 is a great service to One Piece fans, and possibly Dynasty Warrior fans who are curious about the strange and whimsical world of One Piece, but I'd warn anyone else to be wary.  It also helps to be a fan of the series to know which characters are good for crowd control and which aren't, among other things.  Other than that, I can recomend this game.","January 24","true","159.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

The keyboard controls are just horrible.\nThe graphics have a bug currently, That the graphic settings are all stuck at low/medium even if you turn it to high quality.\nSo my advice is that you wait until Bandai fixes the problem, And then buy it for the full experience.\nAlthough, If you don't care about the graphics ((kinda like me)) then buy it, I've been playing the game nonstop and it's so much fun.\nI will update my review to recommended as soon as they fix the bug ((Although knowing koei that bug might have been intended, and not even a bug))\nIf you decide to buy it, Download a SweetFX mod, Makes the game look more like the PS4 version.\nhttps://vozforums.com/showpost.php?p=79992150&postcount=242\n\nEDIT: Sigh.\nSeems they just want to push this game under the carpet of their lies, It's been more than 2 months already and they didn't even care to release one little patch.\nBandai always says that Koei hasn't contacted them about this yet, But after two months you pretty much know that's a lie and they don't give a ♥♥♥♥.\nAll in all, It's a ♥♥♥♥ port that only works performance wise, I'm sure the game would barely handle 30 fps if it was actually PS4 graphics with this port.\n\nConclusion: Buy if you're a massive One Piece fan and/or don't care about the graphics, and gameplay might get a bit repetetive so keep that in mind, Or maybe you just love the Dynasty Warriors style of games.","August 28, 2015","false","73.8"," 71 of 115 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","71","115","3","0"

There's also an edited part elaborating this in the bottom.\n\nSo let's get something straight. Koei Tecmo and Bandai Namco were heavily flooded with hate-speech regarding the disability of the "ps4" (which was in fact a port not even as good as the ps3 version) port. A lot of the negative ratings are based solely on the quality of the port for the PC. Basically, for the newer people who have not been following this frustrating story, Koei Tecmo advertised One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 (via trailers and similar) to look as good as the Playstation 4 release. A lot of gamers were overjoyed and hyped for the game release. Upon release, it was realized to be a very, very terrible port. The gameplay was depressing. Lots of visual bugs; Graphics quality locked to <~30 FPS; followed by very common cuts, crashes and similar.\n\nDisclaimer: The below paragraph is not 100% certain as I've stated already & is based on my personal experience with the game, but some people still don't read, so I'll implement it here as well.\nI believe that the locks were removed and that some type of silent hotfix came through. The game is no longer locked to <~30 FPS as it was before (for me). No need to check the 30FPS or even 60 FPS options within the Settings in the game; it will vary on its own depending on your PC's settings, up to 60 FPS without any issues. The graphical bugs still persist, but very, very rarely (as some of my friends have stated). Personally, I've had no issues.\n\nThe gameplay of One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 is (from a subjective perspective, of course) superb. You have the opportunity to play a very wide variety of characters (including any of your favorite protagonists or antagonists alike). You may level them to their initial cap of Level 50. After doing and collecting the Level Breaker Coins, you can increase a specific character's level cap to Level 100. The game offers various difficulties. From the Campaign/Story mode, you may play Easy, Medium & Hard (+ you may unlock Super Hard). Similar to the Dream Log (which in my eyes has some great maps and pushes some great stories in front). After clearing everything (via S ranks) you may also unlock Nightmare Log, which is Dream Log's Super Hard difficulty (recommended for Level 100). Quite a lot of things to do in the game. Can keep you busy for a solid month at least.\n\nIn a nutshell (from a subjective perspective of a One Piece fan who enjoys Dynasty Warriors:\n\nCharacteristics        Score               Graphics        10/10               Sound        10/10               Gameplay        10/10               Overall Score        10/10\nI definitely recommend this game to any fan of One Piece or Dynasty Warriors.\nThank You for reading and enjoy playing.\nEDIT - 20.05.2016: Some people are thoroughly negative regarding my review, so I guess I could add that as to pose a more objective approach. Namely, they've stated that the game had not ever been patched (as there is no public notice I presume) and that there are lots of other issues, including graphic ones.\nAs I've answered them, I will share the reply here as well. I can only PERSONALLY negate their statements regarding graphic issues as I've never PERSONALLY had any of these issues.\n\nHas a patch or a hotfix occured? I personally believe that there probably has been a silent hotfix. Why? Because I've yet to come across any visual bugs or issues. Perhaps some people still have them, so it might not be the case. However I still stand for my own, subjective approach considering the things stated above within this paragraph. I cannot make a 100% guarantee regarding it, but I can firmly state that I believe it to be so because my game runs fine, with a very lousy (for nowadays' standards) pc configuration.\n\nWish you all the best.","May 2","true","89.6"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","32","46","0","10"

I held my breath on instant purchase since I don't really know much on what defines a good or bad game port, but it felt like my worries were pointless. Or perhaps, I've been really, really lucky.\n\nFirst of all, I've been a fan of the One Piece series for years. This can be looked upon as a biased review, or not. I've followed the discussions for quite a while, and I see that many are having problems. As aforementioned, I'm simply lucky and have not met any problems yet. Game runs fine for me; no controller and saving problems, and as far as I've ran the game for, there hasn't been any noticeable bugs or glitches that has caught my attention. Well, other than the fact that the characters' arms have a weird shading from possibly bad graphics. Thought I'd mention my personal grudge, but AIs don't really lend a hand in certain parts of the game when you really need help from. Graphics are the least of my concerns, and the game itself is of repetitive gameplay. I find the difficulty of the game rather balanced, though this is really my first DW kind of game.\n\nFrankly speaking, I stopped watching the anime at the start of the Dressarosa arc because I got lazy, and I never managed to get myself to sit down and read the massive amount of manga chapters. This game serves as a good recollection of the main events that happened in the adventures of the crew and I love it. The story still makes me cry sometimes (*sniff* Marineford *sniff*) and I find the game to be truly a fascinating and entertaining experience in itself. I'd totally recommend getting it if you're a fan of One Piece and is willing to give such a genre a chance to shine in your hands. Or at least, according to the forums, I'd pray you luck.","August 31, 2015","true","102.2"," 44 of 71 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","44","71","3","1"

The frame rate is stuck at 59FPS along with multiple controller issues for a huge amount of players.\n\nWhat is so surprising is that there are people who are actually in support of this scummy practice of false advertising.

Let's hope the modding community saves us all. Come on, Koei didn't even bother adding controller button guides for controller users, they might ''think'' because it's PC we all use keyboard and whatnot... Ridiculous, they probably don't care for the PC gamers.\n\n\n\nThis game has been pretty fun so far. As a One Piece fan I would love to recommend this game, but this port does not deserve possitive ratings for the lazy job that Koei did.\n\nThe gameplay is a 7/10. Simple controls and combos, but it sure is fun beating the crap out of hundreds of enemies in front of you :). The difficulty could be much better imo. I would love it if boss fights actually made me feel like my life was on the line. Boss fights are simply all about button mashing and dodging a few attacks. Naruto games have decent challenging bosses sometimes, they could take an example from that.\n\nGraphics... I give it a 7/10, but they could be a 8-9/10 if they didn't mess up: This is the no.1 thing that makes me and many people rate this game as negative. From what I've seen and heard the graphics are a straight up ps3 port, which shouldn't be that bad, but come on, PC is boundless when it comes to games. Consoles are restricted by their hardware forever, PCs upgrade/improve constantly. So why did they not give us the ''PS4'' graphics? I call this a lazy port.\n\nStory, 9/10. Whether you know One Piece or not, I think the game does an impressive job of telling you what goes on and why, without going too much into detail. For the lengthy story of One Piece, I think they nailed it at story telling.\n\nSoundtrack/Voice, 9/10. Voice actors are the same as the anime (japanese voice) which is amazing, best quality we can get. Soundtrack is alright, it can get a little repetitive sometimes, but it does its job.\n\nOnline/Co-op: 8/10 ... There is NO online mode. But hey, don't consoles have some sort of online mode? Well, that is a myth for us PC gamers. Apparently we dont get online functionalities at all. At least we get an offline 2 player co-op mode, which is pretty fun if you bring a friend over. Still, lazy port again not giving us online mode like on consoles.\n\nFor the first One Piece port, they did a bad job, or at least didnt provide any reason for their failure to deliver the best. If they ever release a sequel on Steam, I will definitly not pre order it until I see whether they care about the PC community or not. I'm dissapointed, but I'll make sure to have fun and get the best out of this game, which probably shouldn't cost £40 in its current state...","August 30, 2015","false","41.1"," 88 of 154 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","88","154","3","7"

These games are very similar to dynasty warriors games and with that, they are easier to use with a controller. I understand that this game said partial controller support, but only one controller works. I have a xbox 360 wireless adapter and two xbox 360 controllers. However, when we start up the game, only player one works on the controller while player two doesn't get to do anything with their controller.\n\nThe only way that I was able to figure out how this works and that one person is forced to play this game while on the computer with a mouse and keyboard which I think is stupid. Why in the world would you only let there be one controller in use... I wanted this game to be a co-op experience with my boyfriend, but this isn't happening.\n\nOur current set up is that the pc is connected to our tv so we can play on the couch, but now he must play in front of the computer while I have to play on the couch which defeats the purpose of couch co-op.

Despite its simplistic nature and it's missing out on features that would've drastically improved it, it holds up very well.\n\nIt's a classic style beat-em-up JRPG, with a good mix of story, missions, side-quests and explosive action to keep you playing. The soundtrack is amazing, and I'm pretty sure they don't replicate the same song for different levels. But I've yet to finish it, so don't quote me on that. It also involves a bit of strategy if you take the game seriously enough to want to 100% it, as you try to balance out who you're levelling up and spending coins on, as well as which territories you should go for first, so the game does well to layer it's inner complexities upon and massive heap of "just go in and beat the ever living hell out of everything that moves." And I think that heap is what makes the game fun. It's nonsensical violence in all its glory. Sure, there are segments which are just plain frustrating, but the fact that you can easily take that frustration out on 50 or more guys in the form of one powerful move which downs them all instantly redeems the game.\n\nBut, despite being a really fun game, it has its drawbacks. As you'd expect from a game of this style, it can easily fall victim to repetitive gameplay. The flashy moves get less and less flashy as you use them, and you will be using them a lot.\n\nAnd more on the aspects of gameplay it's missing, I felt it lost a huge opportunity to diversify itself from other beat-em-up games in the form of actually commanding where troops should go and what they should focus on. It would make up for the blatantly stupid AI getting itself in seriously bad situations. It doesn't help that those situations can sometimes cost you the entire mission as a whole either.\n\nHonestly, even though the game has its flaws, I'm sure every game does.

But REALLY, Thi is PC game, it means you have to include the best graphic quality possible. I see low quality of shadow + texture everywhere even in highest graphic settings (which is already mentioned many times by other user).  As for the other problem, when user is using xbox360 controller,  please change the UI layout to xbox360 buttons, how the user would know wtf they supposed to press.\nThis are simple mistakes yet so important not to forget.

You can level them, you can unlock skills and make them more epic (I really love every single character).\n\nI know the PC and PSVita versions got less than the PS3 and PS4 versions but we still pay just as much. And I know it's not fair for us and just seems like a money grab. But I don't play this game to enjoy the BEST GRAPHICS or online coop. Because even without it this game is highly enjoyable for every One Piece fan. The graphics look very neat to me anyway but I guess I don't have my standards set that high.\n\nI don't even have any of the issues that have been mentioned by others. No bugs and my controller works just fine.\nI can imagine though that online coop would actually be pretty awesome for this game and I'd definitely enjoy that too.\n\nSo I recommend this game to all those who'd like to enjoy a good One Piece game with many lovable characters and exciting missions/fights.

Ill start off by saying Ive always been a fan of the Warriors games and probably always will be but this game felt bland to me. I love One Piece and to me this game kinda messed with my expectations. The lore was all over the place and the as with every anime based game the graphics looked waxy. This being said ill start with gameplay.\n\nThe fighting in this game is just like any other Warriors game. Do a combo, then mash for a bit, rinse repeat. Animations look cool and it is satisfying seeing all those dirty little mobs hit the ground. Other then that there isnt much to say about the combat and gameplay. You complete the objectives and you run through mashing everything in your way.\n\nThe graphics are cheesy but i knew they would be so it doesnt bother me. 3d anime games always look like this so you cant expect much else. In fact I dont know what else I would expect.\n\nStory. If you watch One Piece just do yourself a solid and skip the cutscenes. They suck. If you dont watch One Piece you might like them you might not.\n\nOverall its a good time killer. Its not something im going to play everyday and i probably will never log more then 30 or so hours if I even get that far but if your a casual gamer looking for a decent time maybe pick this up during a sale or something.","November 4, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

However, you can definitely tell the games controlls were meant for console, i still play with the keyboard because i dont own a contoller. The campaign is definitely fun and is what you would expect if you watch the anime like myself.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game though is the dream log, the dream log allows players to unlock new characters and abilities. The dream log takes countless fun hours to complete and when completed the is even a nightmare log which is even better! One thing that definitely stands out is the split screen in the game even with a keyboard. One of you can use the w,a,s,d keys to move as the other uses the arrow keys on another keyboard.\n\nIn conclusion i give the game a 8/10 for campaign reasons and a 9.5/10 for its replay factor.","December 5, 2015","true","66.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Every little thing in this PC version speaks of the fact that they've done the bare minimum to make it possible to be sold on the PC to make extra money, as opposed to wanting to deliver a good game to their PC user base that they care about.\n\nOne specific issue I had was that the game did not recognize the right analog stick and the two analog shoulder triggers on my Xbox360 controller.  I couldn't map them to anything in the controller settings.  Not having camera control on the right analog stick makes this close to unplayable for me.  At that point, I'm no longer "playing" the game but just mashing buttons in random directions blindly at enemies I can't really see.\n\nKoei Tecmo reminds me a lot of the old Capcom.  They milk their franchises to death.  They often make their profit in ways that leave fans feeling dirty and cheated in the end.  They don't listen to, or care about, their fans.  Then all their fans and talent in the company leave them after years of abuse.  Capcom has fallen from grace despite having had legendary franchises like Mega Man,  Ghosts'n Goblins, Street Fighter, and an empire of beat 'em ups including Final Fight.  Much of the once massive fan base had turned their backs.  Capcom is a sad little company now.  Koei Tecmo seems to be happily skipping-and-hopping right down that road, while throwing rotten eggs at PC users along the way.\n\nI will never buy another Koei Tecmo product on the PC again, ever.  I hope other displeased users will make the distinction between Koei Tecmo (the developer of the game) and Bandai Namco (merely the publisher), and point their pitchforks in the right direction.","December 31, 2015","false","33.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

You could argue that it's not very original and it's just a reskin sure but the amount of detail they incorporate into the game is admirable and they are very loyal to the source material.\n\nHowever, Pirate Warriors 3 also changes up a few things from the story which is risky but it pays off, like slight changes to a few story arcs and I even felt at times these changes were superior to what happened in the Manga. The combo system was surprisingly more complex than I was expecting and I certainly didn't get bored thanks to the large roster of characters you can play as.\n\nThis game exceeded all my expectations and you can play as Shanks what's not to love?","May 10","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkaji/recommended/331600/","blinkaji","Blinkaji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkaji/","379 products in account","After discovering the One Piece anime and manga series in 2015, it has quickly risen to the top of my personal favourites. Although it is long, I highly recommend watching some episodes as it really is a great anime that continually improves. Because of my love for One Piece I tried to find any video games based off the series since video games and anime are pretty much my two favourite hobbies. After I while, I found One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 for the PC.\n\nIf you are not a fan of the One Piece franchise then there isn’t much reason to play the game in all honesty, but I’ll explain the basic plot anyway. It follows the adventures of the pirate Monkey D. Luffy and his crew of friends, who are all pirates to fulfil their own dreams and for the adventure, not to get rich. The game is a reskin of the Dynasty Warriors franchise, which has a mix of strategy and beat em’ up gameplay that the series is known for. Other Warriors reskins you might have heard of could include Dragon Quest Heroes and Hyrule Warriors. While I am a fan of both The Legend Of Zelda and Dragon Quest, I felt that it didn’t completely make sense considering in the Warriors franchise you can plough through enemies like butter, unlike in Zelda and Dragon Quest. But considering how strong the characters are in One Piece, and how it is almost natural for them to be facing this many enemies, I think the game makes sense to have the gameplay that it has. Except for Usopp. In the anime and manga he doesn’t cut through enemies with a butter knife, it’s more like with a toothpick.\n\nAs you could probably tell from the number 3 in the title, there is a pirate warriors 1 and 2. Both games are very similar in gameplay, but the first game covers most of the story up to the timeskip, whilst the second game has it’s own story. The third game opted to start all over again by covering all the current story, including all the pre-timeskip content. This means you can expect to see up to the Dressrosa arc, but the ending will be different for this game than it is in the actual series. The obvious problem with any One Piece game is that it can’t show all the story, but the game instead focuses on showing some of the battles that take place in the series. I’ve not played the first two games, but I have heard from many people that the third game is the best in the series.\n\nIn terms of graphics the game looks amazing, and it resembles the source material very well. Apparently the PC port has worse graphics than other versions but I still thought the game  looked good regardless, as the game is well optimised as well as looking good. The cutscenes aren’t as good as the anime and manga, but they still are nice and still manage to get their point across. The voice acting has the exact same voice actors from the anime, which means that there is no problems with any of the performances. The soundtrack is also ok, but it is a bit disappointing that there isn’t many songs from the anime in the game. I mean, how cool would it be have songs like Overtaken playing during an epic battle or even the various versions of the iconic We Are! It would be very cool, to say the least.\n\nThe game has three modes to play. Legend Log - Which is a shortened version of the original story where you play the missions like they happened originally. Free Log - Which is the same as dream log except you can play as whoever you want. But sadly I have to inform you - you cannot play as Chou Chou, which whilst sad, I think life can go on without him. Dream log is the last game mode and it is basically loads of battles to unlock characters like Shanks. This mode has no story whatsoever though, so it can become bland and repetitive after a while, as the gameplay does become repetitive, especially when it isn’t story driven gameplay. Your allies are random in the dream log, but in the free and legend logs they are different depending on the level, and there is some characters who are support only, but considering there is roughly 30 of them I can get over the fact that you can't choose who you have to support you.\n\nThe game has local Co-Op for Legend and Free log, but the online co-op from the console versions is missing from the PC version. In general the PC port is worse than the next gen versions, but considering it’s the first One Piece game on the PC and it is still good even with these problems, It’s not the biggest deal in the world unless you believe in the PC Master Race. The price is also another problem as it currently costs £40 on steam, which I wouldn’t say is worth it, so I got it in a sale for £20. The game in general has a lot of content when you think about it as a gem, but considering the sheer length of the One Piece series, there could have been so much more stuff in the game, but to be fair, it’s a bit too much to ask.\n\nThe actual gameplay is the same throughout all of the modes, with the general concept being that you play as a character who has to defend and capture bases as well as helping allies and taking down bosses. Each character can use basic attacks for comboing, as well as attacks that team up with allies and specials, along with specials that team up with allies and giving a buff to your character for a while. Most of the attacks look cool and the specials and team attacks (named Kizuna rushes) look awesome, you can expect to see some of your favourite attacks here. The game has little innovation compared to the other Dynasty Warriors games, but it doesn't really matter considering it achieves it’s purpose of being a good game for One Piece fans. I can’t really say much about the keyboard controls, as for some strange reason I decided to play the majority of the game with a fight stick, potentially due to the abundance of fighting in the game. The Dynasty Warriors games are often accused of being button mashers, which I can say is entirely false, at least for One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3. If you just spam random buttons you will end up doing attacks in the wrong direction, they will often not even create good combos and it generally will get boring. Each character has a variety of moves you use, and it is good to remember the combos for at least one character, as it will be necessary to use combos in the later stages. It surprised me with the amount of thinking you need to do when it regards bases. I mean, the game isn’t Civilization 5, but you will need to make sure you tackle enemies in a smart way, and do a mix of attacking and defending, along with helping out allies.\n\nEach of the 40ish characters can be leveled up to 99, and each one has unlocks that can be obtained by completing certain objectives as them, such as unlocking alternate specials and transformations during a Kizuna Rush, such as Sogeking or Gear Second.There is even more than 40 characters if you include different forms of characters before and after the timeskip. I like the fact that most of the alternate costumes and specials are unlocked in ways that fit the content that you unlock. Character Coins can also be gained in missions which let you increase your character's stats, and Beli can be used for the shop and for forcibly leveling up your characters. But if I threw money at people they would probably get weaker. There is a lot of content that could keep you playing for over a hundred hours, but it depends how long it takes for you to get tired of the gameplay.\n\nThe attention to detail in the game is truly amazing. Some of the smaller things can really make it feel like a One Piece game. Such as Sanji performing alternate ‘love’ attacks when paired with Nami or Robin in a Kizuna rush team attack thing, or how he can’t hit women. At least when you play him. The CPU’s can do what they want, apparently. Overall the game has a lot of polish, with this only being the tip of the Iceburg. Literally.\n\nOne Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 - 76%","April 15","true","27.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When it went down temporarily in November, I jumped on the chance to buy it.  Now that I have had a few months to play it, here is what I think.\n\nI don't really care for the whole argument about shading, brightness, or any of that.  But there are some drawbacks with the graphics.  First of all, most of the common "cannon fodder" enemies have their heads moving away from their bodies.  I mean it is really easy to see that the heads are simply not attached and are weaving away from the bodies.  I thought that was kind of annoying.  To add to this, you will often see their weapons floating right next to them rather than being held.  On the plus side, it kind of makes you feel like you are killing a bunch of Jedi or Sith, just pretend those weapons are being held by the Force.  However, part of these faults can also be found on major characters like Kuro, Aokiji, Usopp, and Ivankov but with these guys the problem is the hair.  With Kuro you may find his hair floating a few inches away from his head, making it seem like he is bald.  After a few moments of laughing it became a little annoying.  As for the others, the dynamics between their head and their hair is annoying in that the hair will often move independently and block your view of the character's faces.  It may not seem like much for some, but I was really aggravated by that.\n\nI absolutely adore the gameplay.  It is fun, objectives will change which will keep you on your toes, and the interactions between major characters can be very enjoyable.  Sometimes the objectives will not be that clear, but you can just wing it and figure it out along the way.  The gameplay can be hard at first but if you have too much difficulty, go to Dream Log and level your characters up.  The downside is that eventually as you level your characters up, the gameplay becomes really easy even in the Hard difficulty.  If you ever want a REAL challenge, then try the Nightmare Log.  Now THAT is a challenge.\n\nDream Log I found to be an absolute gem.  It is a great way to unlock characters, level up, and get rare coins to further improve your characters.  And all of the island missions have themes that border on weird to absolutely hilarious.  For example, one mission is Men vs Women.  I was on the side of the men, and who was on my side?  Akainu, Blackbeard, and a bunch of other male pirates with Akainu saying we have to win for Justice.  There was just something about that whole thing that had me cracking up.  Keep in mind that on all of these missions, the characters who appear will be completely randomized.  The only things you can choose are who to play as, which side to select if the option is available, which costume to use, and how to strengthen your character.\n\nFor the main story, there are two options.  The main one is where you play any arc in the story with a handful of characters that coincide with the arc from the anime/manga.  The other option is the Free Log in which you can play any arc you want but the difference is you can play as any character you have unlocked.  Do you want to storm Impel Down as Akainu or Whitebeard?  In the Free Log you can do that.  Also, each arc has a percentage rating of how well you complete the requirements in said arc.  The more of the requirements that you complete, the better your percentage rating, and as such the better rewards you will get upon completion.  Some of these rewards are rare coins that you cannot get anywhere else that can help to boost your characters' stats, give them a new special, or give them a new costume.  You will find that if you want all of the rewards, or maybe are just a perfectionist, there is a LOT of replay value because the game will reward you if you strive for an S-class rating in everything.  And do not worry, unlike some games you will not be penalized for taking damage, healing yourself, or performing a bunch of specials.  You are evaluated on other criteria that I will not divulge.\n\nThe tutorial I found to be very disappointing.  While they try to be helpful, they are often unclear and when they tell you which keys will do what, they use symbols instead of the actual keys to tell you.  For example, they use one symbol that looks like a pink shooting star and tell you what it will do.  Problem is, I don't know about you but I do not have a pink shooting star on my computer.  So you have to go into the options menu to figure things out on what symbols stand for what keys.  It is annoying but after awhile it becomes second nature and you can pull of pretty cool moves really easily.  The lack of clarity is also clear for several optional events in the game, so you will probably find yourself going online to help get some clarity as to what needs to be done and how.\n\nThere are a lot of characters to choose from, and I love this.  I love having options and you will more than likely find a few of your favorites are available to play.  However, you will also find a bunch of characters you cannot play and yet are still in the game as allies or enemies.  Fortunately, that does not stop you from being able to perform cool specials with them.  Unlike a bunch of other games, you will find that each character is unique.  They do not do the same punch, kick, grapple thing that you will find every character doing in some games.  Each character has their own unique actions and abilities that makes each play through feel completely new and special.  Now there is one playable character that I will list as both a pro and a con (Unnamed because it's a spoiler).  The con is that they have not appeared to fight in the series yet, so we know very little of what they can do.  As such, I feel like the developers jumped into this character too soon.  The pro though is that they are an absolute blast to play.  Their specials are also awesome and coincidentally have the coolest names.\n\nAs for DLC, it is for some but not for others.  I bought the two packs on Steam for extra Dream Log missions and costumes and I adore them.  I will be honest though, I care more for the costumes than the missions and trust me, I love the costumes.  There is an extra set of costumes not on Steam but you can just go to the Bandai Namco site, become a member for free, and you can download the extra set for free.  Also, other than just adding some very nice aesthetics, the costumes themselves also offer new abilities.  Equip your character with their New World costume, and they will have access to their New World abilities.  Keep in mind though, even if you have those new abilities, if your character is not at a high enough level then you will still struggle on even the easier missions.\n\nSo in conclusion here is what I think:\n\nCons:\n- Graphics need improving.  They look nice but there is a serious problem when it interferes with the characters.\n- Gamplay does get a bit repetitive after a while\n-Even on hard, can still be a little too easy.\n- Tutorial is terrible\n- Some of the optional mission events, like Treasure Events are not clear so you will have to go online to figure them out.\n-  The game finished before the Dressrosa Arc was finished in the manga, as such the game and the manga will differ on the arc.\n\nPros:\n- Very fun gameplay\n- The game gives some very good incentives to getting 100% or S-Class on missions and Dream Log.  As such, a lot of replay value.\n- Large selection of characters.  You will almost be guaranteed to find one of your favorites to be playable.\n- Costumes, while adding a great deal to aesthetics, also affect gamplay.  New World Costumes grant that character the ability to use their New World abilities.\n\nWhile there are a lot of cons, if you can get past these then I highly recommend that you buy the game.  It is truly a blast.  While I do believe it is worth the current price of $49.99, I would still recommend waiting for it to go down.","April 25","true","174.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You would honestly have to be trying to get your KO count below 2000 in most maps, so if you like kicking a literal ton of ♥♥♥, you're already looking good.\nThere are a ton of characters to play as, and a few have different variations that change their movesets, in some ways minor, and some major.\nIt's even fairly different from the previous Pirate warrior games, in a few ways, the team up stuff the most prevalent. The Kizuna rush mechanic is a big one and one you'll be making use of constantly.\n\nThe legend log tries to retell the story of the Manga, and while I have not beat it, it does an alright job of doing so, but still omits some key side characters in their arcs. (Dressrosa is apparently really barebones too, but that's because of when the game was being made) Some of the cutscenes are repeated from Pirate warriors 1, but they were good there, and they're good here, but the new stuff that they didn't cover in it, do get really good cutscenes, so it's all good and consistent.\n\nDream log is where a lot of the meat of the content is and where you unlock a good chunk of the playable cast, with at least 50 battles to get through, to complete it all, and they have randomized allies and some random enemies to keep things a bit fresh. With random bounties, and tough battles ahead, you will spend a lot of time in this mode, even if you've beaten it completely.\n\nThere are a lot of unlockables and collectables to get you hooked into the game, too.\n\nBut there are some bad sides, if you don't like this "Dynasty Warriors" type of game, then this may not change your mind, and it can get a bit repetitive at times, I will admit that. And the port isn't the greatest, but some graphical bugs are being looked at and will most likely get fixed in the near future.\n\nIn total, I would rate it a good 8.5 out of 10 and highly recommend it.","September 6, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You beat up hundreds of useless mobs with devastating attacks and engage in fights with various bosses. Gameplay is easy - don't be afraid to turn on hard difficulty!\n\nIf you're interested in the genre or in One Piece, might as well give this a try because so far it's the only game of this kind on PC. The game is easy but I think it's pretty fun. The port is bad, though, made from the PS3 version instead of the PS4 version (from which gameplay images in the Store are!!), so graphics aren't as good as they could and controller support is shoddy. This is causing a lot of noise in the community and will hopefully be fixed.\n\nStory mode encompasses the entire One Piece story, from episode 1 to the completion of the Dressrosa arc, and definitely contains story spoilers for those who care!\n\nI'll give this a cautious recommend but it is somewhat of a niche title, and if the port issues worry you, check in the community if they have been fixed.","September 1, 2015","true","16.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

The answer is I would hate it, however this game does pretty well to represent One Piece so for all you fans out there, there you have it.\n\nFor everyone else,\nAll the levels have the same kind of feel, so it may get boring and repetive, however each level has taken me longer and longer to finish. So the repitivity doesn't make it easy in addition I am playing on easy mode right now. So if you play on hard or normal I am sure you will feel the same way just, double.  Follows the anime story so if you don't like the anime then either you will start to like it because of this game.. OR  DON't GET THIS GAME. One Piece will grow on you and you will love it.\n\nThere are alot of cutscenes\nHowever they are very skipable. If you are a huge fan you might watch them some of them are amusing. If you want to get on with the game you can easily in about 1 second skip the scene.\n\nCons.\nFemales Wear  what some might say are scandalous outfits.\nThere is no  blood.\nGameplay is fairly repetitve Ussop is lame. ( But if you are a fan  you probably kind of expected that.)\nBadge is very hard to get.\n\nPros\nFollows close to the story line\nFemales have cute outfits.\nQuick actions that can be repeated, for very fast and upbeat gameplay\nMoves   for each charector are unique each charector does't have the same skill set.\nAchievments!!\nCARDS / BADGE\nEPIC moves\nGreat Anime game\nBetter then Naruto.\nONE PIECE\n\nAll in all I can see myself putting at least 100+ into this game. Right now I am not there but that is because I just got it recently.\nI use a keyboard and so far I am doing just fine, however I imagine it may be easier  with a controller, I also have the Naruto games which are directly ported from the Xbox 360 and I find that one in bearable without the controller however I am able to throughly enjoy  this game on the keyboard. fyi the attack  controlls are I J K L O, I think there are combo attacks but I  just press the buttons in repeatedly when I know I have a combo attack ready.\n\nRating: 9/10\nOh I have the DLC's so I am not sure how big it is without them, but my download was around 9 GB.\nSo it is a big game.\n\nThis is a first impression review  I have owned this game for one day. I bought this game on the holiday Sale  on 12/23/15. For   those who read this when it is at full price I was going to buy it at full price but didn't have the money. Honestly I think it is worth its asking price, but if you can get it on sale even better.\n\nThankyou, You should buy it I mean honestly what else are you going to do with all that money.. ;)","December 24, 2015","true","84.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The menu is in PC keys and the controller in game is horrible but luckily there was a guide that helped me get my controller to work like it should tho it stills feels a bit bad but I can play it like normal well besides having to use the PC keys at the menus.\n\nBeing a fan of one piece and the games I will still try to play this game on steam so would I recommend it? well if you're a fan of either the games or the anime then yeah try it out but only if it gets on sale. If you're not really into the games or the anime and just looking to buy it because it's an anime game then I recommend you do not get it.\n\nWith using a program to get the controller working like it would be I'll give this game a 7/10 for a decent port on steam still I do hope they give it an update since I really loved this game on console.","January 4","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedanaaddams/recommended/331600/","thedanaaddams","TheDanaAddams","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedanaaddams/","2641 products in account","Frankly, there are two questions you need to ask yourself about this game:\nDo you like One Piece? Do you like Warriors games?\nIf you answered yes to both of these questions, you will not be disappointed.\nIf you answered no to both, well, give this one a miss.\n\nIf you answered yes to one, or "I don't know" - there are a few things to know.\n\nPirate Warriors 3 follows the Warriors tradition of expanding upon existing games - you do not need Pirate Warriors 1 or 2, as Pirate Warriors 3 will cover the story from the beginning.\nThe story, of course, is the storyline of the One Piece series - if you have read the manga or watched the anime you will be at an advantage in some instances, as the battles you undertake are indeed based on the series' events, and prior knowledge can help you know who your character should be targeting for certain bonuses. Essentially, you tend to be rewarded for following the events of the series "correctly."\nIt must be noted, of course, that the story presented in the game is abridged - if you want to experience the One Piece story in its entirety, you should opt for the anime or manga.\n\nAs for how it stacks up as a Warriors game, it's the standard formula with some tweaks - as is standard for Warriors spin-offs.\nThis time, we have the basic standard/strong attack combos, Musou-style specials, camera-targeting, a dodge-dash, an unorthodox "unique attack"on a separate button - seems to be a ranged attack, and the 'big' feature of Pirate Warriors, the crew system. Crew members will join up with your character and charge a meter not unlike the rage gauge or similar  in previous Warriors games, when full you can activate the crew assist, which functions much the same as the rage state did - boosting your abilities in various ways, while also bringing the crew member in to fight beside you. While active, you can also use a powered up Musou special attack, teaming up with your crewmate. This gets stronger as you play, as after using this crew assist, you will form a team with that crewmate, at which point you can switch your crew assist member, and build the gauge anew - which is where it gets interesting! With the new crew member, building the gauge again and executing the crew assist will form a team with THAT member - the previous member will stay part of your team, and thus your crew assist grows in strength, with both joining in for the Crew Musou special attack. You can have a team of up to four for your crew assist - the sheer devastation caused by a team of this size is really something to behold.\nIf you like the spectacle of wiping out large crowds in your Warriors games, you will have a lot of fun with this!\n\nThere is definitely less focus on capturing terrirory compared to other Warriors games - most of the time, capturing a territory removes it from play, stopping enemy spawns but not providing any benefits to your own forces. This fits with the theme, obviously, since the Pirates are a small band of rogue agents only sometimes assisting other forces.\n\nIf you've never played a Warriors game and aren't a One Piece fan, I would suggest cutting your teeth elsewhere, but as it stands, this is a really solid Warriors installment! Lots to do, lots to unlock, definitely a title to keep you invested for a long time!\nHighly recommended for the right audience!","September 8, 2015","true","46.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have had zero bugs/glitches at all. I am a huge one piece fan and I assume anyone interested in this game is one too. That being said, I love this game. I have been dying to play my favorite characters from the show ever since I got into it. This game finally gives me the chance.\n\nThe  gameplay is fun and I love how the characters develop new powers as you progress, just like the show. The graphics are fine. I mean they are on par with alot of other games I have played in the recent past. Are they the best graphics ever? No. Do I care? No. I don't get peoples issue with the graphics, because they are great if you aren't a nitpicker. The gameplay and controls are great, I am using a xbox controller though... Huge selection of characters, outfits, and skills for each character. This game is very in depth and follows the story amazingly.\n\nMy one issue with this game would be that it does get repetitive. I honestly don't care that much because I see this as a game to kill a couple hours(especially after being pumped from watching the show). This isn't a game you play for 10 hours 5 days in a row(I guess you could). I haven't finished the game but I see it as a game with tons of replay value since you can play tons of characters and unlock skills etc... It's almost like super smash bros. in the sense of replayability.\nI do wish online was available but meh, Ill just play with friends in person and only one of us has to buy the game...","September 12, 2015","true","80.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

I'm really excited and happy all thanks to Tecmo Koei and Bandai Namco who did a great job on bringing the PC Port, which surprisingly very satisfying!\n\nPROS\n= Amazing Wide Variety of Roster, even though sadly not all of them were playable.\n= We got Shanks and Sabo playable AND that's more than enough to ask for.\n= 60FPS and so freakin' smooth, kudos to Tecmo Koei for not being so lazy at all to create a good port.\n= Graphics and art style is awesome since it fits One Piece theme to be this comical.\n= Combat is fast-paced and super fun with Kizuna System and the Combo Move Finisher.\n= Kizuna System really lives up the battle, this is a new feature implemented on this series since it doesn't existed yet back in PW2.\n= Awesome Voice Acting and well-done translation, one of main selling point of this game.\n= EPIC SOUNDTRACK, it really defines the ambience of Pirate theme for this game.\n= A lot of balancing for OP characters such as Law and Kuzan who makes this game too ez back in PW2.\n= Storywise it tries to stay true as the Manga and it did a great job on retelling East Blue Saga Story Arc.\n= The cutscene is amazing and it retells all the famous scene with so much feeling.\n= Balanced Difficulty, not too easy and not too hard.\n= So far i didn't encounter bug or fps drop with All High Settings. Awesome!\n\nCONS\n- Control sucks with keyboard, those who want to fully enjoy this game seriously grab a Joystick.\n- Control scheme didn't get explained well since it replaces button with icons that doesn't really helpful.\n- Is it me or the right analog stick for camera is kinda jumbled up? Probly just me.\n- A lot of key characters that are actually needed for the key plot is missing, such as Shanks's Crew, Non-Zoan CP9 Members, 11 Supernovas, Vander Decken, etc.\n- A lot of interesting characters ended up only as a support, such as Monet, Kaku, Blueno, etc. Perhaps they're saving up for PW3.\n- There is one achievement that NEEDS A LOT of Grinding, VERY TIME CONSUMING and there are some support characters that we need to grind but it's hard to find a level where we can find them. YES, we CAN'T CHOOSE our SUPPORT UNIT for most of the time. Especially when we're playing at Dream Log where basically based on random stage most of the time.\n- Combat can feel a little bit repetitive, but that can be expected from a Hack n Slash genre made by Tecmo Koei.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 8 out of 10.\nPerfect from almost all of the aspect for One Piece fans and still can be enjoyable for those who didn't follow the series.\nOverall, i gave it two thumbs up for the Game and for Tecmo Koei and Bandai Namco for bringing this awesome game to PC.","August 29, 2015","true","33.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deeefoo/recommended/331600/","deeefoo","DeeeFoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deeefoo/","","I'm only giving a thumbs up to this game because I know the game is good, and I would definitely recommend it, which is what the thumbs up means. HOWEVER, I recommend getting it on another platform. While the port doesn't have any glaring issues at first glance, there's plenty of technical issues that start to pop up.\n\nFirst, the visuals. While the inferior graphics don't bother me personally, they falsely advertised the game on the store page by posting screenshots with PS4-level graphics, and false advertisement is always a no-no. Also, knowing KT, they probably purposely made the PC version this way so that the PS4 version will look better, since that's their main moneymaker, which is pretty sad but true. The colors are dull and washed out, the rendering distance is quite poor since you can't see the buildings in the background, and the shadows, textures, and lighting are all PS3 quality. If you're fine with that, then go for it. Mods can improve the colors and sharpness, but the lighting and textures will be unaffected.\n\nThen there's the controller issues. The game didn't recognize my controller right away, since apparently I had to switch it to Dinput mode to get it to work. Even then, not all of the buttons were remappable on the options menu. Even DW8XL had better controller options. I had to resort to using joytokey in order to get some of the buttons to emulate the console layout. Only official Xbox 360 controllers are supported in this game, as stated by Bandai. However, if you have a controller that can act as a 360 controller or can be recognized as one, then it should work. There's absolutely no mouse support in this game, and the keyboard controls are far from ideal, so you're basically forced to use a controller to enjoy the game fully.\n\nThen there's the bugs that are present. Apparently there's a graphical options bug that makes the game stuck at the lowest settings, so you can't even change it. Bandai's looking into it right now. Then there are plenty of other bugs, such as black screens, crashes, microstuttering because it's 59fps, and in-game graphical bugs. One of the most noticeable is that some characters' models start flipping out whenever devil fruit powers are used, particularly Logias. Body parts go missing, clothes disappear, and some body parts don't transform when they're supposed to. There's also sometimes a random plane of light protruding out of the character's bodies, and it sometimes is so big that it obstructs the whole screen. Bandai, you need to fix this stuff before I consider re-purchasing the game.\n\nPersonally, I refunded the game because of all the in-game issues I encountered, and am waiting for a fix. Until then, I cannot recommend this game for the PC platform, but please don't think it's a bad game. It's a great entry to the Musou series, and it's even better for One Piece fans, and I totally suggest that all Musou/One Piece/hack'n'slash fans try it out. Just not on PC.

First the graphics are good if you have a good PC/Laptop. Second the gameplay was kind of repititive throughout the game but it was fun to use their skills especially to those who don't know the skills of Shanks, i hope he has the skills like that in real OP or more than that because it wasn't show yet in all episodes. Buy this game if you are fan of One piece or if you want to know the story of each every Arc in the episode.

The game is fun and actually has enough going on to keep you playing however, the port to PC seems like they didn't even try. Ignoring that the company actually said the PC graphics are actually worse than the PS4(graphics don't make or break games for me), the controls are BAD, like really bad. It's not keyboard and mouse, it's all keyboard. Even using an Xbox 360 controller is painful. It wouldn't be so bad if I could actually remap the controls but everytime I do and stop playing, they are reverted back to default when I log back in. I even tried an outside program for my control but that didn't work either. Would I reccomend the game? Yes but on the condition that you could put up with clearly worse graphics and terrible controls. It's sad because the game is actually quite fun (IF you can get past the controls...I'm honestly trying...I wanna play.)","September 3, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It has 3 game modes. Legend log, It tells the one piece story using the main characters. Free log, It tells the story but able to use any characters. And finally the dream log where there are various islands you have to beat and where you get some of your characters(also where you will spend most of your time). The level system in this game is interesting. You use coins you get from beating the strong enemies in this game like, arlong, lucci, etc. Then there are gold coins which are rare, you get them from 100% legend diaries, which is from legend log, also you can get them from the dream log. You can use these gold coins to level break your character and level your character stats to the max. The only down side to this game is the port has ps3 graphics (which imo doesnt really matter) and no online which is a little annoying but its fine.\n\nRating : 9/10","September 2, 2015","true","129.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

After completing story mode, there are still quite a number of options so the game doesn't get boring.

Basically this game is just a walkthrough of the whole one piece saga, with the introduction of you using the characters to beat the hell out of those bad guys in the series.\n\nPros: 1: you get to collect all these pretty coins that will further improve the playable characters, it can be quite difficult to collect some. 2: you get to see luffy and shanks fight each other,ain't something to get to see so soon in the anime/manga\n\nCons: R.i.p keyboard if you do not have a gamepad while playing this game. The amount of keys usage is so high, you wish the keyboard you have has a life-time warranty so you can exchange for a new one every now and then. Also, Xbox controller doesn't really seem to be working because some of the skills can't be used.

It's a very repetetive dynasty warrior like game. The graphics are okay and it loads fast on a decent PC.\n\nThe good : The Character development and Battle Animations are pretty good. The story is nearly as expansive as the actual One Piece Story. Same voice actors from the show and the character animation is very well done ( I wish the Anime was done as well as the animation in this game)\n\nThe bad: It skips over minor characters in certain arcs ( I don't blame them this game would be VERY long if they really put everything in) The play style is VERY repetitive, doesn't really offer much new from level to level so if you're not a Fan of one piece and the story you're probably going to get bored very easily. That being said I think this game is really just for One Piece fans, and even then I think that you'd really have to love One Piece to Love this game.\n\nI honestly just wish the pacing of the story was a bit better, it was hard for me to get invested in the ARCS because they skip over random details , so emersion is low.\n\nOverall a good game, the actual game play is average but I highly recommend it to diehard One Piece fans.","August 31, 2015","true","32.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Goes through the story and you get quite alot of playable characters. The combat is smooth and relatively easy to understand after 2-3 battles. The game runs well and I haven't encountered any crashes or graphical bugs.\n\nThe only complaint I have is you better remember what your controls are set to, because you can't pause during a fight and check the options to see what button does what. They have an area that lists the combos by showing you icons, but you have no idea what key corresponds to what icon unless you remember from the main menu. This is aggravating at the start of the game when you don't know what you're doing but quickly becomes a non-issue.\n\nOverall, for the average player that enjoys dynasty warrior-esque fighting games, I recommend this game. If you like one piece or are interested in it, then I highly recommend it for you.","August 31, 2015","true","79.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Now then, as you progress the levels are going to get longer and longer: you now have to play for a full hour the same character with the same four attacks. Gets boring very quickly.\n\nAlso this might be the only game where both keyboard and controller support are terrible.

If you are a fan of one peice, This game lets you play in the role of all your favorite characters, but to make room it skips out on some of the less important arcs and some background story ( most notably brook and zoro). This game also has a lot of quirks that the show often has, such as Sanji is at a disadvatnage to woman.\n\nFor those who do not watch the show:\nThe game is in japanese, so you will have to read the subtitles, this is because the english show has not caught up to the japanese version of the show. But if you are looking for a hack and smash invovling you and your team destroying hundreds of soldiers at a time while taking objectives, this game is for you!\n\nOn a more general note, for both series watchers and not, the game takes a bit getting used to. It is best played with a controller and i would highly suggest changing the controls since the default doesnt include a pause button. The game is very repetitive, as all missions are kinda the same just with different enemies and backgrounds. and that may sound different but no, you smash through tons of people and capture the objective points. Though the real challenge comes from the different obsticles they put in your way, such as changing the conditions of winning and losing, opening some entryways while closing others, etc. The game constantly changes around you. So if you cant keep up with "go here, now do this, now run all the way back, now do whatever for a couple of minutes" kind of gameplay, this game isnt for you.\n\nSo overall, the game is a fast pased beat-em-up that gets repetitive, but hey! you are a force to be reckoned with and that is just fun to begin with.","September 16, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At first, I was on the fence of preordering this game (I wasn't really cause steam refunds for life lol), but I did, one day before release. I was expecting ♥♥♥♥, because let's face it, it's Tecmo Koei, but I was pleasantly surprised, it runs smoothly on my gtx 970 and I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs (I've played through the Legend Log). The gameplay is awesome, it's smooth and it's fun. In Pirate Warriors 3 they introduced a new mechanic called Kizuna, replacing the system they had in Pirate Warriors 2 that had strength and technique characters. It's a cool feature and let's you pull off sick looking specials. We've heard some rumors that the PC version is ported from the ps3 version which I don't know enough about to speak on it, but graphics isn't the most important thing for a game right? Now let's talk about some downsides. The game doesn't have online co-op, which the peasant versions of this game have, and that I'm salty about. I hope they add it later and that it doesn't end up like DOA 5. They game NEEDS a controller, cause you rotate the camera with the F and G key, which makes the game almost unplayable. So if you don't have a ps3 or PS4 controller and you really wanna play this game, go get one. These are the only downsides I can find really, so this is a great game. I thinkl this is a stepping stone for Tecmo Koei to get back in to pc porting. Give us the online co-op, fix the graphics thing and then you guys got a good chance of making up for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc ports that you've ported. DON'T ♥♥♥♥ IT UP. Nevertheless, if you have a PS4, get it on there, it has the online co op and it runs at 1080p/60 fps which is cool. I also need to mention that the resolution doesn't go further than 1920/1080, which is fine for me cause I game at that resolution. This is a fun game, and if you love One Piece as much as I do and have a controller, go get this game!

A very fun, action-packed game with many, many characters to offer - each with impressive and broad movesets that feel awesome to pull off. Furthermore, it's stunning, the anime style was beautifully implemented into this 3D game. I've played for roughly 20 hours, finishing the story mode, and most characters I've yet to unlock, so there's plenty to do. I have but a few issues with the game that I've got to address. Sometimes it's a real pain when crewmates are about to flee from battle and you have to run all the way across the map to help them. Special attacks can get pretty repetitive, it would be nice to have more - even two per character would make a big difference. Missions generally can get kind of repetitive when there are just too many foes. Boss fights don't stand out enough as they work nearly the same as any other fight. It'd be cool to have some cinematic quick time events or more of a God of War approach to the boss fights. For replay value, I think a versus mode would really help the game. It's kind of a shame that you can't put two or more characters in a fight outside of Legend, Free or Dream Log. Also the sountrack, while of good quality, is too repetitive. Too much of the same melody. That's about it. I haven't explored the game in it's entirety but these are my impressions at the moment. I would highly recommend the game, lots of fun.","September 13, 2015","true","28.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics in this game are cartoony to match the One Piece look but also provide alot of nice shading and texture. Although in some places, there is a void of many textures, the game still looks fantastic. The game have alot of iconic One Piece characters to play as, such as the Straw Hat Crew, Serveral Warlords of the Sea, and other rivals Luffy may face like Rob Lucci, or Smoker. The amazing range of attacks paired with the fast paced Dynasty Warriors like gameplay add to an amazing game, even if you don't know much about One Piece. I will say that this game might spoil things later in the One Piece series, so I would recommend atleast getting near the Dressrosa ark in the books or show before coming into this game.","October 29, 2015","true","142.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

".\nwe waited our due time, the day the game became available I started downloading it, saw both the prepurchase DLC and the story pack DLC and everything looked fine.\nI stayed at my friend's house so we could play local in his PC, we found out Steam changed the story pack dlc removing 5 costumes, and that they were obtainable by getting it for free on Namco Bandai's web page, got the code, we used it and got the third DLC marked on his account.\nWhen I got to my house I obviously wanted to play, to my surprise the previously mentioned DLC dissapeared, and in its place left only de Namco Bandai's DLC, with a lousy 5 costumes and no missions, which obviously made me mad at the Sharing system, as this is obviously a bug on Valves part, we tried coneccting to his account to re download the DLC but obviously on returning to my account they still could not get accesed, im just posting this to get some help quick, as Valve support to this day has not answered my one problem my friend had when he switched to his new rig...\n\nTL;DR: 10/10 Would split game cost again for faulty Family Sharing on DLC","August 29, 2015","true","60.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Dynasty Warriors had character differentiation through weapon types but this game focused only on individual powers and fighting styles. Many people complain about the keyboard controls but it never posed a problem to me. I used to watch One Piece but have stopped following the series due the extreme amount of episodes it has. I still enjoyed the game as it follows the general plot of the anime while using the game mechanics and objectives as the dominant aspect. Most characters are generally balanced in comparison to eachother while still having a plethora of playstyles with the exception of Fujitora, because he can spam call meteors and nuke the entire room he is in with 1-2 shot kills of the ability. Character power is mainly determinant on player fueled growth and coin collection.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed beating up hordes of enemies DW style with some old familliar characters and more.\n\n9/10","April 27","true","45.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So this review might only apply for die hard fans too.\nI wanted to wait with writing this review until I have finished the legend log.\nThats what I did 10 minutes ago.\nAnd the whole journey was fu***ing awesome!\n\nI was reliving some of the best and worst moments of One Piece.\nThe die hard fans will know what I am talking about.\n\nI spent 65 bucks for the preorder and this game was worth every last euro.\nThis games fulfilled my dreams, because I have no Playstation or XBox, so I was unable to play a One Piece-Game before, but now thanks to KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD. and BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment I am able to play a One Piece Game.\n\nI have played 50 hours and I think I am halfway done for achieving 100%.\n\nIt was an emotionally overwhelming experience. I laughed, shed tears, was sad, mad and proud throughout this journey.\n\nIn the end I wanna list up some positive and negative things.\n\nPositive:\n- it's exactly what you expect – you can play the story from beginning to Dressrosa\n- you can play with any character, even the bad guys\n- you can get revenge by kicking akainu's, blackbeard's and doflamingo's ♥♥♥\n- it's so great that they get the original voice actors to do this and the implementation of the characters are simply\nawesome\n\nNegative:\n- they could have used more characters and create some more side quests/levels (for example: each level of Impel Down)\n- It may be too easy, even on the hard difficulty\n- it would be even better if you could decide which attacks each character can use, but I guess that would be kinda\nmessed up – if Luffy has „red hawk“ and at the same time an attack from 2 years ago or something like that.\n\n\nConcluding I wanna say, that I really enjoy playing this game and I really hope that they either gonna make a sequel or update this game once in a while.","September 24, 2015","true","85.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you don't, I'd stay away. The gameplay is average at best, and you'll simply spoil one of the better manga storylines in existence with no context. The plot is chopped up in a way that relevance will only come if you're up to date on the manga/anime (like what, 17 years worth of chapters?). I can only assume those not familiar will be left scratching their head. This does seem to be the standard for these "Musou" games, at least for the only other one I've played (Hokuto No Ken). If you are caught up, the fan service is amazing to say the least. Another major negative is that the meshes and textures are fairly low quality, but this seems to be the norm for devs that focus on consoles primarily, but I think a fan of the series can ignore that (kinda major for a AAA priced game) fault.\n\n8.0 if you love OP. Likely a 5-6 if you don't.

I read the manga, I watch the show in both english sub and dub and I plan to buy merch when I actually get some money to do so. That by no means indicates that this game will easily impress me. Quite the contrary actually. Being a rather big fan of the show, I was incredibly critical of the game. Especially when it came to lore friendly-ness. So did it live up to the name of my favorite show of all time?\n\n\n\nStory\n\nThe games Legend Log goes through the main parts of the Straw Hat Pirate's adventure. Once you beat a level in Legend Log, you can use any character you unlocked to play that level again in Free Log mode. Along with that, there is also Dream Log mode where you can unlock characters and coins by playing certain pre-made scenarios.\n\nGameplay\n\nIf you played One Piece Pirate Warriors 1 or 2, you pretty much know what to expect. The basic Musou gameplay of wailing on thousands of weaklings and the occasional strong baddie. They have added a few new features this time around. One such feature is the Kizuna Rush system. The Kizuna Rush System involves a bar in your HUD filling up as you fight baddies and lowering when you receive damage. The bar has 3 levels. level 1 doesn't really do anything special but level 2 allows you to summon a team mate to unleash an attack by pressing an extra button at the end of your combos. If you fill the bar all of the way, you can activate Kizuna Rush. With this active, each enemy you defeat gives you “!” (The means by which your characters level up) and “Beli” (The currency of the game). As you level up, you unlock new combos and more power for your characters. Defeating strong characters also gives you a coin of that character which can be used to increase your stats.\nEach character has 2 separate kinds of levels. The first kind of level goes up to level 5. Each level unlocks a new thing with the 3rd and 4th unlocking character head shots and voice gallery for that character. A very nice touch if you are a hardcore One Piece fan. The second kind of level goes up to level 50. This is what actually increases your characters stats. The level cap can actually be moved up to 100 if you unlock all of the required coins.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music was a bit lack luster. The songs aren't bad but they aren't really good either. Just kinda meh. Also, right before you start a map, there is an annoying and unneeded 5 second loop of a song that will repeat over and over until you start the game. Why they didn't use one of the many ACTUAL SONGS I will never know.\n\nGraphics\n\nI wasn't expecting breath taking graphics and I got exactly what I was expecting. The graphics are mediocre with the exception of during the cinematic cutscenes. These cutscenes look beautiful and were a treat to view. Not so say they are stunningly realistic. They are beautifully stylized while still keeping faithful to the art style of the show. However, (and this may be because I have the PC version). The character's skin during the comic strip cutscenes look . . . . . really just awful. What is supposed to be sweat is poorly done and just makes the characters look terrible with the sweat textures phasing in and out of their bodies.\n\nLore Friendliness\n\nI feel as though it is necessary to add in this extra category for this game. I was pleasantly surprised with how well this game stuck to the One Piece lore. From Usopp not being effected by Perona's Negative Hollows to Sanji being very weak against female enemies. Should not disappoint.\n\nOverall\n\nI enjoyed this game and I still play it with over 90 hours played on it. I still have yet to unlock every single character. I have about 5 more to go. I really wish there were certain people I could play as that were only available as support characters. I will not divulge any of the playable characters because I believe part of the fun of playing is discovering who you get to be. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nIf you liked my review, consider supporting me by visiting my blog ^_^\nhttp://everythingnrd.blogspot.com/","September 27, 2015","true","107.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's dynasty warriors with a One Piece skin, with the story line superimposed on it. And it works well. You have a great sense of power, and moves feel good to execute. You feel pretty involved in a story you already know from the anime/manga. A great game for anyone who loves the show. Many key moments of the grand adventure come by, and look pretty cool in 3D renders. I wouldn't mind if the show would be re-done like this entirely at one point. Heck, I'd love to see that.\n\nOn the other side, the game is a graphical mess. Set your textures to high or low, it doesn't matter. Higher than 60fps? why'd you need that? Shadows? Why? This is the PS3 version of the game with all the graphics turned down, and the game does NOT allow you to turn them up. Quite frustrating. It is a software issue that the PS4 version looks better, and it should be fixed.\n\nDo get this if you like One Piece. The game is great even if the graphics are meagre.\n\nDo not get this if you have integrity, and just want a great game to play. There are better games that are the same thing.","April 5","true","218.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's dynasty warriors with a One Piece skin, with the story line superimposed on it. And it works well. You have a great sense of power, and moves feel good to execute. You feel pretty involved in a story you already know from the anime/manga. A great game for anyone who loves the show. Many key moments of the grand adventure come by, and look pretty cool in 3D renders. I wouldn't mind if the show would be re-done like this entirely at one point. Heck, I'd love to see that.\n\nOn the other side, the game is a graphical mess. Set your textures to high or low, it doesn't matter. Higher than 60fps? why'd you need that? Shadows? Why? This is the PS3 version of the game with all the graphics turned down, and the game does NOT allow you to turn them up. Quite frustrating. It is a software issue that the PS4 version looks better, and it should be fixed.\n\nDo get this if you like One Piece. The game is great even if the graphics are meagre.\n\nDo not get this if you have integrity, and just want a great game to play. There are better games that are the same thing.","April 5","true","218.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not sure if the positive reviews realized yet, but the port is great because it's a straight vita port. Including the graphics. Controller support sucks as well. I wouldn't recommend it until they fix xbox controllers and give us the actual game.\n\nEDIT: And no this isn't just about me being a graphics person. It's literally me reaching out to everyone to not support these type of tactics. It is a literal example of false advertisement and charging extra cash for a game that is just a Vita copy. If you're going to release a game, deliver what you promised and don't pull these type of strings on your customers. Also, yes the game is playable for me besides the fact the Xbox 1 controller (to be specific) has unused buttons, infinite scrolling on some menus, missing functions, etc. There are other users reporting similar issues and it has something to do with xinput or dinput.\n\nEDIT #2: Bamco pretty much said screw you guys, the game is working intentionally because it is just a ps3 port and that's what we just sold you. So if you're waiting for any fixes regarding the graphical options, good luck. They pretty much sold this game on false advertising and stated it is NOT supposed to look similar to what's out on current gen consoles, instead it just looks worse on purpose.","August 28, 2015","false","1.4"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","21","44","0","4"

Wait 'til it's on the cheap.\n\nEDIT: Just for clarity, I'll expand upon this.\n\nNeedless to say, the negative reviews on this game are well founded, the gamepad controls are reasonable, but needing to button mash to figure out what the hell the buttons do because there is no clear cut information within the game, isn't what I would call good dev practice. The graphics and gameplay are tepid at best, very reminiscent of what one would expect from something like Dynasty Warriors 5 on the console, for example, and the translations are bad at times. That being said, the Trailer on the store page for OP PW 3 certainly didn't hide it's graphics and gameplay.\n\nHonestly, I'm a big OP fan myself, and the prospect of a One Piece game for PC definitely got me in fanboy mode.\n\nI also found myself dissapointed than the devs didn't sieze the oppertunity for an alternate story, in which a character of your own design can pursue the One Piece, with the Straw Hat Pirates being what amounts to the antagonist in terms of competition.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, but it's far from reaching it's potential. What did it for me was the AAA pricetag for a mediocre level of content, which is why not long after it became available I refunded it.\n\n\n4/10 from me. Two of those points are for it being a game revolving around One Piece, strip those away and this is rubbish. I'd pay $30 for this, but 70?

It seems to be ported from teh PS3 version of the game and is not at all like the promotional screenshots.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and exactly what you would expect from a warriors game (Dynasty Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, etc.). The controller works very well for me, I have not tried the keyboard, but judging from other reviews I don't feel I am missing out.\n\nLocal coop is certainly fun and runs well, though you will loose half of your screen, so this should be avoided if you have a small screen.\n\nSound is fantastic and suits the feel of the show well. I am a little saddened that they did not include any music from the show, but what is there feels right.\n\nI am glad they they have used all the voice actors from the show, they only have the Japanese voices, so this may not be as great for you if you don't like reading subtitles, or watched the english dubs.\n\nThe biggest annoyance for me is the way the story plays out. It is told very fast, which is to be expected as it covers all of the currently released arcs, but they miss out a number of major and minor characters. Because of this some characters appear in stages that they would not be normally, while annoying, it is not a huge downside.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the game, once you complete a level or two you get used to the washed out colours, I have since installed a few third party mods that have increased the draw distance and brightened up the colour pallette.","August 30, 2015","true","14.2"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","3"

I've been waiting for this game for quite some time. But I'm also very adamant about my video games so I'll do my best to stifle my bias for just a little while so I can discuss some pros and cons that I see evident already.\n\nPros: The game plays smooth. I have a decent rig 2.8 Ghz i5, 8gb ddr3 gskill ripjaw, 4gb EVGA Nvidia 970gtx, and a 3tb hdd. I've never hit a hiccup and I wouldn't really expect to with this set up. So if it doesn't play smooth for you, don't shoot me for saying it runs well on mine. Personal experience.\n\nIt holds very true to the story. The depiction of the canon story hasn't been done so faithfully in any other iteration of the franchise that I've experienced yet. There are mini events you can trigger which work outside the norm such as [Spoiler!!] Iron Mace Alvida showing up in the first Buggy mini arc when she didn't team up with him until after Buggy got btfo the first time. [End Spoiler] That being said though, it isn't immersion breaking.\n\nCombat depth and combos flow very smoothly and it doesn't feel "jumpy" like I did in One Piece Unlimited World Red.\n\nStat complexity and customization is very deep and you can adjust particular characters stat priorities in any way you'd like to fit your (or the characters) play style. Of course, this isn't too big of a deal if you're playing on easy or regular because the game is easy on those settings, as it should be. Playing on hard should ensure a level of challenge to the point where character customization is something you should pay attention to and not "auto assign" your tokens.\n\nThe cast! Any fan can appreciate the number of playable characters which have their own unique spin to them that depicts their fighting style or devil fruits very accurately to the manga/anime.\n\n\nNow time for some cons.\n\nI won't sugar coat these because they irk me.\n\nI use an Xbox One controller. But... for some reason, all the key prompts on the screen are still stuck as if I'm using my keyboard! This is immensely annoying for someone trying to start with the gamepad seeing as there is no real correlation between what button POSSIBLY COULD BE and what is mapped to the keyboard. So upon trying the game out on a gamepad for the first time, you'll have to do some trial and error. Which I did and I accidentally released my Kizuna Rush while there weren't a lot of enemies around. Annoying! Pls fix.\n\nThis game is near impossible to play on the keyboard. This gets a line all of its own. Then again, this game was developed for consoles and controllers so take that as you will.\n\nIts a PS3 port! Noooooooo!! I didn't spend this kind of money on a computer of this caliber, to have Koei Temco port a version of the game from last gen. I'm very disappointed in this.\n\nAnd finally, the lack of an online co-op mode. This would have been a fantastic place to allow One Piece fans to meet and mingle through different mediums!\n\n\nAll in all, this is a good game. It feels good, it looks and runs good, and it holds true to the One Piece story that we all know and love so much. Our favorite characters are portrayed very well and it SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPERRRR satisfying to lead a huge group of enemies in line for a massive 100+ KO special :p\nKeep in mind that this is a fan game. Most people who aren't interested in the One Piece universe probably wont be picking up this game but if there is someone who you want to get into the story and hasn't been receptive, this could be a perfect opportunity to invite them over for some 2 player local co-op to ignite that beautiful spark and pass on this story to even more people.\n","August 28, 2015","true","62.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

PC version looks like PS3 version except it can render at 1080p max.\n\nPositives:\n- It follows the anime.\n- Action gameplay like Dynasty warriors.\n\nNegatives:\n- Max 59fps, currently causing issues such as screen tearing or occasional stutter. Hopefully this will be fixed because DW8 does not have this issue.\n- Max 1080p, I don't know of a way to to force higher render resolutions.\n- No online multiplayer, however there is local coop.\n- No English dub.\n- PC version does not include PS4's "New shader system (Program that sets the different renderings of light, texture, shading and effects post-processing, among others ...)\nSource: http://www.ps4france.com/interview-avec-hisashi-koinuma-et-koji-nakajima-producteurs-de-one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-100438/\n\nRecommendation: If you have PS4 then buy PS4 version instead.

OH. also the controls in game dont include the key on your keyboard, so it says press "charge attack" when you start but you dON'T KNOW WHAT BUTTON THAT IS SO YOU'RE BUTTON MASHING EVERYTHING GOD UGH. i'm playing still because i'm in it for the story and my nostalgia and ♥♥♥♥ but after a few hours you get bored. good game for drowning your sorrows because you don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on usually but it's pretty sick so whatever, just go with it. 6/10.","August 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

But the stellar voice work of the original Japanese VA's remains intact.\n\nNot much else to talk about really.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaito70/recommended/331600/","kaito70","Kaito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaito70/","38 products in account","There are ups and downs in the 3rd sequel. I have played the previous sequels on PS3.\nThis 3rd sequels is basically a remake of the first sequel, in the format of the 2nd sequel. As well as, extending the storyline up to Dofi. The new modes seem alright, but the game does make me feel like re-playing the 2nd sequel overall (eg. same BGM, coin-sets collecting). I am NOT an OP fan (i enjoy Hunter X Hunter more :P), but I am a musou fan.\n\nPros:\n- Not much is changed. Control, in-game items, etc. which is easy to begin the game without reading/learning anything extra (I play with a PS3 controller)\n- Contains a up-to-date storyline.\n- Its avaliable on PC, and to most westerners, in their mother-languages.\n- Hack-n-slash musou style retains.\n- More playable characters. (but still more should be added)\n- smooth gameplay (eg. good camera angles, control settings, and story-flow)\n- the in-game CG movies are in real high quality.\n- the REPEATITIVE gameplay is rather low, as a musou game.\n\nCons:\n- Be prepared to set graphic settings to 'all high'. The manga-alike G-pen effect is inconsistent (like little dots ), when the character is static (issue tested in medium & low graphic settings)\n- Its kinda annoying collecting all the coin-sets again (just like a replay of the 2nd sequel)\n- Expensive (like all japanese big titles, it is a expensive game) I would recommend a short wait for a price drop (like what they did to dragonball-xenoverse 40GBP-> 20 GBP) I bought it cuz I just happened to have enough in my steam wallet..after selling a knife in CS:GO\n- A controller is a NEED. Keybord control is very poor. (as expected)\n- On my windows 10 laptop, all function keys are diabled in the game, (eg. volume control, screen brightness)\n\n\nOverall, its a OK game, at a high price. But as a musou game, it is decent. Just the right balance in repeatitive gameplay and in-game missions.\n","August 27, 2015","true","22.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Issues which makes PC gamers produce bad comments about the game. Game controls is part of the gaming experience and if you cant release a patch to improve it, then PC gamers will keep giving this game a bad rating...\n\nIt may be good in Playstation but the control suck in PC.

You should've bought this game already!\n\nHopefully you have a controller though. You're going to need it. It takes a bit to figure out which buttons are mapped up with the controller you have and what few keyboard keys you'll have to press. For me, so far, I've only used the keyboard to change which character helps me in battle. Two buttons, that's it. Not a big a deal. The other keyboard keys are mainly for changing camera settings or minimap positioning. Not at all necessary to play and enjoy the game.\n\nExpect Japanese voice acting with english subs (other subbed languages as well). I've always watched the One Piece anime that way so it feels right at home with me.

Chicken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JackDChicken/","118 products in account","I am super enthralled in seeing, that people label this game with a 'I do not recommend this game,' mainly because of the graphics bug (that bandai is looking into). The game has its flaws right now, such as stupidly made visual button cues and no online CO-OP (there is CO-OP in the sense that you sit with your friend and play on the same machine). But I do not think that these are enough to say that it is not recommended. The gameplay is good, the story is awesome and you will be able to log hours into the dream log and the free log in the game. The story is, as it is staunchly following One Piece, really REALLY good. There is a leveling system, there's awesome music, awesome visual effects (even on the bugged low quality version) and there aren't a lot of bugs or glitches.\n\nI think we PC people have become more and more like spoiled brats who look at the cover, before reading into it. I would like to point out such events as the Fallout 4 graphics where people complained, the Witcher 3 graphics where people complained and so on. Why are we not delving into these games, to find out if it has awesome gameplay, an awesome story and so on?\n\nI have played this game for 15.5 hours these last two days, and I haven't even completed chapter 1, as I continuesly try to get an S ranking, try to complete the dream log, try to level up my crew, try to unlock character and try to get better at the game.\n\nI am sorry if I have infuriated anyone, I just felt like this needed to be said. I mean, really, the most helpful reviews on this page, are two negative reviews mainly based around the graphics bug and no CO-OP (even though one of them talks about the FEW bugs that happen to some people). Reading through them, I do not think that their negative recommendations are justified, as they only state the bad things about the games, and therefore completely overlook the good things about the game, and the fact that this is one of the first good Koei Tecmo PC Ports.","August 29, 2015","true","40.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The best comparison I could make to another game that is similar is a single-player version of Dungeon Defenders with anime style graphics and a anime style storyline. All voice-acting is in Japanese with English subs. It's a pretty shallow game in terms of everything apart from the combat, which is surprisingly enjoyable. Each character that you can play, and I believe there are 40 different ones, gives you a unique set of combat abilities... I guess you could also call it a fighting game in 3rd person..\n\nI would say that unless you are a fan, this is not worth $70USD though.

You play the amazing Story of One Piece and the Gameplay is also great.","August 29, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I looked into the settings and apparently you can only map to the keyboard which makes no sense to me. I guess thats what you should expect from "Partial controller support"...\n\n***(EDIT)*** Apparently you can lock-on enemies using the Left Trigger. It took me a while to figure out because L-Trigger is use as a power up as well.\n\nStill going to play through the whole thing because these can be patched pretty easily and everything else seems really high quality not to mention the game is really fun.","August 27, 2015","true","11.8"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","2"

So when I heard that Pirate Warriors 3 was coming to PC, I was overjoyed.  I'd never played the previous games (due to not owning a PS3 or 4) but I had watched walkthroughs of both and loved them very much.  I added PW3 to my wishlist the moment it appeared on Steam, and pre-ordered it the day that became available.\n\nDespite being ripped off by Bandai and Steam when they removed 5 costumes from the Story Pack (So that the pre-order on Bandai's site could have an "exclusive" pre-order bonus) AFTER I preordered the game from Steam, and despite the fact they NEVER gave a real answer as to why they did this without informing us or whether they'd do something to make up for the deception, this is a good game.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple: smash and slash your way through hoardes of enemies.  Be very aware, the controls configuration are intended for controllers and not keyboard and mouse.  Plus, you have to figure out which buttons are which actions because the symbols they give you are not all very self-explanatory.  So, if your using an Xbox controller, here's some tips:\n\nGeneric Attacks: X and Y.\nSpecial Attack: B.\nCharged Attack: RB\nDash and Dash Attack: A\nAwakening: (Not sure what this is called officially, but it's what you do before you can use Kizuna Rush) it's either just RT, or RT and B at the same time (I'd have to test this further to be absolutely sure of one or the other).\nKizuna Rush: Tap B while Awakened\nChange Crew Member: Up and Down on the D-Pad\nChange Map View: Left and Right on the D-Pad\nReset Camera: LB\nSet Target: LT\n\nI'm a huge One Piece fan, so this game is pure bliss.","August 28, 2015","true","28.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Be warned.\n\nThe game itself is a superb addition to the dynasty warrior styled games. Gameplay is smooth, and the games optimization is really good. At this point in time, there is talk of developers working to fix the PS3 like graphics. While the graphics look like it belongs in last gen gaming, it still looks amazing. Missions are fun and the world of One Piece translate well into a dynasty warrior game.\nThe only real drawback of this game is the local co-op. While it works well and is entertaining, in my experience it was a major issue trying to get everything working, and ended up taking roughly 30 minutes to fix. In my experience, I had to emulate one controller to a PlayStation 3 controller (Using Motioninjoy AKA DS3), and had one XBOX ONE controller with default settings. Only at this point was I able to get the game working for 2 controllers.\n\nWhile lacking some key events in the story, this game is superb and all around a blast to play.\nIf you like One Piece, this should be a sure buy.","August 29, 2015","true","59.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

They get grind-heavy, they're hack and slash, and can become repetitive for the average gamer. If you're looking for more of the same, you're in luck. Compared to other Warriors titles, the combos feel fluid and the combat is more dynamic. Sadly, movement hinders the game and feels clunkier than other Warriors titles, and there are a few problems with the PC version, which is sadly not out of character for Koei Tecmo ports. If you have the option, get the PS4 version.\n\nPOSITIVES+ It's a very fun take on an existing series, Dynasty Warriors\n+ Lots of on-screen enemies\n+ Follows the series' story pretty closely\n+ Collectibles for completionists\n\nNEGATIVES- Awful camera controls for keyboard\n- Graphic options are limited\n- Movement feels clunkier compared to another recent Warriors title, Hyrule Warriors\n- No online co-op\n- Just inferior to the PS4 version, hands down","August 27, 2015","true","125.6"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

With a controller I believe that this would be playable but at the moment I am unable to enjoy having to hold L for 2 seconds evertime I want to look the other way. It could at least offer a camera lock so the camera moves depending on the way I'm facing but there doesn't seem to be any. Once I get a controller it will be fine but they really should have at least given you the option to control the camera with the mouse.\n\nThe games graphics for the characters are great but the scenery is disguisting. These graphics are ones I'd expect for a game which is 8 years old, not one just released today. The scenery didn't even look like it was 480p. Apparently this port isn't even a port from the PS4, it's a PS3 port! Not upgrading the graphics for the PC is one thing but porting the worst version is another!\n\nThe combat is fun but because of the other two issues above I am unable to fully enjoy it. If you have a PS4 get it on that, I'm almost 100% sure I'd love the hell out of it. I'm not not recommending the game because it's bad, I'm only not recommending the PC version because it appears to be inferior to the PS4 version. Not only will you play it better but it will look better and you'll be able to play online with people rather than just co-op.\n\nThat being said if you are fine with the graphics and have a controller then I don't see anything wrong with the game. It runs really well so you won't have issues with that. I'm a huge fan of One Piece so I really want to enjoy it. I'll surely get it again once it has gone down because £40 for it seems to much for me at the moment.","August 27, 2015","false","1.9"," 58 of 134 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","58","134","3","11"

Having compared the two versions gameplay wise there's no difference aside from the lack of Online MP on PC. Graphically, they both have their own strengths and weaknesses. So my review remains pretty much the same.  Cool game regardless of platform.\n\nEDIT: There seems to be issue with the current PC version not saving controller options when using a gamepad and there's also apparent issue with the graphics settings not updating when changing them in the options. If these things matter to you then perhaps wait for a fix before purchase.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3dCXMlpaeI\n\nText Version:\n\nToday we’re taking a look at Omega Force’s One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 which for the first time sees the outlandish cast of character appear on the PS4 and PC. It has been almost two years since the last game on PS3 and so the question one has to ask is, aside from the visual upgrade, is it worth jumping in for more of the same hack and slash gameplay.\n\nIn a nutshell yes, if you’re making the transition from PS3 to PS4 or jumping in on the PC, that’s a given, for PS3 gamers there’s perhaps less of an incentive unless you’re a sucker for the extra story elements. The core gameplay remains pretty much the same, with Omega Force’s trademark actions making themselves well known here.\n\nFor the uninitiated, players can tackle Luffy’s story across 22 stages where the onus is on fighting in open environments against a slew of regular forces and more powerful captains with some boss characters thrown in for good measure. There’s a few combos players can utilize and as the story progresses more moves become available. There’s no block button per se but an evasive move which also doubles up as a means of closing the gap between your character and any locked on target. It’s all straight forward and with the option to team up with secondary characters for devastating attack moves or Kizuna attacks and the choice to build up powerful specials there’s enough options to keep the game from being too repetitive and allowing for a bit of individual flair. That said, players who simply wish to button mash can do so with ease and still come out on top due to the forgiving nature of each stage. The only real spanner in the works is the slight tactical elements where players need to stay focused on events that happen during the skirmishes which require being in a certain location for special sequences or aiding an ally before they get taken out. This aspect is a mainstay of Omega Force’s games and certainly makes each stage much more challenging although failure does mean restarting the entire level from the beginning.\n\nOne Piece Pirate Warriors 3 offers a wide range of characters to play with (37 to be precise), across its two main modes of play which are the story based Legend Log and Dream Log. The former also allows for free play where any unlocked character can take on completed stages. Essentially though each mode plays out the same with the core gameplay and unlockables being consistent across each mode which is neat. Players can earn cash to upgrade characters, or purchase extras such as additional costumes, music and movie sequences. The coins also make a return which are essentially the game’s skill levelling feature.\n\nIn terms of visuals, the game ups the ante quite a bit over the last game with an overall level of sharpness bringing the characters and on-screen enemies to life with much more clarity than before. The 60 frames per second smoothness is also well apparent on the PS4 with very little to slow it down even when the screen is filled with masses of enemies and regardless of whether they are just standing around doing very little. That said, it’s pretty satisfying to unleash powerful attacks which send large groups of enemies flying across the screen which for some reason doesn’t get old.\n\nThe One Piece characters are well animated where players are treated to numerous scenes before and during the stages which adds a bit more personality to the gameplay. Expect lots of crying, snotty noses and shouting here as there’s some excellent use of visual effects and manga style still images interspersed with animated sections making for amusing and entertaining moments throughout. For some, the constant interruption might begin to grate – although for the less patient the option to skip is offered which is handy especially if replaying a level.\n\nThe audio is a love or hate it area which has to be said is drenched in Japanese with English only making itself known via subtitles and in the menus. However, the voice overs regardless of their origin are excellent and performed with an intense variety. So even if the native tongue isn’t understood, it’s obvious some great talent has been used to bring the diverse set of characters to life. Sure, a complete localization in English as an option would have been nice, but then again, there’s a certain charm listening to the original Japanese voices. Aside from the voice overs, there’s a usual assortment of sound effects and background music which is pretty much standard fare.\n\nIn terms of length, there’s quite a bit on offer here, the Legend Log alone will take up to 15 hours to beat (or more) with some stages lasting 40 minutes and longer. Players then have the choice of upgrading unused characters with earnings, which again takes time, alongside just replaying the game with a different character if desired – especially as each one has their own style to mess around with. The Dream Log mode extends the same flavours as the Legend Log but with specific challenges and bosses to overcome across a set of islands. The core fighting gameplay remains, but the mission structure is slightly more condensed here and makes for a neat extra to play with.\n\nPlayers can also team up locally for split screen play for up to two players and if the wider online community is your thing then there’s the option to tackle the Legend Log stages with others via creating or searching for games. Players can also request assistance from others at any time in a persistent rescue request option.\n\nOne Piece Pirate Warriors 3 certainly makes its mark on the PS4 as a worthy entry for the series. PS3 gamers might feel a bit short changed in terms of there being little new here. However, with an abundance of entertaining characters and amusing new scenes following much of Luffy’s story fused with compelling simplified gameplay makes it an accessible game despite following Omega Force’s usual formula which they have used for years now. There’s obviously quite a bit of gameplay repetition here, but a healthy cast of characters and progression makes up for it in many ways. Whilst hack and slash games of this ilk aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, fans of One Piece will love the transition to PS4/PC here despite the lack of English voices and probably need no encouragement to buy the game. Anyone else on the fence will find a neat game filled to the brim with content that’s worth picking up if you’re in need to let off some steam and just attack masses of enemies over and over again.","August 27, 2015","true","4.6"," 77 of 179 people (43%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","43","77","179","12","9"

Even if you finished a lot of quests in a short period of time, all the characters have to say their lines before you can move on and might get another quest, to finish the map. Bit slow for my taste, especially if you try to get all the coins, characters, dream log islands, treasures, etc.\n\nIf you love One Piece, enjoy the Dynasty Warriors game style and only want to buy 1 game in a couple months. This game might be for you, because there is a TON of stuff to collect and characters to improve.\n\nPS: Check the wiki if you want to know a bit more about the game before buying: http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/One_Piece:_Pirate_Warriors_3#Playable_Characters","January 9","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game works very well for a port from the playstation 4, however there are some issues if you plan on using an xbox controller instead of a ps4 controller. This is fixable but is an issue. The game covers the story of One Piece all the way up to Dressrosa. So if you are interested in One Piece but don't want to play catch up on the anime you can play this game and have a very good summary of the main points in the series up till now.\nThe gameplay is typical warriors style gameplay. If you don't like beat'em ups you probably won't like this game. I have not run into many bugs (Aside from the controller issue mentioned above) and the game seems to run pretty smooth on my old gtx 560 rig. So it is definitely a good game that I would reccomend to fans of One Piece and any person who enjoys a good beat'em up.","January 5","true","95.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But even after beating the story there is the dream log, this is where you can team up with some of the most random assortment of charecters and fight to unlock stroger characters to play as. Controls can be a bit awkward, especially on keyboard. But if your patient you will learn to play the game enjoyably, as for crashes and bugs I havent run into any during my playthrough. If you havent played any game from the franchise (Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Gundam, Hyrule Warriors) then you might be disapointed in the lack of variety in what you do, you run around, beat people up, take over areas etc. If your the completionist type this will be quite a long road, due to the fact you will have to replay certain levels if you dont get S rankings on the first try. It all boils down to a simple game that I personaly very cassualy play, if your looking for something to entertain you for a while this is a good choice. As for port I have played on PS4 and it was better but not of too much significance, it doesnt matter too much which one you buy it for.","February 17","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can get past the fact that this PC port was inteded for the PS3 version so it looks like ♥♥♥♥ and does not have online multiplayer then chances are you will also have a lot of fun like I do.\n\nIt's a great game IMO but if you have a PS3 or PS4 just get it for those consoles they did not put in a lot of effort into the PC port","April 5","true","63.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, this is a Dynasty Warriors game with a One Piece paint job. As a someone who enjoys the Dynasty Warriors gameplay and is a fan of One Piece, I am pleased with how they were merged for this game. The story line is a decent retelling of the One Piece plot up to Dressrosa. There are many characters to play as, fast and fluid gameplay, and a large set of extra missions to be played beyond the story campaign.\nOn the other hand, it is entriely subbed. If you like the japanese voice acting, you're in luck. If you'd rather hear it in english, tough cookies. The keyboard control is complete garbage, get a controller or don't even bother. Speaking of controllers, you can play co-op with split monitor if one person is playing with a controller and the other uses the mouse/keyboard. It plays like a proper DW game should and art style (while again, inferior to the console release) is nice, colorful, cartoony look that compliments the anime style. I really want to recommend this game, as I have derived several hours of single player amusement from it, but the lack of online co-op makes this a tough sell on the PC. As it stands, it is a lazy barebones port. If you are like me and don't own a new console, this will be a decent Dynasty Warriors game for any fan of One Piece, otherwise I suggest you pass this one up.","February 28","true","92.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagerofelements/recommended/331600/","jagerofelements","Saul | APP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagerofelements/","131 products in account","One Piece Pirate Warriors 3 is Dynasty Warriors fused with the greatness of One Piece. You can play as the crew members from the first arc being "Romance Dawn" all the way to the one of the most recent arcs the "Dressrosa Arc." I will give some pros and cons to the game to help others decide if the game is worth it and believe me, it is.\n\nWARNING: there may be spoilers of the story from here on.\n\nPros:\n-You can play as any Strawhat and many others. Though some characters can only be played after you unlock them. You do so by playing the story which is the main focus of the game.\n-You get to play through the storyline to one of the most recent manga arcs.\n-When you are bored, you have a game mode that gives you random objectives to take over islands and face powerful enemies.\n-If you don't want to play Luffy in Romance Dawn (which is the only character you have available in story mode), you can play any other character in another mode.\n-Though the game's graphics are locked at PSVita graphics, the game still looks good.\n-Co-op in story mode is available though I have not tried it.\n-On my computer that overheats with powerful games, the game runs fast, has great fps, and doesn't get hot.\n-It's fun fighting in Gear 2nd.\n-If you want to get every coin, beat every island, the story mode, and get the full pictures... it may take awhile. Replay value!\n-Though it is slightly confusing, the team moves are pretty cool. I just want to know how they assist me when they are on the other side of the map. 0-0\n-Some character are not fun to play and some are. But I have a feeling some people may like characters I don't like. Though some people would rather like all characters, I feel this is needed. (In my case, I hate how Pre Timeskip Usopp fights).\n\nCons:\n-Certain parts of story mode are NOWHERE to be seen. I never saw Dragon save Luffy, I never got to see Luffy befriend Hancock, and much more.\n-I'd love to have a versus mode where I can say, On my team I have Luffy, Law, and Shanks and on the enemy team I have Buggy, Whitebeard, and Blackbeard. That way I can choose the fight instead of having random battles in the island mode.\n-For some reason, I can't play the game with my headset and MUST play it with my speakers. I get an error whenever I use my headset and I have seen fixes, that don't work.\n-The game was made before the Dressrosa Arc finished so it's Arc is apparently made up and doesn't have the actual real finish.\n-I'd like Gear Third to NOT be just a single attack. I want to actually fight having my body inflated instead of it being a punch followed by a kick.\n-Characters I'd love to play aren't available and some characters I care less about are. I mean why can't I play as Coby or Arlong? You can fight with them or fight them, but that is it.\n-Nightmare Luffy should have totally been a playable character in his arc. I don't care if I could play him outside it or not, he is badass. xD\n\nNeutral:\n-The game is totally in Japanses. I don't mind what voice it is in but it's kinda weird having people hear the japenese voices and judging me. lol\n-The game doesn't have co-op in other areas like the handheld apparently. I don't care since I love the game.\n-Again, the game was suppose to have better graphics and when released, didn't. Many people give negative reviews over THIS. I don't think the game looks bad and yes, they could be better... but I don't judge a game on JUST graphics. In face, I find it has it's own charm. If they fix it, yay. If not, oh well. ;p\n-The game will spoil but it gives you a general idea on the story (EVEN THOUGH SOME THINGS SHOULD BE IN IT). I'd suggest actually watching the anime (in japanese with subtitles) and catching up on the manga before playing but hey, not everyone likes that stuff.\n-Combat is repeatative but I find mindless fighting fun. Some missions are oddly difficult (like the Fist of Love Arc) and others are easy. Some arcs are long and some are short. Overall, I like how this fact and it's a FUN time waster. You don't find many of those.\n\nOverview: Overall the game has some problems and many great additions. I'd recommend this game any day even in it's current shape. For those that want to complete eveything, you have a long road ahead of you and I hope the game gains many One Piece fans that will enjoy the anime (both english and japanese with subtitles) and many manga fans that haven't given the series a chance.\nLet us hope that the next game has a certain powerup for Luffy and a few more arcs in the New World (where this game only has 1 and an arc with a false ending). Oh and have a great Year of Sanji. lol","February 4","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there are enough game-breaking bugs that I cannot recommend this game.\n\nI am only at the Alabasta arc in the regular story, but all of the fancy cutscenes that aren't in-game graphics go straight to black screens. I can't watch them, only skip them. I have several times that I'll be in the prematch loading screen and it swaps it out for the loading screen for the main menu and cancels out the prep I made for each match.\n\nThe gameplay is fun. The story is abbreviated but still well done thus far. The characters are all spot on and the animations are also appropriate. That said,  there are enough bugs just after a few hours worth of play to feel annoyed and disappointed.  I really want to like this game, but when I can't view half of the cutscenes in a game it pretty much ruins the development of the characters.\n\nUnfortunately,  I cannot recommend this game in this state. It truly needs some form of patching or consistency update. If it gets that, I will definitely come back and update.  Until then though, it's another unfortunate no.\n\nEdit:  I can recommend this game now. It does have lots of issues still present, but making sure the drivers are up to day is important. I failed that and then fixed it to where the game now runs at an acceptable level.","October 7, 2015","true","37.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nasurambo/recommended/331600/","nasurambo","Nasoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nasurambo/","177 products in account","There are three things you should consider when planning to buy this game:\n\n- The story follows the key battles in One Piece all the way until Dressrosa. With some bonus content. The story has been cut a bit so that it can fit into the chapters and whatnot in this game, but it doesn't really bother you as much if you can fill the in-betweens with your own knowledge. As such, being a fan of One Piece is highly recommended.\n\n- This is a console port, and so having a controller is almost a must. I could never see myself playing this game comfortably using nothing but my keyboard and my mouse. But that's how it is for nearly every fighting game, so if you're considering getting this game, you should already own one.\n\n-I've never played any games of this type, as in, Dynasty Warriors. So this was a completely new kind of game for me, which might've altered my view on it a bit.\n\nAll in all it's nothing to click your tongue at. If you're a fan of One Piece you should consider buying it. There are tons of characters in the game and a lot to do until you feel like you've actually finished it. And there's apparently room for a second player in the game as well but I've yet to try that, so I'll not comment on that either.\n\nMost people also run into some problems when launching the game and when watching cutscenes, but there are solutions to these problems on online forums if you know where to look.\nAnd make sure to use the game backup function every now and then as there is no Cloud on this game. At least yet. Hopefully it's still in the works and soon in our use.","January 8","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game crashes if you attempt to change the graphic settings, resolution resets to 640x360 if you full screen it before picking correct resolution, no V-sync option and only partial controller support.

The partial controller support honestly isn't too much of an issue to me as I played through PW and PW2 so am familiar with the controls already, but it is a tad annoying that there isn't full support in the game.

But even after beating the story there is the dream log, this is where you can team up with some of the most random assortment of charecters and fight to unlock stroger characters to play as. Controls can be a bit awkward, especially on keyboard. But if your patient you will learn to play the game enjoyably, as for crashes and bugs I havent run into any during my playthrough. If you havent played any game from the franchise (Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Gundam, Hyrule Warriors) then you might be disapointed in the lack of variety in what you do, you run around, beat people up, take over areas etc. If your the completionist type this will be quite a long road, due to the fact you will have to replay certain levels if you dont get S rankings on the first try. It all boils down to a simple game that I personaly very cassualy play, if your looking for something to entertain you for a while this is a good choice. As for port I have played on PS4 and it was better but not of too much significance, it doesnt matter too much which one you buy it for.","February 17","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its easy enough to set the controls your self. However, even  though there are just enough button on a controller for you to use most of the commands, the second set of shoulder buttons arent programmed in so you lose 2 necessary button.\n\nEdit:I originally rated this as reccomended but I made this review before playing much of the game. now thatas I have, I am updating my review. The controls are still stupid, but now the game just repeatedly crashes during the second mission of the second chapter.  A quick check of the forums will show that I am not the only one having this issue and there has been no support for the game since release. I wasted my money on this thing.

I thought that I had significantly less because of work and life and etc... But I digress. It is a really fun slash and hack game that One Piece fans will love. A LOT! Many different characters ranging from the well-in-the-spotlight ones such as Trafalgar Law, Luffy (unbelieveable right?), and Buggy to the smaller characters such as Perona and Monett are playable. The more you play a character, the more moves that will be unlocked. And boy are there some flashy ones. There is a neat little leveling system and coin collection that allows you to boost individual characters too.\nAs for the storyline. Well. It is pretty much a summary of the One Piece story so far. It does not go into to much detail, but it will bring back some great memories of the show. The Comic/Mangaish style of art and transitions flows well and is pleasing to the eye in my opinion. Oh, and the opening kinda twisted at my heart when I saw Luffy, Sabo, and Ace fighting side by side. Like I said earlier. Once Piece fans will love this game.\n\nBUT one very important thing to keep in mind before buying this is that you NEED a controller to play it well. I say need because just using a keyboard will be a nightmare (I tried... trust me).\nWell that's it for my crummy, rambly, review. Buy it, play it, love it. (And have a clock visible while playing. One loses track of time way too quickly when playing this).\n\nNow Excuse me as I spend the rest of the night... Morning... holy ♥♥♥♥ its morning alrealy... playing as Perona... or Law... Both...

Many "minor" characters don't even make cameo appearances (Encounter with the bandits/seaking, Nojiko/Nami's tatoo incident, Patty/Carne, Laboon, Whiskey Peak...).

I thought that I had significantly less because of work and life and etc... But I digress. It is a really fun slash and hack game that One Piece fans will love. A LOT! Many different characters ranging from the well-in-the-spotlight ones such as Trafalgar Law, Luffy (unbelieveable right?), and Buggy to the smaller characters such as Perona and Monett are playable. The more you play a character, the more moves that will be unlocked. And boy are there some flashy ones. There is a neat little leveling system and coin collection that allows you to boost individual characters too.\nAs for the storyline. Well. It is pretty much a summary of the One Piece story so far. It does not go into to much detail, but it will bring back some great memories of the show. The Comic/Mangaish style of art and transitions flows well and is pleasing to the eye in my opinion. Oh, and the opening kinda twisted at my heart when I saw Luffy, Sabo, and Ace fighting side by side. Like I said earlier. Once Piece fans will love this game.\n\nBUT one very important thing to keep in mind before buying this is that you NEED a controller to play it well. I say need because just using a keyboard will be a nightmare (I tried... trust me).\nWell that's it for my crummy, rambly, review. Buy it, play it, love it. (And have a clock visible while playing. One loses track of time way too quickly when playing this).\n\nNow Excuse me as I spend the rest of the night... Morning... holy ♥♥♥♥ its morning alrealy... playing as Perona... or Law... Both... All of them!","May 5","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good progression system and active combat.\n\nWhere it falls short is the story.  The original One Piece has THE best plot.  Unfortunately in this game many parts of the story are skipped or only brought up by a sentence or two.  Many "minor" characters don't even make cameo appearances (Encounter with the bandits/seaking, Nojiko/Nami's tatoo incident, Patty/Carne, Laboon, Whiskey Peak...).  And because of the missing links, the story that was presented seem very out of place at times and will be hard to follow for players unfamiliar with the series.\n\nThat being said, this is an excellent pick up if you're an One Piece fan.  I only wish Koei would add the full story like Treasure Cruise on the mobile.","May 9","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So i give 85% after beat it you can get a challenge in super hard mode. The dream mode is nice, many islands, many strange teams and fights, but that you cant select or support characters at start or see which are possible, are a bit sad. The nightmare mode is good to test your strategies. What i dont like is the high steps to reach level 51+ you need all coints to get higher, not each coin give you 10 levels more, some are strange like playing Lysop vs CP9 but you cant pick him in that level and the leveling brings only a very low extra help for level 100 nightmare mode. What i miss is Steam Cloud / Back Up Saving, you have only 1 Safe File and if its get lost you can start from new (me after 34 hours) and not even 5 Trading Cards. The intro is good, the animations are okay, the extras ? are fine, but the DLC are expensive, there would be a new characters or some more specials better new powerful abitlities/ characters or maps. This potenial wasnt used. The game is for hack and slay + One Piece fans fine (90%) or for hack and slay(75%), One Piece Fans (73%) this game could get fast boring, sure every character has many combos but mostly the strategy is just hit hit hit and sometimes you lose only 1 mission and 20 min are completly for nothing, no check points, no 2nd chance, nothing, thats frustrating, but for me this game could be much better so i give only 57 %. For achievement hunters i give 53 % they are easy but the last ones need much time and that for only 40 achievements, is a bit less, there could be much more step achievements (each 5 islands, each 5 character level 5) or many other possible things.
