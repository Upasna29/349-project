The texture in this game appears to have had thought and care put into it. All the content feel connected and well integrated. None of the assest in the game seem out of place and but have a polished feel as if they have great repect for their work not just thrown together. Gameplay is simple and easy to get familar with no complicated controls and simple fun game objectives. The game itself feels like Team Fortress 2 had a mythical baby and we got this game its simplistic straight forward content is well placed and blends well. Characters and Enviorment fits perfectly and feel natural together.\n\nAs far as my Cons I refer to is not mean't to discourage anyone to buy this game it is more of a feedback to the Devs to make this game better then what it already is. In my honest opinion this game is a must buy if you want a game that is enjoyable even in Early Access. These Devs shows what Early Access games are suppose to be and not as a excuse to throw garbage at a consumer grab your money and walk away. Keep up the great work guys and all the best to you for a enjoyable game.\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com\nYou're also welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified Group\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","May 22","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaminggurugabe/recommended/440280/","gaminggurugabe","GamingGuruGabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaminggurugabe/","62 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off let me say that the game has amazing potential and I really hope it takes that potential and runs with it to create the fun, rewarding game I know it can be.\n\nPro's:\n1. Skill Based Combat : Aiming/Timing is key in this game especially when playing a ranged base character. There is plenty of room for players to outplay one another and I love that and im sure plenty of other pvp junkies do too. Nothing like going in a fight with low hp and out playing a full hp player.\n\n2. Variety: There are 4 different classes to choose from, with plans to add more in the future. Each class has a choice of a few weapons each with a variety of effects from slowing people with auto attacks to burning them over time etc... On top of each class having different weapons they each have the ability to choose two skills out of a list of a couple of skills adding a huge variety of gameplay styles mixing and matching skills and weapons.\n\n3. Gameplay Modes/Map Variety: There are several modes to choose from, ranging from a control point to last man standing and others. There also is a handfull of unique maps to play on with a nice unique medieval twist.\n\nCon's:    *Note this is a Early Access game so I understand bugs and whatnot are to be expected, just some thoughts on what i feel needs some love*\n\n1. Bot AI can use a little bit of work, occasionally i've seen them get stuck or fall off maps. Also they can sometimes take a while to find each other when it comes down to only bots left. For the most part though they aren't too bad and do occasional suprise me with some nasty combos\n\n2. Balancing: I know its early access and I would love to see a few tweaks to certain skills etc... Not to worried about this the devs seem very active and open to feedback and im sure in due time well get some balance changes. But for the most part I seem to be able to kill any of the other classes with any class.\n\nSo overall I think this game has HUGE potential and look forward to seeing how it develops over the course of its early access cycle. I can not wait to play ranked games against other players and climb the leaderboards or level my class to earn class based rewards, features i've heard that will eventually be coming our way. I'd give the game a solid 8/10 with potential to be a 10/10 as it progresses. This game truly does have the potential to be a pvp junkies paradise!","April 21","true","8.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But I feel the developers must do something about its price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/440280/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSteamified are proud to welcome Hydrant Games to the Steamified family with the feature of their debut game, Overpower. The developers are a two man team who made this game, completely unfunded, out of the sheer love and dedication to RPG games and PvP combat. They draw their inspirations from their favorite childhood games that include Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, Secret of Evermore, and Secret of Mana. Further inspiration has been born from the MMO scene including EverQuest, Final Fantasy XI, and the indomitable World of Warcraft. The final pièce de résistance comes from their affection of shooters such as Counter-Strike, Quake and Unreal Tournament.\n\nHaving gained an appreciation of the knowledge and passion of gaming that Adam, a career graphic artist, and John, an experienced programmer, have and having similar experiences myself I was excited to play their game. The ideology that they have for their game is something that a significant number of players in MMO communities have wanted to play for many years. Therefore I can argue that there is a sizable target player base for the game. It would be up to the execution and the marketing power of the small team to realize their achievement. Both are vitally important to the success of a game such as this given that there have been great multiplayer games die because of a lack of a community and it goes without saying that bad games die very quickly unless they become cult classic because of how poor they are.\n\nUnfortunately, the servers were almost completely empty when I went to play the game. Not a good sign. On the very fortunate bonus side, however, the devs have clearly understood that garnering a player base especially early on was going to be a difficult achievement so they created bots so that any single player could log onto a server and immediately get into a game. Unlike other games that I have recently played that have implemented bots the bots in this game are relatively intelligent to the point of being tough to kill. There are times where their intellect leaves a little bit to be desired but this was rare in my experience. Also, unfortunately, the one time that I got into a game with another player I noticed him transport from one end of the arena to the other just as I was about to kill them. Given that we were the same class and that there is no ability that does this all I can put it down to is hacking. A disappointing experience.\n\nIn regards to the servers I am thankful that they are another developer who have decided that an Australian server is a wise investment. Having a healthy ping is of vital importance in this type of game so possessing the ability to play locally is important given that timing and aiming are vital. There appears to be local servers around the world for that matter. This inspires me to play the skill and talent based games much more than if I were forced to play on servers that have a constant 250+ ping because of the location.\n\nThere are a number of different game modes but the servers that I have played on – the official servers – have both been set to have team deathmatch where once you die you have to wait until the end of the battle to be able to play again. I didn’t stick around long enough to see if these servers change from game type to game type or whether they are officially stuck at their default setting but I would be hoping that they are on some type of rotation.\n\nAs someone who played warrior I’d love to see our whirling ability set to a hotkey rather than holding the button down to execute the move. Given that other classes have easier to trigger skills that are better than the warrior’s this puts the warrior class at a distinct disadvantage before play even begins. That said friends have also complained that other classes are either overpowered or underpowered so balance seems to be an issue that needs an overhaul. However, it is easy to forget that the game is in early access and balance issues are known to plague early access multiplayer titles so I am certain that the dev team will improve this before retail release.\n\nThe game has yet to be truly Steamified. Achievements and trading cards need to be added to encourage players to purchase the game and until they are I believe that the game will struggle to garner much of a player base.\n\nThere is an online marketplace that sells you cosmetics and similar but there is no need to purchase from it unless you’re a fan of the game and want to put extra money into the game. I do not believe that there is anything in the store that can be seen as giving a player a gameplay bonus aside from appearance.\n\nOverpower is a great concept that needs the continued work from the dev team who are doing just that. It may be a little bit overpriced for what you’re getting at this stage but it has the potential of delivering a valued and enjoyable game by the time that it leaves early access.","May 2","true","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It takes the extremely fun elements of PVP, such as arena in WOW, and combines into a whole new outlook of 3rd person shooter with advanced combat.

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nOvepower\n\nThis is a PVP game currently having 4 classes. There are swappable skills and weapons for each class, each with their own benefit. Game modes I ran into were last man standing team deathmatch and a capture the flag variant.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/440280/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nFun art style\nFluid controls\nCons\nIn need of better balance for skills\nCould not find a live person on any server\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nI tried the classes. I had the most fun with the archer. The quick shot skill is overpowered. Currently the game feels unbalanced - not the kind of asymmetrical balance you'd expect in a game like this (rock paper scissors is an example of asymmetrical balance where you have a strength and a weakness that is "class" based). Hopefully this balance issue is worked on as the game becomes more complete. Another problem I faced was a lack of other players. I tried this game at around 11am central time (GMT -6) on a Saturday and did not see another player in an hour of gamplay. The game will automatically populate the servers with bots allowing "solo" play.\n\nFor a finished game the price might be a good one. When trying to fund a project it might be necessary to evaluate if 3 people might buy it at $5 USD versus 0-1 at $15. Having active players on is key to the success of a PVP game\n\n5/10\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","June 4","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

FPS games have got stale to me as of late; with all the militarized combat and millenials screaming over XBL, this game has breathed some fresh air into an otherwise boring genre. As a lover of most fantasy games (WoW, Zelda, Star Wars,etc.), this game grabbed a ton of elements from the world of magic and allowed me to immerse myself in it while wrecking on the battlefield; very satisfying. If I had to make a suggestion for this game in it's early stages, it would be that I would like to see an expansion of classes soon, a support/hybrid character would add a nice dynamic to the roster.\n\n\nOverpower has carved its own niche in an orignial third-person/fantasy-shooter.

Is this game worth 15 bucks to me personally no. 10 bucks Seems like a fair deal simply because i feel like i have played this game for free. The game was called bierzerkers and the game is completley dead now. But it was still a fun game you get a sheep and had to throw it to score. But the rounds would end so quick before you even get to fight at times. So back to this game.\n\nEarly Access:\nMost games come out and fail, This game was released later than it's origonal date to release. I understand why, and i respect that. They did a good job. I did not find a whole lot wrong with the game but i did not spend hours on it either. Simply Because i feel like i've played it before with a different title on the game.\n\nSo while playing this game i was the dagger guy. I was hacking and slashing everyone. I was killing people in like 1 or 2 seconds and sometimes they kill me in one hit or 1 or 2 seconds. Fast pvp action, if that is your style of game.\n\nGood:\nYou can choose the colors you wear,\nWhat spell abilities you have, What moves you can do.\nFor each of these there are 4 to pick from or at least for the dagger guy there was.\nUnlike bierzerker which was a free game and gave you only the 2 handed weapon guy,\nWhen you buy this game, You have all of them.\nThere is a timer on the matches so you know how long you have to get stuff done.\nThe maps are different, not all the same like bierzerkers game.\nGraphics are very good and i love them.\nI know it sounds like i am comparing Bierzerker and Overpower a'lot but those of you\nwho have played Bierzerkers loved that game and can understand why when you play this\ngame ( Overpower ).\n\nBad:\nWhile playing the game, i felt as if i played this game before and pretty much did as i keep\nrepeating myself.\nSo here we go, while i was playing the game the matches started so fast. I did not have\ntime to really look at my loadout before others started fighting.\nI think there needs to be rounds for the death match not ( Respawn ) over an over. If that\nwas a game mode i did not see it, I only played quick match so if i am wrong please comment.\nSo other people do not get scared away from this.\nI think there needs to be meaning to playing the game, Moves to pick from, skins and all that is\ngreat but it means nothing when there is no leveling or money such as gold to be earned or a\nleader board to brag to your friends about. I did not see any of those things in this game.\nSo i did hop off of it pretty quick.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nYes...\nWhy?\nIf you like Pvp this is streight PvP and fast action.\nIf you want to beat your friends up.\n\nWhy should i not buy this game?\nIf you do not have 15 bucks, or simply do not like PvP games.\n\nTo end my Review, There is not a'lot of bugs i found wrong with this game.\nThe Market place is basically for new skins not to boost your stats because\nthere is no stats. So do not let the Market prices on the add stuff scare you\nfrom this game. Is this a game i will be playing day and night. Probably not.\nBut if i am Tired of playing Arma 3, Yes i will be on this game slashing away\nwith my Daggers.\n\nFor the Devs..... I really wanted to buy like a 2-4 pack to give copies to my friends.\nI think by you guys not allowing that to happen it may hurt the population of this\ngame. So id think of something to allow that to happen. Those 2-4 friends of mine\nmay end up doing the same to get their friends to play and we all win in the end.\nRemember to respect Post good or bad, no matter how much someone has played\nthe game. They still tried the game and are giving their own opinion. This is mine,\nI hope it was helpfull and i hope to kill you one day inside the game of OVERPOWER! :)","April 20","true","4.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

But ultimately I returned the game. I did not like the abilities. I did not feel any difference between any of the weapons you could choose for a given class. The game is all about abilities and using them as much as you can. The warrior class has the War Cry ability that grants you temporary invulnerability and a damage increase based on how much health you are missing. Apparently if you get into a fight and go down to about 10% health you can engage War Cry, and one hit your opponent. Doesn't really scream balanced to me.\n\nTL;DR The game has a fun premise, but at the moment I can't recommend the game until my concerns are fixed. I'd rather have my 12 bucks for the moment.\n\nNote for devs: I know it's called Overpower and you want the game to be about using abilities, but c'mon... You can balance them better than this.","April 24","false","0.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"
