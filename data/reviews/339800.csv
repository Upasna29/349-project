Having only ever dated men, I was very eager to learn more about the experience of dating women and, on this front, found the game very enlightening! I learned a great many things about dating women, such as:\n\nAll women become cranky when hungry and will not speak to you until you buy them food.\nAfter 4 dates, women will send you unsolicited explicit photos even when you never respond to their texts.\nAuthenticity is your enemy. You should only express opinions you think the woman in question also holds.\nWomen enjoy racially-appropriate gifts, regardless of context or previously expressed interest. Also: giving an Indian woman a Native American dress qualifies as "racially-appropriate."\nAfter completing HuniePop I feel like I now have greater insight into dating and sexual politics. I have learned valuable lessons I can apply to my own relationships to become a better romantic partner.

How do I put this.\n\nI showed this to my friends because I thought it was a train wreck of a game, yeah? Turns out one of them had enough disposable income and enough deep seated hatred of me to actually buy it out of the blue for me.\nMy screams of anguish echoing through the house, I installed it while he cackled maniacally in my ear. Then, through Steam's wonderful beta features, I streamed it and he watched me play.\n\nI won't lie: It's a funny game. Throw all the logic you've got stored in your brain case out, and it's good for that at least. The puzzles ramp up strangely well, though really, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing awful at games like that and am not a good metric for the difficulty of them in the slightest. There's racism, specifically from your bubblegum fairy friend, and all the girls are less human beings and more charicatures of what certain human cliques are supposed to be, but that's alright: It makes it even funnier, as long as you don't take it seriously. By the time another friend started watching me play, I was invested, and the three of us laughed our asses off constantly (partially due to our own commentary, partially due to the game).\n\nIt's not BAD. But then again, I'm the kind of person who sits on Newgrounds playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash games all day, so I'm not exactly smart. I will say, however, that it's not some kind of spectacular rainbow coated super game: It's funny. The puzzles are challenging, for lobotomized dickmonkeys like me, and what more do you want? I mean, it's got blatant objectification of women, but we've already established that if you're going to play this you need to turn off the logical and reasonable parts of your brain and basically just go with it.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who's open minded and doesn't get offended easily and you desperately need something to do because, like me, your standard hobbies are slowly becoming less and less fulfilling as you descend into the maw of inevitable insanity, go for it.\n\nIf you're literally anybody else, then take any recommendations with a grain of salt: It's certainly not something everybody will find as amusing as I did.","January 19, 2015","true","28.7"," 1,484 of 1,612 people (92%) found this review helpful 957 people found this review funny","92","484","1","957","25"

A game where you ask girls how big their honkers are, get them drunk, then try to Candy Crush your way to their climax? Really? Yep, really. And it works great.\n\nI started out my adventure deciding I would try to get it on with both of the blondes. My plan works great, until I ask them both their family names and realize they are mother and daughter. I don't know whether to cry or to get turned on. In my confusion I decide to just keep going. Unlocking the secret characters was great fun.\n\nThis game is incredibly sarcastic, and has a lot of great references. Let me paraphrase one of them to you: "Guys keep asking me to put a shoe on my head, I don't get it." The girls in this game are objectified and stereotyped on a large scale, but it's done in a satirical way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/willizord/recommended/339800/","willizord","willizord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/willizord/","377 products in account","This is a game about lying to women as much as you possibly can so you can eventually have sex with them. Your character (who can be male or female, so that's nice) wakes up at the prodding of a voyeuristic nymphomaniac fairy who really, REALLY wants you to get laid. She teaches you the secret to becoming both a dating master and a sex machine... that secret being a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of "Bejeweled". Of course.\n\nThe gameplay is just about everything you can expect from the rather niche "Puzzle Dating Sim" genre. You match tiles, you buy gifts, and you ask/answer the most inane questions the writers could dream up. Your character hasn't got a job: Mr./Ms. Protagonist literally makes all of his/her money from dating women. That's right, your dates are so grateful for your time and your puzzle skills that they'll literally pay you to date them. It leaves one to wonder how the protagonist fed him/herself before a fairy showed up to teach them the ins and outs of dating for cash.\n\nThe girls are likable enough. Even the one that is intentionally unlikable. However, they all unfortunately suffer from crippling Alzheimer's, and will often ask you the same question two or three times in a single hangout session. God forbid you ask them a question more than once, though. Be sure to remember every minute detail they tell you, because you will be quizzed.\n\nEven the most promiscuous of these women will only put out after your fourth successful date with them, and only at night. The resulting "sex scenes" involve playing even more Bejeweled while your partner moans and eventually climaxes at how incredibly hot it is. Their fetish for matching tiles is only matched by the deep shame you'll feel for playing this game.\n\nAt the risk of making you feel dirty whenever you play "Candy Farm Crush Saga Heroes 3: Reloaded" (Though let's be honest, you already do), there is an uncensor patch for this game. It's incredibly easy to find and to install.\n\nI recommend this game under these conditions:\n\n-Is the game on sale?\n-Are you an unabashed weeaboo?\n-Are you fine with having a softcore porn game in your library?\n-Do you want to bang a transdimensional fairy who's old enough to be your great-grandma's great-grandma?\n\nIf you answered "yes" to any of those questions, then you probably already own this game.

In fact, it becomes much more difficult.\n- Chicks dig pretenders. Do NOT try to be yourself. Trust me, it's not gonna work.\n- It's completely OK to ask questions about weight and bra size. Girls expect you to do so.\n- There is little to no reason to ever have anything to do with someone you've already banged. Move on.\n\nHuniePop is pretty much your regular light dating sim. You ask girls generic questions, they in return quiz you to find out if you've paid any attention at all and in the end, if done correctly, you've humped every girl in town. For some reason though it feels more fun than dating sims usually. I'm still trying to determine if it actually is more fun or am I just being fooled to think so.\n\nIf you've played any dating sim before, especially any western-made, you've seen most of this game already. First you're introduced with your mission to get down with every girl you meet. Sometimes it's because you're trying to win a bet, sometimes you're doing it just for the hell of it, sometimes you're getting revenge, and so on, and so on. This time the reason is a magic fairy who comes to your aid because you're a pathetic mess and need to get some poon-tang ASAP. Then you run rampant around the town meeting girls and memorizing trivia you learn from them. Wooing the girls can be made easier by handing them various obtainable gifts.\n\nWhat's different in this game is dating. Instead of putting anything you've learned in actual use, you're playing a round of Bejeweled... Candy Crush... You know, that puzzle game where there's a board full of bricks of different colors and you're supposed to swap bricks to create lines of three or more of same color. You need to get certain amount of points and you have 20 turns to do so. If you succeed, date is successful and your prey likes you a little bit more. However, every time you win a date game, next date becomes more difficult with higher target score. You can improve your in-game skills to get point multipliers, but at some point you're likely to find yourself in a situation where every move has to be magnificent. There's no time limit though, and sooner or later you're gonna understand why.\n\nOnce you've managed to bend your target under your will, it's time to move to your bedroom. Again you're facing your nemesis, the bling-bling puzzle game, but this time it's slightly different. You have unlimited moves, but your score keeps running down to zero. In order to reach your target you need to score faster than your points decrease. During this your conquest stands next to you in her underwear moaning. It's rather peculiar portrayal of intercourse, I must say. It makes you feel like you're rolling all over the place like a tornado, trying to twist and tweak everything you can, as fast as you can. If you can conjure a hysteric state of mind at will, it will be extremely helpful.\n\nThe game is put together very well. Graphics are pretty, background music can run hours without becoming annoying and voice acting is a lot better than you would expect, although sometimes it's difficult to believe that every girl has their own voice actress. Girls have extremely different, yet quite stereotypical personalities. Dialogue varies from hilarious to awkward to annoying, so a lot, but thanks to voice acting you don't want to skip any of it (unless you really hate the girl in question).\n\nThere are some minor nuisances. Once you've done the deed with a girl, there isn't any reason to interact with her again. There are some minor details like costumes and hairstyles you can always try to unlock but nothing that affects gameplay and nothing that matters at all in any way if you're not gonna see that girl anymore, and again, why would you? Item inventory has less space than there are items to obtain. For some reason this becomes quite annoying, especially because there is absolutely no reason to limit the size of inventory. Also, there are Steam cards but no achievements. Personally I would've picked achievements over trading cards, but that's just me.\n\nI still don't know for sure whether HuniePop really is fun or just masked as fun. I'm playing it hours at a time, but I'm not exactly sure why. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It doesn't offer anything I haven't yet seen. If you're familiar with dating sims this one is going to feel familiar right off the bat. I recommend this game, but ONLY if you like the genre or want to find out what dating sims are. Even though it's very generic, it's still very well made and an excellent example of a dating sim. If you've tried dating sims before and haven't liked them, this one is not gonna change that opinion.","January 22, 2015","true","33.9"," 509 of 551 people (92%) found this review helpful 224 people found this review funny","92","509","551","224","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/presidentgoku/recommended/339800/","presidentgoku","President Honoka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/presidentgoku/","850 products in account","When I bought this game, I was not expecting much from it, in fact, I thought it would be nice if I can get around an hour or something. But damn, was I wrong. To be honest, I was really surprised by the fact that the game was actually well made. I'm assuming the game was made by an American developer, and yet, they really seem to understand waifu, moe and hentai factors that exist in the current hentai anime trend. Is that a good thing? For someone like me, yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nIt is basically Bejeweled with dating sim, and my goodness the game is just well made in every possible way.\n\nSince It is basically Bejeweled, if you know how to play that, then you should be able to play. But there are things that you must remember, such as which jewels give you what kind of effects. And honestly, it took me some time to master that, but you should be able to find out eventually as you keep playing. The game gets pretty challenging as it goes, so you will need to get good items and such to make the game easier.\n\nAnd honestly, I would've just given up on the game if it were not for the whole real good dating stuff you can do in the game. You actually can buy girls gifts to please them and also you can get more love from your girls by giving them the right answers to their questions. And by this, it felt as though I actually was dating them, I somehow ended up memorizing those girls' birthdays, last names, etc (Sad, I know -_- but you will be, too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )\n\nAlso, I noticed you actually can get...panties, PANTSU of each girl when you sleep with them. My goodness, can this game get anymore hentai than this? I honestly thought it was such a neat idea, taking away their pantsu. What do those pantsu do? Well, you can use them to unlock something, but in most cases, they are basically meant to be the medals of honor ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I always take a look at those pantsu to make me feel proud of myslef ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)v\n\nAnd I thought it was pretty nice to see that the game has 3 secret girls that you can unlock. I mean seriously? 3 more waifus? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)b\n\nAll I can say is, this game needs a sequel. We want the sequel....no, "I" want the sequel. The only complaint I have would be that, the girls you see in the game and the girls you see on artworks are somewhat kind of different looking. So I really wish this could be fixed in the next game.\n\n\nRating:\n\nI have disappointed my parents out of 10.\n\n\n日本語レビュー\n\n簡単に言えばBejeweledです。しかし、女の子たちとのデートシミュレーションがメインなゲームであり、彼女たちがする質問にちゃんと答えたりとかプレゼントを上げたりとかしなきゃ先に進めないし、絶対購入者のほとんどはそれが目当てでしょうに。( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nゲーム自体はパズルの面で少しずつ難しくなるため、アイテムやステータスを上げる必要があります。きっと途中でやめたくなるかもしれません。「難しすぎる・・・」となってもうここで終わりにしようかとも思ってしまうかもです。しかし、このゲームでは彼女のハートをゲッツし、彼女たちと甘い夜を過ごした後に彼女たちのパンティー（！！！）をゲッツすることができるのです。こんな変態ゲーが今まであったでしょうか？パンティーのとこを見ても「彼女が君と一緒に寝たときに履いてたパンティー」とかマジで完全もうエロ過ぎてあれだよな？何このゲームめっちゃ何かよく分かってるな、おい、マジかよ？何かもう、女の子のパンティーをコレクションできるってどんだけエロいんだよ、開発者、俺もう１２枚集めたからシェンロン呼んで良い？良いよね？（崩壊）\n\n・・・・とにかく、このゲームはそういうヘンタイストたちの心を揺さぶるものがあるのです。問題点と言ったらまぁ、これは日本語が無いと思うので英語ができなきゃちょっとこれを完全に楽しむのは難しいかもです。ちなみに、このゲームには隠しキャラが３人います。そしてその中の一人がネコの女の子で、英語でご主人様になってとか言ってきます（興奮）もう何このゲーム？めっちゃよく分かってんな？おい、こんな子とデートするんだぜ？？おまけにこんな子のパンティーをゲッツできるんだぜ？？しょうもねーゲームだな、おい、どんだけけしからんゲームなんだおいはやく２出して下さい。\n\n\n結果：\n\n十点満点中、「もうとっくにご存知なんだろう？俺は二ポーンのヘンタイワールドから来たヘンタイスト・・・穏やかなニートでありながら激しいエロスによって目覚めた伝説の超戦士・・・・スーパーヘンタイストだーーーーー！！！！！！」\n\n\n・・・・って俺なんちゅうレビュー書いてんねん","March 14, 2015","true","12.3"," 494 of 540 people (91%) found this review helpful 323 people found this review funny","91","494","540","323","0"

A girl could have a DD cup size, be 5'6" and weigh 118 lbs.\n- The girls all seem concerned about their weights, many of them claiming to be dieting or trying to lose the weight despite enjoying junk food/candy/desserts\n- The information you learn about the girls is pretty superficial: "What's your favorite color?", "How tall are you?" and then they expect you to memorize that and you get more points for that... Pretty silly\n- No "date" dialogue; the dates only consist of you playing the Candy Crush game well enough to get to the point threshold. Sometimes they ooo or ahh in response.\n- No jealousy dialogue\n- You literally have no other activities except hitting on these girls and where you go is determined by which girl you want to see\n\nDespite having more wordy cons than pros for this game, I still recommend it because it was different than most visual novel games I've played. It appeals to the common denominator of interactive soft-core hentai lovers, but if you're looking for an involved story with good dialogue, I would say look elsewhere. There is no emotional journey, no growing, you're literally just trying to get with as many different girls as you can. It really bugs me that the protagonist has no identity as well, as I loved that you could play a girl (and the dialogue changes accordingly). The information you learn about the other girls is comprised of nebulous details too, just awful and boring when some of them have children they don't talk to. I'd rather memorize things that matter, like their child's names, or why they hate university, or how they got to be the person they are. Not to mention, some of them just insult you when you ask the stupid questions you have to ask them anyway.\n\nThis game doesn't try to be anything more than what it advertises, though. Even when they advertise you get plenty of "plot", the "plot" must be in quotations because it's more of an illusion that there's a plot. You want sexy pictures? You will get them. You want dialogue choices? You will get them. You want girls moaning as you match icons together? It's there. It's simple and if you're into light-hearted playa sexy time, you'll get it. It's just disappointing for the people who actually play for the story and relationships. I haven't managed to sleep with all of them (I can only play Candy Crush for so long), so if there's an ending where you do see an emotional journey, I apologize as I haven't gotten there yet.\n\nTLDR: Boobs.\n\nEDIT **SPOILER ALERT**: I have finally slept with all the girls. There is no ending or closure that I can see, except for getting the rest of the outfits and hairstyles. Honestly, I would only recommend you sleep with everyone just to get the rest of the CGs, but my claim on lack of story still stands.","January 20, 2015","true","16.9"," 266 of 300 people (89%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","89","266","300","60","11"

I streamed this game straight on twitch for over 12 hours. Got suspended at the 12th hour cause I didn't know that even Steam's censored version still had a lot of porn in it.\n\nThe game itself is well made with good music (except for the carnival BGM) and very high production values all throughout. The clincher is the writing: its excellent; and the full english voice acting is superb. The developer shows self-awareness by giving us realistic-sounding women that swear, drink, and talk about sex and your obvious interest in their lady parts openly.\n\nIf you're looking for your by-the-numbers visual novel with chicks falling into your lap and gameplay comprising of reading / clicking furiously through textboxes and occassionally choosing the right (obvious) answer to please the girl, then this game is not for you.\n\nIf, however, you're up for a challenge and appreciate the occassional naked girl bits, then HuniePop is amazing. This is the Puzzle Quest of anime porn games.\n\nP.S.: This game lends itself to a portable release really well. They should make a PS Vita / Android version.","January 21, 2015","true","38.5"," 160 of 180 people (89%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","89","160","180","27","0"

Unlike the usual dating sims, however, the date spot is chosen randomly, and your success at the date is determined by winning a match-3 puzzle game. Also unlike the usual dating sims, you don’t focus on winning one of the girls, but instead can (and in fact expected to) date all the girls at once, without any negative repercussions.\n\nThe puzzle aspect of the game is top-notch. Among other things, you are required to focus on specific pieces depending on which girl you are dating, and there is a huge selection of power-ups (represented by date gifts), and choosing the ones that work well together is very important for late-game puzzles.\n\nDating sim aspect, however, is kind of lacking. The girls have very distinct personalities and some backstory, but next to none present-time development is happening: as you date the girls you are rewarded with photos and new outfits for them, but your relationship isn’t going anywhere. Meeting new girls and learning more about them is still fun, though.\n\nFinal thing worth mentioning: HuniePop was originally an adult game, and while Steam version is censored, I believe it is still NSFW, which may be off-putting for some people. Those who enjoy adult content, though, will be pleased that it is possible to un-censor Steam version of the game (information about that can be found at Steam forum).\n\nI fully recommend this game to everyone who like match-3 puzzles and isn’t put off by adult content. And while HuniePop isn’t 100% typical dating sim, I believe that dating sim fans will thoroughly enjoy it as well.","January 31, 2015","true","74.0"," 101 of 106 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","101","106","5","0"

Yes sex sells. It sold me. But this game is more than dating sim, it‘s a really hard puzzle game. Of course the main goal is sex.\n\nThe magic sex fairy appears and you start your journey to conquering the girls with only a pack of tissues and a porn magazine in your pocket. You start going on dates with different girls and make your best to seduce them by telling them how you masturbate and so on. Your goal is to have sex with all of them. Well, not at the same time of course. Though it would be nice i guess, a super hardcore mode?\nEvery girl has a different personality and taste. You can talk to them and you must remember their birthdays, favorite time of year, their breast size, hobbies and many more. Also you can give various gifts to them. Like yoga bag, sombrero, happy pills, watering can, vibrator and so on. If you want to have better chances to succeed on a date, you must feed them and most importantly – make them drunk by giving them lots of alcohol.\n\nAfter you ask girl on a date, the color matching puzzle game begins. You must connect 3 or more blocks of the same color to get points. There‘s always one color which gives more points and another one gives less points, depending on the girls personality. Each personality corresponds to a different color. In addition to getting the girls drunk you take a few gifts with you, which could increase the count of some blocks, depending on the gift. One date is not enough to get into girls panties. You‘ll need 5 successful dates for this, and believe me it‘s difficult. One wrong move and you can forget about seeing those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tonight. Same as in real life. There are broken heart blocks and if you connect them the score goes down so far that it‘s practically impossible to succeed at the date after that. And to succeed at this game is almost same as hard as in real life. After each successful date the girls send you a sexy picture. With time the pictures become more and more revealing and you know you‘re getting closer to your goal. And when you finally get into bed with a girl it simulates the sex very accurately, you'll see when you get there.\n\nHonestly i don‘t know how this game got on steam, but steam needs more sex themed games. Valve could make an adult section where maybe only people with credit card information would be allowed or something like that.\nI can recommend this game to people who want something funny and completely wrong. Don‘t take it seriously (same goes for my review, don‘t get offended by it, i‘m just trying to match the mood of the game in my review), the game is about having fun. I know some people hate games like this, but to each their own. I love variety, i play very different games and i‘m not judging anyone if they play games i don‘t like. The game is aimed to male audience of course, i doubt women would find this game interesting. But it would be interesting to see similar game for female audience.\n\n\nPros:\n\nSex\nBoobs\nFunny dialogues\n\nCons:\n\nNo DLC","March 1","true","6.9"," 95 of 102 people (93%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","93","95","102","37","13"

The puzzle mechanics are basically a slightly easier version of candy crush with each puzzle piece playing a distinct role for the "date." The girls themselves are very varied in personality and in looks and each requires different techniques to "succeed" with them (if you know what i mean ;)) The characters are really well voice acted (compared to other dating sims) and there is a lot of art used in the game.\n\nThe only negative thing i can really say about the game is with the main character (you) are slowely and methodically being transformed into a player by a love fairy (who you eventually date as well). But that is does not at all ruin the fun of the game and I highly recommend.\n\n10/10 would date again :D\n\nAlso, here is the exteded video discussion of the game:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPZkOZVjWgw","January 19, 2015","true","32.0"," 140 of 173 people (81%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","81","140","173","17","3"

Do you long for the joy of human interaction, to know the touch of another person? Of course you don't. You're a wibblyboo. You are proud, strong, and foreveralone.\n\nAnd HuniePop is here for you.\n\nJust about every waifu stereotype is lined up here for your perusal. There are some fun interactions but very little 'sim' gameplay. The HunieBee makes it borderline impossible to screw up, informing you of everything from names all the way to the sorts of gifts that will get you into dem shorts the fastest.\n\nNOT SO FAST, says HuniePop. You may have gotten her all steamed up and good to go with your timely offering of a spatula that you just happened to have on your person, but a woman is not some easily-bought ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can just pick up like that. The real way to a girl's heart lies through the mystic ritual of match-3 voodoo. For some reason.\n\nThis is at least fun and you already know how it works. Match the colors, make smart usage of the special power tokens to give the girls the vapors, and then spray your load of +numbers and beepboop sounds all over their nubile young bodies, leaving them reeling, blushy, and eager to slob on your pixel knob.\n\nMasterfully display your command of tile-matching and you will eventually get them to take their clothes off and give it up for your alpha male stylings. Censored, of course! We can't have the sight of an exposed ♥♥♥♥♥♥ distracting us from our murder simulations. If this riles you up like the red-blooded porn aficionado you are, it is fortunately very easy to decensor the game (check the forums to see the stickied post from the devs with simple instructions.)\n\nBut srsly. The game knows what it is and it knows what the target audience wants. Luckily, it has managed to make this pandering a surprisingly fun romp for just about anyone who enjoys puzzle stuff and bare-bones social sims. Some of the characters even end up likable whether you want to bone them or not, aided by some pretty decent voice acting.\n\nIs gud? Is gud. u buy nao.

(Pretty sure I have the uncensored version too, unless Steam got lenient over the years.)\n\nTo be honest, this game's more of a Puzzle/RPG with girls since you can level stats and what-not but to call it a dating system is a stretch.

That all changes the day that you get visited by the sexy, scantily clad dating fairy who vows to teach you how to play the field and promises that with her help you’ll go on dates and get laid. From there the “Yukki”-esque fairy teaches you the core gameplay mechanics which aren’t that too different from other puzzle games in the vein of Bejeweled. You go on dates that consist of the puzzles where you connect three or more of the various colored balls and earn “Affection” points, and you can earn bonus “Affection” points by paying attention to the girls personality and focusing heavily on the color balls that she desires most. You are tasked with reaching a set level of Affection points to pass the level and have a successful date, however with every successful date you have, the level of Affection points required for the next date becomes significantly higher which certainly adds to the difficulty considering you are limited to 20 moves per date. In addition to the colored ball tokens, there are also bell tokens which give you an extra turn, heart tokens which increase your passion level that increases the affection points you get when you connect the colored balls, sentiment tear drops that allow you to use various items, and purple broken heart tokens that sap affection points from your date and can be truly devastating to a date. At the conclusion of each date both successful and failure dates, you are awarded “Munies” that you can use to spend on food, drinks, and gifts for your dates.\n\nAs you talk to the girls and successfully choose the right dialog branch you are awarded “Hunie” which is used to upgrade your traits that give you bonuses and allow you to perform better in the puzzle dates. It’s sad, because one of the games both strongest and weakest points are the dialog, for both the cut scenes and dialog trees. The dialog is really what makes this game worth playing…It will make you laugh, cringe, and blush, however it becomes repetitive very quickly, and spending time with any one girl for too long will cause the dialog to loop back around and start recycling itself.\n\nWith each successfully date; you earn a “heart” in the girls love progression bar. Once you reach either 4 or 5 hearts depending on how into you the girl is, if you successfully pass a date puzzle at night then things will get disappointingly hot and heavy. You’ll finally get laid and the sex mini-game puzzle is just merely a puzzle similar to the ones you’re used to only with no limit on your number of turns, you have to rapidly connect the colored ball tokens to combat the decreasing Affection points bar  all the while your date is moaning and egging you on. Upon completion of the mini-game you are awarded a semi-nude sexual photo of your date that gets added to your photo album. The fact that that’s as far as the game is willing to push the envelope is a little disappointing, If you are going to make a game that focuses on this type of subject matter and the entire goal of the game is to have sex…then there should have been more of a payoff than there was.\n\nBesides the puzzles and dialog, the game also features a very large amount of “Plot”. The Plot is very well animated and the various image stills you receive in the game are all very well illustrated. The only issues some may run into with the “plot” is that the steam version is censored, but this can be easily remedied if you so desired with a patch released by the devs.\n\nThe game successfully delivers a fairly solid puzzle dating sim that is delivered with the look and feel of a visual novel. The game is held back however by its sub-par voice acting, repetitive dialog, and less than climactic climax scenes.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","January 24, 2015","true","2.9"," 127 of 161 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","127","161","24","1"

You make matches with limited moves to earn enough points to win a date.\nAll the tokens on the grid represent a chararistic people have, such as talent or romance, and each of the ladies prefer something unique.\nTiffany, for example, prefers you match the green flirtation tokens and doesn't care too much for matching the red sexuality tokens, so you're enticed to focus on making better matches with the flirtation tokens to earn more points, while matching sexuality tokens won't earn you as many.\n\nThe sex minigame is like the date one, but there's no limit on moves, and your points constantly drop.\nEarn enough points to reach the limit, and... You and your date reach the limit, I guess.\nAlso, the girl will moan and make general sex noises when you make matches, so, wear headphones.\n\nI think now's a time to mention that art is awesome. Each girl looks cute, and you can dress them up in different clothing.\nI just think Lola doesn't need to wear her stewardess uniform all the time, alright?\n\nThe music is hit or miss. Most of the date themes are really fun, as well as some non-date themes, but other themes are just plain generic and dumb.\n\nThe game is fully voiced, and the writing is really funny, even if it's incredibly stupid at times.\nEach character is interesting, and while they're just there to have sex with, they all have fun personalities, and unique traits.\nKyanna is a single mother who constantly works out to stay in shape, Aiko hates her job as a schoolteacher but is a sexual deviant, Nikki is a huge introvert who'd rather stay in her room than attend clubs, and Audrey is a ***** who does drugs.\n\nThe gifts you can give these ladies are kind of dumb, and racist at that.\nKyanna is latina, so her gifts are Mexican-themed like (I kid you not) maracas and luchador masks, while Aiko is Japanese, so you can give her chopsticks and kimonos.\nHowever, Aiko DOES call you a racist for giving her these gifts, so I assume the game is in on the joke of being a parody of dating sims.\nAlso, your love fairy companion "loves her some chocolate" and has "yellow feaver." No comment.\n\nI think I "beat" the game, having sex with all the girls, even the secret ones, but there's no ending.\nThe devs promised an update for post-game content around Valentine's Day, so I'll keep my eyes on that.\n\nBut, for now, I can only recommend this if you like fanservice and puzzle games.\nAnd anime girls moaning in your headphones while you play Bejeweled on crack.\n\nEDIT: Welp, my Valentine's Day plans were canceled, so I go this game to fap my sorrow away, and finally see the update!\nNow, there's an ending to the game, achievements, a few bonuses and tweaks, and an even harder difficulty.\nI still recommend the game, but again, it isn't for everyone.","February 7, 2015","true","15.0"," 68 of 76 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","68","76","18","1"

You play the game on a day to day basis as a hopeless dude (or lady!) looking to date one of many women in the game. It is a quirky game with the art style of a Japanese visual novel and the writing of one of the many flash based, dude-bro western dating sims.\n\nGraphics:\n\n2D- Japanese Visual Novel styled art\n\n+Surprisingly decent production value for this style of game.\n+Surprisingly accurate lip sync for all characters.\n\n-Art style is inconsistent between character stills and collectible CG. (Honestly of the three characters I have completed so far, none of them really looked entirely the same as the in game stills. The art isn't bad, but it can be a bit jarring.)\n\nMixed- The character art. The art style itself will be highly subjective but many of the characters felt generic when it came to character design. This will be a matter of opinion however and you can easily check the characters before you buy.\n\nSound:\n\n+Surprisngly good soundtrack. My personal favorite is the Spanish guitar tune that plays during certain romantic dates.\n\nMixed- Voice acting. I found the voices hit and miss. Some of the characters sound VERY similar due to sharing voice actresses and can be extremely noticable at times. My personal favorite is the main hostess Kyu.\n\nWriting:\n\nThe actual writing in the game takes some getting used to. It uses, in the developers own words, a highly abrasive western style of writing. So expect some "ladybro" speak, club girls, and the like. I personally found it very entertaining but it might be a shock to those who are not used to this western style talk coming from Japanese style character art.\n\n+ You are bound to find someone you like in this large cast.\n+ The writing maintains a consistent quality. If you like the story, you will be pleased to know it maintains it style and quality throughout the whole game.\n\n- There are very few "events" in the game. Girls have an introduction scene, and an ending scene. Otherwise all character dialogue comes in the form of question and answer. You will ask them questions, and sometimes they will quiz you on what you asked. You can see some character development through this but it feels like reading a Flash card and it repeats often.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe puzzle aspect of this game is a simplified bejeweled. It starts of easy and then with every victory it increases in difficulty. That is to say ANY victory will make EVERY puzzle hard. So if you complete one girl and then start another, her introduction date will be much harder than the previous girls.\n\nIn between puzzles you will go around talking to each girl. Talking earns experience, which is called Hunie in this game, which is used to increase traits that make certain block more valuable. A useful thing to improve as each girl has a preferred color of block to match. If you are succesful in impressing a girl you can earn dating gifts that do cool things like turning all the bad blocks into good block, or cashing in on multipliers to help complete the date.\n\nGirls have a stamina bar that keeps you from talking to her too long. You can increase the stamina using food which is bought with cash, called Monie in this game. Monie is earned by dates. You will get monie even if you fail, so it is still worthwhile trying a date no mattter the difficulty.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall I find this to be a fairly fun puzzle game that is light on content. If you like Bejeweled, cute girls, and abrasive humor I would say the game is worth the asking price. I do hope that in any sequel they will expand on, well, everything. It is a very simple game but with some fleshing out I feel it could find a good niche between the puzzlers and the dating sims.","January 23, 2015","true","13.0"," 69 of 87 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","69","87","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/339800/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","Welp. It certainly brings new meaning to the term “single player” I suppose.\n\nI should begin by saying that I’m not terribly experienced with dating simulators. Outside of Hatoful Boyfriend which I absolutely loathed, the last dating sim I played was some flash-based game on Newgrounds called Ganguro Girl back in 2002 - a guilty (…) pleasure back in my younger days. Due to the sour taste that Hatoful Boyfriend left in my mouth, I lost interest in the abundance of dating sims now plaguing Steam. It took a special video to pique my interest:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcGPYxpPt6Q)\n\nAnd so I played it. I played it for 10.5 hours, apparently. Somehow, I even got my non-gaming girlfriend hellaciously addicted to it.\n\nStory\nHuniepop begins with a dream sequence, in which you meet a very perky and attractive female. After some pathetic attempts at flirting, you wake up in your bedroom and find a “love fairy” in your room, who spends the rest of the game helping you pick up girls that are so stereotyped that it puts Mean Girls to shame. Such stereotypes include ♥♥♥♥♥y teacher, ♥♥♥♥♥y milf, ♥♥♥♥♥y high schooler, weird spiritualist, geeky girl, mega ♥♥♥♥♥ and a young single mum, among others. Your goal is to sleep with each and every one of them.\n\nGameplay\nThe developers described the game perfectly. For those too lazy to read the top right of their screen right now, the basic gist of it is that it’s half dating sim, half match-three puzzle game with an awful lot of “plot”.\n\nThe dating sim portion of the game involves you talking to each of the girls, asking them questions and every so often, answering their questions, which may include them quizzing you on questions that they’ve asked you. Talking to girls and answering their questions correctly earns you points, which can be used to purchase upgrades to your stats (charisma, sexuality, etc), which will make the other main portion of the game (the puzzle portion) easier. You can also earn these points by buying gifts for your target waifu.\n\nAfter you’re done talking, you can choose to take a girl on a date. The dating portion of the game plays as a very simple match-three puzzle game. Each gem on the screen has a different purpose, and your goal is to match three or more of these gems to earn enough “affection” to successfully complete the date. Just like the real world, certain girls seem to favour some attributes more so than others – matching three “sexuality” gems may work wonders for the cougar lady, but won’t quite do against the shy little geeky one. Other gems don’t contribute directly to the affection count, but assist you in earning more affection. The passion (pink hearts) gem, for example, provides passion which will increase the amount of affection that other gems provide, whilst the sentiment gems (light blue) allow you to use certain gifts in the middle of the puzzle which provide extra bonuses. Each puzzle has a limited number of moves that you’re allowed to make. Running out of moves before reaching the target “affection” level (which increases with subsequent dates) will result in you failing the date. Successfully completing the date will reward you with a decent sum of money and more importantly, greater admiration from your future waifu. Once you successfully date a girl 3 times, the game allows you take a girl out at night, which results in… Yeah.\n\nUnfortunately, the game never really gets deeper than that. Yes, you can buy food, drinks and gifts for the girls, but there’s no challenge to this as each girl’s favourite foods and gifts are not only listed in their profile but also indicated with a star or heart next to the item in the store. The getting-to-know-you portion of the game never really offers anything challenging or original compared to any other dating sim ever. On the other hand, the simple-yet-addictive puzzle portions of the game do provide some value in breaking up the monotony of scrolling through lines of cringeworthy-but-hilarious dialogue.\n\nThe “plot”\nI imagine anyone reading this review will understand that there’s a huge different between a “story” and a “plot”.\nHonestly, I was actually surprised at just how graphic some of the depictions of the girls were. I’m not even sure if I’m allowed to talk about it here. If Steam reviews censor swearing, then they’re probably not going to be happy with me talking about pictures of naked anime girls bent over and dripping ♥♥♥♥♥ from their nether regions. In a weird sense, I think I’m legitimately too old for this stuff now. I’m sure an 18-year-old virgin might feel differently though.\n\nThen there’s the other major thing that differentiates this title from Hatoful Boyfriend – The absolutely hilarious voiceovers. Seriously, the dialogue in this game is golden and the voiceovers are spot on. I really wouldn’t want it any other way.\n\nOverall impression\nHonestly, I enjoyed this game because of just how incredibly hilarious and inappropriate it was. The puzzle sections of the game were a fairly welcome addition to the genre and helped to keep the game more engaging and challenging than its contemporaries. A word of warning though – you will be judged by your Steam friends for playing this game. Whether you choose to proceed despite that is up to you.","January 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","87","46","53","23","4"

Going into the game all\nI knew was it was a dating sim with puzzle game elements…. what the real selling point was for me was when I saw all the incredibly ridiculous steam reviews:\n\n“Well, I didn't expect her to ♥♥♥♥ on the first date let alone squirt. And when Tiffany refuses anything other than Anal, I almost choked one out right there and then”\n\nThat was when I knew I had to see what the heck this game was about.\n\nThe game focuses on you playing as a guy who is an absolutely hopeless virgin who is utterly horrible in the dating scene. That all changes the day that you get visited by the sexy, scantily clad dating fairy who vows to teach you how to play the field and promises that with her help you’ll go on dates and get laid. From there the “Yukki”-esque fairy teaches you the core gameplay mechanics which aren’t that too different from other puzzle games in the vein of Bejeweled. You go on dates that consist of the puzzles where you connect three or more of the various colored balls and earn “Affection” points, and you can earn bonus “Affection” points by paying attention to the girls personality and focusing heavily on the color balls that she desires most. You are tasked with reaching a set level of Affection points to pass the level and have a successful date, however with every successful date you have, the level of Affection points required for the next date becomes significantly higher which certainly adds to the difficulty considering you are limited to 20 moves per date. In addition to the colored ball tokens, there are also bell tokens which give you an extra turn, heart tokens which increase your passion level that increases the affection points you get when you connect the colored balls, sentiment tear drops that allow you to use various items, and purple broken heart tokens that sap affection points from your date and can be truly devastating to a date. At the conclusion of each date both successful and failure dates, you are awarded “Munies” that you can use to spend on food, drinks, and gifts for your dates.\n\nAs you talk to the girls and successfully choose the right dialog branch you are awarded “Hunie” which is used to upgrade your traits that give you bonuses and allow you to perform better in the puzzle dates. It’s sad, because one of the games both strongest and weakest points are the dialog, for both the cut scenes and dialog trees. The dialog is really what makes this game worth playing…It will make you laugh, cringe, and blush, however it becomes repetitive very quickly, and spending time with any one girl for too long will cause the dialog to loop back around and start recycling itself.\n\nWith each successfully date; you earn a “heart” in the girls love progression bar. Once you reach either 4 or 5 hearts depending on how into you the girl is, if you successfully pass a date puzzle at night then things will get disappointingly hot and heavy. You’ll finally get laid and the sex mini-game puzzle is just merely a puzzle similar to the ones you’re used to only with no limit on your number of turns, you have to rapidly connect the colored ball tokens to combat the decreasing Affection points bar all the while your date is moaning and egging you on. Upon completion of the mini-game you are awarded a semi-nude sexual photo of your date that gets added to your photo album. The fact that that’s as far as the game is willing to push the envelope is a little disappointing, If you are going to make a game that focuses on this type of subject matter and the entire goal of the game is to have sex…then there should have been more of a payoff than there was.\n\nBesides the puzzles and dialog, the game also features a very large amount of “Plot”. The Plot is very well animated and the various image stills you receive in the game are all very well illustrated. The only issues some may run into with the “plot” is that the steam version is censored, but this can be easily remedied if you so desired with a patch released by the devs.\n\nThe game successfully delivers a fairly solid puzzle dating sim that is delivered with the look and feel of a visual novel. The game is held back however by its sub-par voice acting, repetitive dialog, and less than climactic climax scenes.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","February 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","48","57","13","0"

I mean, you can't take it seriously; all the girls are basically caricatures and the conversations never rise above ludicrous but the mechanics are entertaining, there's some laughs to be had and the puzzles ramp up to be challenging (mind you, I never play puzzle games so maybe the Candy Crush masters will find this easy).  You meet girls, ask them questions, get asked questions and go on "dates" represented via the match-3 bubble puzzles where the personality of the girl affects the value of each bubble type (so one may value "Flirting" matches more and another "Talent" matches).  Your conversations are tempered by a constant need to buy food and gifts to keep her talking and the dates oddly give you the money you'll need to start all over again.  Eventually your night time dates can lead to bedtime frolicking represented by a "lightning round" style puzzle.\n\nThe game is unabashedly what is is and if you think you might be offended, you certainly will be so save your money.  If the trailer makes you laugh at either the dialogue or voice acting, you'll probably enjoy yourself for at least a while.  I don't know if the game will have a ton of staying power from a gaming standpoint (unless you want to collect a bunch of semi-naked pictures) but it's fun while it lasts.\n\nOf special note is the musical score which is very catchy and well done.  It's rare that I notice game music enough to realize it and I found myself enjoying it multiple times throughout my playing.","January 19, 2015","true","27.5"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","44","51","0","0"

account","Well lets start by saying that this is "THE GAME",and when i say "THE GAME" i mean "THE GAME" that's causing an extreme amount of controversy on STEAM as even if you play the censored version you will still end up (eventually) seeing some rather rude image's of the girl's you will date,but if you download the patch "BOY-OH-BOY" the image's you see then are thing's that wouldent be out of place on some dodgy website,how do i know............................well i just do OK,so stop asking me question's about it *GULP* ;)\n\nHuniePop Release Trailer -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrr4xVU06VE\n\nOk i hear you cry it has BUM'S and BOOB'S in it but what does it actually play like and is the game actually any good????????????\nWell lets deal with the most important thing first and that's the gameplay,now when you start the game you wake up and come face to face with Kyu who is a magic love fairy hailing from the mythical Sky Garden,ok so not your usual morning wake up call,me i set my alarm clock.\nShe then proceed's to tell you that she has come to help you try to get dates as you are pathetic at it (well that really made me feel good about myself) and you need her help,this lead's to you walking round the various location's the game has to offer and meeting your prospective date's.\nSo after meeting the nine girl's we then get down to the brass tac's of the gameplay and you learn that to unlock new outfit's for the girl's you need to buy them gifts,but not just any gifts ones they will actually like.Now this is where your Hunie pop device come's in handy as when you activate it,it gives bios for all the girl's and also access to your inventory,the shop to buy gifts,your traits and the ability to upgrade them and more beside's.\nAnd believe me you need to upgrade your trait's to get anywhere in this game as when you go on a date you then get to the main part of the game where you have to MATCH 3 symbol's that are the same and score enough points and you win the date.Sounds easy yes,WRONG as each girl like's and will be happier with certain symbol's matched together in three's than other's and all girl's like different combinations,so you will have to learn what symbol's and then remember if you dont well you fail your date if you do then eventually you'll end up with another notch in your bedhead.Then you move onto your next date and start talking to the girl and then "RING-RING" you get a new message and also a photograph for that successful  date,OK that even happen's in real life but (and i do mean BUT) as you win more date's you get more revealing photo's from the girl's until you actually get to bed them,BED THEM yes BED THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSo after four successful  date's (IT ISNT THIS EASY IN REAL LIFE) you get to...................well like i said bed the girl and in doing so what do you get for your trouble's and hard work,a pair of underwear..............likes its some sort of trophy.\nNow when you have successfully dated all girl's you may think that's it,well no actually as there are three secret girl's to date and so on you go onto more conquest's.One girl is easy to get and she just appear's when you have won the other nine date's (OH ten actually,Kyu the love fairy as well) but the other two take a bit of guess work (OR LOOKING IT UP ON GOOGLE WORKS AS WELL).\n\nHeres a shot i got sent by one of the girl's for a successful  date (CLEAN SHOT THOUGH-SOME ARE WELL................DEARY ME) -\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385025900\n\nAnd that's the problem this game will have appealing to a main stream audience,the fact that the image's you see in game and the negative way it treat's its female cast (even though to be honest its all done in jest "You can keep my underwear its ok HONEY") are getting so much attention that people think that's all the game has to offer.\nWell i can tell you that even though it does have image's like that,that the game itself is actually both well made and oft time's hillarious,"Hillarious you say" and i say yes it is as some of the thing's the girl's will say will make you cringe but more often than not you will end up laughing out loud at the script and what the girls actually say to each other.And all dialogue in game is actually fully spoken by an all female voice cast,which adds to the fun factor when they start fighting or ♥♥♥♥♥ing each other off.\nI can understand why the game is getting the stick it is but if you like a solid puzzle game with MATCH 3 element's then you cant go wrong with this game.Like i said the gameplay element's are solid and if you havent leveled up your trait's and you dont know what the girl your dating like's in her symbol's that you match then sorry son but your going to fail that date.\n\nHeres a short video that show's and explain's how the gameplay play's out during a date -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TWrTCiuEDk\n\nSo in closing as allways will you want to play this game and will you get anything out of it,answer the following three questions and see what you think -\n\n1 - Do you want a great MATCH 3 game that has a sense of humour and a great script that will at point's have you laughing out loud???\n\n2 - Are you ok with (EVEN IN THE CENSORED VERSION) seeing the girl's in less than,shall we say flattering poses???\n\n3 - Do you like anime style art in your game's,as your going to be seeing a lot of it before this game reache's its conclusion???\n\nIf you answered yes to the above question's then what are you waiting for buy it now,if not and you arent into MATCH 3 type game's or you dont want to see the sort of image's this game puts forward then that's ok,the game isnt for everyone.\nBut even though the game does contain image's that some may find offensive the game itself would actually stand on its own due to the strong MATCH 3 game play element's and the often hillarious script.\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY

HuniePop is an amazing puzzle adventure that I have become addicted to. I find myself wanting to play more after I wake up. This game has ruined my sleeping schedule, actually... and that's because of how much I really enjoy it.\n\nOf course there will be reviews out there that enjoy the game strictly for aesthetics, but I look past that. If that's what you're into, though, that's fine. But, strictly rating HuniePop on gameplay: it's fantastic. I have 23 hours clocked into the game, 96% completion rate, and I cannot wait to complete my first file. I plan on starting a new file after I have reached 100% on my first file just to get all of the achievements I've missed while on my first playthrough.\n\nAs someone who thoroughly enjoys puzzle games, HuniePop never disappointed me. I love Alpha Mode and its ever-increasingly difficulty. I'm the type of person who loves a challenge. Though HuniePop does get quite challenging with the introduction of Alpha Mode, I still find it to be a relaxing game. I feel like it improves my terrible short-term memory, since the girls will quiz you about themselves and other girls later on in the game. I think that the fact that HuniePop seems to help improve my short-term memory is definitely a bit of a bonus.\n\nOutside of the game being relaxing, challenging, and helpful for memory, it has a great soundtrack. The music tends to be very lighthearted and bubbly. The personalities of the girls made it easy for me to laugh. This game is great for those who want to stay in a great mood.\n\nI would like to commend HuniePot on creating such a wonderful game. I am looking forward to HunieCam Studio - and although it is going to be quite different, I hope has as much work put into it (if not more) than HuniePop, because this game is an absolute steal for its price on steam.\n\nTo close out this review, I would like to say thanks for providing an addicting, adult game with memorable characters. I understand that the game may not be suitable for a younger audience, but would recommend it to anyone who is able to pick up the game...to get it. No hesitation there, just get the game.  I am also happy that it has over 20 hours of gameplay in it (for completitonists).\n\nI hope that this review might help someone out there, and I hope that readers end up enjoying the game as much as I am enjoying it right now.","August 26, 2015","true","35.8"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","34","36","8","0"

But I was surprised it didn't turn out like that.\n\nHuniePop certainly isn't a perfect game. It's a really good game with some unpolished spots all around it. HuniePop features a dating like mode where you can talk to the girls, earn Hunie (which can be used for upgrades) and give them gifts. Then there is the "actual gameplay" part, shich are the dates. The dates are played through Bejeweled-like puzzles which get harder and harder each time you succesfully complete one date. After each date you unlock a special "reward"...\n\nFor me, the selling point was the cheery idea behind the game, fun dialogue and good graphics but I just personally feel like the developers count on the "rewards" side a little bit too much... What are the rewards you may ask? They are straight up hentai/ecchi pictures which are then stored to your storage where you can admire all the pictures whenever you want. I'm not saying the pictures didn't affect me. They certainly added some kind of reason to keep playing the game and wanting to see what you unlock next.\n\nOverall, HuniePop is a very fun and addicting game and has all your needs covered wether it be a quick wank or a quick Bejeweled round. Worth picking up from sale but I wouldn't recommend this game on full price. The game repeats a lot after a while but surprisingly doesn't get boring. The puzzle mode is just that good.","January 1","true","13.3"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","37","41","15","4"

I might have been misguided in this, but I was expecting something a bit more... like a Visual Novel or Dating Sim, where talking to the girls would branch out more or allow for different events to happen.\nI would love to get to talk more with Jessie about her work, her situation with her daughter, maybe help her mend that relationship.\nI'd also love to get to actually look at Aiko's web browser history, or get it down and dirty under her desk.\nAnd what about taking part in a yoga class with Beli, or go on a space trip with Celeste?\n\nThe girls are interesting, but apart from filling a fact sheet and getting some glimpse about their personality and life, the whole talk part of the game feels somewhat shallow and something that could be improved greatly, hopefully in a sequel.\n\nThe match 3 part of the game is fun and somewhat addicting. I'm not a great match 3 player, mostly because it's not the kind of game I usually play, but the gifts part lends itself to some interesting choices to strategically take on the puzzles.\n\nThe art for the girls ended being better than I was expecting, especially for the naugthy event images. I wish there were more of those event images though, both nsfw and sfw since they do work in framing the background the girls a bit more.\n\nAll in all, even with some reservations about those parts that I think could have been done better/made them have a bit more depth, I believe this is a fun and nice enough game, definitely worth the asking price, especially with the release discount.","January 23, 2015","true","15.6"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","37","42","3","0"

(Beware future game devs http://www.huniepop.com/post/108464572403/sjw-reviews-hp-spoiler-he-doesnt-like-it so you know where you don't send your game review copies to)\n\n1) download a patch from the devs here http://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/616198900649668367/\n\n2) Buy the game from their website or MangaGamer https://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?goods_type=1&product_code=130\n\nhttp://www.huniepop.com/\n\nNow since that's out of the way I'll try my best to explain what works, what could've been added & what I don't like in the game. (I'm also going to mention some minor spoilers so watch out & also another warning the girls in the game are all stereotypes so that's another reason the easily offended should stay away from the game)\n\nThe whole point of this game is to get laid (obviously) either picking a male or female gender to score with 12 different kinds of girls (4 of them are secrets) who all have different personalities, interests, hobbies, boob sizes & so on but just so you know you're very anti-social according to the game so you need the help of a 10,000 year old fairy named Kyu (One of the girls you date in the game, very perverted & no not the letter Q) to teach you what techniques work on each girl (Forgot to mention mildly racist/perverted towards Aiko since she's an asian.... another girl that's datable in the game).\n\nJust to get the pros out of the way I liked the cheesy/funny writing, the music, the creative use of unlimited match 3 with sex moans involved when your date loves you enough to bang the hell out of her, the ladies that did the voiceovers for each girl except for Audrey I couldn't stand her, 2 of the secret girls give you questions about the universe & cats, the use of emotions for the match 3 puzzles like for example an orange coloured crescent moon is romance (Bejeweled & Candy Crush have new competition this year), the gallery of NSFW pictures you unlock after a successful date with each girl (You can only get 4 pics from each girl) & you can get money just for dating in the game but you have to spend it all on luxuries for the women.\n\nThe only cons I have to say about this game is the repetitiveness in the dialogue when the girls ask you questions about remembering information about them, Certain questions from Venus for example get annoying after a while, the options menu & there is no end cutscene to this game after you date all the girls. What the devs should've added is a better punishment for the failed dates you encounter instead of only getting half the cash so that's the only option I can think of that I feel the game should've had to make the game more intense so overall if Valentine's Day does come just play videogames like HuniePop to waste time on.\n\nIf I missed anything, or you want to correct me on anything, feel free to leave feedback, it helps me a lot.\n\nUPDATE: The devs just keep on giving more new content & it addresses such concerns like an ending scene for example http://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/611698195148212248/\n\nEDIT: Alpha mode is really hard so you need a lot of patience to handle each date properly\n\nUPDATE 2: The devs have decided to add a politically correct mode (Coming Soon) to make fun of radical feminists & oversensitive people in general that ♥♥♥♥♥ about everything https://twitter.com/HuniePop/status/566674104099823616\n\nUPDATE 3: The Steam DLC for the digital art collection is censored so you have to go through another special patch just to see the NSFW content on the DLC http://steamcommunity.com/app/339800/discussions/0/610572929721992528/","February 9, 2015","true","17.2"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","40","51","3","4"

Regardless of the choice, you can only date girls in the game. I honestly didn't have high expectations from a dating game, but right from the start there is plenty of humor in the interaction with the love fairy, the players guide to dating.\n\nThe girls come with a great variation in looks and personality, the only thing they all have in common, is being hungrier then starving wolves. In order to talk with them, you need to give them food and lots of it. Though they have a lot to say, and even after having reached the final stretch of the game, they sometimes say things I haven't heard before.\n\nThe dates evolve around a puzzle game, it is similar to bejeweled, but demands a lot more strategy. Checking what a date wants from you before the date is the key to success, as well as in the interaction, where it's good to refresh what you know before being put on the spot with a question. The strategy factor and the puzzle game is most the game, the girls are just a bonus. I'm sure this game could have been just as good with a different theme. Perhaps meeting fluffy animals and making friends with them? It wouldn't affect the puzzle factor at all.\n\nPositive aspects of the game:\nEvery location has its own music.\nThe characters come with great variation.\nA lot of comedy, this game isn't in any way serious.\nThe difficulty is balanced, and increases over time.\n\nNegative aspects of the game:\nThe full screen mode glitched for me, though that could be a result of my screen resolution. Otherwise I don't have many bad things to say about the game. I should note that there is a strong chance someone on your friendslist have a thing or two to say about dating games. It is a game that comes with a douchbag stamp, but that is okay, the game hardly tries to make you think that seducing 12 girls makes you any better then that.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy/puzzle games, but would prefer to look at sexy girls while playing them. To quote Kyu; "Come on! Seduce me with your sexy puzzle skills."\n","February 28, 2015","true","71.5"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","25","27","5","0"

There are characters that you love and characters who you just hate which is a nice thing that not everyone are a little "sugar babys".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/339800/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","HuniePop is a Western Dating Sim, RPG and Puzzle Game. You play a nameless protagonist who has no love life. The Love goddess, being disappointed by the lack of romance in your life, decides to send Kyu, a magic love fairy, to help you out. Kyu profiles eight beautiful, eligible girls in town and after a few helpful tips, starts you on your quest for love... or lust.\n\nThe puzzle section (making up the date portions of the game), at its core, is fairly standard Bejeweled fare but with some added complexity. The player has to score enough points to fill an Affection meter within 20 turns, and each girl has favorite and least favorite token types that change how many points each give out, along with Passion tokens that act as a score multiplier, Joy tokens that give extra moves, Sentimentality tokens that allow the use of special items, and Heartbreak tokens that penalize you if you match them. Aside from leveling up a girl's relationship status, clearing a date also gives the player money to purchase gifts for use in the dating sim section, where the player talks to the girls to acquire "Hunie", which is then used to upgrade various traits (such token effectiveness, lessening heartbreak penalties and increasing the score multiplier cap for Passion tokens) for use in the puzzle section. You will want to upgrade your traits as often as you can, so wrack up that Hunie. The puzzle segments get progressively more difficult as the game goes on, so traits are VERY important. Also, if you reach a certain Passion level during the puzzles, you may be sent bonus photos of the girl you dated.\n\nThe game plays out very well, having you move from location to location talking to the different girls to learn things about them. At times the girls will quiz you on your knowledge of them, and if you answer correctly you receive bonus Hunie. As you talk to each girl, you will notice a hunger and intoxication meter under their relationship gauge. If you try and talk to them while their hunger meter is empty, they will simply tell you that they are hungry. To continue talking to them you can buy some food in the shop and gift it to them to restore a portion of their meter to continue the conversation. The other option is to leave and come back to the girl later, when her hunger meter will be refilled again. The intoxication meter measures how, well, intoxicated the girl is, and you can buy her drinks to drive this meter up. Doing so gets you bonus Hunie while talking to them, as well as starting you off with a Sentiment level equal to their intoxication level when starting a date puzzle, depending on the girl.\n\nAfter each successful date (yes, you can and will fail some puzzles), your relationship gauge (measured in hearts) with that girl will go up by one. When you reach 4 or more hearts with a particular girl, and complete a dating puzzle at night, they will offer to go back to your place. This begins a "climax" puzzle, where you have unlimited moves but the objective is to fill the Pleasure meter, which slowly decays over times. Making matches in the puzzle fills the gauge. When you complete the climax puzzle you are rewarded with a raunchy photo of the girl you "conquered", as well as a pair of their panties as a trophy to stash in your inventory. These do nothing but to remind you of which girls you have climaxed.\n\nOh, did I mention that EVERYTHING is 100% fully voiced acted? Yes, even the climax puzzles. Let that sink in for a second. There is also language and revealing photos. This is certainly NOT a game for children. Please exercise discretion when playing this game with children in the house.\n\nHuniePop is an excellent puzzle game with a dating sim cover. It offers solid mechanics and ever increasing challenge in it's gameplay, in the puzzles and in the "dating". Definitely give it a shot if puzzle games are your thing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382621663\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 27, 2015","true","16.9"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","36","47","2","6"

When you venture further into loneliness, the puzzle gets much harder. There were times where I had to stop and think about my next move carefully\n- The music is well done\n- Fantastic voice acting\n- Hilarious dialogue\n\nCons\n\n- Tedious and repetitive. You will see that the girls will ask the same question multiple times. After half way through the game, it just becomes a grind.\n- Lack of content. There really isn't much to do to be very honest here. You talk to girl, give her gifts, feed her and ask questions. Go on date, play a puzzle, done. To fully complete this game, you gotta do that 5 times for all 12 girls.\n\n\nI do recommend this game but for a VERY specific audience. Overall though, I do not. For the price tag, there just isn't much to do to keep someone entertained for the nearly 20 hours of doing the same puzzle over and over again.

You will have the opportunity to meet different girls and socialize with them. (Just don't use what you learn in this game during a real life date)\n\nSo what is the story?\nYou play as yourself. You are terrible at socializing with girls. One day, a magical fairy named Kyu shows up and decides to help you out.\n\nThe Girls:\nThe girls are pretty diverse. There are girls who are kind and passionate like Tiffany, and then there are girls who are haughty and loud like Audrey. All of them are actually well voice acted, making them feel "real".\n\nGameplay:\nHuniePop generally consists of talking and getting to know the girls you meet and going on a date with them. The dating scenes are pretty much what most people call "Bejewled".\nHowever, I'd say HuniePop's gameplay is a bit "more fun" since you can match orbs horizontally or vertically (the orbs you want to match don't have to be next to each other). There's also a catch. You can't just match random colors and just win.\n\nEx: You want to date Tiffany. Her favorite trait is flirtation (a green token). When you are dating her, you will only have a certain amount of moves to fill up a point meter. Matching green tokens will get you the most points.\nIn addition to the "Bejewled gameplay, you can match bell tokens to get more moves and avoid the shattered purple hearts (They will decrease the meter).\n\nAbout..."those" scenes:\nUnless you install the uncensored patch, Panties and bras will stay on, but moans of pleasure will still be heard. :3\n\nShould you buy it? & My Opinion\nFor people who just want a casual game that involves "Bejeweled" gameplay and dating girls, pick this up if you feel like it. You might find that one girl that you admire the most.\n\nFor me, this was a great way to perhaps practice talking with girls. I especially enjoyed the "Bejweled" gameplay. Some of the dialogue was a bit awkward, but then again I never really talked to a real girl for more than five minutes so I wouldn't really know.\n\n- Psychii","April 18, 2015","true","61.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","24","27","8","0"

No, wait, it actually is pretty cool.\n\nYou play as...Well...You. You're a virgin and you're bad with the ladies, when suddenly Stephanie from Lazy Town appears in your room and tells you she's going to help you get laid. And thus begins a journey of self discovery and learning to love yourself for the way you ar- oh who am I kidding, you bang a bunch of dames. There are seven girls and one best girl as well as a few surprises in between. Like my tears when the bejeweled didn't want to cooperate with me and refused to allow me permission to see the single Mexican mother naked. How dare you shield my eyes?\n\nYou go day to day in game, finding the ladies scattered remains of their emotional stability about town and talking to them, giving them gifts like a weirdo, and taking them out on battle bejeweled dates. This is probably the make it or break it part of the game. For my friends it was a simple romp, stealing hearts, and playing dangerously. For me it was a heart shattering performance rivaled only by Schindler's List. Being ♥♥♥♥ blocked by bejeweled is like the biggest and swiftest kick in the ♥♥♥♥ from a quarterback. That's like five Nicklebacks.\n\nThe characters themselves aren't that bad either. They have their own personalities, quirks, and problems that they sometimes pour out to you. Though they themselves are nothing ground breaking, they play their parts well and you'll end up enjoying at least a few of their companies. You can do exciting things with them, like talk about their day, or watch them eat an entire cabbage. Riveting and compelling.\n\nBut should you play HuniePop?\nIt's honestly hard to say, it's one of those games I shield from the children passing by my dumpster while I play it, but it's nothing to lose your mind over and feel embarassed about, really. Unless you're like me and can't get it up for the sex game. Sorry Ladies.  :(\n\nIt can only get really bad once you realized you've spent the last seven hours playing Bejeweled and you've become your mother. But you kind of forget that in the music, the moment, you own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow, this opportunity only comes once in  a lifetime. Just like me.

And it shines in both categories.\nSummary: funny, medium challange, entertaining gameplay in all parts; limited replayability; features NSFW content\n\nThe Dating-Sim aspect is really tongue-in-cheek and takes itself about as seriously as it does the player. It really plays it up for laughs. You even get made fun of by one of the characters for trying to woo women (yes, they're all legal!) by matching gems. Speaking of which, the Puzzle-gameplay is the best I've ever seen. While average match-3-games get repetetive and boring quick, this one keeps things fresh with the addition of consumables per match and effecting the board by leveling your player-character outside of the puzzles using a light RPG system in the dating parts. Also it features a slightly larger than average board for these kinds of games which might not sound like much but it immensely rewards careful planning.\n\nThe characters you meet are absolutely 1-dimensional but the twist is, they seem to know it! Interacting with them is a blast if only for the chuckles you'll have at some of the more imaginative lines. The excellent voicework really helps getting to know each one. Since your objective is to date women until they are willing to spend a night with you, the game features adult themes, language and imagery but the imagery is censored by default (easily unlockable with patch from developer).","April 27","true","57.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","20","21","3","0"

It's regarded as a simulator by some, but really, it's not unless you want the ♥♥♥♥ slapped out of you when you try out the lines for real. Many years ago I played several bishōjo or gal games, many of which would be regarded a H (hentai) game. Is this also a H-game? Not exactly. However, it has seriously raised the bar for what's allowed in Steam titles and I love that. With a tiny patch you can unlock full upper nudity, highly suggestive artwork and risqué dialogue. As a game developer myself I was pleasantly surprised to see this. Sex should be much more accepted in video games. It certainly is a lot more natural than blowing somebody's head off with a shotgun, one would think.\n\nEdit: Progressing even further into the game I've found out that with some characters you get to see full nudity, with the inclusion of particular fluids...\n\nBack to the main point. The key to succeeding in this game is mastering the use of bull****. The objective is to screw as many girls as you can and you have to adapt your personality to match that of each girl and basically deceive them all. It's all fun and games though, and indeed, HuniePop makes sure of this with witty and entertaining dialogue, decent voice acting and interesting puzzle mechanics used in the dating scenes. You have the choice of being male or female, with the latter catering to the lesbian and bisexual female crowd. The game uses a day/night system in a linear fashion—you can't choose where you want to go specifically like in many gal games such as True Love, but you get an amazing stalker device which allows you to see where girls are and travel to them immediately.\n\nThe story isn't amazing by any means, but that's not really the aim of any game of this genre. At the start of the game you're approached by a fairy seductress who encourages you to get into the dating scene. That's the gist of it. It has an RPG system with stats you can upgrade, with each one catering more to certain girls, also affecting the effectiveness of different blocks in the puzzle game. There are two main variables in the game: Munie (currency) and Hunie. You'll gain more Munie from successful dates for some reason (IRL it's very much the opposite) and from buying gifts and chatting girls up properly you'll gain more Hunie, with which you can upgrade your character. Think of it like the boner meter. Keep filling it and you'll keep filling them much better in bed. Yes, there is indeed sex. It'll sound like a cheesy porno when you reach that part.\n\n\nRatings\n\nCategoryScoreExplanationGameplay25/30The gameplay mechanics make this game very addictive. You can choose how you want to play it and in which order. The choice of gender adds more replay value. There's plenty of profile information you must learn about the girls, and your memory is tested when you're asked to recall these facts, such as full names, favourite colours, cup sizes, work history, and so forth. Dialogue choices are funny and unrealistic, and the game seems to be a parody of other dating sims in a sense. The puzzle gameplay is challenging yet fun; hardly original but it does the job.Story10/20As previously explained, it's very much a no-frills experience in the story department. There's nothing particularly bad about it, but it's nothing special either.Graphics18/20I honestly have nothing bad to say here. Characters are well drawn and have well animated facial expressions and mouth movements. Backgrounds are nothing short of professional. The user interface is colourful and easy to use. Extra attention was clearly spent on the artwork. This is an indie game with graphical quality of a retail title.Sound18/20I love the background music. It's no wonder that it's available as DLC on this store page. Voice acting is a mixed bag. A couple of girls have a bit of a high-pitched nagging voice, but from what I've learned so far, they all seem good at moaning in the sex scenes. Just sayin'. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Bonus9/10I'm awarding this game a high bonus score because of the message it delivers to the game industry in general. It's not hentai I'm talking about. It's sex in general. People need to relax. It's a normal thing and I hope that eventually the industry will stop being so uptight about it. Oh, an exta +1 at the fact it practically slaps Anita Sarkeesian in the face.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\n80%: Grade B","February 13, 2015","true","17.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","21","24","6","1"

They don't smell. They don't ask for much. All you have to do is give them love and affection and they will return in kind. I haven't left my house in weeks because 2D girls don't ask you to go to work or take them out or shower. All you have to do is be there, in front of the screen with your dakimakura and masturbatory tool of preference and you will be set. I finally know what true love is. I just wish my mom would stop knocking on my door. I mean, I'm 20 for Kami-sama's sake. I know what I'm doing with my life. She's such a baka gaijin. Thank you, HuniePop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/recommended/339800/","endchronicle","Rekyua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/endchronicle/","675 products in account","Pleasently surprised.\nI had low hopes for the game but after playing it I found the writing to be delightful! The conversations are quirky, though at times a little too cliche, but it doesn't keep the game from being anything other than fun. Just know this game ISN'T a visual novel so the dialogue is pretty lite.\n\nThe sound effects are great and the music is nice. Some people had issues with the art style but I personally like it and all the scenes are varied and the girls themsevles have a handful of hair and clothing sytles to unlock.\n\nThe core however is the puzzle matching game during dates. If you enjoy any kind of match-3 game type (Bejeweled, Candy Crush, etc.) then you'll have fun with this. The differences that make this game stand out from those however is the ability to move a gem anywhere in the row and colum it resides and counter-balanced by a move limit. Along with traits (leveling system from getting experience by talking to girls outside the puzzle segment) and gifts (which you obtain from giving gifts to girls outside of the puzzle segment) that when combined together can enhance your playing style. You might go for points, extra moves, changing gems, or a mix of all. It has enough flexibility to let you strengthen the way you want to play.\n\nMy only complaint is the game gets ridiculously difficult the further in you get. At the last few girls (including the unlockable) I had difficulty completing a level as I had long since maxed out my traits and ended up lowering the difficulty level to finish the stage. Not to mention the "bedroom" stage which involves filling a meter which constantly depletes, at later levels you have to match 4 or more to gain any footing.\n\nOverall, I came in with low expectations but found them surpassed. It's a fun game and I highly recommend it if you like puzzle gems and match-3. Also, it rewards you for winning with bewbs, which is good because it gets hard as ♥♥♥♥ later on and you're gonna need that motivation.","January 19, 2015","true","15.0"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","30","41","2","0"

While Baker is initially distraught of the idea of leading men so soon in his military career, he soon learns that he must focus and lead both himself and his men to victory and glory. Throughout the campaign, Baker's squad is picked off one by one by the germans, changing Baker's initial objective of completing the mission, he now must keep his men alive, complete the mission, and get back home alive himself against the odds with only a handful of men. The gameplay to the game is pretty spectacular, the way to defeating the overwhelming odds of germans ranges from the four "Fs" of military tactics in that time, finding, fixing, flanking, and finishing the enemy. As the game progresses, Baker and his squad start to go from fighting untrained grunts to the elite "Fallschrimjager" division of the German Paratroopers aswell as encountering situations where your tactics must adjust to the new circumstances and choosing whether or not sacrificing a member of your squad is worth it to complete the mission.","January 25, 2015","true","13.4"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","70","32","46","35","0"

It pretends to be a dating sim, but considering it as an entry in that genre, it's a very mediocre entry. The entire game is rail-roaded so you will always end up in a position where you can date the girls and even if you pick the 'wrong' dialogue option there is no permanent penalty, just a loss of one of the two in-game currencies.\n\nWhat Huniepop does do right is the dialogue, it is genuinely funny at times and lewd throughout, and every girl has their own consistent voice. The gameplay is separated in two parts, non-date and date. During the non-date parts you will be chatting with the girls to make them like you more: the more you learn about them, the more points you get. You can also buy them gifts. The girls will also challenge you with questions which you have to answer correctly, some related to their personality, others related to their stats you've learned before. Every time you talk they become hungrier, so you also need to buy them a kind of food they like to keep the conversation going.\nIf a girl likes you enough you can date them. Now the game becomes a Bejewelled clone, and a fairly good one at that. Rewards for dates are unlocking new outfits and hairstyles for the girls -- and if you do a night date, sex.\nSex is another Bejewelled game but now you have to make combos as quickly as possible to score (pun intended). Your reward for a notch on your bedpost is a sexually tinted image of the girl (censored by default, but uncensoring is easy and quick).\n\nIf you're an adult who is not offended by lewd humour, Huniepop will not disappoint. But if you want a dating sim there are far better examples on Steam.\nRecommended for today's version of Leisure Suit Larry fans, and definitely not recommended for puritans.","May 5, 2015","true","13.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","14","14","4","0"

It is incredibly politically incorrect and I'm not sure how it has so-far escaped the ire of the Tumblr and Twitter crowd who would generally cite this as being the most hateful example of why gaming is evil.\n\nI found myself chuckling as I flirted with the popular chick by talking about getting wasted and then won her favor by buying her a crack pipe. And by saying all the right things to appeal to the fitness-freak hair-dresser single-mother by conveying my value as a stable mature provider who appreciates children. I was a bit taken aback by the photo one of the characters sent me in-game of her going deep on an adult toy and another of detailed self-appreciation. Completely absurd and earned its laugh. The love-fairy liked to talk about "chocolate love" and "yellow fever", but is basically that platonic girl in your life who spends half her time trying to hook you up with everything that moves.\n\nI mark every "novel" and "dating sim" game on Steam as "not interested", but the reviews suckered me in to trying it out and I have been thoroughly entertained. I would still hide the game window if someone walked into my office and caught me playing this, but I was still amused.","February 23, 2015","true","8.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","12","13","5","0"

Well... you're actually playing as a woman, never fret, since this game does a fantastic job adapting to the female audience. When you start the game up, you're given an option whether to play as a female of male, and I obviously thought "Well I bet that they changed some words to "she" instead of he and thats it." But EVERYTHING is adapted. The voice acting is redone, the texts have changed (not the pictures but i remember one saying "Hahaha! I can almost fit this whole thing in my mouth! I would make a great straight chick!" or something like that).\n\nSo don't worry, you will feel like a girl playing this game.\n\nI havent finished every route... but i have done the vast majority. And even though the... *ahem* sex CG's... aren't my cup of tea, I can't deny that they are well drawn much like everything else in this game. It's honestly surprising how much love and effort was put into this game. The sprites are fantastic and I ADORE the voice acting and dialoge(well.. except a perticular red head). The game play is sort of like bejewelled, but much more addicting. I guess it's like marmite. You either like puzzels or you don't.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the woman... are kind of shown as objects in this (So like, most of them are fully aware that you're dating other girls at the same time but they don't care.). But i dooubt you expected FULL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND A DEEP EMOTIONAL BACK STORY. Of course theyre shallow! The whole point of this game is to have sex with everyone! Some VNs and dating sims i have played are worse than this so it doesn't bother me a whole lot.\n\nThis is one of those games where if you think you will enjoy it, you will, and if you're not too sure, it might be a waste of your money.

While the graphic adult material is limited to a few still shots, they are very graphic.\n\nHuniePop is a dating simulator puzzle game hybrid that mixes the two elements quite well.  As a dating simulator, the game is pretty shallow.  Decisions like 'where to take her,' 'what she likes,' and 'how much will she appreciate the gifts' are completely predetermined.  The dialog is completely spoken (or in blips and bloops if you prefer), which actually fleshes out the characters a bit more than I expected.  All of the twelve different women have different personalities, and they sometimes offer curve ball questions that really make the dating side interesting.  Showing interest, answering questions right, and buying various gifts for the ladies rewards with a special currency called "Hunie," which can be spent on increasing the strength of your own character traits that are used in the puzzle portion of the game.\n\nThe puzzle (date) portion is the real meat of the game.  You make 3-of-a-kind matches by moving pieces along x/y axis rails.  The concept is very basic and easy to pick up.  What makes it so tricky is the very limited amount of moves you are allowed to make.  Each lady you are on a date with has preferences of what color match they want you to join the most and the least, and reward you with cash respectively.  The purple broken hearts are penalty pieces, and if joined together, reduce the amount of cash you are awarded.  Pink hearts increase the value (intensity) of other matches.  Blue tear drops give you ammunition to perform special moves.  Gold bells add to the amount of moves you are allowed.  Overall, you need to consider the weight of every match you make, and how it will help you in future matches.  It may sound overwhelming at first, but it comes easy and natural with experience.\n\nIf you have completed four levels of dates, and you successfully complete a fifth date at night, you will be taken to a bonus round.  For the bonus round, you just have to make as many matches as possible, regardless of color, as fast as you can.  This is both exciting and terrifying, as it is exactly the opposite of the rules for the previous dates.\n\nAs more dates are completed successfully, the ladies will send you pictures of themselves in provocative positions (some more provocative than others).  Completing a bonus round will reward you with a very provocative picture.  Once a picture is unlocked, it can be reviewed at a later time at your leisure.\n\nPersonally, I bought this game as a joke, and found the game so fun that I completed it to 100%.  I still love completing the puzzles on the hardest difficulty, and I still try to figure out the secret behind the tissue box.  If you have the love for puzzle games like I do (10,000,000, Bejeweled, Zoo Keeper), give this a shot for sure.","February 8, 2015","true","52.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

Also Boobs.\n\nThe set up is you are either a lady or a dude and then a fairy comes and makes you better at getting ladies. That's... pretty much it.\n\nThe gameplay loop is something like. Data allocation or asking questions that will later be asked back to you in order to obtain more Hunie (used for upgrading) Ask on a date, play bejewled repeat. I guess you can feed the girls in order to talk to them longer should you want but the game seems to encourage switching between them. Each girl has traits they like and dislike which translate into a type of affection that is more effective during a date (which is when you play bejeweled) Which is more important than you think as you have only 20 turns to complete your goal.\n\nIts very weirdly addicting. I found myself especially interested in Aiko Yumi and went after her umm, to completion and then tried after a few more ladies. It kind of fiddles out in the mid game so to speak as the questions repeat and its becomes a meter management game.\n\nThere is definitely nudity, however its really no worse then what you can find with a simple google search.\n\nThe upgrading is not really terribly involved either, basically it makes a specific type of affection worth more during a date. Passion being a sort of multiplier as far as I can tell and Sentiment being a relatively useless resource but allows you to give gifts which act as powers ups.\n\nThe only weak points are you can literally just read a wiki and remove the memory aspect of the game and should you take that route you still need to sort of stay within the 4th wall? As in the character you play as knows less than you at that point based on your wiki knowledge.\n\nTHE GIST\nHuniePop is obviously not for kids or really even the immature. But its fun and relatively harmless. The voice acting is good and the characters are hyper stereotypical but with all due respect, that's what makes a character a character. And to be honest it gives a lot of life into a genre I never really cared about. That being Match 3.","May 23","true","6.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The puzzle game itself is surprisingly addicting, though, and the characters are pretty enjoyable. My favorite character overall is probably Aiko, but Kyu is far and away the funniest of the bunch. If someone made a mod where she was voiced by John DeLancey (get it, Q, Kyu?), I think I'd die laughing.\n\nThe game revels in how politically incorrect it is. Every woman you meet is pretty much one or another stereotype (i.e. the good girl, the mega-♥♥♥♥♥, the catgirl, etc.), as Kyu herself is often quick to point out. Most of the women play their parts to such a straight degree that it's hard not to laugh, but Kyu's "no fourth wall" conversations turn the whole thing into pure gold ("Come on, seduce me with your sexy puzzle skills!").\n\nIt isn't really possible to "lose" at HuniePop, per se, but each successive puzzle gets progressively higher point requirements to clear it, and if you don't make the most out of each portion of the day (particularly the night portion), you can quickly find yourself falling behind the curve; even easy mode will start to give you trouble going into your second week. Thankfully, you only have to pass the first four dates with each girl to make progress, after which you're free to fail as often as you like.\n\nOverall, it's a decent way to pass the afternoon. You're not gonna find the meaning of life in this game, but you will be entertained.","June 16, 2015","true","30.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

Date gifts added a pretty interesting level of depth, considering how basic match-3s usually are. I found myself staring at the board for surprisingly long durations trying to optimize my next move. It was a pretty mechanically sound puzzle minigame.\nThere's also the faster variant, which I'm not actually sure if you can fail or not, but I managed to avoid letting the bar completely empty after the first few seconds.\nBejeweled Blitz will prepare you for Match-3: Prepare to Fast mode.\n\nAs ridiculous as the dialogue was, this is the one occasion where I could actually bet that the game wasn't completely exaggerating. It didn't feel like any of the characters were really the same, and it (at least to me) justified the sometimes cringe-worthy or side-busting things they'd wind up saying, since it seemed to closely match their personality.\nAt the very least, the dialogue was incredibly amusing in its own right.\n\nThis game also reminded me I will never have a blue haired gf that has that much of an interest in vidya.\n\nAll in all, ♥♥♥♥ these birds.\n10/10, buy this game.","February 6, 2015","true","20.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

It really makes me happy to see stuff like this on the Steam Store, since obviously no prudish retailer would ever stock it.\n\nThe puzzle games are fun, and the dating portions are fun. It all blends together really well. The writing is cheesy sometimes, but also perfectly believable. There's even voices for every girl, though I'm really glad there's an option to turn them off... no offense to the voice actors or anything. The best part is that everyone refers you to your gender of choice. I finally don't have to feel excluded and can be completely immersed when I want to see some dating sim anime boobies (if only they were all like that).\n\nThe girls are all interesting, and very unique, almost guaranteeing you will find a girl who is right for you. However, if you settle for just one, you aren't getting very far. The goal is to bang all the girls. Yes, all of them. What else were you expecting from an H-game? The pictures you receive are a satisfying reward for all the work you put into getting to know the girls and taking them out on puzzle dates.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to all you pervs out there, but I also highly advise you grab the uncensor patch before playing it, because otherwise you're really missing out on the blue hair on Nikki's naughty bits.","June 12, 2015","true","13.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

All of the girls are the stereotypical 100 pound, young looking cockthirsty ♥♥♥♥♥es, but hey, that's what dating sims are about.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, and the difficulty level really scales up quickly for a challenge. It's very reminiscent of Pokemon Puzzle League and is similar playwise to Bejeweled. The game is a bit repetitive if you want to try and get all the girls on one game file, and it definitely takes some skill to play this game. Definitely fun, especially for the small price tag that it comes with.","January 25, 2015","true","62.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Having originally peeked at a copy which I didn't own for laughs, I was treated to an actually really hilarious set-up for what turned out to be one of the most fun and hilarious games I've ever played.\n\nHuniePop is an example of really knowing it's audience. Anyone willing to spend time with an open mind gets to experience this gem of a game on Steam. The gameplay is your standard match 3, it's straightforward enough for someone who's totally useless at puzzle games to get into and learn how to kind of pass everything but you can ramp the difficulty up if you want that.\n\nHuniePop's selling point is the humour. It's seriously funny if you have that kind of sense of humour. It's dumb, it knows it's stupid but it doesn't care. Just watch the intro sequence, if you laugh. It's probably for you.\n\nPros:\nCharacter designs are broad and fun. Beli best girl.\nGameplay is straightforward enough for anyone to get into but has a ramping difficulty curve if you need that.\nNot all of the game is thrown at you. You have to figure out how to get into bits of it.\nThe item system is initially somewhat confusing but you can easily figure out what setups are good for you if you put some thought into it.\nIt's seriously funny.\nIt still has some subtlety to it despite this. There are a few things about characters that poke fun at public perception in a very clever way.\nIt won't break the bank for price.\n\nCons:\nDon't expect depth from the characters. They've very caricature and stereotypical.\nIt's very dumb. Though this is a minor point.\nVery minor: There's a tiny amount of tinkering to unlock the blocked away parts of the game though it's simple enough and there's a walkthrough in the forum area.\nOnce you've smashed everything, there's not that much replayability.\n\nIn short, it's really good for what it does and it's a welcome addition to Steam in my opinion. It's funny, has it's own charm and have had some serious laughter over it.\n\nI don't think I'll ever figure out why half the people on my friends list who own this game are girls though.","November 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

The way the game kinda takes you by the hand and teases you about the next girl, encouraging you to meet them all, feels natural. The fact that you can't save on your own is a bother, but as a result the game is a lot on the forgiving side. You never really lose anything, so all you have to do is go for it. Besides, even if you can see the girls' profiles on the internet or even in the game (second tab of their HunieBee entries), sometimes they'all ask you completely random questions you have to give some sort of a personal answer. And that's nice.\n\nAnd And I'm a sucker for match-three, bejeweled, shariki, you name it. The extra strategy you need was like a hurricane of fresh air because it isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like most game modes in Candy Crush. Gearing up with gifts is part of the strategy too, so it ends up being somewhat complex and actually challenging.\n\nI'm kinda sad there is no closure though. I've reached a point I can win any date just having a couple passion matches and then flirtating (green blocks) forever. The difficulty curve is neatly planned until you get the last date with two girls, more or less. It gets far too easy then even if the difficulty keeps raising.\n\nThat and I would have loved some character development, especially for best girl Audrey. I suppose that's just how dating sims are, but it's kinda disappointing.","February 10, 2015","true","11.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","4"

Or perhaps you hate how your dating sims have no professional voice actress, is made in Flash, and has no redeeming qualities? Well, this may or may not be the game that was made for me  you!\n\nHuniepop - a fast dating sim, with a touch of fantasy, made to make your evenings cosy and your time spent fast.\n\nWhat fun gimmick is expected of this almost typical dating sim? A minigame. One single minigame. Luckily, the minigame (that we all have played somewhere before) has some interesting mechanics that makes you want to think two, maybe three, turns ahead. Though this sort of immersion into the minigame might make one forget what game he's actually playing, a puzzle game perhaps..?\n\nNow as for the actual Sim part, it's nothing too advanced if you have played any other typical game of the same genre - ya gotta talk, gift and flirt to win over the ladies. Oh wait, I'm wrong. By doing the mentioned stuff, you only score points for the date minigames and your own skill upgrades. Which means, ya can't get the ladies by using up all the dosh. Interesting in it's own way.\n\nTo summarise, the game is worth it's price. Is it to fun to play? I'd say yes. Does it have an interesting cast? 9 (+3) outta 9.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/recommended/339800/","tuttythefruity","Tutty The Fruity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tuttythefruity/","527 products in account","An excellent game that combines various genres (puzzle, RPG, dating sim) very well. Very addicting.\n\nThe first thing you should be aware of is that, between CGs explicitly depicting the female anatomy and the pursuit and outcome of having sex, the game's content is elevated from softcore titillation that Steam has typically released up to this point (i.e. Sakura Spirit) to hardcore hentai. Fair warning that that's what you're getting into; at its core, you're playing for sexy porn pictures, and you're buying a hentai game. It's good porn if you're factoring that in.\n\nThe game is VERY fun though. It incorporates a simple match 3 game that you've seen countless times, and adds enough rules and stipulations to distinguish it from other games. At later points in the game, you'll have to play carefully to make the right plays, deliver the right gifts at the right times to reach the end of a date successfully with limited moves available to you. There's enough strategy to engage you meaningfully. And, let's face it, exploding coloured tiles has always been supremely satisfying. And then the game changes when you successfully bring a woman to your room, and the game changes in such a simple and yet genius way, removing the time limit and turning the game into a race to pop matches as quickly as possible.\n\nThe main progression comes from learning more about the girls, increasing your skills, and expanding your options for game-changing items in dates. It feels meaningful and coincides well with the gradual increase in difficulty as the game goes. Gameplay is the best part about the game, really.\n\nSurrounding the gameplay, it's just a very professionally done package. Full voice acting is solid for the most part, the OST makes for delightful BGM when doing puzzles, art in general is very crisp and clear, the character sprites have solid variety in how their expressions change and in changes of clothing; lip sync is an incredibly nice touch.\n\nThe writing in the game is smart, witty, and plays primarily to the expectations of a western audience and to the mentalities of a "player" picking up women. It's exceptionally tongue-in-cheek; the dating sim is, by nature, a genre of manipulation and telling the girls what they want to hear, and HuniePop replicates that without falling prey to traditional Japanese writing tropes. There isn't much of a narrative and the characters aren't exactly deep, but the writing is spot on for interactions between any number of them.\n\nIt's an exceptionally well-done game. You won't be disappointed.","January 22, 2015","true","21.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's a bit easy at first but as you start finishing each girl's "route" the date puzzles get much, much harder. The game is really fun, even if you don't like date sims, you'll probably like this one since it knows how to take itself seriously and when not to. If you're looking for a super serious game, you won't like this too much. Yuri mode is also an option for those who want a bit of girl on girl, too.\n\nFor that price, if you are even slightly interested, it's worth it.\n\nThe steam version is censored, but there's a uncensor patch right there on the community hub by the devs themselves, if you want that kind of thing.

HuniePop is a fun, simple Dating Sims game that smacks reality & common sense right out of your freaken face. Want to be a nice dude who's actually in it for the .. you know, dates? NOPE. Enjoy joking about people's race and openly talking to strangers about how sexy they are and wanting to smoke a joint. The game has nice visuals though, and hilarious dialogue. Personally the puzzle is weak, the conversations are to short, I felt used because in order to bond- I needed to buy the girls SO much loot rather then actually getting along naturally. Another problem is that nothing happens when you actually go out on a date. They just change clothes and you beat the puzzle, that's it.\n\nDo note this game is good, especially for a $10 game. If you want something to spice up a Dating Sims game with fun, likable characters then this game does work well. I even admired that the girls will ask you in trivia to what you've learned about them. A huge flaw though is the core of the game's focus .... to get your guy actually dating. Since you finally get to socialize and hook up with someone, shouldn't that be more developed? Instead we get a guy who tries sleeping with 7-8 girls while trying to get them as drunk as heavily possible.\n\nThis doesn't make the game bad. It is fun, and enjoyable... and addicting even. But it's not exactly that brilliant of a Visual Novel and not even that 'erotic' compared to other Visual Novels. If you want an amazing Visual Novel with both depth, detail, and great story telling- just look into Katawa Shoujo. It's free to download. For something very erotic, best just to do porn man.

All in all it totally blew me away at how much attention to detail and polish was put in this game.  All characters are fully voiced, the dialogue and scripts are well done (the personalities between the girls really come out), and the graphics are colorful and fantastic.  Even when I thought I had maybe beaten the game, it added even more surprises (and more characters).  The puzzle mode is also fun but not too complicated.  It's also a very real puzzle mode, they're not just handing you a free win.  Even on easy (and I'm still not sure what the difference in the difficulty levels are) I found myself having to carefully plan my moves and my power-up items.\n\nOh, and there's boobs.  I know that's what you came for, and admittedly, so did I, but there's surprisingly a well-polished and fantastic game behind it.","February 2, 2015","true","13.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
