The reason why the recommendation is negative is mainly because objectively "bad" and "buggy", on launch there was an issue where the exe was linked improperly, but such issue has been patched out nicely fast too, to be honest. With little polishing, I would imagine that I would very gladly change the "not recommended" tag, if I feel that the game gets polished slightly around the corners.\n\nAs for the game itself, I find the game good in design, but bad in the quality of execution. The latter I will cover first:\n\nAs said, runing the game may be rather finnique, but not impossible, and the game is riddeled with bugs: The player character does not have an idle sprite facing left, the options are not options but a help screen (as in you can't change anything), the music does not stay off when it's turned off, but rather stops or starts by toggling the music on and off (because of wich I also noticed that screenshots from the game are not fullscreen, but cropped to top left corner). Also the jump is bound to W, Arrow up and Space, but as there are three keys for jusmping (no options = no rebinding), the space is the only key that works on these "Jump boosters". This is partially even game breaking, as every once and a while these boosters are set up as a form of obstacle, but can be circumvented by jumping normally by NOT using space as a jump key. And to add insult to injury, the moving platforms (that are of plenty) do not move (except downwards) while you're on them.\n\nThat all said, the hitboxes are consistent, the screenwarping is surprisingly fresh mechanic (in terms of game design) for something that has been around since joust at last, and while the movement does not have any momentum, the controls are tight enough. Added that with nicely casual puzzle levels, and simple mechanics that don't need a tutorial, the game is surprisingly good in design. It feels as if it was made in Games Factory (The predecessor of Multimedia Fusion), but with more care that most put in their god awful unity games.\n\n[EDIT]: Few oversights I forgot to mention; While the levels are properly designed, sometimes there is a situation where an enemy is positioned next to the level start so that it kills the unexpecting player rather surprisingly, and the shooting patterns that there are seem to be random which, in terms of game design, makes playing te game unneccessarily inconsistent, and adds random deaths especially as the shooting entities does not have any tell of when they're shooting.\n\n[EDIT2]: Updated a bug that was fixed, but left description of it for "archival reasons". +1 for developer for acting fast on fixing issues on that.\n\nTL;DR: If you're reading this because you want easy and simple working game, you shouldn't get the game, but if you know what you're getting in to, go ahead.","August 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","13"

I would consider it a puzzle platformer. You die after one hit, the clue is,  only hazards and enemies kill you. Jumping down a cliff or out of the windows results in the classic labyrinth experience as every border is connected to the level you are playing in. This means that if you go over the border at the right side you appear left, this works with falling, jumping and enemies.\n\nIt has a simple story about creation of life, you were made on the sixth day and got the task to collect all the colored crystals to return color to the world. Progress is achieved through buying the next level with your crystals, as you need every crystal to complete a level its a totally fair system. You just have to figure out how to get every crystal without dying as dying resets the level and what you gathered in it.\n\nThe music is something experimental, slightly reminding me of Corpse Part during a few parts. There is an option to turn the music off, if you dont like it. Upon death you hear a specific phrase that matches the story.\n\nAbout the difficulty, I started at easy and will check out the other difficulty levels later. But so far its relaxing (on easy) and sometimes you have to think shortly to get every crystal.\n\nI brought it because it looks interesting and I wanted to support the small developer.\nFor the asking price its a nice puzzle platformer which I for sure will complete. =)\n\nEDIT: The other reviews mention how the game doesnt start. For me, I downloaded it and pressed the normal play button to start it. Had no problems with it. =)","August 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Barrentwigget/recommended/395380/","Barrentwigget","Barren Twigget","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Barrentwigget/","77 products in account","You go around through levels collecting gems, avoiding enemies, and teleporting from left to righ, top to bottom, etc. As you collect gems in each level, it completes an aspect in the background, such as lighting up a block or growing grass. Each level slightly progresses in difficulty, adding new mechanics or enemies that keeps the game interesting. Some textures aren't exactly clean cut, like the enemies and Anki, and the hit detection is a little silly.\n(Just play level 10 and you'll more than likely see what I mean.)\nBut the gameplay makes up for these minor technical issues. Overall, if you enjoy platformers, I would recommend this. Anki is an enjoyable title at a pretty affordable price.","August 24, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","2"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nANKI\n\nThis is platformer that has non-euclidean rules. In this game falling does not lead to death... unless you land on a trap. The screen wraps left-right and up-down. This is the main mechanic in this platformer. There are numerous puzzles, mostly in the form of determining the path you take to collect all the crystals. Collecting these crystals is the main objective in each level, and you will only be able to proceed once all have been collected. The level ends when the last crystal is obtained, and this is where it becomes rather puzzle-like in route development. There are interesting mechanics that keep the levels fresh, some of which are unique to which "world" you are in. The pixel art and color palette are appealing. The only real complaint would be the hitboxes are slightly larger than one would anticipate on some traps.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/395380/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nPlatforming that makes use of fun mechanics\nSome of the songs in the soundtrack are great\nSimple controls\nMechanics of the gameplay are simple enough to need no tutorial\nHard enough to be fun without being unfair\nCons\nHitbox can sometimes fool you\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is $1 USD or whatever your national equivalent might be. If platformers are not your thing or you are easily frustrated, this game might not be for you. The number of levels combined with not encountering any bugs makes this game well worth that dollar. Fun platformer with a pleasant soundtrack.\n\n7/10\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","February 19","true","0.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This may sound simplistic but the old grey matter gets a bit strained as you start to think "now, how do I get to tha area?". It's colourful and jolly sounding so if you enjoy a platformer with a slight edge then this is for you.","October 4, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Może i grafika nie jest najwyższych lotów, za to grywalność stoi na dość wysokim poziomie. Generalnie w grze chodzi o to, żeb zebrać wszystkie kryształki z planszy. Czasami wymaga to kilku prób i powtarzania poziomu, ale nawet i ewentualne powtarzanie poziomu nie przeszkadza w grze. Muzyka jest dość przyjemna jak na tak prostą grę, nawet i pomaga w skupieniu.\n\nOgólnie to polecam tę grę. Jest to całkiem dobra gra polskiej produkcji, gdzie można się trochę zrelaksować. Wiadomo, nie jest to Wiedźmin 3, ale i też nie kosztuje 160zł a około 4zł. Moim zdaniem warto.\n\nENG:\nAn interesting little hybrid between a platformer and a logic game. You need to collect all of crystals on the stage, so sometimes you will need to repeat a stage because you've picked them up in a wrong order. This is really basic, yet kind of pleasant game.\n\nFor that price (1 Euro as per day of review) you can try it. It's not to special of course, it's not a AAA class game, but it still should be pleasant to play. The music is fairly good in this one too.\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 20","true","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So you have to find out where to fall in order to which location you want to go and in this course also pay attention how you fall down again, since this might be the one and only possibility to reach a certain crystal.\nReally like it.","March 19","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
