Be critical when reading.\nPlease also note that I've not had the patience to play through the entire game as of writing this review.\n\n\nThere are a few things I do like about this game now. I'll start with those.\n\n* This game has lot of content for its asking price\n- 11 maps\n- 17 or 19 weapons. It's a bit unclear.\n- a few dinosaur types, zombies\n- Four gamemodes in addition to four bonus gamemodes (8 in total)\n- Multiplayer (currently in beta, whatever that means)\n\n\n* Maps\n- Fend off a castle against a dinosaur invasion, or take to the snowy mountains to go dino hunting.\n- Good location variety is what I'm trying to get at.\n\n\n* Player progression\n- It has a currency system. You gain currency from killing dinosaurs and getting headshots.\n- You use the currency to purchase new weapons or upgrade your existing ones.\n\n\n* EXPLOSIONS\n- Michael Bay directed the survival mode.\n\n\n* Uh, performance?\n- You can most likely run it on either a lemon or potato.\n- Bugfixes and optimisation are in the works it seems.\n\n\n\n\nNow for the things I don't like about this game:\n\n* Core gameplay\nYou pick your weapons, pick your map and mode, and click on dinosaurs.\n\n\n* AI\nThe AI in this game is broken. All enemies have awful pathfinding, so you'll mostly see them get stuck on terrain. A lot of times the AI doesn't even react to getting shot - especially from far away.\nEnemies also have weird spawn locations, so the hardest part of this game is actually finding the dinosaurs. In addition they sometimes spawn inside you or right next to you, which is the only time you're likely to die in this game.\nGive the AI better pathfinding!\n\n\n* Maps\nThe maps all feel very rushed and badly designed. Why is there a tower on "Africa" if you can't climb up there? Why does "castle" feature a cool castle if I have to go outside the walls to even find the dinosaurs? On all the maps, there are numerous spots where you can place yourself to bug out the AI, if you have the patience to find the AI.\nGive the maps purpose and backstory! Why are there dinosaurs getting stuck on terrain in this wintery landscape?? Do I need to track down and defeat the ancient yetisaur?\n\n\n* Weapons/gunplay\nThe guns I've tried feel boring. The devs have put some work into making the guns feel a bit meaty by making your crosshair bounce around a bit when you fire. I've noticed no bullet drop, no bullet penetration, no tracers and bullets dont leave marks if you fire at any prop in the world. The guns aren't all awful, they just need some work.\n\n\n* Inventory\n(I think) You can carry all the weapons in the game at the same time and all bullet weapons have a shared stash of one ammunition type. Weapons have magazines which need to be reloaded after depleting them.\nThe devs could've done so much more with the inventory system.\n\n\n* Graphics\nGame looks about ten years old. There's varying texture and model quality all over the place. Some things look better than others. Lot of things look either awful or unfinished.\n\n\n* Physics\n- nope\n\n\n* Sound\nEither someone has diarrhea or that's a dinosaur yelling.\nDinosaurs don't make sounds when stomping around, or while doing anything else. There's just a diarrhea roar when you spawn.\nGET IT? -STOMPING AROUND-\n\n\nJust to summarize - nothing is fleshed out at all. Everything feels either broken or unfinished.\nEverything that makes a game cool or good is missing. With the exception of exploding dinosaurs. That part is okay.\nIn my opinion this shouldn't have made it onto Steam to begin with.\n\n* Other things\n- Standard unity launcher in addition to an options menu where you can turn off shadows, bloom and music.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nI want to recommend this game - I really do. I like the concept, I love dinosaurs, the asking price is nice. I want to be nice. I want to say, "hey this game has its moments!"  But the game is a turd. It's a piece of ♥♥♥♥. And not even a polished one.\nWaste of time.\n\n\nI would absolutely recommend it as a gift for someone you hate though.","September 17, 2015","false","4.2"," 183 of 217 people (84%) found this review helpful 103 people found this review funny","84","183","217","103","12"

There are pros and cons, which I will list below.\n\nPros:\n- Seems like the dev(s) keep updating the game\n- Cheap (got it for 49 cents)\n- Great art\n- Huge variety of weapons. Seems like before you had to buy them. Not anymore.\n- A few mods\n- Trading cards\n- Achievements and easy ones atop. Can be 100%-ed in 3-4 hours without playing multiplayer mode.\n- A few maps\n- Level up system. Gain levels to become stronger.\n- I think I've heard some rock/metal music playing. I don't listen to such music anymore but it's better than plain silence.\n- Even when it got repetitive, it was still fun\n\nCons:\n- As I mentioned above it gets repetitive after a while\n- When dinosaurs die their bodies can be moved and look really fake. It's like they've turned into plastic. lol\n- The radar isn't really good. I mean sometimes I was on the spot where the dinosaur(s) should have been and they weren't there. Had to look around to find them eventually.\n- No blood. I don't like that much gore stuff but it would've been more realistic with it.\n- Got stuck more than once and died because of that. But the dinosaurs got stuck too which helped me. xD\n\nConclusion :\nFor this price I think it's a must-buy.

It is not a good game but for $1 I found enough amusement here to justify the purchase .\n\nDinosaur Hunt:AC is a sandbox hunting game with very bad enemy AI . There is little to no fluidity in enemy animations so it feel like dinosaurs are floating toward you . In other words game is more like a shooting gallery where most of the fun comes from laughter . Killing dinosaurs feels very silly and even enjoyable in a way.\n\nIt goes without saying that game has many issues across the board and if you expect any depth in gameplay do not buy it . It is literally shooting helpless objects running toward you in streight lines , get new gun and repeat . Enemies can't even  handle areas that have no direct pathing so you will be untouchable on any elevation that needs a jump .  Game presents no challange of any kind .\n\nIf anything this game looks decent and weapons are fun to use . It has a lot of unlockable content and upgrades so at least there is some sort of progression by grinding new weapons .Maps look nice although many of them seem to be out of place.\n\nAlso developer makes constant updates so game is improving . Much better since I bought it but the game is far from being polished .\n\nDon't get angry at me if this review convinced you to buy a bad game. I bought it for ****s and giggles and well it does that in my opinion . Don't take it too seriously and maybe you will have fun with it .","November 11, 2015","true","7.3"," 43 of 62 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","43","62","3","3"

On certain levels, dinosaurs spawn with 0 hp, and one shot will kill them. Asia is the primary level this happens in. The 'sniper' and the 'pistol' have the same damage value until you get the sniper upgrade, and the pistol fires faster, so there's no reason to not use it. Terrain doesn't matter; there's no hitboxes for the terrain so you can shoot right through everything. Yes, you guessed it: this is a de_cache simulator.\n\nDinosaur hitboxes are cubes.\n\nEvery 'mission' gives 50 coins regardless of how difficult (read: tedious) it was. Most of the weapons cost thousands if not tens of thousands of coins, and the amount of grind required is unfun. I tried to sneak into the files to adjust my coin values, but I couldn't find a save file and I don't know how to mess around with unity.\n\nAmmo is pointless since it's free, but is probably just there because the dev didn't know how to remove it from a preset asset.\n\nThere's no music. Stock sound effects.\n\nFirearm animations are fine, which means they're probably stolen. However, it has the typical problems firearm animations do when designers make assets without actually knowing how to shoot a firearm. Primarily, misunderstandings with how the charge handle works. But whatever, it's not important in the scheme of things.\n\nLevels range from too large to too small.\n\nZombie level is dumb.\n\nMouse cursor stays on screen, so playing windowed is impossible, and I had to be careful with my second monitor.\n\nThe kill cam animations work from a certain distance. Once you're up close, (I think from about 30-40 meters, but I didn't check) they stop happening, so sniping is impossible and takes far too long.\n\nI didn't try any of the other firearms because they're too expensive.\n\nInteresting quote by the developer on the forums: "2. Regarding if it is a crap or NOT - that's the best I can do at moment. So as I really really lack negotiations skills, I'll put this as soft and calm as I can: Do NOT like it, Do NOT BUY IT."\n\nNot how it works, buddy.\n\nIn summary, I could give someone fifty cents to let me suck their ♥♥♥♥ and I would have more fun in ten minutes than I did with this game in half an hour.","September 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","21","30","4","14"

The story is short a outbreak like Jurassic Park but you not try to survive you hunt and elimate the problem on 11 champains, not a really big deal with all weapons you can buy.

I give the game 51 %, the most should avoid it if they dont like low frame rates, low details, old graphics, boring long runs for a few dinosaurs. Yeah there could be some more dinos and things like caves or more animals that live that time but its okay for this low price, the most people should make it better.

During this time you become solely responsible for an exodus of dinosaurs taking them single-handedly from the realms of the living, to what I can only assume is a fate worse than hell, or so you are lead to believe by both the main character and the voice over in the mission briefing. Seriously, I cannot figure out what the dinosaurs have done wrong and in fact most of them don’t even attack first.\n\nThe campaign is relatively low in content; however this is matched with a low price tag.\n\nThe game also hosts a survival mode & a multiplayer version of this aforementioned mode, which feels like faster paced versions of the campaign missions, in which the dinosaurs are constantly aware of your location and running towards you, less Dinosaur Hunt, and more Dinosaur I wish I reloaded faster.\n\nPros:\n\n+ 11 Campaign missions with different, relatively pretty locations.\n+ Low price tag.\n+ Multitude of weapons & a store to purchase ammunition and further weaponry.\n+ Controls are smooth; the game feels fluid and guns respond as expected.\n+ Two game ‘lab’ choices provide a mildly different feel.\n+ Active Developer (as of this review).\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Repetitive missions, each mission requiring you to kill X dinosaurs, a variety in challenge or objective based missions would be really beneficial.\n- Terrible voice for protagonist providing a Duke Nukem type feel, often saying things unrelated to the games theme, and also suggesting that he is aiming for world domination... No, seriously.\n- A lot of the game is in briefing narrative before mission start, instead of playable content, or viewable via cut-scenes.\n- No obvious reason to play survival mode other than to massacre dinosaurs, levelling up and/or unlocking weapons/character upgrades would provide a purpose to play this mode more than once.\n\nOverall this game can be recommended due to the low price tag, I wouldn't expect anybody to get countless hours out of this, however it may indeed be worth picking up due to it being a short, yet playable set of content. As more updates are announced I am confident that this game will only increase in quality and content.","February 18","true","25.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

It's a thrilling adventure that's hard to put down. The pure rush of adrenaline that faced me forced me to put down my controller and surrender to its overwhelming power.\n\nWhen an experiment has gone wrong in a suspected sabatoge, dinosaurs escape from an experimental lab and wreak havoc on the earth. You are the only man who can stop them and bring peace, or so you think.\n\nEverywhere you travel to, there are several dead bodies of the same people just laying around along with every type of ammo in the game lying around in the pile even though you can only hold 2 weapons at a time. Those dinosaurs are playing mind games.\n\nYou also don't start the campaign with a gun, you have to buy one with money the game gives you. I ran around the first level for 10 minutes while dinosaurs killed me before I realized this. I was a fool to not realize this was just a masterful game design choice far beyond my feeble mind. In addition, your character randomly yells sometimes. I think it's a metaphor of the release of anger within us that we all yearn for. When you think the game cannot get any better, it lays more story on you as you complete your first level.\n\nOn your adventures, you find the scientist you were searching for who claims the incident was not caused by sabatoge, but by a freak accident. The dinosaurs in the lab had been carrying a virus that turned people into dinosaurs, since the lab workers were exposed the most to the virus, they were killed by the dinosaurs first(?). In desperation for a cure, the scientist sends you out to get samples for testing as you kill about 14 more of the same 4 dinosaurs that are sometimes a different color.\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, the protaganist returns to the scientist only to discover he has become a dinosaur much larger and stronger than any other he has fought before (by that, he is exactly the same as the T-Rex you fought a few levels before, assuming that's meant to be him because the story is in no way connected to the gameplay.)\n\nAfter defeating the scientist, the protaganist realizes that the future of humanity does not look so bright as the only man who could ever make a cure has perished. He must continue to fight (I guess).\n\nThis is all I have played for now, I will be sure to update my thrilling tales while in the world of the greatest video game to ever be blessed by an artist's touch.\n\nI rate Dinosaur Hunt 10 unity asset stores out of 10.","September 18, 2015","true","4.7"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","18","31","12","0"

Well, I was wrong... it's actually entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing to do with a "nice" or "good" game, still it manages to be funny without being a parody of itself. Let's go for a list of cons and pros.\n\nTHE CONS\n- The overall graphics. Game uses some default Unity assets, and it tells;\n- The UI. Menus are not very user-friendly and in-game UI is a little confusing;\n- The walking. Sometimes the last animal you have to kill is 1500 meters away and you just have to walk and walk and walk and walk to it (your character gets tiret pretty soon and the default sniper rifle is not effective until you're at max 250 meters from the target). This can get boring sometimes.\n\nTHE PROS\n- The price. Full price is 0,69€. It's worth it.\n- The skybox. Holy Finger the skybox is GOOD. Better than F1 2015's.\n- The funny. Animals spawns randomly through the huge maps, so it's easy to see rabbits jumping in water (!) or triceratops climbing incredibly steep mountain sides (!!). And sometimes dinos just explode when they die. Yes, this game gives you EXPLODING DINOS. How can't I love it?\n\nI got all of the (easy, procedural) 5 achievements and I'm thinking of getting the two DLCs that, to date, are available.

By any standards. If you only play games that you think are good, this isn't the game for you.\n\nThat said, it you like games that are so bad that they're good, buy this game. Immediately. If you like things that are so bad they're good, and you skip this game, shame on you. This is the type of game you play with your friends and just laugh. The game's graphics are hilariously bad, the gameplay feels like it was taken right out of a Unity sample game. It has terrible ragdoll physics. The guns all basically play the same. The way the katana kills is hilarious. It's all perfect.\n\nSo, like I said: if you don't like games that aren't good, don't play this. But, if you are someone (like me) who loves things that are so bad they're good, and you skip this, you should be ashamed of yourself.

The dinosaurs were awesome, you have the choice to either put around 3000 shots into a Dino to kill or you can just one shot headshot it!

That being said i havn't played or updated the game for a while and will probably wait for quite some time before making another review. to give the developers more time to update and fix the game. But i feel as though this game needs to be reviewd at this current point in time aswell.This review wont be to attack the developers or the game, it is strictly a review on how the game is at it's current point.\n\nGameplay- 3/10\nTo me it's really repetitive and simple, which may not be a bad thing alot of people enjoy the simple games. However, personally i enjoy something a bit more intracate. but that's just a personal opionion. The dinosaurs all feel the same, apart from looks and sizes they act the same and have the same movement paterns. The game does not feel immersive and the in game sounds just don't fit in.  But again the developers ( Racing Bros) are doing a great job at constantly updating the game and making it a little bit better each update.\n\nGraphics- 4/10 The graphics don't look to bad. the textures might not be the best but at least ( from my knowlage) Racing Bros are not taking assets and just plugging them into a game like alot of developers are lately. the sound design doesn't feel as though it fits in with the game as ( from when i last played) the dinosaurs all sounded the same. the map design isn't to bad but it could use some work as the areas feel lifeless and plain.\n\nStory- 2/10\nFrom what i gathered there is no real story in this game, you just kill dinosaurs and sometimes zombies/mobs. The campaign mode within the game is just finding a dinosaur within the map and killing it and repeating until you get enough kills to enter the next map.\n\nOverall- 6/10\nThis game does have a decent overall score mainly due to the fact that this game is litterally the price of a lollipop. Racing Bros are not asking for much as anyone can easily rack up $1 that being said the game still needs many improvements to sound graphics and gameplay, and if you want something that is simple and cheap then feel free to pay this small amount.

I see missions in the future.\n\nThe X input software included works perfectly, and the graphics are GREAT.

Hunger and thirst is a must. the settings in the game Need it. it looks like you ware dropped into a zone, and I love that. but its so open, without the added stress of food and water, this is just running around killing.\n-Kill dinosaurs, loot corpses, take to evac point (capture the flag style) I am so into this.\n-Food/water drops would be cool , if randomly dropped in.\n-reload while running (ok, we are killing dinosaurs.)\n-Stop Exploding the enemies unless its grenade related. Ragdoll them out.\n\nI LOVE this game now.Havent uninstalled it yet!\n\n8/10\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nPC Test Build:\n\nI3 (speed 3400)\ngtx 780\n5 gigs Ram ( my cheat, 1 for windows, 4 for gaming lol)\n\nBad matchup in card/cpu, but the 3 gb gddr5 +3400 mhz processor, runs all of my games at 60fps on high... (older games, ultra)\n\nFunny, 1080p 40-55 fps, 1366x768 60-70fps\n\nSmoothness over graphics anyday.\n\nThat said, ON TO THE REVIEW\n\nMy Rig chews this game up and spits it out graphically, but the game runs on the most meager of systems, judging the requirements. But I digress...\n\nThere is a unique opportunity here for the person making the game. An opportunity to make the game for all people, and their tastes.\n\nPros\n- Nice graphics (no Im not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but smoothness and playability count)\n- Playability (has an awesome SERIOUS SAM Vibe thing going on with it, and controls very well)\n- Tried Multiplayer (well, not  exactly, just ran around the empty level and I was impressed, assuming everything stays this smooth)\n- Looks like the developer keeps updating the game.\n\nCons\n\n- If the support stops, the game will suck.\n- maybe allow maps to be made for multiplayer, offered up via workshop.\n- enemies are great, but the bullets need to do more damage, assuming that the gist of the game is "dino hunting" so the caliber bullet must be higher. it wont be too easy, if the numbers of wave spawns increased. and the money can be lowered. 5 coins per kill. a headshot needs to force an enemy down. I shouldnt be getting thousands for multiple headshots on the same creature.\n- as of the build I'm playing, the trees have no collision, so it hinders the view, and cramps general playability, so I end up enjoying the desert a lot more...\n\nI like the game. it has all of the bones of a fantastic shooter, because the 1st half hour is extremely important in the success of the game.\n\nHaters on a game like this, clearly dont see the potential.\n\nDeveloper!!!\n\n- multiplayer horde mode\n- asset driven map maker (cubes, walls, stairs, spawn points) Keep the maps.\n- enemy soldiers in place of zombies\n- money system is excellent, working for guns and ammo is perfect.\n- Counterstrike controls  really helped the game. Player maps (which you can offer up) can give us a healthy alternative to counterstrike.\n- any way to add splitscreen? (man, I would pay extra for this add on. this way , naysayers on splitscreen dont have to purchase.)\n\nI love shooters, and what the developer has built here is an opportunity.\n\none that should be capitalized on.\n\nLike killing dinos? great!\nZombies? Yes please.\nSoldiers? maybe in the future.\nBots? maybe in the future.\n\nBased on the Indie peers, this is a solid 7/10.\n\nexcellent minute to minute gameplay, even if you just want to kill something.\n\nNeeds more blood.\n\nPS\n\nI sort of cheated, as I set up the controls on the pinnacle game profiler, and played it like call of duty. so I think it needs Controller support, because it handles so well with it.\n\nanyway,\n\nGod Bless.","January 3","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It just really brings you into the absolutely boring suspensful world of Dinosaur Hunt: Africa , China and USA Contract. The music is a tiring great loop of action packed music that any idiotic rad action fan would love. The game obviously had zero amounts a lot of passion put it. It is a waste of time fantastic.

The new updated Menu is very useful in many ways new graphics settings control settings and resolution settings which it didn't have before.

Also gun noises could be higher quality. -- May be being fixed\n- Massive map, the dinosaurs are so far away and takes u around 15 minutes to try and kill all of them in a mission, just because of the distance between them, and only being able to sprint for a few seconds\n- Campaign is just killing dinosaurs, no story or anything. Well there kind of is i guess.. but not much.\n- Survival is terrible, the dinosaurs should come in waves and be attracted to you, instead they just are sitting ducks waiting to die and waiting for u to spend 30 mins trying to run around the map ---- Fixed if you Turn up difficulty\n- Dinosaurs can attack random rabbits, and the rabbits are invincable.\n- You can still pick up ammo for your gun, although your ammo is full. You can't pick up health packs when you're at full health, so why should you be able to with ammo? --- Fixed\n- The health and name of dinosaur don't show when scoped in with sniper when they are at long range, so can't tell how much (if any) damage you are giving.\n- Dinosaurs barely ever attack you---- Fixed I guess if you turn difficulty up xD\n- The health you start with and get is WAY too much.\n- Can't check mission objectives.. (even though you pretty much only need to shoot ♥♥♥♥, no need to check I guess)\n- Trailers barely show any of the game, and no gameplay. -----Fixed.\n- Sometimes the dinosaurs bits falling off dont make sense.

I'll start with the creative depiction of dinosaurs in the game. These dinosaurs make toilet flushing sounds and instead of being bound to land like we all believe they were, they walk through the sky to get you. The developers have nerfed this flying ability by making the beasts move at a speed of one millimetre per second, however this masterpiece of a game includes some diverse control layouts to challenge even the best of gamers like pressing E to run and middle mouse to aim. The game comes with only one graphics quality option called "Normal" and it is the best I have ever seen. If you have 59 cents, buy this game. It's definitely worth it.\n\n66 million years/10\nGood laugh for the price.\n\nEDIT: Unfortunately, this game recently got updated and lost many of its unique features. The control layout has been replaced with a cliche one and the dinosaurs are now unable to fly. However, while testing out the new update I was able to buy more weapons and discovered some fascinating products of creativity like a bazooka with a seven round magazine that makes shotgun sounds. This masterpiece still manages to impress me.","September 19, 2015","true","2.5"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","49","20","41","25","4"

You bet\nWant rocket launchers that sound and work like shotguns and a 7500 coin weapons (at 250 coin per mission kill) that does less damage than most guns in the game? Of course you do\n\nSeriously, this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥. It started with the worst keybindings in the world and there was nothing you could do about it but press E to run and Right-click to reload. But to be honest, I haven't had more fun finding bugs in a broken ♥♥♥ game that only cost me 60 cents. That's right, A whopping 60 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cents is all this cost and I have been laughing at the dumkbest things that happen in this game. Dinosaurs spawning on top of each other, weapons that don't have models, and maps becoming blank for no reason. Seriously, someone call TotalBiscuit and let him see the gun models in this game, he will rant his lungs dry.\n\nGood game/10, bugged dino mechanics. Can't wait for the next patch and the sequel.\n\nAnd because buying this game pushes patches, I have spent an astounding $2.40 and "gifted" it to all my friends with the addition of a flood of messages like "What the F--K is this?" and "What amd I playing" and also "Why is the ADS for the shotgun way off?"\n\nDon't take the game seriously by any means whatsoever. The dev added some patches and bug fixes but there are so many and like the description says, If you were looking for a top-notch game, you are in the horribly wrong place.\n\nThis is The Slaughtering Grounds with actual working AI and is worth how much it is. You could buy a bottle of soda, or 4 copies of this game; a nice date with your girlfriend (assuming you don't spend an eternity in this game) or enjoy your life.","September 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

So what can I say? I played it for 25 minutes and may never again. If that is worth a dollar to you than it is a hit !!!\n\nThe game has a lot of potential as a fast shooter but I really don't like dying all the time. If I was a little more careful I guess it woudl be better but it relaly does not feel like a hunting game and there is no cover so it then is defined as a run and gun game in my opinion. The dinosaurs move weird and it make my head hurt. And while I am shooting one 3  or more are eating me. It cousl be fun if they just made it a lot more fun and re did the textures. After playing in HD for years now these dated graphics just blend into each other for me.

Now lots have put this down! Why? I realy like  it :) yes its not the best dino game out their but i do see what the dev is trying to do here. Bugs! Bugs! so what!! in the past two days ive had more updates to the game, and now got the DLC for this. 4.3 Hours play to date and will play more :). To the dev thanks for your game but if you can tweak some thing`s like thud sound`s to some of the dino`s and more enviroment sound`s added this would make so so better, I like to play with no music to get a better feel for the imersion of the game if you understand what i mean? maybe some sound`s of wind, and when walking through grass the sound of my feet would change. Well done. :) Oh! one last thing the map can switch on and off :) can we have a switch the hud on and off too? :) this game is fun to play if you like dinos like me ha!!.\n\nGfx 7/10 well drawn nice lighting, some maps need work.\nSound 6/10 ok could do with some additions :)\nGame fast good shooting no lag on my system :)\nUpdates regular :)\nBugs yes so what!\nPrice cheap :) worth it\nDlc yes :) hope to see more :)\nFun yes :)","November 10, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its been massively updated. It's far better then before but its still lacking a lot. For one theres no sounds. other then gun shots, foot steps and roars. Even if there were I would not of heard them, seeing as I had to turn my speakers almost all the way down do to the annoyingly loud foot steps and gun shots. However dinos will now give full chase on you once disturbed and are VERY over powered. Two hits from spino and I was done, although I did not see an animation when he hit me so he basicly killed me by poking me with his snout. The menu is very quick and simple which I like and has very fast load times. However I could not find any in depth options for the life of me like aim speed. all in all the game is very much improved and is now well worth what I bought it for.\n\n"BUT" its very quite with very few sounds at very high volume, Its hard and the dinos take way to much bullets to the head to die. I felt more like I was playing some prehistoric screen saver flash game then an atcual dino hunt game.\n\nfinal word is 5/10\n\nWorth having for a quicky game if you have a 5 minute break or lunch..","November 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah it looks like crap but the guy who made it was honest atleast "If you are looking for AAA quality, ace & crack, top-grade Dinosaur Survival MultiPlayer Open World Game, with millions of details, whatever, there are better positions out there, so please move on - DO NOT BUY IT." That's why I like this game, for 99c (or 59 at the time of this review) it's not as bad as other games for the same price or even higher (Bad Rats or Temper Tantrum are 2 that come to mind) I say that even if it's not the best game I still have a little bit of fun with it and I'm sure if the Dev keeps updates going, it could possibly get better. Look at Orion: Prelude, was one of the worst games on Steam but the Dev(s) have fixed that, the game currently has 76% positive (at the time of this review) I never played it before when it was bad but still, I hope you get my point.\n\nDev, hope this review can inspire or atleast give you a smile and good luck on any updates or other games you make :)","September 20, 2015","true","5.0"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","48","20","42","7","0"

I went in with this mentality to Dinosaur Hunt: Africa Contract and I was surprised with how good this film really is. A lot of the time people that write comments will judge a film without seeing it and it gives the film a bad name. Ignore what you hear about this film and take a look, I'm sure you will be surprised with it also. Adam Sandler has shown that he is capable of playing a serious character in contrast o the aggressive and funny character he normally plays in his film, Dinosaur Hunt: Africa Contract is no different, Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments, Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife, and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond Employee. David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, and Jennifer Coolidge are funny in their supporting roles in this film. Australian audiences expecting to see Sophie Monk in a major role will be disappointed as she is honestly a very minor character in the film, in contrast to what the Comedy Chanel is running about her on Foxtel/Austar.\n\nAll in all I do recommend seeing this film, if not to learn a valuable lesson about priorities in life, but to have a laugh and to enjoy a film that is better than what was expected of it.","September 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","47","16","34","15","2"

As I opened the game I felt an immense amount of joy and satisfaction, as I knew this would be an experience rivaled by no other. As I began my treacherous quest throughout the vast lads of Africa, I was greeted by the ominous roar of a reptilian creature of gigantic proportions. I had never seen quite a creature in my entire life. I then proceeded to shoot the beast multiple times in the chest with my rifle. The creature feel to the ground with blood pouring from the multiple wounds I had left in its torso. Btw I'm gay. I ran towards the beast with my knife drawn ready to harvest the meat of the exotic animal. I felt invincible knowing that a mere man such as I could bring this gargantuan reptile to the ground. I had soon lost the feeling of adrenaline, and I was left longing for more. I continued to take down many more dinosaurs leaving their blood shed across the great African plains. By the end of my quest I had killed roughly 58 dinosaurs, and let me tell you that is 58 minutes of my life i wouldn't trade for anything in the world.\n","September 18, 2015","true","1.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","45","9","20","6","0"

The dinosaurs must have gotten very fat after all those years of being extinct. My turtles move faster then them. The maps are small and there is not much to do. It gets very repatitive. What i would recommend is the following: add more enemies along with the dinos, make the dinos a little faster, BUT NOT LIKE CRAZY HOLY CRAP FAST, expand the maps or add more objectives, like saving someone from the dinosaurs or somthing. Just some feed back like you asked. I spent my money on this game and im trusting you to improve it. After a couple updates i hope to be able to change this review for the better. It is so bad its funny though, and it was only 69 cents.\n\nUpdate: Now that you have updated this game it is a lot more interesting. The new maps and game modes are great. There is zombie hunt, terrorist hunt, animal hunt, and zombie hunt. the button layout makes more sense now and you added music so it is not so akward. The devs of this game are some of the best.

Guns easy to use if sights work and automatic reload when you are shooting at Dinosaurs really helpful. Not having to search for right key to press before you become a Dino dinner. Sniper rifle really nice to use and telescopic sights let you see what you are shooting at a distance. Really addictive and good fun. Some bugs but looks like being worked on to improve it. Sights don't work on machine gun, Uzi? or Missile launcher but can still hit dino if you point and fire in their direction and large calibre snipers rifle now has sights that work but transparent so hard to use.  Nice animations on Dino's and can build up large scores in survival mode if you overlook spot were wave charges from and pick them off. Controls better since tweek as easier to use left and right mouse keys for fire/sights and scroll for next/previous weapon and can now use esc to leave game. Your graphics for shooting just as good as World of Guns and if anything easier to aim/reload in your game. Would be nice to have name of gun you are using on screen. When you manage to floor Dino with one well placed shot you will soon get hooked.

Based on that rubric, Dinosaur Hunt: Africa Contract is absolutely worth the money. It's a wonky, janky, dodgy game with a big heart and a very simple mechanic. One of the biggest draws of this game is that the missions tend to be very short, so you can load it up and play a few missions in half an hour or so. It's a stupid, silly, lovable game, and if you've got a little bit of spare change to throw away and an hour to kill, I would definitely recommend Dinosaur Hunt: Africa Contract.","September 26, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Make it like Monster Hunter but, with Dinosaurs and guns. It would be awesome!\n\nI feel ripped off paying 59cents\n\nUpdate 10/10/15 - The game is now very unoptimized when it first released I was getting a solid 500fps now I can get no more than 40 fps. I have no idea what happened in that regard but, the game didn't really change much in the graphic department. A ton of bloom was added and grass not much else.\n\nAs for the gameplay I have no idea if its changed because im not playing a game so unoptimized. It might be better It might be worse if you are curious you can check it out yourself.\n\nUpdate 10/19/15 - The FPS issue is fixed so now getting well over 100 fps and that is perfectly fine. The gameplay seems better than the first build Dino's still glitch sometimes one completely froze while I was shooting it but, only happened once. The dinos atleast move around now and aren't potato shooting bags. They move and attack almost like jeez i dont know an actual game. The game is improving and the developer seems to care about it so that's good. Seems like its worth the 50 cents now or however much.\nIf you are looking for a short burst of fun of flash game level this is not a bad game. It appears to have multiplayer now so that's cool. I have not tried it though\n\nchaning my rating to a positive.","September 17, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","4"

This game has a lot of good ideas though and is overall an interesting concept. For that ill rate the game up. Ill be looking forward to see what improvement there will be in the future.

(At launch, I couldn't even get the game to launch)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p334c8IxBbs\n\nThis game allows you to work through several different maps, each with a different theme (swamp, forest, jungle, cave, winter mountains, etc) and either hit your comma key to engage a survival mode where many enemies will attack you until you either die or turn off the survival mode by hitting the comma key again... OR.. you can simply kill and fight one enemy at a time on most maps, taking you back to the menu after every kill.  Each progressive map requires more total kills to unlock.\n\nBy far the most fun to be had in this game is the final zombie map, where hitting your comma key creates an endless invasion of zombies (Think Red Dead Redemption: Zombie Horde Mode) While it's not a AAA game like RDR, it is quite a bit of fun, especially watching the zombies and demons you blow up shatter into pieces with each kill.\n\nThere are unlockables that you can reward yourself with as you score coins for each kill you make in the game.  These include more damaging weapons, new weapons, and more.\n\nThe game is too easy in my opinion, but you can always greatly increase your challenge by putting your gun and crossbow away and taking out your dagger, and then turning on the survival mode as well on any map.\n\nThis game is EASILY WORTH IT"S 99 CENT PRICETAG!  While it likely won't offer you dozens of hours of exciting gameplay, it should definitely give you many times its pricetag in overall value for perhaps a few hours of fun over time.\n\nMy video details my review and exactly how and why this game score an impressive 78% from me.  It's an impressive score for a game that costs under a dollar.\n\nEnjoy!  Highly recommended for any dinosaur or zombie slaying fans who don't mind less then amazing AI and a few glitches.","September 17, 2015","true","2.0"," 18 of 58 people (31%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","31","18","58","13","1"

It's a nice skeleton for a game, but lacks the meat which will make it anything more than an impromptu spontaneous buy. It works wonders as a proof of concept for a dinosaur hunting, or dinosaur slaughtering game. The hunts are easy and integral aspects of hunting like reward for shot placement are overlooked. The dinosaur survival mode probably needa a lot of work too, it's just dinos spawning at the same spot of the map which are 1-hit kills.\n\nThere's flaws, sure, but the game's not pretending to be anything it isn't. It might even be a great timesink, similar to the appeal of clicking games ala clicker heroes. Do a mundane task over and over until you acquire an item which makes that mundane task slightly easier than before only to continue ad infinitum.\n\nThe most fun thing to do for sure though is to not buy any rifle upgrades and play the zombie map in survival mode. I can't say much for the rest of the game really, but this is actually awesome. There's three types of zombies: crawlers, walkers and some gargoyle-esque creature. Gargoyles tank a lot of damage, crawlers are reasonably fast and hard to see (especially when the field is laden with corpses) and the walkers just...walk. The gamemode forces you to prioritise the gargoyles, but while doing this a lot of other zombies are crowding you and you're constantly checking your feet.\n\nIt is important to note that for this gamemode to be most fun it's imperative that you kinda just sit around for a bit not killing anything while the zombies spawn so that there's more of a horde feeling to it.\n\nOtherwise, if the developer puts more work into it I'll be watching the game with a keen eye. It is ultimately worth the money if you think you're going to play around in it anyhow.","September 17, 2015","true","3.5"," 23 of 72 people (32%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","32","23","72","30","0"

I still have my gripes, such as no volume control (there is a mute for music, but no volume sliders anywhere, you have to use your PC's sound mixer), the default controls being wonky as ♥♥♥♥ (you can change them from the launcher, though), and some of the dinosaur's 'perfect headshot' hitboxes seem off, BUT it is now a playable shooter game.\n\nOriginally I was not able to play the game at all, but was able to spend some time on it today, killing a few dinosaurs and finishing a few levels. Considering the developer seems to actively be working to fix the issues it has, and is actively listening to the reviewers, I think it could be heading to a good place for one of those "I have some time to kill, let me go shoot a dinosaur" sort of games.\n\nI'm going to change this to a recommend for the time being, as there doesn't seem to be a neutral option, but I think it still needs a little more work.\n\n\n---ORIGINAL REVIEW UNDER THIS LINE---\nThis game is garbage. When in full screen the mouse and cursor don't sync. In windowed they sync but clicking on anything will cause it to pull windows up that are in the background. There doesn't seem to be an in game setting's menu and that's a problem when the volume is astronomically high. The countrols are counter intuitive, and while they can be remapped when launching the game, they can't be changed in game that I can find.","September 18, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"

From there with each kill you gain coins to buy weps etc useing the "P" button during the hunts..\n\nThe map ARE sooo much better then the orginal build. the Textures are cleaner as well execpt issues with the 2d Grass (yellow) there broken.. (ill have a video and screen shot to show what I talking about..\n\nI will have a video up regarding the new build later to match this review..\n\nAll in all this game dose suffer a lot of issues that other games built on the Unity3D engin suffer. and I have all that in the later video\n\nAll in all  this game and the dev and made a lot of progress since releases. I have a Before and Now video to show just how much the game has changed.\n\nI wish steam had a Nutural Button cuz I can not really Recommend this.. nor can I say its the worse thing on steam any more ether.. Game dose pack decent amount of content for the asking price.. So much more then before that this title could easily be worth $4.99 now. And becuase of the progress made thus far my Thumbs down will go to a thumbs up..\n\nSirvival mode along is worth the price tag if your on the fences aobut buying..\n\nTo the Dev keep up the work this title is truly becoming something. Also too bad you didn't releases this as a early access.. you could have easily made a few more $$ buy slowly incressing the price till the game was full finished.  Also I don't think its quite there.. so keep it up","September 19, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

Its pretty buggy. I had ammo crates and health kits dropping randomly from the sky for some reason, my shotgun would lose all its ammo if i switched weapons. You randomly spawn into each level but for me, that meant, either spawning in the middle of 10 dinosaurs and getting killed immediately, or spawning over 1000 metres from the dinosaurs, and with no vehicles and only a sprint that lasts a few seconds, means a lot of running.\n\nBut with all its short comings, i still found myself somewhat enjoying the game. I'll probably contuine to play it, just to see it through to the end, if there is one.\n\nHopefully it will be patched to more of a working game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/recommended/401190/","russianlot","Sir Russianlot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/","768 products in account","EDIT: Game recieved huge update on 8 January 2016 and is now even better. Some of the improvements are:\nNew gun models (Machine gun is now gorgeous)\nNew player and animal animations\nSome dinos got updated models and graphics (allosaurus looks much better)\nGame also runs a bit smoother\n\nAnyways original review below:\n\nBy just looking at the screenshots, first thing that probably comes to your mind is:\nHoly Mother of Jesus what is this ♥♥♥♥?! Why did you even bother?\nWell let's look at this and see what it has to offer :)\n\nLet's start with the positives 1.  Game looks decent and runs pretty well. Sure it's no Battlefield 4 (when you think about it, it's not even Half Life 2) and some of the models look a bit cheesy and weird but I think it's completely playable.\n2.  There is a whole lot of guns in this, 24 to be presise. You got everything from melee weapons, assault/ sniper rifles to shotguns and RPG. Some weapons like AK Sniper and Crossbow can also be upgraded 3 times.\n3.  Maps are huge and quite varied. Locations include some medeval castle, Iraq (?), swamps, city etc.\n4.  Game is under constant change and improvement. Developer listens to community and constantly updates the game. Since I bought it, there have been over 15 updates that changed main menu, balanced guns, overhauled campaign mode added multiplayer etc.\n5.  Some of the dinosaurs look really cool.\n6.  Price. Costs almost nothing. Good price, I like! Yes.\n\nNow, if it looks like I was scraping at the bottom of the barrel to find positives, you're kind of right, because this game is basically Early Access at best.\n\nAnd so the negatives begin:  1.  I said game looked goodish. Well, it kinda goes both ways:\nYou see, some of the things like shadows, lightning and water are ok, while others are downright terrible like some buildings, trees and ground. Sometimes when you deal very much damage to a dino, it explodes in these half colored bits and it looks just... plain bad.\n2.  Dinosaurs behavior is downright crappy. They simply walk aimlessly intil they get shot, at which point they beeline stright towards you in hope of tearing you with your 1 000 000 hp to pieces, at which point they usually die by you hand. Some dinos like raptors can be seen hunting rabbits on some maps, but man that is not something you see often.\n3.  Campaign mode is can be completed in about 10 - 15 min. There's nothing more to be said about it, other than it would get pretty damn repetitive if it lasted longer. While maps are huge and some are even great, objective is always the same.\n4.  Weapon models are hit and miss. Granted I haven't unlocked everything yet, but some like M99, AWP like sniper, Crossbow and LMG looks pretty damn bad. Same reload animations and models that you can see through. Some guns are also very underpowered while others are waaay to overpowered (M99 and LMG comes to mind).\n5.  When you play survival, your FPS will tank in about 5 min, no matter how powerful you PC is. This also happens in campaign and Hunt mode (have not tested online yet), so optimization is needed here.\n6.  There are some bugs and glitches here and there.\n\nTL;DR and/or conclusion:So at this point I basically teared this game a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you think I really hate it.\nAnd while it is kinda bad, even terrible at times, I still enjoy it from time to time and/or after update.\nAlso, if you think that this game looks bad now, you really have no idea how it looked and played at launch.\nI actually respect the developer of this game, for not abandoning this like a quick cash grab, but instead, standing up and constantly working on the game with patches and improvements based on community feedback. Seems like they have ambition to make this into something special in the future and I truly hope they succeed. By looking back on it, I think they are well underway.\n\nP.S.\nGame is incredibly cheap. I got it on sale for almost nothing, so basically there were no regrets to be had either way.","December 23, 2015","true","22.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I still have my gripes, such as no volume control (there is a mute for music, but no volume sliders anywhere, you have to use your PC's sound mixer), the default controls being wonky as ♥♥♥♥ (you can change them from the launcher, though), and some of the dinosaur's 'perfect headshot' hitboxes seem off, BUT it is now a playable shooter game.\n\nOriginally I was not able to play the game at all, but was able to spend some time on it today, killing a few dinosaurs and finishing a few levels. Considering the developer seems to actively be working to fix the issues it has, and is actively listening to the reviewers, I think it could be heading to a good place for one of those "I have some time to kill, let me go shoot a dinosaur" sort of games.\n\nI'm going to change this to a recommend for the time being, as there doesn't seem to be a neutral option, but I think it still needs a little more work.\n\n\n---ORIGINAL REVIEW UNDER THIS LINE---\nThis game is garbage. When in full screen the mouse and cursor don't sync. In windowed they sync but clicking on anything will cause it to pull windows up that are in the background. There doesn't seem to be an in game setting's menu and that's a problem when the volume is astronomically high. The countrols are counter intuitive, and while they can be remapped when launching the game, they can't be changed in game that I can find.","September 18, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"

It has improved quite a bit since it's original release date.  The problems in my original review are gone, and the game almost seems like a brand new environment to play in.  The maps are improved, the dinosaurs are a little more active and provide some challenge in killing on occasion.  At this point, it is enjoyable.\n\nAt 59 cents I didn't expect much.  Somehow I got less than I expected.  You've got a few locations to kill a random dinosaur in.  Africa, Asia, Caves, Winter, Zombies, Swamp(with bamboo forests even).  There's a bullet cam effect for when you shoot the sniper rifle.  It mostly gives you time to think about the moments in life that have lead up to this moment.  Most of the environments consist of a floating island that you can easily jump off of towards your death.  There is also a survival mode that makes the dinosaurs explode after one or two bullet wounds.  If you're close enough to the explosion you'll get shot into the sky...  You can also find a nice cornerr of the map to sit so multiple dinosaurs can load onto the map.  Some will get stuck in trees, some will appear in the sky.  All of them will appear through a moment of firey teleportation.\n\nYou earn coins for killing dinosaurs, and zombies, which are then used to buy upgrades to your weapons or new weapons entirely.  You can buy other things too.  You can even buy bullets for free, which seems to make the process pointless.\n\nIf the pointless endeavors of the game haven't persuaded you elsewhere, the technical problems might.  1.  I hope you like your mouse cursor, because you're going to see it a lot.  2.  Prefer to run the game windowed?  Enjoy clicking off screen as the mouse does not get locked to the game.  3.  There's no quit button, so you need to Alt+F4, Alt+Tab, or Ctrl+Alt+Del your way to a better experience.","September 20, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/recommended/401190/","BrickMcSlabHouse","Viktor Vasko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrickMcSlabHouse/","297 products in account","REWORK:: My initial review may have been just, however unlike most of the ♥♥♥♥ posted to steam greenlight the Dev is actually working with the community to better the game. Needless to say this was a huge step in the right direction for Dinosaur Hunt Africa Contract warranting me to re-do my review. It was nice to hear that the developer is placing time into his game that he cares about similar to the dev for UNLOVED. Okay so contrary to the previous review was written on a previous build but the game seems to have done a complete turnaround.\n\nThe combat seems to have improved with the dinosaurs now moving alot faster than their previous. With that said it still has some flaws with damage taken/done but nothing to detrimental to overall enjoyment. It was also nice to see some small things changed I.E. animations so the dinos don't just slide around at a really slow pace, the dinosaurs actually seem to carry a weight so props to the dev to knocking that out. On top of that the progression seemed to have a change as well with each level having a set of actual objectives to complete rather than the old version which was nothing more than go in kill one to two dinosaurs and leave. So this was also a pleasant surprise.\n\nOverall the game is certainly progressing in the right direction to become something worth owning especially with it's fixes from it's original version it may be worth the small 99 cent pricetag. The amount of fun you will have with it is pretty much based around what you enjoy. Is this what it would be like to hunt dinos? I really still don't think so and I also don't think this game was made for me but don't let that stop you from giving it a go. In it's current build with what time I've spent with it my 2-3 major gripes are relatively small. For one you do too much damage to the dinos nearly one shotting everything especially with the shotgun. 2 the dinos spawns are random and so are yours so you may spawn next to or even on top of a dino and some of them have the ability to kill you in 1 hit and revert your progress on the level so that would be nice to see fixed. And lastly an addition of a more refined UI and shop would be nice to see but polish certainly should be the last things on a devs mind.\n\nTo finish this review I would like to say thanks to the Racing Bros (The Dev)  for contacting me and informing of a new build so I can give a more fair review to the new build. And also good on you for caring about your game and tailoring it to be an enjoyable experience for the people who bought it. I wish you nothing but luck in your future endevours.\n\nIf you would like to see gameplay here is a link. (This is pre-update footage. I will update this with the new build when I get the chance.)\nhttps://youtu.be/I8XYKR3uWQQ","September 17, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

I reccomend buying this regardless how much it might suck at this moment.. Its only going to get better with the positive attuided this dev has.. Its a great example that all other "single" devs and EA teams can learn from.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zrMu3Cv5Go\n\nI remmeber the very first build, follow by 3 updates that did not make it any better...\nThis is not that review any more..\n\nI can honestly say the game feels like a complete rebuild since the begging.. in all the right ways.\nFrom way better AI, to Collision detection.\n\nThere are still a few issues such as being stuck on edges  that involve hilles and sides of terrain,\n\nWhen  you first start, find loot on the ground, and if your quick enough at the begging of each respond you will be able to see were ammo falls from the sky around if you qiuckly look up.. From there with each kill you gain coins to buy weps etc useing the "P" button during the hunts..\n\nThe map ARE sooo much better then the orginal build. the Textures are cleaner as well execpt issues with the 2d Grass (yellow) there broken.. (ill have a video and screen shot to show what I talking about..\n\nI will have a video up regarding the new build later to match this review..\n\nAll in all this game dose suffer a lot of issues that other games built on the Unity3D engin suffer. and I have all that in the later video\n\nAll in all  this game and the dev and made a lot of progress since releases. I have a Before and Now video to show just how much the game has changed.\n\nI wish steam had a Nutural Button cuz I can not really Recommend this.. nor can I say its the worse thing on steam any more ether.. Game dose pack decent amount of content for the asking price.. So much more then before that this title could easily be worth $4.99 now. And becuase of the progress made thus far my Thumbs down will go to a thumbs up..\n\nSirvival mode along is worth the price tag if your on the fences aobut buying..\n\nTo the Dev keep up the work this title is truly becoming something. Also too bad you didn't releases this as a early access.. you could have easily made a few more $$ buy slowly incressing the price till the game was full finished.

At first the game was really buggy and boring, but after the most recent patches the game got a little better, less bugs and more of everything. This game has a campaign, where you basically snipe dinosaurs, survival mode which is pretty fun but after a while drags down the performance drastically, zombies mode which is neat too. The graphics are okay, 2010-2011 graphics, with no lightning engine, but for 99¢ you can't expect top notch graphics etc. There are a few achievements, weapons and upgrades which is neat, only perfect game i've in terms of achievements :D The devs are active patching the game and adding new stuff (atleast for now), didn't expect that from such a cheap game but i love that! The hit detection is better than call of duty :D Now remember the game is 99¢ so it's not great but it's great for the price. There are more things that are covered in the description, sorry for the lenghty review, but i felt i had to explain the game, which not a lot have gone deep in. With some more patches and work the game could potentially be pretty good. 6/10 for me","September 23, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You just shoot dinosaurs that don't even respond to your bullets piercing their flesh until you step a little bit closer to them, then they get so into chasing down and destroying you that they forget there's a boulder in-front of them, and run face-first into it. Then when you kill them, you realize you can't kill a single dinosaur in this game without it being completely dismembered and having some parts of it fly off into the far distance. And the dismemberment is weird, it literally just splits the model in half most of the time, like for instance i shot a raptor and part of it flew off, but one was just a small piece of the back with a piece of the raptor's mouth floating infront of it, but connected to it.\nAnd now let's talk about the main character, he's quite special. I don't feel like i have to say much, i'll just tell you some of his quotes.\n\n"I'll rob the world, i mean... Heh, yeah."\n\n"Whaddya know, looks like i learned something."\n\n"One step closer to total world domination."\n\n"What madness is this?"\n\n"Oh no..."\n\n"Time to get some new guns."\n\n"Soon i will be invincible!"\n\n"With meditation i gain my power..."\n\n"This can't be happening!"\n\n"They will taste my blade!"\n\n"All right, it's my turn now."\n\nNow, some of these would be okay if they had ANYTHING to do with the situation. And these quotes are random, you don't have to do anything to have him say it! When he said "They will taste my blade!" i was climbing a mountain without my sword out, or any kind of sword to begin with. When he said this can't be happening i was just chilling at a tree. When he said "Time to get some new guns!" i didn't have enough money to get any guns, and i didn't need to either! There wasn't a bit of madness when i was just walking through the forest.\nYou rob NOTHING in this game, and there isn't any form of meditation. Same for world domination, nothing. "Oh no..." Literally nothing bad happening dude, you have enough ammo, full health, no dinosaurs around. Are you just a constant downer?\n\nThe story is bad, that's all i'm saying about it.\n\nAnd no, the game isn't terrible believe it or not. Although it's just a generic shooter, there's actually quite a bit of content for a $0.99 game. And i'd be lying if i said i didn't enjoy it most of the way through, just because of how stupid the character's quotes are, how rediculous the kills are, and a variety of other things. I'd say just get it if you have a few quarters to waste and you're bored.","February 16","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You just shoot dinosaurs that don't even respond to your bullets piercing their flesh until you step a little bit closer to them, then they get so into chasing down and destroying you that they forget there's a boulder in-front of them, and run face-first into it. Then when you kill them, you realize you can't kill a single dinosaur in this game without it being completely dismembered and having some parts of it fly off into the far distance. And the dismemberment is weird, it literally just splits the model in half most of the time, like for instance i shot a raptor and part of it flew off, but one was just a small piece of the back with a piece of the raptor's mouth floating infront of it, but connected to it.\nAnd now let's talk about the main character, he's quite special.

It is already leaps and bounds ahead of the game I played just a few months ago! I wanted to support the developer with the game so I just bought 3 of the DLC packs. I do have a few gripes, though:\n-I think before you make any more DLCs, you should work on upgrading the base game.\n-Is there any way you could make it so that in the campaign mode, the mission ends when you kill all the targets, instead of us having to go all the way back to the base area?\n-Some more music would be awesome! (maybe mix it up a bit?)\n-Fix the FPS drops. At one point, (on a GTX 970) I dropped to around 10 FPS.\nOther than that, I can't complain. The game is good. I love the gun sounds; They're pretty realistic. The fact that you have to search for the targets is fun and the controls are solid.\nKeep up the constant good work!","January 17","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game, although playable, is still far from complete. The reason for my change is the developer is still very active in making changes and striving towards making a quality product and I want to support with positive reinforcement. Please don't disappoint.\n\nMany years ago there was a game called Carnivores that I tried playing but either my machine would lag too badly or by the time I finall got a computer that would run it well it was already dated. The game wasn't perfect but I did enjoy it for a bit.\n\nSo I'm looking through the Steam Store and I see Dinosaur Hunt. It has mixed reviews but it's only 49 cents and I just happened to have two quarters burning a hole in my pocket. So I figure how bad can it really be and I give it a shot.\n\nI really want to like this game and I do like it, but in its current condition I cannot give it a Yes recommendation. If there were a Neutral recommendation I would select that.\n\nI think this could be a really great game with more work. I would even purchase the DLC's if this game shows some major improvement.\n\nOn the positive side,\nOne of the fastest loading games I've played in a while.\nIt was inexpensive.\nThe landscapes look very nice (although I've never seen palm trees growing out of solid rock before).\nThe biggest annoyances for me were;\nConstantly getting hung up on the terrain and having to jump alot to move around.\nThe sounds need alot of work\nThe music is tolerable for about a minute and that's it (fortunately it can be turned off).\nIt always sounds like your stepping on wooden floors and it's too loud.\nWhen you crouch and move the sound of the foot steps still sounds the same, just spread further apart.\nThe dinosaurs don't sound like they have any weight.\nThe only time the dinosaurs make any sounds is when they are attacking you. It feels like there should be ambient dinosaur sounds.The game would not remember settings\nI turn exploding kills off and for the current level it stays off, but when I die or go to the next level it's turned back on.\nI set the detail to max and it returned to lowest.\nHowever the music did stay turned off and the Shadows setting did stay turned on.Is the scale of the dinosaurs correct? Some seem smaller than they should be.\nAI: It looked like a deer chase down a dinosaur so that it could be eaten.\nSome of the menus need explanations. There is one screen which I am assuming is difficulty select. There are two pictures, one with one dino and the other with two dinos. Minor, but the game mode selection screen could use short descriptions when you mouse over the different buttons.\nDetails on the weapons and ammo on the selection/purchase page when you select them would be nice.\nAlthough I figured most things out (it's pretty standard FPS stuff, Use the mouse wheel to bring up your weapon) some instructions would also be nice.\nMinor: my arm looks like it's made of plastic and so do some of the dinos.\nNuetral;\nI think they could have worked the tracking system into the story. Possibly even making recovery of the trackers part of the missions.\nThe comments get repetitive after a while. Maybe an option to turn them off.\nThe campaign story, at least what I have heard so far, is meh, but plausible. I know this isn't a high budget production, but the narrator needs improvement on the voice work.\nMy biggest hope is that the devs are still working on this to make it a great game.","February 21","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The still shots looked good, and the most recent reviews were positive, so I gave it a shot. I played this game for a few minutes and gave up. The main thing that is bothering me is the primitiveness of the game. The graphics and user interface feel like this game was made 10+ years ago, and not in a good way. The game loaded very slow and the graphics were pretty spotty even for the low level of detail on screen. The dinosaurs are fairly broken. The skin is very rubbery in texture, and their movement animation is bad (walking in place without moving forward, clipping into the player's character when the dinosaur is attacking you). In campaign mode the player can spawn within a few feet of 2-4 giant carnivores. The good news when that happens is that you practically have to run into the dinosaur to get them to notice you. They have more important things to do, like a T-rex that performs the eating animations to an empty patch of grass. There is very little tutorial teaching what the different things mean or how to pick up ammunition/med packs. I gave up after about 20 minutes of playing.\n\nNow, this game WAS only $1, but there are some really great games that are only a dollar (please see below) that you should check out instead.There are a lot of really great dinosaur themed games out there. If you are looking for some suggestions, check out:\n\nARK:Survival evolved (~$25) a really beautiful survival & dinosaur capturing/riding game with a huge fanbase and a great development team\nCarnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn ($15), a very solid dinosaur hunting game based on a very popular series that I played as a kid.\nand Orion: Prelude ($1) the best $1 dollar you can spend on steam for hours and hours of cooperative multiplayer dinosaur shoot-em-up action\n\nBuy those instead","October 27, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/recommended/401190/","russianlot","Sir Russianlot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/","768 products in account","EDIT: Game recieved huge update on 8 January 2016 and is now even better. Some of the improvements are:\nNew gun models (Machine gun is now gorgeous)\nNew player and animal animations\nSome dinos got updated models and graphics (allosaurus looks much better)\nGame also runs a bit smoother\n\nAnyways original review below:\n\nBy just looking at the screenshots, first thing that probably comes to your mind is:\nHoly Mother of Jesus what is this ♥♥♥♥?! Why did you even bother?\nWell let's look at this and see what it has to offer :)\n\nLet's start with the positives 1.  Game looks decent and runs pretty well. Sure it's no Battlefield 4 (when you think about it, it's not even Half Life 2) and some of the models look a bit cheesy and weird but I think it's completely playable.\n2.  There is a whole lot of guns in this, 24 to be presise. You got everything from melee weapons, assault/ sniper rifles to shotguns and RPG. Some weapons like AK Sniper and Crossbow can also be upgraded 3 times.\n3.  Maps are huge and quite varied. Locations include some medeval castle, Iraq (?), swamps, city etc.\n4.  Game is under constant change and improvement. Developer listens to community and constantly updates the game. Since I bought it, there have been over 15 updates that changed main menu, balanced guns, overhauled campaign mode added multiplayer etc.\n5.  Some of the dinosaurs look really cool.\n6.  Price. Costs almost nothing. Good price, I like! Yes.\n\nNow, if it looks like I was scraping at the bottom of the barrel to find positives, you're kind of right, because this game is basically Early Access at best.\n\nAnd so the negatives begin:  1.  I said game looked goodish. Well, it kinda goes both ways:\nYou see, some of the things like shadows, lightning and water are ok, while others are downright terrible like some buildings, trees and ground. Sometimes when you deal very much damage to a dino, it explodes in these half colored bits and it looks just... plain bad.\n2.  Dinosaurs behavior is downright crappy. They simply walk aimlessly intil they get shot, at which point they beeline stright towards you in hope of tearing you with your 1 000 000 hp to pieces, at which point they usually die by you hand. Some dinos like raptors can be seen hunting rabbits on some maps, but man that is not something you see often.\n3.  Campaign mode is can be completed in about 10 - 15 min. There's nothing more to be said about it, other than it would get pretty damn repetitive if it lasted longer. While maps are huge and some are even great, objective is always the same.\n4.  Weapon models are hit and miss. Granted I haven't unlocked everything yet, but some like M99, AWP like sniper, Crossbow and LMG looks pretty damn bad. Same reload animations and models that you can see through. Some guns are also very underpowered while others are waaay to overpowered (M99 and LMG comes to mind).\n5.  When you play survival, your FPS will tank in about 5 min, no matter how powerful you PC is. This also happens in campaign and Hunt mode (have not tested online yet), so optimization is needed here.\n6.  There are some bugs and glitches here and there.\n\nTL;DR and/or conclusion:So at this point I basically teared this game a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you think I really hate it.\nAnd while it is kinda bad, even terrible at times, I still enjoy it from time to time and/or after update.\nAlso, if you think that this game looks bad now, you really have no idea how it looked and played at launch.\nI actually respect the developer of this game, for not abandoning this like a quick cash grab, but instead, standing up and constantly working on the game with patches and improvements based on community feedback. Seems like they have ambition to make this into something special in the future and I truly hope they succeed. By looking back on it, I think they are well underway.\n\nP.S.\nGame is incredibly cheap. I got it on sale for almost nothing, so basically there were no regrets to be had either way.","December 23, 2015","true","22.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Dinosaur Hunt: Africa Contract is a FPS game that has no campaign stories, and still costs us 1 euro and just let us shoot all the dinosaurs, which becomes really dull after several killings.\n\nThe graphics are not too bad in comparison to its price. But there are just a few maps for us to play and we gain little money after each level that we have accomplished, the combat actions are way too repetitive and are not challenging at all.\n\nThere are still many weapons, ammunitions and equipments which can be found in their game shop, but still not very useful to attract players because even if you get a new weapon, you will still have to play the same way that you had played before you obtained it.\n\n\n[New Version- Dinosaur Hunt (2016 May 13)]\nThe things that I pointed out above are the old version of the game. After a long period, I've recently launched the game again to see if any updates are put in place, I found these nice features:\n+There are now more maps\n+More weapons are now available\n+Graphics are now a lot better\n+The multiplayer mode is now available\n+Since there is only 1 developper, this can be considered as a great challenge.\n\nHowever, there are also flaws.....:\n-The entire combat system seems to be exactly the same as Survival Postapocalypse Now, which is also a survival game on steam.\n-There are still a few bugs in game.\n\nPositive remarks\n+Nice graphics\n+lots of weapons and equipments for us to use, ammunitions are free\n+The developper is constantly updating the game.\n+Multiplayer\n\nNegative remarks\n-Still repetitive\n-bugs are still found in the game","October 7, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It's just awfull.\nGood for card and cheeves hunters tough, but really, you won't get your time back.\n\nEdit:\nMaking me come back here on account of a later released achievement won't make me like this a bit more...\n\nEdit 2:\nAfter a major update and name change, the game is now actually playable, with nor over the top graphics but quite enhanced for what it used to be. The major improvement i guess, it's the soundtrack: Rock On!\nHonestly? Yes, i Recommend for some fun and easy achievements for you Dino / Chieve hunters. I just hope it's the last time a batch of these is released, i just got it to 100% for the 3rd time... New achievements released frequently is somethinf i don't endorse.\n\nBut overall, I guess, for all the effort, this indie team deserves a positive review this time.","November 11, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I actually got a message not long before I rewrote this entire review after trying some of the things out again.\n\nWide variety of guns to choose and you can actually get a bazooka which works well with Exploding Enemies (atleast I think it does)\n\nHas a world map where you can choose where you want to hunt Dinosaurs (the map is a bit like Plague Inc. which is good because both games got it realisticly.\n\nYou can hunt dinosaurs. WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO HUNT DINOSAURS!?\n\nCheap DLC which allows you to even hunt Zombies.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nThe multiplayer opens in another window and so will run slower if you do not shut the singleplayer window down. Everyone should know this soon and the developers are making an announcement  soon anyway.\n\nThe multiplayer is still in Beta and not compatible with controllers yet but it works well with a keyboard and mouse and feels more like CS or another shooter.\n\nIt gets regular updates.\n\nRight now the quality (visual settings I mean) is always a level higher than you set it.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nOnly bad thing to me right now is the music which is being updated so it will be less loud anyway.","April 1","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
