Knowing what to expect is a big part of buying an Indie game.\nIt is rather repetitive, and some of the triggers are either small or need better placing.\nI would not recommend this game to most people. With that said, if you like the object specific sim, then this is not a bad one.","June 27, 2015","false","1.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","3"
