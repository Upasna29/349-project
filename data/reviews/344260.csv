So here is a first impression review.\n\nDescription:\nAgapan is an story-driven RPG Maker game with no fighting. The many, fully drawn characters and cutscenes remind of a Visual Novel.\n\nGameplay:\nYou explore the foggy town of Agapan, helped by a fast travel system. Talking to villagers and triggering events makes the story progress, day after day.\n\nStory:\nSo far, so good. Less character development than in an actual VN, but the place is indeed mysterious and a few things definitely do not feel right.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you like slow paced, enigmatic games, and if you don't mind getting stuck with no clues from time to time, you may want to give Apagan a try.","May 31, 2015","true","3.5"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","33","35","3","0"

I keep buying these games and expect to encounter some cliché rpg or mediocre adventure, and pass some mindless time at best. Yet I always end up picking the ones with tremendous emotional and ethical depth. Agapan is the latest example of my extraordinary luck.\n\nLet's start with the meaning of this rather alien word: Agapan. Agapan means "to be ready and alert, to be able to prevent a grievous event because of being alert" in Tagalog, an Austronesian language with about 57 million speakers in the Philippines, according to Wikipedia. It also happens to be the name of the sleepy, backwater town our protagonist, David Garcia visits during the game. Interesting, eh?\n\nStory starts up with David's annual visit to his mother's grave. We are told that David lost his mother at a very young age, and never knew his father. Luckily, he was adopted by a rich and attentive family and grew up happy. During his last visit to his mother's grave, a strange old lady appears and asks whether David would like to meet with his grandmother, Remedios Garcia. Growing up without a clue about his actual family, David agrees on meeting with this strange woman in the town of Agapan. "4 days" she says. "You will learn everything in 4 days".\n\nPicking the first bus to this strange town, David tries to unwrap the mystery of his own family, learn about this rather strange town, and it's stranger inhabitants. We are quick to notice that something's terribly off with the town, and its locals. What though? As the strange lady told us before: we have 4 days to learn.\n\nAgapan is an interactive story, with 12 distinct endings. 12! Wow, and I've been only able to discover 3 so far. On that part, it has huge replay value. The game is rather slow pacing, and the element of choice doesn't carry the consequential information before you make a choice, half the time. You take shots and hope that you are doing the right thing. On gameplay terms, it is quite simple. You keep visiting locations within the town during different times to progress. It is a bit repetitive and sometimes you end up stuck by missing some detail. Considering there is no walkthrough or guide to the game nowhere in the internet, good luck. My only advice is for you to be stubborn about it. Combined with beautiful soundtrack, eerie setting and the well-weaved story, your time is worth discovering Agapan!\n\nThanks to some detailed research, I discovered that Agapan was actually an interactive story board game created by the developer during his college years and the RPG Maker game is based on the board game. Now, I'd love to get my hands on this board game for a game night! I bet you would too.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 27, 2015","true","5.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","4"

Still, there are multiple endings based on player choices!\n\nSo, it is a nice little game about 4 hours long - try it if you liked 'To the Moon'!","July 5, 2015","true","4.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

(Not all ending will reveal all the truth).\n\nPlayer take control of David Garcia as he's trying to find his relative. He's been an orphan for 10 years.\nOne day, he found a chance to meet his grandmother in a town named "Agapan".\nThat's the starting point of exploring the foggy town.","September 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

But it also have a bit who will remind you Always Sometimes Monsters, this is a story driven game where subtleties in your decision can lead you to differents ending. Don't expect a RPG just because it is made with RPG Maker."","August 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is no challenge or threat of death other than the story itself has. There are several diffrent endings depending on choices you make, I got four diffrent ones but it seems like there are more. At first there is a lot of walking to find the main areas where events take place and once you have found them all you can easly travel to each one. It may be hard to advance if you do not find all the events or items which are easy to miss. I was stuck on day two for a while because I was unable to notice an item on the floor near the clinic. Keep in mind this is just for the story and doesnt have any real gameplay value.","August 16, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a story driven style game and there's no fighting, which I really like. It's a nice break from the typical RPG's I usually play. I only got stuck once and looked for a walkthrough of this game or something. There are no walkthroughs for this game! O.O  There were a few video walkthroughs on youtube but they all only covered a small portion of the beginning of the game. Anyways, I finally figured out where I was supposed to go when I remembered that there's a small building on the back, right side of the church and after that it was smooth sailing.\n\nI'm not sure how many endings there are but the game description says 'over a dozen'. So far I've seen endings' C1, C2, D and F1. The only thing that could make this game better would be the addition of trading cards and most definitely some achievments. More specifically, ending related achievements to help you keep track of which endings you've unlocked and which ones you have yet to see. Other than that it's a great game. I highly recommend it.","October 2, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
