In its essence, The Last Dream is a fragmented object game - or a FRAG as called by the veterans of the hidden object genre. Pretty interface, expected gameplay, a selection of puzzles... But its beauty in execution and thematic nuances centering the notion of dream; and a hopeless pursuit of love, hiding a heartbreaking truth that separates itself from the rest of its genre formidably in means of display, makes The Last Dream a memorable experience.\n\nAs an interesting choice, we take the role of a male protagonist - which is quite uncommon in HOG genre to begin with. Ben has lost his dear wife, Elizabeth in a car accident some time ago. Since that dreadful day, he is getting haunted by the apparition of his wife in dreams. Elizabeth is calling for him, leading him to an obscure discovery through uncanny geography of their history. Desperate to reach his dear wife, to hold her hand once more, Ben takes on this strange journey, persistent to reach her with any means possible. A nameless, smiling cat accompanies him in this journey, leading him through bizarre environments and dangerous obstacles in each new dream. Can Ben reach his dear wife at the end?\n\nWith these kind of games, we are accustomed to encountering digitally rendered art work and animations for characters. Here though, the dream world and the real world are sharply separated from each other in means of display. Enacted characters and their interactions are presented in FMV cinematics in the real world, while dreamlike environments and gameplay sequences are arranged into digital art works. This way, the story presents a medium for you to emphasize with the character, making all nuances a bit more touching. I personally think the acting is quite decent, yet voice acting isn't that marvelous or emotional at all. There is a certain stiffness and a lack of theatrical enthusiasm in voices that wrecks the emotional quality. Dream environments are most certainly beautiful and fittingly uncanny with sorrowful, elegant and symbolic displays of memory streams.\n\nFor the gameplay, there is not much to talk about. You collect items, combine some, use them in the appropriate places and carry on with the story - with one difference of a dream companion. Selecting a cat as a dream travelling guide is a beautiful nuance borrowed from Egyptian mythology and well appropriate for the undertone of the whole story. You are given 10 FRAG scenes in which you'll eventually collect different items and 20 or so puzzles, which are not that hard to deal with anyhow. In 9 chapters - with each of them having a central theme with 3-4 places - you'll come to the end of your journey and the bonus adventure in 3 hours or so.\n\nI suggest considering this beauty on a sale. If you like the HOG genre, it's one of the better ones out there which doesn't come from big name developers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/395860/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","The Last Dream: Developer's Edition is a relaxing point and click adventure that follows closely all the characteristics of a HOG game; however it excels through several original elements that make it distinguish itself from the other games of this genre.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601834771\n\nThe first original element of the game is the protagonist - which in this case is not a woman, but a young man, Ben. After a tragic accident, the spirit of Ben's wife starts materializing in his dreams, appearing to call him and asking him to follow her. Therefore, Ben sets himself on the adventure to find the source of this mysterious call. The story develops itself around the Dream world that alternates with scenes from the Real world. And this is where the originality of the game kicks in - instead of having digitally designed cut scenes, the Real world is depicted through live action cut-scenes, with people playing the characters of Ben and his wife Elizabeth. The contrast between this beautifully painted Dream world and the acting snippets from the Real world adds even more immersion of the story, which is already emotionally packed. The main motif seems to be the classical "save the loved one" theme, although in this particular case, the story has much more depth, culminating with a plot twist and an intense ending. To me, finding out midway through the game that the actors that gave life to these characters are actually two of the game's developers (which got married afterwards) made me feel even closer to this game and enhanced the experience of playing it even more.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=602350115\n\nThe classic HOG scenes have been replaced by FROG scenes (fragmented hidden object scenes in which you gather multiple object fragments in order to construct an item that will be used further to unlock other puzzles). The puzzles are also original and in general of moderate difficulty. And there's also a little cat helper that adds to the enjoyment of playing the game. Collectibles are also present, and they come in two categories - cat toys that provide funny cat animations and real pictures of the Ben - Elizabeth couple, all of these being not extremely difficult to find for a player that invests a bit of his attention into the details.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed The Last Dream: Developer's Edition a lot and I would recommend it to all the HOG lovers out there - it provides a unique experience through the live-action cut scenes and the profound story centered around the deep-rooted idea of "love conquers all barriers".\n\nNote: A key has been provided by the developers with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received. My personal opinions about this game are not influenced by this.\n\nMany thanks to the Hidden Object Gamers group that made this review possible by gifting the key.","January 17","true","7.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/395860/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4509 products in account","The Last Dream is a beautiful casual adventure / 'hidden object' game. 'Hidden object' here is quoted since the game does share a lot of elements with HOG games, but doesn't actually feature any Hidden Object puzzles! Instead, all puzzles are either of the inventory kind, or where you're presented with a limited list of items to find on a static screen and have to combine them to create and find another object.\n\nThe story is told through full motion video and voice-over. When the video ends it transforms fluidly into the game screens, which are all richly detailed and partially animated. The Last Dream features beautiful environments which are at times similar to The Longest Journey in its fantasy, and at other times display real life locations. A credit to the studio here in that they manage to keep everything looking as if it is part of one world, not once did I see something that looked really out of place.\nStatic images do not do this game justice.\n\nThe sound in the game is good. The music is well done and fits the game perfectly, even if it didn't really stand out to me on its own. Everything fits together perfectly with the environments. Sound effects were fitting in all cases as well. The voice acting is good as well, for an indie game. I'm glad the studio decided to hire English speakers, there is no trace of a foreign accent. The one bad note I have is that at times spoken dialogue did not fit the subtitles.\n\nPuzzles range from incredibly easy to a few reallly challenging ones, fortunately on the standard and lower difficulty levels there is a hint system that also functions as a skip button for if you get stuck. Each puzzle additionally has an information button which explains what to do, which I really appreciated a few times.\n\nThe game's story does get a bit dark at times, that combined with the at times hard puzzles means I wouldn't recommend this for young players.\n\nWhat I loved:\n-Beautiful graphics\n-Animated environments\n-Fitting soundtrack\n-Challenging puzzles\n-Cat companion!\n\nThis game is a real gem, and I definitely recommend it to everyone.","December 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","1"

In practise though, it has only ten fragmented scenes and roughly twice as many puzzles with a difficulty rating of almost zero (except if the player chooses expert mode for the first play through).\n\nThe main content is the story about a man who cannot shake the feeling that his dreams about the ghost of his wife mean something, so we follow him through nine scenes, each about 3-5 screen and 10-20 minute long. This kind of setup quickly eliminates any backtracking or chances to get lost, but it also severs any ties the players might have towards the game. Simply put, most scenes feel empty, lifeless.\nThis stands in stark contrast with the live-action story segments, which set an excellent mood and help us immerse ourselves in this story and make sure that anyone who buys this game won’t regret their decision.","February 8","true","3.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","4"

I try to only review games I think I'll enjoy\n\n\nThe Last Dream makes great strides to take the adventure/hidden object genre to new levels of depth. As Specialbit's second Steam release, I am very impressed with the quality and attention to detail. This is coming from someone who was previously not overly interested in the genre, but it's fair to say they have a fan in me.\n\nNot your typical hidden object game by any means, here are some of the reasons why I think this game trumps their first release (also a very enjoyable game which I would recommend):\n\nAnimated Backgrounds - Scenes come to life with flowing water, windmills spinning and so on, while creatures and other parts of the backgrounds animate when you hover over them. The artwork is varied and gorgeous, with spooky/Halloween-inspired settings, industrial areas, underwater, nature and more.\n\nGameplay Mechanics - See that cat in the bottom left corner? That's one cool cat, that's all I'll say :)\n\nStory & Music - As you've gathered from the trailers, the effort put into these aspects is much greater than the  norm, even if the story is still uncomplicated. Regular gameplay is spliced with full motion video. Particularly at the beginning, it feels like a interactive movie/adventure game hybrid that blends together nicely.\n\nHidden Object Scenes/Puzzles - many more puzzles and hidden object scenes. A definite improvement!\n\nDynamic Difficulties - I really like the range of options here becuase it allows for a 100% casual experience with quickly-recharging hints and skippable puzzles all the way to a figure-everything-out-yourself, challenging difficulty. Some of the puzzles are very tricky, by the way!\nTo summarize: The Last Dream is a gorgeous-looking, thoroughly enjoyable adventure/hidden object game with deep story elements and detailed, animated backgrounds which I would recommend to anyone, fan or not!\n\n\nIf you read this far, thank you :) Click here[www.bobmanbob.com] for a small surprise (Ends December 23rd 2015).\n\n\nI put together a 2-minute, relatively spoiler-free preview video if you want to take a look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbjUQcVIudk&feature=youtu.be","December 5, 2015","true","6.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/395860/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Introduction\nThe Last Dream: Developer's Edition is a surreal hidden item game about a man trying to find his wife. The story is rich,engaging and heartfelt with voice acting and full  motion video cutscenes. Everything in this game blends together to create an experience that can be easily played in one sitting as you may find it hard to pull yourself away. This title is a beautiful piece of work and a prime example of how video games can be more than just games, and can also be great vehicles for storytelling.\n\nStory\nOn its surface the story is simple:  You are Ben, a man who believes his wife to be dead. Suddenly in a dream you see her again and begin your pursuit to be reunited. Through this journey we learn more about Ben, his wife and the love that they share. The game shifts from the enigmatic dream world to what seems to be the real world causing one to wonder what is actually real and what Ben is only imagining. The story is touching and sweet but also mysterious with its fair share of twists and turns. I won’t go into too much detail about the game's story but I will say that you should prepare to be very entertained.\n\nGameplay\nThe game plays as your standard point and click adventure. You click on items to interact with them and collect items when need be, some of these items can be combined to make a new item for you to use which is a feature I enjoy. You move between areas trying to advance and overcome obstacles. The game is filled with puzzles to be solved, a bit too many for my personal taste. There are also hidden item scenes, which I prefer, that entail finding pieces of items to create new items, which are then used to progress in the scene- so it’s still a little puzzle. You are aided by a cat that helps you reach places you normally cannot so bonus points from me right there. The game can be played on four different difficulties which do not affect any achievements.\n\n\nGraphics/Audio\nAlong with a great story and solid gameplay, The Last Dream: Developer's Edition also offers beautiful artwork and FMV cutscenes. The artwork in the game is well done and invokes the dream-like mystique of the story. Nice colors and items that aren’t hard to find if you have bad eyes make for a pleasant experience. The FMVs in the game help move the story along, and the two actors portraying Ben and his wife tug silently at your heartstrings. There is also voice acting but not by the same actors in the cut scenes. The voice acting is pretty good with only a few awkward moments in the reading.The game also has a lovely musical score.\n\n\nPros\n+ Offers a good amount of gameplay for the price.\n+ Overall presentation is satisfying..\n+ Story is wonderful as is the acting and audio.\n+ There is a cat.\n+ It has trading cards and achievements.\n\nCons\n- Personally I would have enjoyed more hidden object scenes instead of puzzles.\n- I felt there could have been a bit more direction on what to do next in the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI found the game to be nearly perfect!  I may just be nitpicking, so what annoys me may not annoy you. If you’re a fan of the hidden object genre then this is a must-have in your library, no hesitation. If you’re new to these types of games or not usually a fan of them, this game may change your mind- or at the very least offer a great experience you may not have expected. Video games can be a fantastic medium for storytelling, The Last Dream: Developer's Edition tells a beautiful and relatable tale that is worth the money.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","April 1","true","3.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It might fit the category of 'Casual Gaming; but the term Story Driven might be a better category for it.....because it is the story that MAKES one want to complete the game and help this man get to his wife.\n\nThere is an emotional content that is in the game, that really doesn't exist in most Casual Games where a "lost" significant other meme is a regular theme of the games.  You genuinely FEEL for the man and his quest….and the whole tenor of the game, juxtaposing cinematics that drive the story and sequences of game play that also alternate between very plausibly real to “What the Heck is going on Here?”\nI for one, really thought that juxtaposition was part of the theme that kept me guessing what was going on….until the end.\n\nIt is supported by good art work and by mini-games that are quite challenging.  (thank heavens for the video walkthroughs!).  The "FROGS" that are a part of the gameplay, really don't feel as if I am playing a FROG or Hidden Object puzzle, and I didn't find myself sighing at the thought of searching the landscape for the objects that were needed, I just simply 'got to work' to help this man in his quest….and many of the mini-games were thankfully, quite solvable with a little work.\n\nThe art work gave us hidden clues that he was not searching in the real physical world....and gave us some unique problems, like how to stop a killer lawnmower or a garden hose, that suddenly take on life of their own.  There is a Helper Cat and I hope that people who object to such Helpers won't skip this game because of the existence of the cat.  She is obviously a construct of another world, from the first moment she speaks to the man....but, is far from cute....and not used very often....but, if anyone playing the game, is owned by a cat, the looks and behavior of it, will be quite recognizable…and, the main point, is that anyone who simply objected to playing a game BECAUSE of the inclusion of a “helper” would be missing out on what is a unique gaming experience.\n\nThe game kept up a juxtaposition between places and tasks, you would find in the real world and places that were obviously in a Surreal Zone that kept me asking "What is going on here?" and the cat, was simply another element of that not quite real....that sometimes became “Whoa…what has this guy been smoking?” sorts of scenes.\n\nA clue to how interesting this game is?

The game has fragmented object scenes, a cat companion who helps you out and voice overs all the way through. This game also uses live acting for most of the cutscenes, and it's the best live acting I have seen for a HOPA yet in my personal oppinion, especially considered HOPA games usually have pretty limited resources for development. I also LOVED the plot twist/the end. Bonus game was pretty good. Also totally love the main menu screen. The game never felt repetivitive or boring to me. Sadly I cannot comment much on the audio since I don't pay as much attention to that as I should, but there is a gorgeous atmospheric song during the credits.\n\nThis is a "developers edition" which seems to mean that it includes a bonus game apart from teh main game and some bonus content such as some concept art. If you've ever bought HOPA games from big fishgames for example you'll recognize it as being what is there called a "collector's edition"-version game.\n\nPersonally I can't really remember any big cons, except maybe that it is, as HOPA games are, linear. Personally I like that, but I know not everyone does.

This does not effect my review.\n“Reality and dreams are about to become entwined…..” The Last Dream: Developer's Edition" is a casual adventure game which, despite having some classic casual elements, will also offer a greater challenge for more experienced gamers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdKNU-u4Yk\nTags: Adventure, Atmospheric, Casual, Hidden Object, Point & Click, Indie, Mystery, Story Rich\n\nPoints of interest+Story: well written and engaging.\n\n+Visuals:  fitting for each environment you encounter; you will visit a dark circus, a junkyard, and many other mysterious locations.\n\n+Gameplay: both fun and challenging; this is difficult to find in a hidden object game. There are many secrets to discover, puzzles to solve, and mini games to beat. Definitely my favorite game of this genre I have played so far.\n\n+Difficulty: will satisfy puzzle fanatics and newcomers equally. I suck at puzzles and had to skip a few of them, but the majority of the puzzles are enjoyable. If you play on the easiest difficulty (like I did) hints and skips will recharge fast, so you don’t need to worry about being stuck on one puzzle for too long.\n\n-Can't really find much wrong with this game, I think it is really that good. Nothing sticks out to me as a glaring flaw so far.\n\nSummary By playing this game you can see that a lot of time, effort, and a little bit of love was put into this wonderful gem of a game. I highly recommend this especially if you enjoy hidden object games and even if you don’t. Excellent scenery, music, and story all make for a truly fantastic experience.\n\nI would give it 8.5 out of 10.\nReview done for Vantom Giveaways.\nRead the review on our {LINK REMOVED}website.\nSteam Key provided by the developer","December 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
