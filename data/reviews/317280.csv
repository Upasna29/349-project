I liked it enough that I have since purchased it and am playing it a second time.\n\nIt's a visual novel from the same folks who did Cinders. Like Cinders, it has excellent characters and writing. Like Cinders, it is gorgeous. Unlike Cinders, it's a mystery with two protagonists to give different points of view, and it'll leave you guessing as you navigate different branches, ask different questions, and get different pieces of the puzzle depending on how you play.\n\nI highly recommend it. If you don't usually like visual novels, you should still consider giving this one a try. It's so, so good.","March 26","true","3.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

The game takes place in a frozen wasteland where there is one isolated city, famously called the Jewel of the North.  You play as two protagonists, Galen from The Academy and Yani from The Faculty.  These two come to the city to investigate the sabotage occuring there, as well as to find out who the perpetrator is.  Although this is the main plot of the story, there is a subplot, first involving a missing and then a murdered person, although it does connect to the main plot.\n\nAs I had a chance to play Solstice before its Steam release, my playtime here has fewer hours than I've actually invested in it.  I loved Solstice and I can't even remember how many hours I spent getting every achievement and every ending variant.  For those who are familiar with Cinders, Solstice has the same gameplay features although there are a few differences here and there, such as there being two protagonists and how they're outsiders to the people in the city.  The art is as beautiful and the music tracks are wonderful, as they fit in with the various scenes that took place.\n\nSuffice it to say that if you're a fan of visual novels and liked Cinders, you will absolutely love Solstice.  It's definitely worth the money, especially if you're the kind of person who pursues every possible path, ending, etc.  It's one of the many features I love about VNs and Solstice definitely doesn't disappoint.  ^^","April 27","true","6.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The production values are very high, particularly the graphics--the backgrounds in particular are nothing short of impressive.  Somebody put a lot of love into all of them, and even seemingly throwaway areas you'll probably never seem more than once or tiwce are meticulously detailed.\n\nObviously, though, the story and characters are the important part, and all of them were great.  The story is well paced and keeps moving along, hitting all the right notes of letting you spend enough time with the characters to get to know them, but not at the expense of belaboring things or dragging on too long.\n\nIn short, I thought it was pretty great.  Easily among the top visual novels I've experienced, and I'd comfortably recommend it to any fan of the genre.","March 27","true","7.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

You play dual roles in the game; Galen, the new doctor, and Yani, a young woman found unconscious outside the city. They both have their secrets. The local eccentric disappears,starting off the mystery. You explore the mystifying Jewel of the North, which itself is a giant secret standing in the middle of a frozen wasteland. You'll meet the skeleton crew that stays behind to keep the city running during the true winter, and I'm sure you have guessed they all have secrets, too.\n\nThe story is interesting and, like any good mystery, you have to peel a lot of layers to get to the real truth. The artwork & music are beautiful. The game has 4 main endings with several smaller variations per ending, so it has replayability. It took me a little less than 6 hours to complete the first play through. It is a standard visual novel where you make choices throughout that effect the outcome of your game.","April 1","true","7.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

You might take less if you rush through it.\n\nDescription:\nSolstice is a visual novel with 2 main characters, a very unique setting, memorable NPC and very convincing art.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe characters were all very well written and the setting is very inspired and I almost wished they made a TV show of of it.\nMusic and art are top notch.\nI didn't experience a single bug throughout the game.\nMultiple paths are intriguing, and later chapters offer interesting decisions.\nThe game takes notes for you about the different characters you meet: this is helpful, especially when you come back to the story after a few days of not playing it.\nMysteries abound in the game: it's hard not wanting to see how it's going to end.\n\nNeutral points:\nThe two playing characters generate interesting dialogue branches and the "both side of the story" scenario is always fascinating. This though, in turn, might take away from the immersion a bit. Most of the times, you'll feel like you're directing actors in a theater play, rather than living "your" story. This is not a bad thing per se, though.\n\nAnimations are limited, but they generally fit the game well.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nChoices, especially in the first chapters, often lack a sense of urgency and, most of all, it's often very hard knowing or even loosely predicting what the consequences of our actions will be.\n\nThe absence of voice-overs, although justified by the small team, hampers immersion and might drive some people away. This is related to another small problem I have with the game: if you don't pay enough attention, you might not get who's actually speaking, since the text for both characters in a scene always appears in the very same place. It would be great if the small icons depicting the speakers reflected their position in the scene. Gladly, you can rewind text with your mouse-wheel.\n\nYou can never "move freely" in the game. I know that maps in visual novels are often nothing but branches anyway, but at least they give you the illusion of having a bigger part in the story.\n\nI truly wish there was an iPad version of this game. It's a kind of game I don't see myself playing in front of a PC screen again.\n\nTL;DR - Overall:A very solid visual novel, with a story worth reading. Even though choices rarely feel urgent or dramatic, the story stays compelling until the end. Setting, characters and music are its strongest suits. Price might limit its appeal to fans of the genre, but as far as quality goes, Solstice delivers.","May 13","true","9.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Once you start uncracking some of the secrets, the mystery really draws you in.\n\nThe branching decisions and real moral repercussions of the choices that you take, made me doubt and second guess myself, often wondering 'but what if...' and consequently replaying over and over (and over) again, to experience the multiple perspectives of the complex characters and find the answers that I was looking for. The soundtrack is also beautifully composed and effectively complements the fantastical atmosphere of the game.","March 26","true","10.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Solstice is a beautifully constructed world riddled with deception, intrigue, and multiple perspectives that will keep you coming back for more each play through.  I bought this game preior to the steam release and was hooked for a week solid.\n\nThe artwork and music are breathtaking and fit the mood of the story beautifully.  Fans of Cinders will notice that the artwork is even more refined this time around.  Characters will move (crossing arms, tapping their fingers, etc.) and change their facial expressions through the course of dialog.  The backgrounds were not neglected here either; every setting is animated and detailed.  There is a story book like quality that seeps into all of the visuals.  The music plays perfectly off of the setting and moods of the charactesr, bringing The Jewel of the North to life.\n\nThe story is filled with betrayls and intrigues that require multiple play throughs to get a full picture of the city and those who chose to stay behind during true winter.  You have a note taking system that catalogs major details you discover about each character.  Depending on who was asked and what previous choices you make will lead to different discoveries.  There are sometimes multiple ways to learn about a given character's secrets.  Learning a secret from one person will lead to an entirely different note entry and perspective on the events.  One play through a character may be cast in a sympathetic light for their wrong doings, but in another play through they could be shown as cowardly or deceptive.  It gives a great depth on how the truth is just a matter of personal perspective.\n\nThe characters of the story are just as deep and rich as the visuals/musical score.  Each character has their own hidden agenda, motivations, and fears.  The more you play, the more you realize that you cannot trust anyone at face value here and you're required to read between the lines.  The use of dual characters to tell the story (Galen & Yani) also adds some depth as both characters may have the same goal but completely different outlooks on their situation.  Both main characters have a potential romantic interest in the story as well.  I have to say it was refreshing to see a gay male main character that the writers didn't feel the need to base his character purely around his sexual orientation.  Galen is a sexually motivated character at times, but he is more than that as a character.  Galen, Yani, and the full cast of Solstice come off as genuine individuals that will likely remind you of someone you've known.  Very tough to get across that sort of reality in any writen medium.\n\nThere are four main endings to Solstice with most of them having varients giving an epilog to the fates of all characters involved.  Unlike many entries in the VN genre, there is no true "best" ending here.  Even in the endings where you save the city, its a bittersweet victory that leaves the player wondering if the city should have been saved.\n\nIt is easy to get sucked into the world of Solstice.  Solstice is more than worth the price and its wonderful to see MoaCube delivering on another exceptional Western VN.","April 15","true","1.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Even a small Easter Egg would have been great. But I just thought that any developer worth their salt would incorporate a reference to their prior masterpiece.\n\nWell I only had to play Solstice for 5 minutes and "Bam!", MoaCube delivered on my wish: a huge reference to Cinders. Very well done. I won't tell you what it is, but it's pretty cool. So that's why even though I've only played this game for 13 minutes, I already knew 8 minutes ago that Solstice deserves a Thumbs Up.\n\nI still have 99% of this game left to play, and I can't wait to see if there are any more tie-ins from Cinders. My fingers are crossed that the developer will surprise me again and somehow have my favorite character, Sophia, make a cameo. If that happens, I'll gift a copy of Solstice to a random member of my friends list.\n\nIn short:\nMoaCube is not just a developer or a publisher, MoaCube is a genre. There are thousands of games on Steam, but none of them compare to Cinders or Solstice. If you're looking for an immersive visual novel where your decisions really matter, then look no further than either of these two category-defining games.\n","May 4","true","0.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

This is the absolute gem of my game collection. Where do I even start? The breathtaking artwork? The amazing, ear soothing music? The carefully put together, impressively branching story?\n\nAt its core, Solstice is a mystery story with fantasy elements. The city, protected by a magic dome from freezing winter, is a desolate city of sinister secrets, calculative deceit and passionate love. Don't forget the occasional murder and sabotage.\n\nThe main characters, Galen and Yani, end up investigating the precarious city. They both have secrets they want to keep. They aren't an open book which is rare for a visual novel protagonist – you aren't in charge of everything. Every choice leads to a believable scenario – they have consequences, both small and big. The romance routes for Galen and Yani are completely optional and dealt with a satisfying manner. Every character in this story is an individual and so lifelike, I can't help but feel deep gratitude to the writers of Moacube.\n\nThe game offers four endings with multiple variations and each of them are satisfying in their own ways. Even the grim ones, the bad endings, make you really ponder. Is it necessarily bad or good if it ends like it ends?\n\nSolstice is an immersive, unforgettable adventure and offers a lot of value for its price. I wholeheartedly recommend it for everyone, even to the ones who don't necessarily feel visual novels to be their thing.","April 20","true","5.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The characters are compelling and vibrant, the music that accompanies them evocative, and the art and backgrounds a pleasure to view.  Add to that a driving story with excellent pacing and you have Solstice--a truly wonderful way to spend an evening (or several, if you go after alternate routes).\n\nI especially liked that so many characters brought something new and interesting to the game; there were few bit players and it's truly a visual novel that respects your time and rewards your investment.  I also enjoyed the story device of switching between main characters and their points of view,  a nifty trick that keeps you from learning too much, too fast.\n\nFinally, the romance options were satisfying.  They were optional and I managed to find one M/M and one F/M in my first playthrough.  Anyway, though I prefer them to be a bit deeper I was pleased with the role of romance in the story.
