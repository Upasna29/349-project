Tells you all you need to know, really. But for those of you fortunate enough to have steered clear of TDL, here goes. It's presently unplayable. Spawned in, ran around. Walked through vehicles and walls. Found a gun but could not for the life of me pick it up. Kept getting a 'clear inventory' message. Didn't know how to clear inventory. Hitting TAB brings up said inventory, but clicking items or trying to drag and drop them into slots did nothing. Got attacked by a female zombie who roared like a lion. Died, dropping a flare gun and med kit.\n10/10, best The Dead Linger simulator ever.","June 2, 2015","false","1.6"," 80 of 110 people (73%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","73","80","110","16","4"

Where to start.\n\nQuick Reveiw:\nBarren Roads is a post apocalyptic online/singlepalyer game.  After doing some research I discovered it was originally on Android/iOS, and was later ported and is now being worked on for PC. I must say, looking past Barren Roads bugs and clunky animations, it's quite the fun game. It's almost like a DayZ type game, with a Fallout-esque twist. It's graphics are a tad dated, and could use an upgrade. I'd love to see some of the bugs, animations, and models looked after. The world is quite large and has many towns for you to look through and explore, not to mention a fair number of NPC's such as Raiders and Zombies spread throughout. This is quite a fun game and I can't wait to see how it evolves.\n\nNOTE: The pricepoint for what the game is right now in it's Early Access state is a little high, I suggest waiting for a sale to purchase it.\n\nPro's and Con's:\nPROS:\nFun Gameplay\nOnline Support\nLAN, WAN, and Server Hosting\nA good variety of armor and weapons\nFun vehicle gameplay\nChallenging and Fun Survival Aspects, such as Hunger, Thirst, and Bloodloss\nCONS:\nQuite a handful of bugs (Such as Broken Terrain and Walk Through Buildings)\nClunky animations\nSomewhat clunky combat\n"Meh" looking textures (they could be better)\n"Meh" looking UI & HUD\nSomewhat Broken Playermodels (Bad rigging near armpits)","February 6","true","5.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It becomes very hard to be giving the thumbs up. One to put on the wishlist to see how it develops.\n\nAs of 2hrs play (5/6/15) running on (Win 7 64, i3 2100 3.00GHZ, AMD HD 6400 GPU VRAM 1GB, System RAM 4GB)\nIt runs well even on a low spec PC with settings on low and 720p I got a fps of 120. But the movement and animation is sluggish and on muti-player near unplayable with 2 sec delay. The graphics are below par (On my other PC thats highend) and the environment is very barren and lifeless. Raiders hover 4 foot in the air aimboting your every move and aiming at zombies heads shoots their toes, before dying after six or so shots and shooting 40 foot into the air. The aim (dot) is just to the right of the 3rd person character, which I believe is trying to mimic mass effect. Coming back to the environment, the buildings and many objects clip into each other and buildings in some cases can be walked through. Game breaking bugs include a bug that has the character continue to be out of balance for the remainder of play and a broken camera bug. In all it puts the early in to Early Access.","June 5, 2015","false","2.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

This game is total garbage from start to whatever the hell the finish is - death? I think that's the ending for the game; death. The hit detection is totally random, the graphics look like this game was made for a (failed) highschool project, the controls make no sense and the menu is utterly broken. Trying to transfer items from your inventory to your equipment slots should not be so hard - and ONLY because the menu is so ♥♥♥♥ed up that you can't READ what the menu says. Hostile NPCs have ♥♥♥♥ing eagle vision and can spot you from miles away - SOMETIMES through WALLS - and the zombies are able to run right through eachother - and you - and whail on you from INSIDE your body. AND, to top that off, the controls (when they decide to WORK) have such bad input lag that I'd be willing to bet you could control a robot on the surface of Mars better than you could this bag of pickled anuses.\n\nWhat's worse is I wasted Fifteen ♥♥♥♥ing dollars on this blatant Seven Days to Die/Day-Z rip off.\n\nThis game is a tumor upon an already moribund market of games, oversaturated to the brim with zombies and mutants and ♥♥♥♥, but good GOD, at LEAST put some ♥♥♥♥ing effort into your game! Whoever 'developed' this pile of fecal pap should be drawn and quartered. And then flogged for good measure.\n\n-10/10 - This is an unfinished (obviously), incompetent pile of cancer, and it should be removed from the store. Like...

The game may lack in a few features for now but there are always more to come in future updates. This game is mainly ment to be optimize for our phones and tablets and the creator bringing this game to computers also just amazes me.\n\nGraphics:\nTo me I honestly think the graphics are beautiful in this game. But most people dont know that some lower graphics games look even more realistic than higher graphic games (there are some mobile games with such high quality graphic that just seems to look fake at some point and it causes lag)\n\nDeveloper:\nThe developer is always active to his/her community, heck this dev can even take a punch to the face with such mean comments. When a suggestion or bug report is posted he/she is always ready to respond with the best answer. Clearly to me I think this dev is way better than other devs out there (Im not saying this because he is my friend, heck I dont even know the guy I only added him so I can report bugs more easily).\n\nPros:\n- Wonderful open world survival environment\n- Zombies, Raiders, and Players to kill and loot from\n- Houses to Raid\n- Lots of weapons to collect\n- Beautiful graphics (its ment for mobile so dont complain)\n- Crafting coming soon\n- Mobile platforms coming soon\n- An active developer\n\nCons:\n- Its earily access\n\nThe game is improving every update and lets keep it that way by supporting our developer everyday through the development of this game, we lost so many open world games that could of been on mobile (Ex: ZAmbush and The Wild).

Kinda cool how they move pretty aggressive, and the amount is not always too concerting, seems about right. I still wasent healed up much, but was still looking for loot, so as I was thinking about the zombies, I turn a corner, and this *itch zom offs me.

The gameplay is alright though in its current stage considering its very early release. Alot of work to be done and im confident in the owner/dev of this game to finish the product. I really like this game for the arcade feel to it, it feel less serious then than some of the other survivor games like dayz etc.. Although its buggy, incomplete animations and charecters i did have fun killing the ai.\n\nIf you are on a strict budget (low income) Hold off untill its developed a little more.  at the sale price of 10 bucks ish (CAD) you cant go wrong if you have a few hours of fun, IMO if i get 2 hours of fun that to me is worth $10+\nI will be waiting till the 3rd person is developed into a playable state because right now its killing the fun.\nCant wait till this game is developed more :D","June 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 8 of 59 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","8","59","2","0"

Developers i can tell you guys put some serious work into this but im going to have to refund i cant handle this, it makes me very sad because ive been anticipating this for over a year now but hopefully its better on ios. good luck devs and hopefully ill come back after a couple updates and it will be better.\n","May 5","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
