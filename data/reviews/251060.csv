It is difficult to write a review in a traditional manner with this game as it has depth akin to a black hole, so I'm just going to list down in-depth pro-cons of this fantastic, fun game.\n\n~PROS:\n\n1. -  This game is  far  more accessible than most folks give it credit to.  The controls are not convoluted, nor do things have unnecessary functionalities or five thousand menus to grind through to complete simple tasks. This game is complex in the best possible way for a game of its caliber; the depth of its combat.\nThis strength makes the game an extremely enjoyable experience as none of it is bogged down by simulation-esque frivolities. Mechanically it is somewhat similar to games like StarCraft (this isn't  Harpoon  or  Jane's Fleet Command ), although the scale is increased one-hundred fold. The game is complicated only in that it requires not only knowledge of units and their roles, but also quick-thinking and problem solving. The learning curve is steep but I'll be damned if I didn't say I had a blast getting to the point where I could consistently win matches.\n\n2. -  This is any political/military nut's dream.  There is a reason why much of its consistent playerbase is made up of people from /pol/ (don't let that intimidate you, the community is leagues better than most skill-based RTSs). You can simulate any "What If" scenario using countries like the People's Republic of China and North Korea all the way down to nations such as Norway and Sweden. And the game's compelling campaign missions simulate this also; what if the U.K. had not peacefully given back Hong Kong, and had to defend against waves of PLA tanks? You can do everything from sending Navy SEALs behind enemy lines to destroy Soviet command structures to launching massive armored offensives using the latest modern equipment. And it is all (mostly) pinpoint accurate.\n\n3. -  The game is well-built, diverse and reliable.  They aren't kidding when they say  "1,450 units that have been meticulously reproduced from their source!"  There are maps ranging from suburban sprawls to massive tracts of forest prime for special forces operations, using anything from Polish commandos to Czechoslovakian airborne. If you find the game enjoyable it is difficult to get away from, as there is so much content to explore and master. Every unit has an easy reference-sheet that you can view at any time, and all of them (save for PACT/NATO copies of Soviet/American equipment) have unique stats. Some countries have more options than others, but that is only to maintain realistic integrity. You cannot expect Norway to have a better military than the United States, but that doesn't mean they wont have superior niche units such as special forces. Countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia recently were balanced in a patch, making them up to snuff with everyone, so you can likely expect more free DLC patches to the other nations as well. Not only that, but this game is incredibly resistant to technical issues. I have not crashed once in all my hours of playing (this always varies with different machines, though, but I've but this game through hell and its always been fine). Your experience will rarely be interrupted.\n\n4. -  Deckbuilding is EXTREMELY enjoyable.  I've spent half of the time in this game making decks. It may just be personal preference, but because of the thousand+ units, you can find yourself sinking a lot of time into this; not out of necessity, but simply to create fun and personalized armies.\n\nThose are my major PROs. Now I believe I should address the hindrances to the gameplay here.\n\n~CONS:\n\n1. -  Naval combat is easily the weakest part of the game.  It is painful saying that, honestly, but that is the truth. It is horribly imbalanced, inaccurate and barebones compared to every other part of the game, and this is especially true in NATO's case, but I'll get to that later.\nCombat revolves around three principles which usually do not interact with eachother whatsoever; you either mass missile-heavy ships and launch them all at the same time at another blob of ships hoping to get through its CIWS guns, mass low-cost ships and rush them at lower numbers of expensive ships to stun them with cannonfire, or mass aircraft and do the same thing mentioned with the first option. It makes for a very uninspired and boring experience, and although it  somewhat  resembles small-unit naval combat well, beyond that it is entirely inaccurate. There are no submarines, nor aircraft carriers, no exciting fringe ships such as Soviet battleships. You get a very thin selection of classes which makes large engagements very stale.\nThe worst part of this feature is that it is terribly imbalanced in favor of PACT. Most of NATO's ships are comprised of Japanese ships, with occasional exceptions. The flagship of NATO is some ship I've never heard of called a "Kongo." No Ticonderoga or Arleigh Burke's here, folks. Just awful surface ships with inaccurately-modeled weapons (harpoons can't hit anything!). This is in vast contrast to Soviet ships which outclass them in nearly every category; superior accuracy, firepower, durability, range, etc. Their flagships are the popular Udaloy/Sovremenny class destroyers, which are infinitely more famous than the Kongo.\nRiverboats can be fun (the napalm Minotaur can torch vast swatches of riverland in fire, the SHMEL can launch hundreds of missiles) but are ultimately uninspired as they, too, revolve around massing and throwing at the enemy.\n\n2. -  Frustration comes easy at times.  Games drag on, especially if you're losing. Comebacks happen often but many times the case comes down to you being dominated for half an hour, and it makes this game a huge time sinkhole. You learn slowly and losses can be draining once you feel you've gotten better at the game than before; it takes constitution to get to a point where the shoe is on the other foot. It is difficult to be carried in this game as well, since it usually comes down to whatever team is best coordinated wins. This is not always the case, as skill is definitely involved and one person on a team can slaughter half the enemy's army through shrewd positioning, but that's an "If."\n\n\n~PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION:\nYes.  If you have an interest in modern military combat, or even if you just like a fun and deep RTS, this is the game for you. I adore it for all of the reasons above, and I think the pros vastly outweigh the cons with this gem of a title. If you can spare the cash and you like the concept, go for it. You won't be disappointed.","October 9, 2014","true","368.9"," 282 of 293 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","282","293","6","10"

China could use a little buff considering the fact that the game is called Red Dragon after all, and half of China's within time frame units have been questionably ommitted. Naval warfare could use a little tweaking as well, because its implementation was poor at first. However the upcoming naval patch notes look extremely promising.\n\nIn terms of improvement over the AirlandBattle, this game has done it all. Land battles are now far more realistic, intense, and tactical thanks to some of the revolutionary changes that Eugen has made in map design, pace, and terrain. Indeed, this game has taken the openness and unlimited tactical/strategic opportunities that were the trademark of W:EE, and combined them with the ferocity that was characteristic of W:AB battles.\n\nBut overall, from my many hours of closed beta testing, this is the ultimate culmination of the awesome Wargame series. The enormous scale, realistic terrain, and the unlimited tactical, operational and even strategic options that this glorious game provides has never ceased to amaze me. Indeed, this is any amateur wargamer's/armchair general's (like myself) wet dream, and I would fully recommend this to anyone seeking an immersive, immense, and ultimately fulfilling historical/military experience.\n\n\nI wish I had the Mad Money guy's bullish button to press right now...\n\nBUY BUY BUY","March 12, 2014","true","411.2"," 808 of 943 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","808","943","0","32"

Many different nations are avaibable and these use their representing units of the "cold war era". You build decks with a set of "cards", which are the units you are using, showing you their stats and quirks. I probably took the most time of the game in building said decks, trying to achieve the best outcome of my units. There are no "best"-decks just better ones, but even these don't always succeed, because of the different playstyles you can use.\n\nI advice every newcomer to play either the campain or skirmish at the start. The Multiplayer-community can be toxic at times, so watch out. Many people are helpful, but some aren't, don't get yourself overly upset about that. I also advice to watch some youtube-videos of let's play, to get a feeling how that game actually plays, it may not be your liking. Read guides and ask many questions, until you get the grip of the game.\n\nEven deckbuilding can be very complicated at first, but ask around in the forum, or other players (like me) what to use or what not to use.\n\nThe game is extremly fun when you got good teammates to play with. Even Solo it has its good moments.\n\nAll in all a good title to sink in many hours either building decks or playing around (or for some just chatting in the wargame-chat). Very good value if you can grab it in the next sale. I would even pay the full price (again), consindering the hours I clocked in.\n\nThanks for reading!","November 16, 2015","true","812.1"," 165 of 172 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","165","172","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SureJan/recommended/251060/","SureJan","Rem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SureJan/","98 products in account","I'm surprised that I still haven't written a review of this game yet.\n\nIt's a great game; in my opinion the most polished Wargame of the series. Although European Escalation has the superior campaign. Scripted campaigns (European Escalation) are a lot more fun to play than a sandbox-y campaign where you play against an extremely predictable AI on rezoned multiplayer maps (AirLand Battle and Red Dragon).\n\nWargame's always been an RTS with greater focus on force composition and positioning rather than micromanagement. Deathballing that you typically see in Starcraft/Command and Conquer does not work here. Your forces have to be spread out, ready to support eachother, and be able to take their objectives on the map.\n\nThe force you deploy in multiplayer is your "deck", which you build not unlike decks in popular card games such as Hearthstone. Select an alliance/coalition/nation, create a deck with logistics, infantry, support, aircraft, navy, tanks, and the like and deploy that deck in battle. Since the game uses a deck system, like the cards in a real life deck of cards you're limited in the number of units you can deploy. Try not to lose both your Su-27PU's in one go.\n\nThe game also places emphasis on logistics, which I have never before seen in an RTS game. All units have health, fuel value, and ammo value for EVERY weapon (including coaxial machine guns). You must sustain your forces through a well maintained logistics line. Supplies are also limited (and the amount of supply you have depends on how much supply units you've included in your deck) so use sparingly.\n\nCombat is fairly realistic. Engagement ranges seem more plausible than in traditional RTS games (where a marine can only see and fire up to 10 feet in front of him).\n\nThe game is extremely well optimized; I was able to run it at a steady 40-60 FPS on a laptop that could only use Intel integrated graphics (albiet on medium settings). You can zoom all the way out so that you can see the entire map and your units icons, or zoom all the way in to see combat from a footman's perspective.\n\nThe naval portion is a bit gimmicky. Sure, sometimes it's fun to play with ships but the combat is not nearly as exciting or engaging as land/air combat. However, amphibious land units does open up more tactical options since you're not 100% restricted to crossing bridges or chokepoints.\n\nAs a Cold War history buff, having access to over 1400+ real life units from over a multitude of countries spanning North America, Europe, and Asia is extremely exciting as well. Even now I'm still overwhelmed at how many variants of Abrams tanks there are (M1 Abrams, M1IP Abrams, M1A1 Abrams, M1A1HA Abrams, M1A1HC Abrams, M1A2 Abrams).\n\nI don't play this game as much nowadays, but only because I've played it almost exclusively for the past few years and it feels slightly stale to me now (although I do get on every now and then). Wargame: Red Dragon is one of the few games I've bought that has kept me entertained for so long.\n\nA warning: this game is not meant for everyone.","May 6","true","797.6"," 147 of 153 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","147","153","5","2"

Well if you like a (mostly) realistic strategy game then Wargame is for you. But beware of the steep learning curve ahead. While there are some faults with this game such as semi incompetent AI and cheesy multiplayer starting strats the game is mostly good. With over 1500 real life units to choose from across a ton of countries and coalitions you have plenty of deck combinations to choose. I've played all 3 iterations of wargame and I can say that while they all have their pros and cons Wargame Red Dragon is the one to get.\n\nI am also part of the Wargame subreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/wargame) Here, there are loads of people who have played the game for many many hours who will answer any and all questions you may have.

An otherwise perfect game dragged down It's by subpar naval and horrible community. The Wargame series is unique in that it takes away some of the more tedious aspects of RTS games such as base building and resource gathering, but still manages to be more complex and harder to play than most RTS titles.\n\nThe scale of this game can be truly staggering, even for veteran players. Even the smallest of maps will divide your forces between two or three fronts, and having a good unit composition (which is key to winning any RTS game) requires combining a lot of different unit types to support each other. You won't be able to win by simply spamming one or even a few types of units. Positioning and logistics are key, even the heaviest armored tank will die like a ♥♥♥♥♥ if hit from the rear and It doesn't really matter how powerful your units' weapons are if they're out of ammo and panicked.\n\nAnother feature that sets Wargame apart is the deck building. You're spoiled for choice when it comes to units. With over 1500 units between 17 countries and 7 deck types, you're bound to go up against a bunch of really interesting armies while playing. Objectively weaker nations are given more unit availability, ensuring they stay viable and each nation has their own unique playstyle; UK being the slow moving juggernaut while nations like France hit hard and stay mobile. With the addition of national coalitions to all of this, there's an amazing amount of strategic depth just in nation choices themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a game that heavily rewards common sense and intelligent play, if you simply attack move your units without a care in the world, you will get obliterated. This is likely the source of a lot of complaining that the game is "unbalanced", "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" or just "too hard'. I can honestly say that most people I've met who complain about balance talk about the game more than they play it. Spam Artillery? Your opponent will simply fast move into your sectors and destroy you. Forgot to take AA? Enjoy watching your entire army get massacred by a few helicopters.\n\nThe game does, however, suffer from a pretty horrible community. Most people seem unnecessarily rude and are so impatient that about 50 people join and leave lobbies before a game can actually get going. The naval aspect of the game is so barebones and poorly balanced that I almost never play naval maps. This is by no means an easy game to get into, but once you get rolling; It's one of the most rewarding experiences you'll have.","October 9, 2014","true","714.4"," 142 of 154 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","142","154","8","11"

Countries such as France, Canada, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and North Korea are fully playable with their own pallet of men and material to work with. The introduction of the Coalition deck type, which allows you to build your own army of units drawing from a pool of two or more countries, allows nations deemed to be 'minor' to join forces and in many cases become more relevant than the period giants of the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nRed Dragon maintains the playable nations and features of the previous titles. The setting being moved to Asia really just means they've added new nations, and the maps available for multiplayer have shifted to that setting, as well as a time line bump into 1991 for non-prototype units.\n\nThe units are acceptably rendered. Save for some model and texture nitpicks for grognards and military enthusiasts (ERA tiles in the wrong place, etc) the graphics are overall pleasant.\n\nWhile the ranges of weapon systems represented in the game are by no means realistic, they are still measured in thousands of meters.\n\nIf you liked World in Conflict, this is the closest thing to a spiritual sequel you will have access to.\nCons\nYou may notice that in the above, I didn't mention the much-advertised naval component. Roughly 50% of this game's seling point, the naval game is completely botched. It's a sloppy mess with no direction, where the prime strategy is to huddle up your ships and pray that their combined CIWS can shoot down incoming missiles. There is no witty maneuvering involved. In multiplayer games, few players bother with the naval maps. And whose who do find an imbalanced implimentation where ComBlock ships objectively trounce NATO vessels every time due to more powerful anti-shipping missiles and better CIWS scores. Eugen is supposedly going to address these issues, but it has been over half a year.\n\nMultiplayer community is measured in the hundreds, rather than the thousands one might expect from other genres. RTS games tend to struggle if it's not Starcraft or Company of Heroes. Because the game has boiled down to its hardcore online community, public games tend to be with people who are extremely experienced with the mechanics that will obliterate a new player without the new player having a chance to learn anything. This is definately a game to play with friends, unless you're an RTS pro or a masochist.\n\nModding support is on the low end of the spectrum. Modders can edit unit code and behavior, but there will be no mapping.\n\nPrevious titles in the franchise, I feel, had better maps.\nOverall\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has a passion for this era in history and 'what if' scenarios. There is an upcoming (free) DLC worth of content which may or may not address some of the cons I pointed out above. The relative scale of the game is something we don't get to see very often and promises a unique experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vallkyrie/recommended/251060/","Vallkyrie","Edelweiss ✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vallkyrie/","227 products in account","Outstanding quality RTS that any military nut would enjoy.  Will also stress out your grey matter, too.  If you aren't familiar with the Wargame series, it's a borderline strategic simulator more than an RTS. No base building, no real resources (besides point income from holding sectors), and every unit has morale, health, ammo, and fuel that needs to be tended to carefully with supply lines.\n\nThe scale is unlike what most other games in the genre offer.  It reminds me almost of the original Supreme Commander in terms of sher volume of units on the field and map size.  Every unit you take into battle will never come back alive once destroyed, and you need to make your own decks of units to take into battle, which is almost a kind of game in itself...finding the right unit combos or roles to take.  One of the major reasons I recommend this game is because of that.\n\nThe army variety and unit selection is also awe inspiring.  You can pick from about 1,500 units, all modeled correctly to their real counterpart and act like the real one too.  Nations to build from include the US, Canada, France, UK, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, China, and Best Korea (I mean North Korea).  There's an army for everyone's taste and they all feel and play unique.\n\nNaval battles need some work and balancing, though, but it also may be just the nature of modern warfare on the ocean.  It revolves around who makes the biggest ship blob and has the best radar gattling gun screen to stop incomming cruise missiles.\n\nOverall if you wanna work your brain a little in an RTS and focus entirely on the war and not the bases/economy, this is the thing for you.","April 17, 2014","true","50.3"," 94 of 103 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","94","103","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/251060/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","The GameThe premise of the game is to play on Korean War, and for conflict between Western bloc and Eastern bloc on East Asia. The primary addition of this release is naval warfare, instead of just air and land battle that has been covered in previous series. This release will also (realistically) adds new units to all nations, as years shift to 1990 era. Like in previous series, Wargame series focus on "combined-arms" approach, where tactics and strategies are required, as just simply roll out your best tanks will only see them turned into scraps in a space of few minutes. Like in Wargame series, there are no base building, the only building you would have is the FOB (Forward Operating Base).\n\nBefore the battle, you are given option to compose a "deck" of units. Each unit have limitations and advantages. For example, you could bring out newest US armor, the US M1A2 Abrams, but you could only field 2 of them in the battle, and it costs a lot. Or you could bring out M8 AGS tank, it is weaker than Abrams, but you could field more of them, and is more cheaper. You could also set the focus and the theme of your deck. You could focus your deck on Soviet Union units, where you could only field Soviet Union units but be able to field prototype Soviet Union units. You could also focus on the type of your deck. For example, you could focus your deck theme on "Airborne", where you get bonus of deployment to helicopters and aircrafts, but may not be able to field some type of units.\n\nThe battles are fought in standard RTS mode. The game uses "true line-of-sight" where trees and buildings could block your vision and your firing solution, creating tactics to hide in the forest, hide in urban areas, etc. Because of this feature, scouting before advancing is really important, so that your tanks did not run into enemy soldiers with anti-tank weapons, or small vehicles with anti-tank missiles. As usual, tanks are the king of open field battles, where their guns and armours could be really beneficial. In the urban areas, it is the areas where infantry and special forces, like SPESTNAZ and Green Beret shine. Aircrafts are fast, but can be shot down by SAMs if they are not careful. Some aircrafts have better counter-measures than the others, allowing greater risk to be taken. On the other hand, careless SAM, who kept their radar on at all times, will also falls prey to SEAD (Suppresion of Enemy Aircraft Defenses) aircrafts, who uses the radar electromagnetic pulse to target the SAM system.\n\nObservationsImportant gameplay features and observations:\n\nComplex Games\nAs outlined above, tactics, mixed arms approach, and fluid tactics are required. There are no units that are truly superior, each unit have weakness that could be exploited. Even in some circumstances, units that usually can't defeat other units could do that. Helicopters could wreak havoc on tanks that are open terrain, but if the helicopter gets close to a tank without detecting the tank, the machine guns on tank could do shot down a helicopter.\n\nLots of Units\nThis is quite clear. Each nation is unique, each faction is unique. For example, as historically accurate, the Scandinavian nation don't possess much armor, but possess a lot of mechanized units. US and Soviet Union, as superpowers, have extensive choice of units. The Soviets, as their armor tactic, is focusing on superior armor and ability of their armor to destroy other armor, hence a lot of Soviet units and tanks could fire anti tank missiles. On the other hand, focus their armor strategies on mobility, thus US tanks have better stabilizers to better fire on the move. Soviet choppers are focusing on gunship choppers like the Hind that can mete out huge punishment and took a lot of damage without failing. The US choppers on the other hand focus on mobility, optics, and more accurate AT missile. Each nation have unique units, each nation have different tactics.\n\nNaval Warfare\nThe naval warfare, on the other hand, have some limitation on units. All naval units on this game is not tied into a particular nation. For example, the US could use a Kongo-class ship, which is obviously not a US ship but a Japanese ship. In some maps, there could be naval and land-air warfare, but there are some exclusive maps that only allows naval and air units. Naval battles are fought with anti-ship missiles, that could be launched by smaller crafts, helicopters, ships, and aircrafts. Interestingly, bigger ships have CIWS to stop missile, thus modern ships that have modern CIWS like Russian ships need to be overwhelmed with missiles.\n\nMultiplayerThere is nothing special in the multiplayer. I find it interesting, you could play in 10v10 map. There are people who despises newbies, though they are usual but I find them in bigger numbers in this game. Though honestly, most of the "newbie-haters" hates newbies because newbies sometimes don't want to listen. Most of the newbies mistake in this game are using too much artilleries, consuming a lot of team supplies (it is limited) and uses aircrafts without thinking.\n\nLook and FeelThe unit looks great, sound great. The maps theme of South Korean and East Asia are great, but we do need maps that represent Europe, as in previous games. The units are richly detailed, a very distinctive. You could find out subtle differences in M11P and M1A1 Abrams. Same tanks, different series. If you compare distinctively different units, like T-90 to T-55, you would see clear differences.\n\nFinal VerdictA great game that should be played for all RTS lovers.","February 11, 2015","true","28.7"," 83 of 99 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","83","99","3","2"

Take ALB and add a few more countries and more units. A few more maps. A dubious artillery buff, to say the least. And there you go.\n\nIf you don't know the series, well... Get it now. Especially if you are even remotely interested in military or real time strategy.\n\nSpecifics\nThe main thing that Red Dragon purports to innovate from the previous series iterations is naval combat. It's a great idea on paper but of difficult execution, and unfortunately Eugen didn't pull it off. The ideas of amphibious invasions, maritme support, and even straight out naval battle are all exciting. But somehow it doesn't deliver. The scale is wrong, the balance is off, the tactics are not right, and the naval gameplay is down right terrible. You won't even find multiplayer games for naval battles. On the positive side, it is a somewhat cool novelty for the single player campaign -- with the caveat that if you are focusing on the campaign you are missing out in what makes this game great: Multiplayer.\n\nThe one cool innovation though is amphibious units in a small scale. You're able to cross rivers with APCs and such. That's applicable to many maps and it does change the gameplay, giving access to more areas of the map and changing the dynamics around bridges and water. Unfortunately, don't expect to run water-dedicated units.\n\nThe maps are improved. There are a few new ones of course, and in general they are more varied. They have a more rugged terrain which is better than ALBs and much better than EE's flatlands, Where there are larger hills in RD they are more accessible, especially for infantry. The down side of it is that the number of maps is rather small. If you play quite a bit you'll quite soon find yourself thinking "oh no, not this map again". It's a shame, really, as a large number of maps could add so much to replayability. If Eugen can't deliver it I can't help but think how much this game would benefit from the Steam workshop for player-made maps, or anything of the sort. Unfortunately I don't think it'll ever happen.\n\nThe community has its problems too, especially if you are looking for pickup games. Pub-stomping is widespread, and a huge problem of playing with randoms is the rage-quitting. It happens more in bigger matches (and especially with 10v10) but it does happen in smaller ones too. Your team mate starts out with 2 expensive jets, flies them into enemy territory and gets them all shot down, and since he lost so many points he immediately quits 30 seconds into the match leaving the team seriously jeopardized. That's the norm rather than an exception, quite unfortunately.\n\nThe solution for that is the same as for many games: Try to play with people you trust. It's not hard to find people online to play with, so do it.\n\nLastly in terms of gameplay is the artillery buff. I have to say I hate it. Arty in ALB worked just fine but apparently too many people complained it was not lethal enough. No, let me rephrase it: People who didn't know how to use artillery said it was useless. Unfortunately Eugene listened and now arty is a sniping machine that can pin-point kill units across the map.\n\nTo start with that irks me because it's unrealistic as ♥♥♥♥. Yeah, I know. Wargame is not meant to be realistic anyway. But it's nice if it has at least some resemblance. The purpose of artillery in the battlefield is not to shred whole armies to pieces with every salvo. Its uses are to affect morale, to wear out and injure, and to majorly suppress whole areas of effect. Shelling is quite the annoyance but it doesn't cause major casualties to dug in units, not even to infantry. But in Red Dragon, one salvo will destroy numerous units and you'll snipe even armoured vehicles with surprising ease.\n\nIts effects on gameplay are double-sided. On the one hand this buff could be a good thing to deny the opportunity to do trench warfare. You have to be on the move frequently for if you stop an arty salvo will come and destroy a lot of what you have. Giving you incentives to move is not a bad thing. Bad players will invest too much on arty (since it's so powered) so you can just steamrole their defenses and keep moving. The bad thing is that some matches risk turning into a ♥♥♥♥ shell flinging contest between the two sides and that's as dull as it goes. Shame.\n\nAs for the rest, graphics are absolutely fantastic although you won't be seeing their best part most of the time since you'll be zoomed out to better control your troops. But it's cool to, every once in a while, zoom in close to the battle and see your troops on the ground. Plus it's a great feature for the replays. The controls are simple and effective, if only a bit demanding on the side of micro-management of some units. I'd prefer some options other RTS titles have such as "skirmish" with which your troops will keep a safe distance from the enemy by themselves. In Wargame you have to tell your troops everything and they'll act as lemmings. The sounds are there: Not great but they do their job, although if you are a sound freak you'll likely find them lacking.\n\nOne very last thing is that the tutorials and whatnot are ridiculously lacking. Red Dragon is not friendly to new players. But since European Escalation and Airland Battle go on sales often, some times for as little of £1, it might be useful to pick one of those up for doing the tutorials alone.\n\nConclusion\nThere are to reasons why you shouldn't pick this game up: If you have played EE or ALB and haven't liked it (because RD is more of the same, with small tweaks), or if you are certain the genre doesn't interest you. Anything else and this is a must-have, especially if you can get to play with friends. Just try to do the great tutorials available in the previous titles and/or watch some youtube videos with the basic dos and don'ts.","March 11, 2015","true","790.5"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","59","64","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bleachorange/recommended/251060/","bleachorange","bleachorange","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bleachorange/","195 products in account","I would have to classify Wargame as my favorite RTS of all time. Here is my rundown of the game.\n\nYou will like this game if you enjoy battles that depend upon knowledge, tactics, and force composition for victory. You will enjoy this game if you dont like base building or economy management in an rts and prefer to focus on gaining territory and destroying enemy units. You will enjoy this game if you like a mostly realistic approach to war, including logistical supply lines, reconnaisance, artillery, and aerial attack that are lacking or understated in most rts games.\n\nYou will not like this game if you feel base building and economy are essential to rts games. You will not like this game if you want a simple rts. You will not like this game if you like micromanagement of units and twitchy gameplay like in a starcraft game.\n\nNow here are some need to know things. The game's tutorial sucks. Go watch some youtube tutorials and gameplay videos to learn better. 1-2 games watched should be enough to learn the basics of how to play. That leads into the second thing. Mastering this will take time, and the learning curve is steep for 2 reasons. Knowledge of the differences in the units in this game is critical to long term success, and identifying whether the T72 variant shooting at you is a 50 point cheap tank or a 150 point expensive tank is very important. This means that learning what all the different stats for each weapon type mean is important to know the capabilities of a given friendly or enemy unit, and then to know what capabilities of the hundreds of units in the game have based on that. This isnt extremely complicated, as there are several weapon types even if the individual weapons are different damage values, but it is time consuming to learn and memorize this.\n\nThis is the steep learning curve mentioned in several reviews for this game. But what it does mean is that those who persevere through early losses as they familiarize themselves with the game are rewarded with a deep and satisfying strategy title that emphasizes combat itself and knowledge of the enemy to gain victory.\n\nNow lets get to deck building. As there is no base building or economy to speak of in the game, you army is determined before you enter battle, when you build a deck. Every army has a certain amount of points it have total and every unit you put in the deck counts against that point total. It is important to look at unit composition and strategy at this point, but dont worry - even veteran wargame players routinely adjust their deck compositions for maximum effectiveness, and you should expect no less as a newbie. The deck builder is where you go to look at the stats for all the units and it really helps out with learning the game before and after a match to look up a unit that did well against you to see why it did well.\n\nLast but not least, visit the eugen forums and also ask players in the chat for advice. There are trolls, true, but there are also people who will help out with any questions you have despite how stupidly childish and amusing the chat may seem (i enjoy just watching the chat sometimes, its really funny).\n\n\nOverall, I give the game a 10/10 because I have never played an rts this much, or liked one this much, since command and conquer generals and the first starcraft. And now I cant go back to those because this is so much better.","May 20","true","888.6"," 50 of 51 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","50","51","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Justicier/recommended/251060/","Justicier","Justicier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Justicier/","94 products in account","Ahh where to begin. Well, this certainly isn't your average RTS. Far from it in fact. This is frankly the kind of strategy game I've been hoping to see for over ten years. Now, I have heard some say that you really need to be a military or cold war history enthusiast in order to appreciate Wargame. I may be biased as I have studied military weapon systems since I was a little kid, but I have to disagree. From the standpoint of an RTS game, I believe it is unmatched and I will give some reasons why.\n\nIt’s actually a bit difficult to compare to other games... see with many RTS games you're building your base, having little skirmishes toward the beginning to gain unit experience, with the ultimate goal of massing units for a big push. With Wargame, there is no base building... it is all actual military maneuvers, weapon system knowledge, use of cover and concealment both for survivability and ambush, use of recon to spot enemy units for more combat oriented units, gaining Line of Sight (LOS) prior to and maintaining it during engagements (more difficult than it sounds), use of support systems such as Artillery, AAA, and SAMs to provide cover for advancing infantry and armored units, use of special forces infantry to wreak havoc behind enemy lines, capitalizing on terrain features to enable better LOS, spreading out of units so that a single airstrike won't eliminate half your assault force... but not so thin that they cannot cover each other. At the beginning of a match, there is usually a push to gain strategic positions (which supply reinforcement points) and dig in, then using recon to find gaps in enemy defenses and pushing through, encircling the enemy and/or simply cutting off their supply routes and territories. So... Wargame really is an interesting combination, it’s slow like a chess game at times... and then in a matter of literally seconds it can turn into a massive brawl.\n\nIn multi-player, which is really the heart of the game, it utilizes a "Deck" system where you will pick and choose what units you wish to deploy into battle not terribly dissimilar to the Total War series of games. Thinking of it like a deck of cards, each one can only field a certain number of units... and once they're gone... they're gone. More advanced or higher trained units will mean that you will only be able to field a very limited number of them, making highly specialized extremely advanced Decks very difficult to play with as EVERY unit loss is a major one... but if you are very careful, and very clever, you can win.\n\nBringing more units into battle requires reinforcement points, which are gained by capturing strategic points on the map. While this system will sound familiar, it plays out differently than in most RTS games in that not just any unit can capture and hold a point. In fact, a single insignificant and vulnerable command jeep or other "CP" unit can capture and hold a point. If the enemy discovers this command unit, then you are just one artillery or air strike away from losing the point and having to bring forward another CP unit to secure it again.\n\nAnother system worth mentioning is support via supply trucks and helicopters. Every unit can run out of ammunition, and any unit utilizing a combustion engine will run out of fuel. The only way to keep your units in the fight is to resupply them utilizing cargo transports. These supply units are very vulnerable... they have no defensive weapon systems, and little to no armor. Special Forces units can ambush and capture enemy supply units, so if your enemy is pounding you with a constant barrage of weapons fire... chances are there is a major resupply operation in progress and if you can disrupt that, you can deal a crippling blow to your adversary. With resupply made impossible, your opponent's constant spam of shells and bullets will render his units helplessly dry on ammunition... easy targets.\n\nAir forces are a big part of the game. Frankly a single well executed air strike can shut down an entire assault, and force your opponent into a defensive posture... but that is not to say that attacks from the air are TOO powerful. In fact, aerial units are very easy to shoot down, very expensive, and fixed wing aircraft can only fly for a short period of time before they have to bug out due to low fuel. Jets can also be particularly difficult to utilize effectively because most of the time the enemy will cover their ground forces with AAA and SAM units. However, in the off chance your opponent miscalculates or sends his forces in with little to no cover... responding with a couple A-10 Warthogs along with fighter cover and witnessing the destruction they are capable of is truly mezmerizing.\n\nNow, I haven't messed around so much with the naval aspect introduced in Red Dragon... but there are some balance issues and tweaking to be made there. However, for ground forces, the game is amazing, made even more so through the use of amphibious units. Your opponent think that you're helpless against his wall of tanks overlooking the lone bridge in the area? Not a problem, send in a group of amphibious tanks or anti-tank missile equipped vehicles to traverse the river around the flank and put fire into the sides of the aforementioned problem. Did I mention that all vehicles, armor, helicopters have differing top, front, back, and side armor levels? Tank armor is usually very strong to the front, and weaker in the rear or side... makes flanking maneuvers or ambushes on unsuspecting armored units quite devastating.\n\nIn closing, the learning curve is high, the 1300 units is daunting to think about, and the pacing may not be what everyone is looking for. It can be very slow and almost chess-like at times, and then turn into a firefight with unrivaled intensity. If you're looking for a unique blend of game and simulation, that you could play for years and still learn new things, it's tough to beat Wargame.","May 3, 2014","true","84.4"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","42","45","0","2"

The second Wargames introduced some interesting stuff, but really could be best described as "now with airplanes!"\n\nRed Dragon of all the series is least functional.  It had a half-hearted "navy" layer added that was so comically broken that it was more or less left unchanged after it was terminally broken in the beta.  There's such a lack of focus, while there's thousands of units, only maybe a few dozen are actually relevant, and frequently they're represented by marginal quality models clearly done by the lowest bidder.  Worse, the developer itself refuses to change models that are 100% wrong, or entirely substandard quality because someone on their forums hurt their feelings once.\n\nPlease note the last statement is entirely 100% true.  They call the no-updated-models thing the "UGBEAR" policy after said poster.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it goes more or less like the following:\n\n1. Single Player:\n\nTerrible.  It's your more or less bog standard skirmish maps arrayed in a sequence, with a tissue paper thin "strategic" level.  The AI is frankly too ♥♥♥♥♥ to do anything but "drive towards things!" which it will do with gusto.  The key to any mission is successfully destroying whatever blob the AI has summoned forth before it destroys whatever much smaller blob you were allocated for the mission is destroyed.\n\nThen pair this with some really stupid choices in terms of campaign design (Fact: Did you know South Korea's defense hinges on French and German intervention?), and just how many damned times you'll fight on the same map, doing the same thing, with the same units against the same total lack of objectives except "DESTOY TANKS," and it's really quite telling how few folks play singleplayer more than a few missions.\n\nWhich is rather a shame, the campaigns in the first Wargame were quite well put together, challenging missions with a wide variety of objectives and terrain.\n\nAdditional caveats:\n\na. This is the least Asian game to be set in Asia since video games were made.  You basically have two terrain types, Europe with Pagodas, or the American Southwest with Pagodas.  These two terrain types represent everything from the Russian far-east, to Tokyo.\n\nb. Again, despite being a game oriented on events in Asia, most of the effort went into making the European countries in game larger and more full of  weirdo stuff that never actually reached service.  The Asian factions, the ones that you would think would command some attention in a game called "Red Dragon" are very poorly realized and hardly worth playing.  The Chinese forces are a curious mix of equipment China never had, and total exclusion of several key systems they used extensively, the Anzac formations are pure crap, and the North Korean force, which arguably are pretty central to a game that spends so much time in Korea are....terrible.  Not gameplay terrible, but poorly researched, poorly realized, and ultimately best skipped.\n\n2. Multiplayer\n\nThe best way to describe it is whatever broken cheesy tactic of the month on a loop.  MRLS type rockets are powerful this week?  STANDBY FOR ROCKET SWARMS ALL MATCH AND NOTHING ELSE.  Super-cheap planes spammed out?  It's going to be raining planes for a few days.  Somehow crappy bottom tier infantry becomes way too cost effective?  Waves of mans for forever.\n\nYou'll note a recoccuring theme.  It's not even like "the heavy tank shuffle!" or some other weird tactic just works really well.  From the first Wargame, to the last most of your games start with a spammy spam rush or artillery spam and end with same.\n\nIt's all right if you're playing with a friend, or folks you know aren't douches.  But public matches are an exercise in pulling your own teeth out.\n\nWhich ties into a few subtopics on multiplayer:\n\na. There's only a handful of "good" maps, which is to say, ones that are not broken/unbalanced etc.  And you'll play on all those maps within the first day of playing the game more than once.  It gets old, fast.\n\nb. Many of the maps are...boring.  Like imagine a flat open field.  Put a river through it.  Add some trees.  CONGRATS!  I just described several of the maps you'll be playing on.\n\n3. Eugen is a terrible company.\n\nHere's things they do okay:\n\n+You do not have to pay for any of their DLC.\n+Wargames EE was pretty good!\n+As far as I can tell, none of them are terrorists.\n\nHere's things that make them marginal\n\n-They do not deliver on promised features, and then lie/have really bad excuses why it's your fault those features do not exist.  Examples:\na. Red Dragon was promised to have sufficent ships to fully flesh out the smaller combatants of all the factions that had Navies.  This is several times over not the case.  If you want to play Naval stuff (which you shouldn't do anyway because its pretty terrible), as NATO your force is an all nations dreamteam of Japanese, French....and really skip the American and British stuff because it's not like either of those countries had Navies anyway (and are represented by a bad frigate and a not really used in number missile boat, and a terrible frigate respectively).\nb. A map pack was promised with the last major patch.  It was claimed the maps were being withheld because...well either to give the dev team more time to work on fixing a HUGE exploit that went more or less un-fixed for a month or so, or because we're sinners and don't deserve maps I guess?  Either way the maps have never showed up, and asking about them on the game's forums will get you either banned, or at the least the thread locked without comment.\nc. Think of it like this.  You know those Twilight Zone episodes, where the guy finds a Genie in a lamp, and he gets his wishes, but the wishes are some jacked up terrible version of what he wished for?  That's Eugen in a nutshell.  Folks who played mostly US forces were concerned that oddly enough, despite the USAF being the largest air force in the world, is having some major issues with air to air combat.  Eugen's fix to this was to add in the PATRIOT missile system, which did not fix the US's lackluster air to air capabilities, but did totally break the rest of the air force part of the game as now there was a SAM site that could shoot down things over half the map.  Broken part broken, and new game breaking element added in for giggles.\n\n-Their community manager is pretty much the biggest troll on their forums.  You have a problem with how things are balanced? Honhonhon, you watch too many movies.  You say something unkind about France?  He's going to be insulting as he can get away with, and then get you banned if you say so much as anything but stating a devout love of froglegs and terrible movies full of ennui.\n\n- Things stay broken for reasons known only to God.  You can shoot down helicopters in this game with artillery.  Like seriously, here's Mr. Helicopter hovering along, and OH NO INDIRECT FIRE! helicopter is dead.  This is stupid.  This is also the reality of the game since the first one.  This has never been fixed, or addressed.  This is also but one of several brokey broke features that have remained with Wargames since 2011 or so.  You get some vague answer about "the engine cannot handle it" but that's a bit like saying the Ford Pinto is designed in a way that causes it to catch fire, so drive safe! vs fixing it when you make a new one.\n\nI really could go on.  I'm still annoyed enough when I see this game on my list though to finally write this review.  This really is not the game for you.  If you want a good RTS, there's plenty of better ones out there.  If you want a good cold war game?  God avoid this mess, it's pretty much like if Tom Clancy was french and mildly mentally handicapped version of the cold war.  If you want realism, this game is just as much not for you.\n\nPerhaps you could instead try a nice game of chess?","May 29, 2015","false","140.1"," 451 of 714 people (63%) found this review helpful 151 people found this review funny","63","451","714","151","101"

Gone is the concept of base building, and resource management. WG:RD introduces players to a realistic RTS unlike anything seen before. No longer will players contend with Actions Per Minute, but rather with tactics, units, and teamwork.\n\nWith a blistering amount of units (1500+) they've managed to capture the most minute, and accurate features of nearly every unit.  Players will find themselves lost in the sheer number of statiscal difference while attempting to create the perfect army. The complex task of "deck building" becomes simplifed by a restrictions and bonuses. The more you limit your military the more you have available.\n\nGraphically speaking WG:RD shines above almost all RTSs on the market. With almost painstaking authentic  detail to units it's a shame to realize they are only utulized when fully zoomed in. The games scale makes it impractical to play any attention more than what's needed.\n\nAlthough WG:RD is a shining example of the RTS genere; it does fall short with it's limited maps, and often sidelined naval battles. You'll easily find yourself playing the same maps time after time.

Most people get frustrated because they never see the enemy before their units start to die. This is because they can't see the enemy, because they're not using their Recon units appropriately.

This review is in no way implying that single player is somehow more important than anything else objectively, just that it is personally one of my primary concerns.\n\nWith that disclaimer out of the way, let's get down to it.\n\nWargame: Red Dragon is probably the worst iteration of the series when it comes to single player. All the major elements like a vast selection of units and interesting maps are there but the AI is not just bad, it is pretty much the worst AI I have ever seen. For example, if you give the AI a deck with a single selection of T-55's, a single selection of BMP's, and perhaps a single selection of Mi-8's, they will first send every T-55, then when you blow them up, they will rush you with BMP's, when you blow them all up, they will send Mi-8's. There is not a whole lot of actual tactics or nuance on display (even when compared to the AI of prior Wargame titles) and the single player just becomes boring at best and annoying at worst.\n\nThe other issue for single player/co-op types is the perhaps over-zealous amount of deck balancing that has happend since the game first came out. While I am sure all the different unit "cards" are very balanced and make for solid competitive style play, the arbitrarily limited, nerfed, and buffed unit cards make for rather stale single player. It makes me wish that they had taken a play from Men of War's book and offered a lot of options to make it good for either single player types or multiplayer types. That way everyone could have been happy and nobody (single player focused folks like myself) would get left out in the cold.\n\nIf you are a PvP multiplayer focused gamer, this is going to be a good purchase but if you are looking for solid single player content, you should perhaps move on to other titles in the series or other RTS's entirely. To be blunt, Eugen might as well have not even bothered with single player considering how obviously ignored it was.","April 8","false","23.4"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","36","44","0","3"

Well maybe like a rant or advices or whatever. Up to you people to decide, i just don't care)\n\nThis game is definitely not for everyone, I tried forcing..ahem...i mean advised 2 of my friends to play this game and it didn't work. It is a 'dog eat dog' world out there and only the strongest will survive. Only the most willing and determine can survive in the multiplayer realm of Wargame: Red Dragon.\n...\n..\n.\nOR just play the damn game longer and learn the basics, there's a damn 200 page guide for this game and almost no one bothers to read it. And stop talking on the damn wargame:chat, YOU FOOLS!! (unless you like the chat.it's a very interesting place where you can talk about politics, rage at people, discuss about fetishes and other crap.)\n\nAfter fighting your first 100 battles or less while losing about 3/4 of them or all of it, you soon will be at the point where you say "Why am I playing this game??", "JEEBUS F@#K this Game!", " WHy did I buy this game?"\nDon't quit. DON"T F##King quit. Everybody has experience this point of time at least once in this game. This event is inevitable, hundreds of new players quit at this point of time. SO I advise to you to not give up!\n\nThis game has a very high learning curve and THERE is player stacking or pub stomping in this game which is the biggest reason why alot of newcomers quit this game but there is a somewhat-valid reason for this....YOU are suppose to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Team or join up with veteran players.\nthe main reason why you keep losing is that veteran players will team up together and pub stomp new players. There is no proper matchmaking system. EUGEN puts too much faith into the wargame community to make one. Nobody likes to lose, so these veteran players have friends who are at the same skill level and call upon them to join in their battles. They will then proceed to rain down hellfire (LOL hellfire missiles if you know what I mean)  upon their unsuspecting foes. Generally, the strongest and most skilled players are those who have played the game the longest and have a high victory ratio and also rank. (victory ratio is overrated, gametime experience is all that matters. Nobody plays rank anyways).\n(This part is just a estimation so might not be true)60-150+ hours players are mainbulk of the community. Anything above that range makes up a larger minority compare to the number of beginner players, these players are considered quite good as they have played long enough to handle tough situations ingame and have a good understanding of the mechanics and unit stats.  There are 1000+ hour players, these guys are the most dangerous of foes but luckily there is only a few of them. Making friends or apprentice under any players from 100+ hours and above is already good enough to teach you tips and tricks of the game. There is alot of notable players in this game, so you get to meet them on a regular basis depending on timezone. The best time to play wargame is usually when it is from morning and night time in the US, this is where most players from all around the world are on. Amount of players flactuate between 400 to 1000 plyaers depending on time.\n\nThis game is not a singleplayer game, it is a multiplayer game. Like Battlefield 3, there is singleplayer campaign but it is not satisfying. it only serves to be a place to just practise abit.\n\nTUTORIAL IS USELESS!! There is no tutorial, it's just some pages on the menu that call itself a tutorial. Read the 200-pg guide or find veteran players to show you the ropes. Just randomly go into lobbies, look at their stats then add them to your friends list. Seriously find someone to teach you, or you will have to do it the hardway like like how I did. So many defeats... so, so many defeats...\n\nNaval combat is what most people are dissapointed about. If you are like me, who is okay or fine with it then don't bother reading this part. Opinions on the naval combat is like a mixed basket, people complain that naval combat is useless or is not what they wanted. Eugen tried its best to make it right but people still don't like it. Perfecting naval combat is not easy, especially in this type of game considering the mechanics to how this game works. Let's face it, this is not the first game that have tried to implement naval combat and it didn't work out. For example , the total war series' naval combat is boring as hell and most other games with naval combat are clunky or broken. Trying to fix naval combat for a rts/rtt game is like trying to fix the entire game genre. Atleast wargame's naval combat was not like in its beta/alpha version, oh god the HORROR!?\n\nLastly even after playing this game for quite sometime, I still find alot of moments ingame which surprise me. The TRUE satisfaction of this is not about winning or losing, it is about experienceing the craftiness and usefulness of tactics implemented by players. Fighting battles against foes who are equally match with you or, holding your ground against a foe who have numerical or have tactical superiority over you, or managing to repel a massive unexpected infantry BANZAI charge with the help of close air support and artillery from your teammates, or working together with your friends to attack a heavily defended sector or so on. 10v 10 Battles are massive and intense. Even the tactical matches where you only control a tiny amount of troops are just as mind taxing. This is a game which will test your skills in controlling your units and your teamwork with other players. You will realise the true values of this game only after putting your heart and time in to it. These values are why there a still many players playing this game since its beta/alpha stage.","July 15, 2015","true","248.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","1"

I loved playing Empire and Napoleon Total War ( Which I highly recommend playing aswell). But there was a very limited amount of modern war type strategy games. And then I found the Wargame Series.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWarning: There is a HUGE learning curve for this game. You just can't start off and know how to play well. I recommend reading the 200 page guide(By SandyGunfox) about how to play the game. I remember starting off without reading the 200 page guide and my army got streamrolled. I didn't know what to do. But after the reading the guide I got the hang of the game a bit. But just reading the 200 page guide is not enough , experience is vital for this game. Every game is different, no games are the same. You need to learn how to defend your flanks, how to assault enemy positions and other strategy's for turning the battle into your teams favour. You also need to learn the strength and weaknesses of the unit's you command on the battlefield. It also takes a LONG time to win your first game , this is because EVERYONE on the team is vital to the outcome of the battle, so expect many defeats at first, but when you get more experience and training the wins will come rolling in. Overall this game has a difficult learning curve BUT after learning to play properly the gameplay is amazing.\n\nGameplay Verdict: 9 / 10\n\nGraphics:\n\nOne of the best graphics for a Real-time strategy game I've ever seen. Of course you need a good computer to run it on high settings, but even not on high settings it looks good. The tank battles and Infantry battles in towns look good too. It's also great to see an enemy heavy tank go up in flames as your Spec Ops infantry sneaks up and blows it up, or watch as an artillery barrage kills a vast amount of charging infantry.\n\nGraphics verdict: 8 / 10\n\nAudio:\n\nThe game sounds great! The gunshots of infantry battles in towns sound really realistic and going close up on an airplane and hearing the engine as it is getting ready to drop napalm on a load of infantry in a town is amazing!\nAudio Verdict: 8 / 10\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game barely has any flaws , except that it has a large learning curve, you just can't pick up this game and start playing. But after that the game start's getting better and better as you win more and more battles.This game is amazing and a must buy for any strategy game fan.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9 / 10\n\n\n","October 13, 2014","true","81.2"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","0"

It's designed for online play, but there is only a tiny online community for it. Most public battles are 4 friends on one side vs a bunch of randoms on the other and that goes about as well as you'd think it would.\n\nSo what about offline play? The AI is horrendus. All it knows how to do is throw units into a meat grinder. Additionally, sometimes it just stops making moves or spawning units and just sits there (probably a bug, but c'mon this game has been out for what, 2 years now?)\n\nFinally there's the steep learning curve. I like complex games, but forget 1 type of unit and your whole force is destroyed in seconds. The micromanagement is also pretty horrific. Every unit has to be given very specific commands and it will not take any automated action what so ever. Helicopters taking ground fire? They just sit there until they're destroyed. Same goes for tanks. The notification system is terrible. All you hear is "trouble...trouble....trouble..." and no indication of who's in trouble or where they are...yeah lemme just scan the map for the 5 guys standing next to a burning tree...again taking no action on their own to move 3 steps to the left so they don't burn to death.","February 2","false","144.8"," 55 of 86 people (64%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","64","55","86","11","1"

It is immensly complex and has a tough learning curve, but is definitely the best stratgy game on the market. I was excited to see there would be a third game, and immediately preordered it and started playing the beta. There is a lot of balacing to be done, but that is not the reason I'm giving this a negative review. The game was advertised as incorporating navies for each country and naval combat mechanics. There are a grand total of 30 ships for 17 nations, yes 30. Blufor and Redfor each get a pool of ships from their nations' navies, and some major navies such as the United State's and the UK's are sorely underrepresesnted. Naval fights are blobs to see who can mass the most ships with CIWS and missiles, and there are no tactics at all. I love the wargame series, but I cannot in good conscience advise you to buy this game. Buy Airland Battle, which is far more balanced and doesnt lie to consumers about its features. Really dissapointed with Eugen, I had very high hopes for this game.","April 11, 2014","false","91.3"," 177 of 307 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","177","307","4","7"

Naval, Air, Land it has it all and they all work for you to kill as many North Koreans as possible. SO many differnt units to chose from on each country/faction. The game is beautiful and I have had NO bugs and glitches while playing. I have  enjoyed the campaign (Which is not very story oriented) and the skirmishing and multiplayer is up to par as well. The game mostly has a particular audience and fan base on the side of Army nerds (Me) and RTS players alike. If you play CSGO maybe it's not the game for you.

It pains me to say it because I genuinely love this game and it's predecessors, but I would not recommend buying it.\n\nThere's several reasons and I will bullet point them (feel free to convo me for a more thorough analysis)\n1: Community: the general chat is some of the worst people you will ever talk to in life.  (yes it's really that bad, think nazi apologists, excessive trolls, people with 0 games who sit in the chat all day deterring newcomers)\n2: Community (dev/"marshall" perspective) the devs and their chosen few (Marshalls), ignore reasonable player input in terms of balance, ridicule people who disagree with them openly, and generally break the game every time they get a chance to suit their view.  Sure, they're the devs, they can do whatever they want.  Does this make the game better?  No.\n3: Balance: This game is terribly imbalanced and despite many many user threads detailing very reasonable steps to start the balancing process it has remained so.  As a amatter of fact they continue to introduce half baked mechanics that break the game further such as "stealth infantry" who were bugged and invisible for weeks.\n4: playerbase: This game is rapidly dying.  A few weeks ago there would be about 900 people on during a weeknight.  This week it has fallen to about 600, and it's been decreasing prior to a few weeks ago.  The chat trolls and high learning curve don't help.  Neither does the pompous attitudes of the devs and players.\n5: Naval: it's broken, it sucks, and no one uses it.  They should have just patched ALB (the previous game) and stayed away from naval entirely.  There's about 15 ships for each side, and none of them balance at all with the rest of the game.  It's literally a folly.\n\nI actually have a guide on this game where I go through a few play throughs.  I won't be wasting my time on it anymore because basically this game is done.  It's a real shame because it used to be my go-to and really did scratch that tactical/strategic itch.  Now it's more just a spam/click fest with very little tactical thikning or strategy involved.  Basically you spam OP units or planes or artillery.  I know that sounds trite, but that's what's it's moved to.  It used to be a game based on positioning and tactical movment of limited forces.  Now it's more of an APM/creep game.","May 30, 2014","false","294.6"," 54 of 87 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","54","87","0","14"

Massive battles, wide variety of strategies and units, good single player experience (though the computer does cheat) and a multiplayer experience that deserves to be in the professional gaming leagues. This is an absolute gem of a game for any strategy game player.\n\nOne of the great aspects about the game is that it makes losing troops very difficult for me, but just like real war, sometimes you have to push your troops in order to take an objective even though you know you'll take losses. As a commander, it is your job to make those losses worth the effort.\n\nWhile I am mostly praising this game, there are some big drawbacks that can potentially be patched with a hotfix.\n#1 There are several hidden stats in the game. Units with silenced weapons are not clearly marked and neither are units with auto-loaders. In the forums it has been stated that there will be a stat indicating auto-loaders with a proper description if I remember right, so this is likely to be fixed in the future but I wonder if they will reveal all the hidden stats and abilities in a clear defining manor.\n\n#2 The multiplayer community can be quite toxic. For a game that focuses on its multiplayer aspect, it is the biggest detriment to the game since you will have people who leave the game just because their initial push failed or even if they lose one unit. This often causes a cascade effect where people leave  one after another and while there are bonuses for the remaining team members and it is quite possible for the remaining members to win on their own, it often means that there are too many fronts for so few people to deal with and there is nothing that can be done. In addition to this, team killing is a potential problem. Luckily the team killing problem is rare, but when you're waiting in a lobby for a 10v10 map for about half an hour just to begin, it is quite disheartening when one of your team mates decides to bomb the spawning location killing most of the allied troops then proceed to bomb all of the supply bases and command vehicles before leaving.\n\n#3 Artillery is very prevelant and there are few counters. This is somewhat a reality of war that I mostly don't mind in this game, but this is bad in a few ways. One of which is that it just becomes an annoyance when you're constantly getting spammed by arty even when you take little to no losses since it often isn't used properly. Another way is that you'll often have team mates on your own team that don't know how to use artillery properly, then they waste all of their supplies achieving almost nothing, and then they start taking from allied supplies which deprives front line troops with repairs, ammo, and fuel. The final way that the artillery spam is a bad thing is because people neglect to mark the locations they are sending artillery shells (or bombing runs from airplanes) and thus there becomes friendly fire issues.\n\nMy suggestion for avoiding the pit falls that somewhat plague this game is to manage to get some friends in the game that you know are reliable, or even better yet, bring friends with you to buy the game and play with you. It's the best way to play and provides a lot of enjoyment for anyone who can work together as a team.","October 9, 2015","true","769.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

If you like Strategy Games, Wargaming or RTS: you should give this gem a try.\n\nGameplay\nWargame Red Dragon is a Cold War RTS. Actually it is a mix between RTS and Wargaming (meant as a category of games). Instead of building a base you will create a "Deck" which symbolises your army. In each battle you can call in units from your deck, but every unit is limited. Depending on your choices in the deck creation, your army has only a limeted number of units. This gives this game a quite realistic approach in terms of resource management. You don't want to loose your men. The combat itself is again, a mix between realism and gameplay features. Although this game is not a full simulation, the battle evolves quite realistic. terrain, recognisance, supplies, weapon technology, morale - everything comes to account.\n\nGamestyles\nThere are 5 campaigns to play which involve a strategy map and the normal battles. The core of the game is mulitplayer and skrimish. You can also play this against the AI (alone or with your friends).\n\nAs mentioned above: I can only recommend this game. The developpers made several free DLCs (Map Packs and Faction updates). If you are going to buy this game, I suggest the "200-Page Guide to Wargame: Rad Dragon" by SandyGunfox. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247884292","May 21","true","418.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It's easy to learn how to play; it's very hard to learn how to play well (which in my opinion is where a lot of the fun lies).\n\n\nQ: Is it a bit overwhelming to new players?\n\n\nIt was for me, and I think that can be what puts some people off this game before they've really gotten into it. The huge number of units is quite scary if you've never played any of the Wargame series before (I hadn't). Perseverance is key at the start, but once you get used to the game, you'll find this a joy rather than something to be afraid of.\n\n\nQ: Should I play the tutorials first?\n\n\nThere are actually no playable tutorials in RD. The tutorials are basically just text with instructions on what to do. It is worth giving these a read to start with, but I appreciate that this is likely to be quite boring for some players (although if you really dislike this idea, I'm not sure if this is really the game for you).\n\nDo not despair, however. There are plenty of people who have made Youtube vids to give you instruction not only on the mechanics of the game but also on deck-building (which is important to this game but not something you need to spend tonnes of time on if you don't want to). I can highly recommend ICBMRaptor (I love his tutorials and other Wargame vids, it's worth watching them if you're new since watching someone else play multiplayer games can be a good way of learning), Bubblebox (nice, clear explanantions of stuff), Boltsauce and VulcanHDGaming.\n\n\nQ: What's the community like?\n\n\nWhen I first started out and was resorting to the general chat for questions, my experience was pretty good (and I maintain that the community is better than a fair number of other multiplayer games I've played).\n\nHowever, recently the game has obviously been on sale and it seems that lots of people have picked it up while it's cheap. This has led to quite a few - how can I put this - "not-so-nice/mature" people entering the game and general chat. My mute list has been filling up a bit recently :( (prepare for spam sometimes)\n\nOn the upside, two things: 1)  you can just close the chat window if you don't want to see this, and 2) a lot of the people who helped me and people who are good players are still around and willing to help out :)\n\n\nQ: What's the gameplay like?\n\n\nSometimes intense, sometimes slow-paced. It depends who you're playing against and what your opponent's play style is like. I won't say a lot more than that because it is quite hard to generalise due to the vast amount of unit combos/deck types you can have combined with the different play styles of different people.\n\nHowever, one thing I will add: beware of spammers and stacked games. If you enter a lobby and you see 3 people on, say, the BLUFOR team and RED is empty, check their stats immediately. This will help you decide whether these are just 3 friends who want to play together (and maybe aren't that good) or if they're 3 pro players who want to ROFL-stomp some newbies.\n\nSpammers can also be an issue, especially in 10 v 10 or 20 v 20 games. Some players will just chuck tonnes of helos/artillery at you, which can be frustrating if you're not ready for it and they crush you. However, if you and your team are ready for it - and act accordingly (i.e. making sure you deploy enough AA to keep yourselves covered and not taking predictable routes to avoid arty, as well as coordinating) - the boot will be on the other foot when you smash their spam and then utterly wreck them ;)\n\n\nQ: Is the AI any good?\n\n\nIn general, it's fine. Sometimes it will do smart things (i.e. try to flank you, change its attack approach according to what you bring against it, especially if you thwart it once, etc.) but often it will also do some stupid things (e.g. advance infantry across open ground towards tanks).\n\nI would always recommend when starting out that you go into Skirmish mode and play lots of games against the CPU, as this will let you become familiar with the various maps and gameplay. The CPU will punish you if you make mistakes, so this will also teach you some good if basic things to be aware of when playing and basic tactics. Contrary to what some may think, I would NOT recommend immediately jumping into the single-player campaigns - you will likely just get frustrated unless you learn the game mechanics in Skirmish mode first.\n\nI have spent a lot of hours in this game just playing against the CPU because it is good fun :) if you find it boring by yourself, team up with a friend and go comp-stomping. If you have general chat open, you might see some good players also opening comp-stomp lobbies for games vs the CPU.\n\n\nQ: Does the AI cheat?\n\n\nYes. As far as I know, Easy mode AI gets the same number of deployment points as you (you'll learn what these are when you start the game) but it gets a slight bonus to how fast it receives them during a battle. Medium gets more of a bonus to this and gets c. 1,000 extra points to start with (don't quote me on that, I just remember seeing it somewhere), and so on. This might put some people off playing against the CPU.\n\nHowever, it really isn't that bad for the most part. The CPU, while making mistakes, is sensible and plays well enough that it can be a challenge, even without resorting to spam (which it can do on higher difficulties). It can also be fun sometimes to face off against a vastly superior force than you and be able to defeat them with the right defensive tactics (or offensive if you're particularly good/bold/brave/stupid :P).\n\n\nQ: I hear the naval combat sucks. Is this true?\n\n\nThere are definitely some issues with it. It isn't as varied as land combat, that's for sure. However, saying it "sucks" would be too harsh. Naval combat is fun, especially on maps with mixed land/naval action! Playing against the CPU can prevent issues with spam which may occur when facing players - otherwise I actually enjoy it and don't find it "imbalanced" as some say\n\n\nQ: Am I good at it?\n\n\nHehehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehehe no.\n\n\nQ: Do you care?\n\n\nNope! :D\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS AREN'T SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME, BUT QUITE OFTEN APPEAR IN GENERAL CHAT FROM PLAYERS STARTING OUT:\n\n\nQ: I see people in chat using flags/coloured text. How do I do that?\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=297173039\n\nThere you go ;) (but please don't spam. Don't want my mute list getting any bigger! :P)\n\n\nQ: When I try to join games, it says that I have the "wrong version" (or something similar). Why is that?\n\n\nMake sure you read the Steam news feed for this game - recently, Eugen (the developers) released a beta version of their latest DLC for this game (coming out officially in January). If you try to access most servers without using beta (unless it is a specific non-beta server), you likely won't be able to join.\n\nJoing is easy, though. Simply right click on the game in your Steam library, select "Properties", then select "Beta" and choose "Opt in" on the right-hand side of the window.\n\n\nIf you are any sort of RTS fan, I can highly recommend this game! :) come and join us for some great fun!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/american_joker/recommended/251060/","american_joker","DODE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/american_joker/","51 products in account","It was poorly delivered...\n\n\n\nFirstly,\n\nWhen the game was first announced, there was a lot of talk of naval been added, which is the biggest feature of the game aside from the fact that it now focuses on the Korean Peninsula and has the Asian nations in the fight.\n\nSadly during the Alpha, navel was horrible... The OPFOR (now called REDFOR) was overpowered in terms of the naval aspect of the game forcing NATO players to try to ditch naval altoghter and try to win by land. This can be seen in some of the early videos of the game during beta.\n\nIn the game current state, the naval feature is still looked down upon by players because it still involves the same way to win as it did in Alpha, although there seems to be somewhat less blobbing of the ships.  But to a beginner, he would come to think that blobbing his ships together is a good thing.\n\nWhich there is nothing wrong with that thought, because the only way or the main way your ships will be destroyed are by missiles.  They can fend off the incoming missiles using a Close-in weapon system or CIWS.  While one ship that has the CIWS can stop (at best) two missiles, a second ship will stop a third.  So following that pattern you can see why players tend to “blob” their ships.\n\nThe same thing can be said for the player who is doing the attack.  More missiles means you’ll need a better defense and if your opponent defense is not strong enough, some missiles will punch through.  Which in terms... leads to the spamming.\n\nSo, during my entire time of playing this game (which was a total of 300 hours) I can honestly say that I tried to avoid any games that involved naval, because it seemed like a stupid feature to play. So if your looking into buying this game for the naval warfare, don't because it feels like a taked on feature that doesn't introduce anything new after your first 2-4 battles. It's nothing more but who can shot more missiles at once will win...\n\n\n\n\nNow my second biggest problem which is that new deck system, or the number of limitations they now have on it.  For me, that deck system ALB (Wargame: AirLand Battle) had was perfect.  Comparing it to this game it now feels like I can no longer put a specific nation to fight in various ways, because of the newly added five card limit to a section for standard deck.\n\nThis newly added limitation was strongly noticeable for me when putting together the infantry for my decks.  The first limitation I had to get over was the five card limit for a standard deck, while the second limitation I have to get over was the number of specific transports I was allowed to have for my infantry.\n\nThe second limitation was strongly noticeable when I created my decks for the SSSR. (USSR or the Soviet Union) The number of the BMP3’s I was able to use in this game was laughable compared to the number I was able to have in ALB.  Which was odd because in that game the BMP3 was a prototype but mind you, it no longer is in this game.\n\nSo oddly enough the word "prototype" means you can have more according to this game.  But ignoring that and talking about the fact that they're the BMP3's only comes with one of the weakest infantry in the game. This helps illustrates that the added deck limitations makes more units useless than others and also shows something I hated most about this series. It’s that units and the things they come with aren’t very modular…\n\n\nNow my last problem with the game is the community.  The number of “pub-stomps” has increased dramatically in this game to the point where you’ll see game lobbies named “randoms only”.  Your chances of coming across a game that is not a “pub-stomp” are like 1 in 10.\n\nBut here's the kicker of this problem... When players ask for help the on the forums.  Typically I’ve seen a number of responses that state, “Play with friends”.  Which if you think about it, that’s what “pub-stomps” are made of.  Players playing with friends or clan mates against randomly teamed up players. Basically the number one solution is also cause of the problem…\n\n\nThen the typical attitude of the community...  Typically when one loses the match in this game, chances are they will leave.  Which puts you at further disadvantage making it nearly impossible to win. (But really it’s not like you have a chance when you’re paired with un-coordinated team members. So you’re better off quitting yourself…)\n\nTo make even worse, sometimes you’ll come across ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will taunt you and your team while you’re losing to them.\n\nSo because of this issue I literally limited myself to only playing the “10v10” matches, which oddly enough is something everybody is beginning to do because of the issue.  Basically the game is really only fun if you’re playing in those 10vs10 matches or 1v1’s. This issue with the community was a huge blow to me for this game because I primarily played this game with random players in the 2v2’s 3v3’ 6v6’s etc…\n\nSadly the last thing I retreated to (the 10v10's) also is suspected of pub-stomps acts also. I can even recall me being kicked from a few servers to make room for friends…\n\nSpeaking of being kicked from games... Because of eugene’s GENIUS idea of adding a view profile button for others to see the stats of players has also caused me to be kicked or even banned from some people’s games all because of my low "victory ratio" due to me playing with randoms all the time. Then you have morons in the game that will judge other players based on their victory ratio... Just note this, if you have a victory ratio anything less than 40%, You might be considered a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that doesn't know how to unistall the game, nor exit out of it...\n\nI have yet to see a response from the developers themselves on why they added that button. If you played the first game of the series (WarGame: European Escalation) you should remember that you had a number that was large next to your avatar. It signified what level you were. They basically added that feature back just disguised as a button...\n\nSince we're on the topic of features needed to be removed or added, I’ve also have yet to see a response from the developers on why they remove the visibility of the deck names...  Which is something most players took pride in during the second installation of the series.\n\n\n\nSo now that I’ve said all the bad things what are the good?\n\n\nWell, you now have the Asian nations in this series and the game now takes place on the Korean Peninsula.  You also have more units!  Also because of the crappy implementation of naval, your units can finally cross Rivers, which adds more dynamics to game also getting rid of or minimizing “chokepoints”.\n\nBut honestly these are the only things I can think of that are good.  Overall I will say that as far as multiplayer goes, the game deliver"s" poorly and was deliver"ed" poorly.  Since that first launch, the game was horribly imbalanced, forcing a number of players to wait for a balancing patch or what has been called "DLC" which took two months...\n\nWhy not make this an expansion to Airland Battle? Because all it really does is add a few new features, units and maps. This is something I've been seening happening a lot lately with games. Before what was called "expansion packs" are now becoming Yearly "re-releases" of the game you've already bought. EE:2012 | ALB:2013 | RD:2014\n\nThen you have a fragmented community amoung your three different games that really are the same thing, just with more stuff.\n\nThe series is great, but this game was the worst of them all…","September 28, 2014","false","566.1"," 82 of 142 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","82","142","5","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deniedoperative/recommended/251060/","deniedoperative","deniedoperative","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deniedoperative/","124 products in account","As opposed to normal categories such as visuals, gameplay etc, I shall address this game as its individual parts and mechanics (specific mechanics and additions), primarily how the game is different from past entries. This review is for people who are familiar with wargame to an extent and may contain jargon, my apologies.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the wargame series, it is a military simulation (to a degree) of Communist aligned nations fighting NATO and capitalist aligned nations. Each side, and the subdivions (coalitions and nations) have their own strengths and weaknesses, and most importantly their own varieties of units. According to the game's files, there are around 1500 unique deployable units in wargame, and this is much of the series' appeal. Battles are fought in real time, with emphasis on tactics and positioning, as opposed to base building and unit micro and the pace is slower than many RTS games out there. Think ARMA, appropriated as an RTS with the vehicle damage modelling of Company of Heroes with the map scale of Supreme Commander and the UI and setting of World in Conflict mishmashed with some of the atmosphere of EndWar. Or something. Its probably better to watch a video of the game to see what is is like.\n\nWargame: Red Dragon is in many ways a series of steps forward as opposed to a leap and a bound from AirLand Battle. The foremost change is the addition of naval and new units that accomodate this new mechanic. Unfortunately, to put it bluntly-the naval gameplay is quite broken. However, it is not the black pit of despair that trawling the forums and boards would lead you to believe. While inherently flawed in its execution, there are redeeming features.\n\nNAVAL:\nWell, like I said, its quite broken, but not for the reasons many people seem to think. The biggest issue that impacts immersion and gameplay is the scale. It is simply out of scale entirely to have Soveremeny destroyers and Arleigh Burke (oops I mean "Kongo") destroyers duking it out 5 kilometres from shore and 2 kilometres from each other. Ships in real life almost never meet to exchange cannon fire. This means for balance, the ships in wargame are nerfed to hell, and even then, they are very powerful. The scale should have been increased or naval should not have been included. Naval pathfinding is an issue, with collisions and whats become "balls of death", ugly bunched masses so that CIWS reaches critical mass. Redfor definitely has an advantage with not one, but TWO 500 point heavy ship options. But, the general strat in naval is clustered ships potshotting with missiles until inevitably, Blu air inflicts unsustainible losses or Red destroyers close with the Blu fleet. River boats, on the other hand, work fine, if a teensy bit overpowered vs land. Then again, I've seen a T34/85 Obr 55 kill a Kongo, so go figure.\n\nGAMEPLAY GENERAL:\nFor the most part, it works fine, there is a measured sense of balance in assymetry. There seems to always be overbuffing of the recipient nations following a DLC release,  but that is a minor issue. The gameplay remains largely the same since AirLand Battle, with the inclusion of naval not matching the revolutionary change that the inclusion of jets was. Air has been nerfed slightly with better AA options across the board and tanks are less viable as well, with seemingly every single unit being geared to kill tanks- a hyperbole, but an apt one. Artillery has been buffed significantly since  The battles are fast and hectic, with 10v10s a sight to behold. The most popular modes in public multiplayer are Destruction-kill more of the enemy, and Conquest-capture points and gain victory points to win. Both modes have their pros and cons, with Destruction boiling down into static trench warfare, artillery slugging  being the decider and Conquest seemingly being an excuse for most people to "suicide their entire bloody deck in the first five minutes". However, with competent teams on both sides, Wargame multiplayer is an enjoyable affair, but inevitably, with unpleasant people in public games. This cannot be helped.\n\nSINGLEPLAYER:\nSP exists in the form of offlien skirmish with the AI and dynamic "Theatre of War" style campaigns. Both are marred horrendously by the laughably bad AI. The extent of the AI is grouping a bunch of ground offensive units and fast moving them down the nearest road straight into your defenses. As a stopgap solution to the bad AI, Eugen upped the availiblity, income rate and starting income of the AI's forces, meaning, most skirmish matches are zombie wave modes. Custom decks make skirmishes bearable, but still needs work. The "dynamic" campaign unfolds on a Total War style grand campaign map, with turn based gameplay. While better in quality than ALB's campaign in terms of AI and presentation, it loses some of the freedom and scale of ALB, in exchange for a more scripted affair. The actual battles are disappointing to say the least. The campaign map basically serves as a connector for a series of skirmishes against a zerg rush AI. We'll see if the "Second Korean War" DLC improves things.\n\nDECKS AND UNITS:\nThe deck builder remains largely unchanged. In Wargame, starting forces are chosen from a pool of units in a deck you have constructed. Everthing comes in cards, with limited availiblity, both of the cards and the units themselves, which fill up slots in a grid, categorised into various unit roles. This is where the meat of the game is IMO and makes the 1500~ units a legitimate feature that makes sense as opposed to filler. Deckbuidling is one of the most fun and involved processes in wargame, with a single slot, card or activation point (How many slots you can fill with cards) making a world of difference on the battlefield. The armory is wonderfully presented with every unit rendered in high detail and with stats, however one must be aware that the armory LIES. Also, Category B and Category C (time period restricted) decks are functionally useless now, with the availiblity bonus gone and more activation points which you likely don't need. Eugen has always been fast and loose with regards to their period accuracy and scale (A Rafale with early 2000s' aams? Really?), and while the game ostensibly has units up until the mid 1990s, this is skirted around a bit. There also appears to be a somewhat prevalent French bias to the game, but its not really an issue for me.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nWargame is slick in its menus and user interface, albeit a bit cluttered at times in game. The game looks and sounds much better than ALB and textures have had a noticeable improvement. Voice work is a bit iffy, with accents ranging from well done to comic. The game scales well too, with graphics that will burn out your GPU down to European Escalation era textures and rendering.\n\nIn short, Wargame: Red Dragon is a fine offering from Eugen Systems and a good step forward in the series. However, naval has some severe flaws and the single player experience leaves a lot to be desired.","August 27, 2014","true","138.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

So my advice is player multiplayer, with the expectation you will be defeated constantly for your first month. But instead of quitting out of games, learn from the better players. Once you start getting a few key aspects down, it is not difficult to become a competent player.\n\nMatchmaking can be a little one sided at times. But remain positive... it is through failing and learning that'll you'll become a very good player. People don't master this over night.\n\nThat all being said though, the game is still massively better then alot of other strategy games out there. And it is very easy to become absorbed by it. Community online is healthy.\nId like to think after the disappointment I've seen around Act of Aggression, the developers will return to make another one of these games. Only time will tell - until then I'll keep enjoying this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","November 20, 2015","true","413.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

If you have Airland battle already then really all you are paying £30 for is some more units and a few maps, basically it's an expansion pack.\n\nThe trouble is so many people have migrated to red dragon that it is almost necessary to get it in order to get a game as servers seem to have got real quiet in airland battle.\n\nRed dragon needs much more work, there are various balance issues, naval combat whilst a great idea is awful and brings little or nothing to the game.  It is of course a Beta, to be fair but still not worth £30 notes, £15 perhaps.\n\nYou can at last ignore people on the chat so all the racist/jew haters out there are forever silenced which is lovely.  AI is still at times frustratingly annoying, the number of times I have sent jets on a bombing run for instance that fail to drop on their target and instead carrying on flying merrily deep into enemy territory to be shot down by the 4 million pieces of AA waiting for them.  And this is depsite clicking madly to get the bloody thing to turn around.  When you are playing as Redfor(pact essentially) you get to buy 3 or 4 planes if you are lucky whilst Blufor(nato essentially) seem to have endless jets at their disposal.  The same applies to the navy, again balance issues.  That said Redfor seems to attract a more tactical player so they do seem to win equally as often.\n\nI also do not like the points limit per deck, whereas in airland battle it was 40 or 45 maybe? so you had to really thick about your deck purchases - now it sits at 60 and you can buy everything thus making deck specialties utterly pointless.  Perhaps this will change - I hope so.","May 6, 2014","false","189.5"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","32","53","2","1"

The first thing to say is this is a  spectacular game. The game has so many good points I cannot list them all but here are some.\nFirstly the number of units is incredible. There are over 1,450 units spanning 17 nations. This gives a huge variety in game play and no two games are ever the same. The second point is the maps. These are huge, covering vast areas of terrain, oceans and rivers. This allows players to use the terrain to their advantage (for example sneaking through forests with tanks or going over mountians with infantry). Thirdly all DLC (at time of writing) is free. This goes back all the way to European Escalation where DLC was also free. Another point about this game is that although the devs had said it needs a 2.5 GHz processor it doesn't. My computer is very low end and can still run this at 15-30 FPS.\nA word of warning though! This game it not a layed back RTS where you don't have to do much accept order where units go. There is a lot to micro manage and if you don't micro manage then you stand not hope in winning. There is also a steep learning curve and from my understanding no tutorial though i'm sure YouTube will have the answers.\nAll in all this is a great RTS and in my opinion the best out on the market at the moment and certianly the best in the series so far. Don't be put off by the price in my opinion to get your monies worth you should play at least the same number of hours as pounds you paid and its certainly done that!\n10/10\n\n","April 27, 2015","true","253.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Unlike other modern strategy games you aren't just looking at a black and blue map seeing missiles being dashed across the board and that's the most combat that the game ever witnesses. Wargame : Red Dragon allows you to enter the battlefield and control your units down to a single soldier. In the Air, on land and wait for it... sea. There are many powerful western and eastern countries to play that you might not expect in a video games when it's usually just US/UK against USSR. Countries like Canada and Denmark or even North and South Korea. This game offers so much with its many maps for multiplayer or singleplayer battles. Very fun Strategy game\n\nCons :\n\nPersonally. I found it very difficult to learn how to play. It's not like minesweeper where you just mess around and figure out the basics in five minutes. It takes time and even now there are still new controls and options I find out about.\n\nOther than the learning curve the only other issue I had with the game is in a multiplayer game if you, your teammate or your opponent are having bad internet connection and constantly hopping in and out of connection it pauses the game until you reconnect as opposed to having you fight against a blind General. As fair as this is to the other team it does make it hard to play a match when someone is disconnecting literally every 10 seconds. As well, after you disconnect you are given 30 seconds to reconnect and if you don't you are kicked from the game and your forces are then given to one of your allies which this could really go into the pros stage because it doesn't just make a game go from bad to great  right away if you're being destroyed by the guy with bad internet.

(Bonus to sticking to a single faction, and there is prebuilt decks for beginners)\n\nThere is land, air and naval combat. The vehicles are realistic. There is fuel, detracking, getting your rotor shot out and your copter crashing into a tank column and blowing it up. There is ways to get fuel again, because you start with a FoB (or Forward Operations Base) which supplies your troops with ammo, fuel, repairs, etc. The jets come in off-map from an air field and do what they do, and can retreat back to the air field (if they make it) for repairs and ammo restocking.\n\nThe maps are absolutely gigantic. The enviorment feels alive. You can hide your troops in the foliage, secure and use buildings, craters are left as permanent scars in maps from your wars (Just for the duration of the game, you won't go back into a map filled with craters from previous games) there are mountains, forests, plains, plateaus, rivers, lakes, oceans, you name it, it's there.\n\nIt's balanced. Yes, factions may favor one type of unit over another, like (example only, not true) USA may favor Infantry and have better infantry than the French, but the French have better air support, etc. Everything has a counter. Air has anti air and other air units like fighters and attack helicopters. Bazookas and RPGs and jets and other helicopters for ground and naval and air for other naval.\n\nThere is objectives, you get command vehicles to secure sectors in a map usually codenamed something like a military term such as Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta. The more zones you control the more advantages you get such as new ways to bring in units to that zone instead of your FoB's location.\n\nThe graphics are superb. Extremely realistic, and you can zoom in on ongoing battles and see from almost a 3rd person perspective.\n\nI definitely recommend it whole heartedly, it's a great game extremely addicting and very fun.\n\n9.9/10","November 26, 2015","true","30.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Takes a bit of decking around to figure out what all the stats mean and how to abuse them in a nice deck, but when you beat your friend in a 1vs1 its oh so sweet. Try reading The Art of War by Sun Tzu if you're having problems, its in audiobook form. And I suggest you get some friends to play with you, the ones that roam the public multiplayer games can be very good. Whereas if you have friends that are as noob as you are, then you can win some, then they win some as they adjust their approach, then you win some because you adjusted your approach, etc. This is very rewarding gameplay.\n\nThe game is known for being as close to realism as possible, and strategically it actually is. You have to supply your troops and ships with ammo and rockets if you have a prolonged engagement (so your ships in naval battles need supply ships as a part of your deck). You also have to use infrantry in forests and buildings to spot and sneak up on the enemy (you can't shoot what you can't see, though you can shoot artillery at suspected locations).\nThe battles are very intriguing. You can't just rush ahead, because to win you have to kill a certain number of points worth of units, but if too many of your own units die then the enemy wins because they killed enough units before you killed enough units. This gives a very real feeling, because you have to take care of your troops as you would in real life. Each unit you get killed is another set of points for the enemy. The trick is to make each exchange worth it, so you take more points than you lose in the engagement. This is tricky, but very rewarding gameplay.\n\nPros: Everything, the only thing missing is a pure city map (unless I missed it). Just about every military asset in the world worth its paint is in the game, and there's endless replayability because no two engagements are the same. No base setup, no tedious setup of power-stations and resource harvesters, no tech-tree to worry about, no real unit cap that you'll ever approach (except in naval battles), there's a counter for everything if you only have the presence of mind to get it out when you need it (and managed to fit it into your deck).\nCons: It can be overwhelming, because there's so much to figure out. But this can be negated by playing with someone who begins playing at the same time as you, then you're on equal ground and will win every other match against each other as you figure things out.","October 30, 2014","true","29.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You can spend hours crafting decks just to learn you forgot to put in AA and get obliberated by bombers or you lack armour support. (Cough Norway Cough) A Deck in wargame is a unit selector were you pick the units you want and your style of play style, so airborne for the person who likes airborne etc.\nUp next is the maps in this game.\nThe Maps in Wargame Red Dragon are massive, battles will rage on for ever unless you lose your command zone to bring in units, the maps can vary from a jungle hell hole to a island in the middle of the map that you have to conquer or a map that has several bridges as chokepoints or finally, an Urban deathmatch. There is also navy only maps were battleships and all will slug it out with each other.\nNext is the brand new feature of Naval Warfare!!!\nThe naval warfare is an anchor weighing this game down since it is mainly, how many ships you can blob together and rush towards your enemy and missiles will always get intercepted by flares so anti ship planes are litreally useless, the naval warfare though can have some intense moments in it and it just looks beautiful.\nNow we are gonna go onto Graphics.\nThe Graphics in this game are gorgeous, its one of those few games that balances Graphics with Gameplay making for a superb experience, the maps are so lovingly detailed from watching a missile go towards its target to blades of grass sweeping in the wind or been crushed by a tank or watching the Earth be charred by your bombs and Napalm, also looking at the reflections from your ships on the water.\nThe community though is a mixed bag to be honest.\nThe community has given this name the unoffical nickname, Chatgame Red Dragon due to you been on the chat more than playing the actual game, the chat will always descend into one of these discussions:\nWorld Domination\nGlorious Leader Kim Jong Un\nPolotics\nAustralian attack Hamsters\nGoing Topless Fishing with Lord Putin\nThings going boom\nCommunism\nCapitalism\nWhy there is no India or Pakistan faction in this game\nToasters\nWhy we all trust the VAB\nWhy the Nighthawk is powered by fairy dust and lucky charms\nWhy some unit is OP\nWhy there are no Dragons in this game\nThat gives you an idea of what the community is like, we are mainly humorus, helpful, no spammers and all, but then there is the darkside, that is filled with racists and spammers, thankfully there is the mighty mute button. You can also 1 to 1 chat with people so you don't spam the chat with help.\nNow this game also has a steep learning curve, if your good at the singleplayer campaigns (Trust me the Dynamic Campaigns are better than ALB's) you will normally get your ♥♥♥♥ kicked in Multiplayer or get kicked from the server for been crap. In skirmish against bots though, the AI will probally cheat but teaches you some things like why recon is vital etc.\nOverall a superb game with such wonderful attention to detail with caring devs and a great community only let down by the awful Navy Combat.\nThis game gets a 9 from Hen","March 17, 2015","true","108.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","1"

The maps are beautiful and are well-balanced for the most part. Maps manage to feel unique even though there are very many of them, all for different numbers of players.\n2. Naval combat, while it sounds cool, is underwhelming. It's basically like a downgraded version of land combat and the naval maps aren't very imaginatively designed.\n3. The developers seem to have trimmed a game mode or two from the previous game which, in all honesty, isn't the end of the world since we still have the most important game modes, but when you get a new game, you expect it to take what was present in the previous game and expand upon it, not remove from it.\n4. The campaigns are pretty mediocre and are gimmicky. The AI is extremely stupid even on the hardest difficulty, and you can bait it easily. To counteract this, the AI gets a handicap in that it gets extra units at the start of the game, which isn't that big of a deal. The AI's basic strategy is to send waves of vehicles at you in hopes that you will just give up. The only thing that interrupts this is the constant artillery bombardments against your command units which, by all accounts, should be hidden to the enemy. The campaigns themselves are interesting and based in history, but they get old because, when it comes down to it, there is generally either one solid strategy or two solid strategies which allow you to complete the campaign successfully, and there isn't any room for strategic creativity.\n\nMultiplayer is super fun.\n\nScore: 83/100: If there were as many people playing ALB as there are people playing this, I would just play ALB, but this game is still worth your time.","May 19","true","41.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It takes a little while at first to understand how to play as the tutorials are not helpful, but after watching several YouTube videos I figured the basics out. With regards to the Navy action, it is fun just buying a medium sized ship or two and sailing around shooting down air craft, blowing up unsuspecting land units, or sinking other ships.\n\nThe land battles are very complicated, it is not easy taking over the map by just selecting a whole bunch of high end units and sending them to an area, you must move your units in a layered fashion very slowly. Sending in a tank or helicopter rush is just a waste of good units. You need infantry and artillery as well as plenty of support vehicles, otherwise your tanks and helicopters are useless. With regards to the air units, wow... not at all easy to use as they get shot down in seconds if you are not extremely careful, and those air planes are very expensive. Being Canadian, I can't help but play Canada. I like the proto types they included for Canada, but still, it is a big challenge to win (my win loss ratio is horrible) but that has not stopped me!

Alot of units have their utility, so cheaper units are not always directly inferior and have their use - aswell as cheaper units will give you more numbers. If you have for example a 180 cost tank, you will only get 1 or 2, where as a 90 point tank will give you maybe 8 or 7, allowing you to capitalize on numbers at a cost of a more powerful unit.\n\n\nNot too easy to learn, so it's good to have a friend who is good at the game to teach you the ins and outs.\n\n\nAlot of people complain about balance and there is a balance issue in certain places with the game. Depending on who you are, this is either a good or bad thing:  You may like a game balanced away from realism to make it slightly more 'fair', or you may prefer that the game lets both sides/individual nations have their strong and weak points.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to play against an enemy and in the lobby see what nation they are playing as, to know what their strong points and weak points are in terms of units, to help devise a plan to counteract that. I prefer to play a game where I have to think to nullify the enemies advantage, than have everything completely balanced.\n\nAt the end of the day, superior tactics will win games over just good units - Adapt and overcome. This sort of thing comes apparent when a team of 1980s North Korea beats a cocky well rounded BLU team. I've seen it happen, and no, it really isn't easy, but if you can outplan your enemy, you'll have positive kill/loss ratios in any match.\n\n\nIf at the end of the day you really just can't get a grip on the game but are willing to learn, theres an entire 200 page 'red dragon for dummies' guide that can teach you everything you need to know, although you really just need to in most cases think realistically about things.","June 14, 2015","true","84.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

However I can tell you that it is not for all RTS players. If you like building  your massive inpenrtable bace, defened by automated turrets. Sorry but there isn't any bace building in this game. If you like having one or two sets of units wipe entire forces ten or twelve times as numerous. Again that isn't possable, because just like in real life one can only carry so much ammo and once it is out you have to go get more. Also with tanks, trucks, helicopters and transports having limited range and use up their fuel supplies that is also something you have to keep an eye on.\n\nHowever even if you are put off by all of that added "realisem" (remember it's a game, not a simulation so somethings aren't all that true to real life like the scale of maps and ranges of weapons for example) I would recomend you try it. If you are good at micormangement or macromanagement then this game will have a place for you. The single player campains are well scripted and interesting to play, although I would say that the AI could use some work when it comes to attacking/defending with singular type forces.\n\nAs for multiplayer some people are amazingly good, however it doesn't take too long to become good enough to enjoy the game while being able to help your team. But as with every multiplayer game if you end up on a team (should you want to play on a team as you can do 1v1 if you desire) who has rocks for brains where as you are playing against some fivestar armchair geneails don't worry if you cannot carry the entire match. Also many of the very good players have reliced theory guides or have posted youtube videos showcasing what they do to win matches and generaily if you watch the replay of a game you lost or won you can usualy come up with the reasons why that happened. Which is one of the best features of this game in my mind, if you loose horably because of a break through attack on one flank that you weren't watching close enough or the player in that sector was unable to defete it you can see why they were able to beat you\n\nIf you are sold now, please note that the game curently has some flaws, for example some nations do not have any upgraded infentry, where as most of the others have a basic pre 1980 form of infentry than a upgraded infentry from 1985 or 1990 with better eqipment and access to more advanced transports. However it has been confermed by the developers that some of the first DLC (which would suprise me if it cost you anything) releases will address this problem.\n\nThat last paragraph has been mostly delt with, with the release of The Milionth Mile most (but not all) of the nations have had an infentry upgrade option added. Also added were land based anti ship missile systems.","April 22, 2014","true","428.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Better late than never I guess. I'll compensate with kind of a mega review.\n\nWargame Red Dragon is definitely one of my top 3 real time strategy games of all time. (The other two being Supreme Commander and Starcraft II.) It's the third game in the series and it takes the franchise to a new level with the implementation of naval warfare, several new nations, graphical polish and rebalancing of old mechanics like artillery power. I don't think any RTS game offers the equivalent experience as Wargame and I believe every self-respecting RTS gamer should play Wargame.\n\nWargame series is so deep that you could sink Mount Everest into it. And it's not just the sheer amount of units and all the simulation, but the tactical opportunities.\n\nPerhaps you should shoot smoke to cover your advance? Or would you like to do an amphibious landing behind enemy lines and cut their reinforcement route? How about sending an elite recon squad behind enemy lines to observe what kind of troops enemy is bringing in? They can also direct artillery fire on enemy supply depot and artillery battery. (Just watch out for counter-artillery) Perhaps you could open the game with an airborne assault to an important crossroads town?  Can't stop enemy advance? Try napalming the important bridges to block them and buy time.\n\nIt's amazing what kind of devious evil plans human mind can come up with. I personally really enjoy this aspect of the game. When tanks get boring you can spice things up with some crazy special forces action.\n\nRealism is a big word in Wargame. Every one of the 1 500 different units have their individual statistics for weapons (type, ammunition, armor penetration, explosive power, fire rate, range, accuracy, stabilizer, targeting system...) armor (front, side, rear, top) and all sort of miscellaneous stuff like fuel, speed, size, stealth, countermeasures, operational range etc. They are all significant when you decide what units you call to battlefield.\n\nHowever, Wargame is no Dwarf Fortress. Even my 57-year-old dad has managed to master the game. I think it's common sense you shouldn't move your tanks through a town in which you have spotted enemy special forces moving in. Most of us also have brains to understand that an AT missile can one shot even the heaviest tank if you expose its side or rear armor, or that enemy AA will most likely shoot down your old slow bomber which doesn't have any countermeasures, or that napalm strike will paint pant's of your infantrymen brown, or that your artillery needs ammunition or that 20 is more than 10.\n\nSure, you don't know all the tricks when you start your first match but you'll get there. There are great single player campaigns (both in Red Dragon and the previous titles) and there is also a chat window in the main menu full of people who can answer your questions and give tips. (At least when it's not full of Russians mocking Americans and Americans mocking Russians and Europeans mocking everyone.)\n\nSingle player offers a lot of practice opportunities. You can either play skirmish games and adjust the difficulty the way you want or once you think you are ready you can try single player campaigns. I found the campaigns challenging (=fun) even for a Wargame veteran, not to mention the amount of interesting tactical and strategic opportunities.\n\nAddition of naval units was a big thing of Red Dragon so I guess I should say something of it. The naval units are often called unbalanced by the players and I guess they are slightly. It's also kind of unfortunate that the ships are only from few nations. I however wouldn't call it a total failure. Naval warfare is still fun and it makes the game more interesting in coastal maps as if you lose your naval presence you are in risk of amphibious landings in your rare. Ships' cannons are really powerful against ground units IF you can spot them, which the ships usually can't. On the other hand if ships move too close to shore pretty much any kind of tank platoons can make serious damage.\n\nThe deck system from Wargame Airland Battle is also here and better than ever. For those who are unfamiliar with the deck system, a deck is basically a pre-defined selection of units you choose for a battle. Decks are really fun to make because you can (and you should) get bonuses by adding restrictions and specializations. For example I really like my South Korean Marine deck, Canadian motorized deck or pre-1980s REDFOR tank decks.\n\nThe system has been rebalanced so all the deck types have become feasible. Especially airborne decks are really cool. Besides the five new countries there are coalitions which consist of several nations. The bonuses for coalitions are smaller but at least they get to keep their prototype units. My Commonwealth mechanized deck and South Korean-Japanese motorized deck just rock.\n\nThe maps in Wargame Red Dragon are also really cool with mountains, towns, deserts, forests, coastal areas, rivers and all of those potentially in a same map! This opens a ton of possibilities and makes almost any kind of deck playable in every map. We sure have come a long way from Wargame European Escalation's never-ending plains with some occasional woods.\n\nAs I said in my Wargame Airland Battle review, what makes Wargame really cool is the variety of everything that keeps the game fresh. Every player makes his own decks and chooses his own tactics. That's why every match is at least slightly different and you can never know what kind of BS enemy has in store for you.\n\nThe fun factor will also get multiplied by 10 if you have a friend in your team in a voice chat to coordinate with. That's where the possibilities of teamwork rocket through the roof.\n\nWargame Red Dragon is the ultimate peak of the evolution of Wargame franchise. It's probably the best think that has happened to RTS games for a few years and I love it just as much as I love the smell of napalm in mornings.\n\nTL;DR: Play it. Play it. Play it.","August 5, 2014","true","429.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is far from perfect however and it has more balance issues then any other Wargame title. Ships dont make noise when they move, unit accents are messed up (the same voice actor is used for UK and Aussie troops) some factions are almost useless (Danish) and some units need balance issues fixed. The single player is also poorly made and overly hard. Wargame: Red Dragon is a epic RTS game but the issues need to be fixed and Wargame needs a much larger profile.

Whether you’re zoomed in on an individual vehicle or structure, or zoomed out to see the entire map at once, Eugen has paid close attention to every detail. It is unfortunate that in many cases, you’ll be zoomed all the way out to look at the map as a whole, or perhaps zooming in to watch a couple sectors. It’s seldom that you’ll have the luxury to view things up close like in the promo shots.\n\nMuch like Supreme Commander, you’ll spend the bulk of your time in Wargame looking at your units as a mass of icons. And this works, it makes sense. But darned if it’s not a waste of those lovingly crafted vehicle and structure models. But even at a distance, Red Dragon has a lot to offer visually. The user interface is utilitarian in the extreme, which is unsurprising given the density of information the game is asking you to parse and process constantly. I am, however, always a sucker for a fancy user interface, and can't help but wonder if they couldn't have done something slightly more appealing this tme around.\n\nWargame both is, and is not, frustratingly and even mind-achingly complex.\n\nAt its core, it’s actually built on some fairly simple and straightforward concepts: build a ‘deck’ of units, go into combat, kill the other guy's units. No production facilities, no reserch, just divide and conquer. Units in the game are broken down numerous ways: they're divided into 2 main factions, and 9 major categories. The factions are BLUEFOR, including the US, the UK, France, West Germany, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, ANZAC (Australia and New Zeland), South Korea and Japan. BLUEFOR is typically deemed simpler to play or even downright better than REDFOR from a balance perspective, but that's highly subjective. I came to personally prefer REDFOR. REDFOR, in its turn, is East Germany, the USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, China and North Korea. The Asian factions are new additions to this game, and are the origin of the game’s name (as should be painfully obvious).\n\nDeck building is an art, and without guidance van be a formidable task. There are guides on Steam, and the game’s subreddit has a weekly deckbuilding thread, but for the uninitiated, simply deciding what units to bring with you can be an incredible challenge and point of contention with more veteran players.\n\nCombat is unforgiving. Deeply so. Being caught out in the open, or by your units counter, is a sure, swift and humiliating defeat. And more than combined arms is necessary – the counterplay of these units goes several levels deep, often requiring multiple types of aircraft and anti-air in addition to artillery, tanks, and infantry combined. Naval warfare and naval units have their place in the game: mainly, via amphibious infantry carriers and other shallow water units. Larger vessels exist, but aren’t used particularly often in my experience. Deep sea units and combat feel gimmicky beside the much more polished and refined air/ground combat mechanics, into which riverine units fit much more neatly.\n\n\nWargame is amazing. I love it, I’m addicted to it. It has tons to learn and master, and mechanics that I can only describe as deeply satisfying. But its learning curve, the burden of knowledge that goes largely unsupported, is undeniably and unavoidably steep. With an afterthought tutorial, and so much opacity involved both in what units to bring into combat and in actual engagements with the enemy, Wargame is uncaring towards the plight of new players, an attitude often adopted by the game’s very community, which is at times shockingly virulent towards new players.","March 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

There is a STEEP learning curve to the game, and there isn't a good tutorial in-game.\n\n2. While there are a few good guys who don't mind helping out a noob, the vast majority of the community will view you as prey to get an easy win. Proof? Create a multiplayer game, title it noobs only, the first 3 people will be level 15+, and won't even apologize that they tried to take advantage of you being a beginner for an easy win.\n\n3. Lots of battles are won or lost within the first 5 mins. These are 20 minute battles, mind, so there's a good chance that you will be on cruise control for 15 minutes of it.\n\n4. Artillery units are overpowered as of now, and matches could boil down to people just shelling the crap out of each other for 10 mins.\n\nNow why do I recommend the game?\n\n1. There's no other game like it. It is like Total War on steroids, every unit has a counter-unit...It is the very basis of strategic thinking.\n\n2. Once you get over the big hump of learning the game, it is quite a lot of fun...unless you match up with one of the vast number of people who are diehard followers of the game and know every key-binding and inch of the map in the back of their head.\n\n3. There is a HUGE amount of units to select, granted some may be the exact same (but made available for different countries) but in general, you can browse through each unit with a very detailed model to boot for a while.\n\n4. Like I mentioned, there are hidden gems in the community, and some of them have written up some very comprehensive guides for the game. Whether you want to read through a 200 and 180 page guide for a game is a whole different question altogether though.","July 8, 2014","true","15.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buegecj/recommended/251060/","buegecj","Buege C J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buegecj/","210 products in account","Overview:\n\nThis isn't your typical Command & Conquer or Starcraft style RTS, this is a somewhat complex combined arms simulation with a little bit of a learning curve. It helps to have some background or at least a basic understanding of modern military strategy, technology and terminology but with a little bit of research that can be achieved. As long as the player has an understanding of what the units are, what their purpose is and what their strengths and weaknesses within that purpose they should be able to play the game efficiently.\n\nThe player's army consists of a "deck" of "cards" which are purchased with "activation points". In each deck their are nine unit types, each with their own row of slots. There are logistics, infantry, support, tank, recon, vehicle, helicopter, plane, and naval units. Each unit type gets a limited number of card slots based on the type of deck. For instance, an armored deck would have more tank slots and less infantry slots. Each card represents a unit and costs a set amount of activation points, starting at one point and gradually increasing up to five points as the player purchases more units within an individual unit type. The player is normally given 60 activation points to spend on each deck. When a player enters a game each card costs a certain amount of points to place on the map. the more powerful the unit is, the more points it costs. Points are earned over time and the income increases when a player or their team takes a point and places a command vehicle in them.\n\nThe Review:\nI have been playing Wargame for a little under a year, starting with Airland Battle. As a Marine Corps veteran I immediately noticed that the developers did their homework and created a very accurate representation of most of the American vehicles and infantry units without sacrificing balance. Within a week of playing I was hooked and the addiction hasn't worn off since. For the most part Red Dragon was a big upgrade from Airland Battle. The maps are more detailed and look more natural, the units are more balanced and the gameplay became smoother without taking away from the original Wargame experience. I was very dissappointed with the naval units, they seem like they were thrown in at the last moment and they don't fit in the game very well. Every game I've played against someone who had a large naval presence I've won. I think it would have worked better if they removed the frigates and destroyers, leaving just the river boats and other small ships. The only other negative aspect of the game is the AI "Fast Move" pathfinding, it would be nice if the player was able to select specific roads for a vehicle to travel down instead of selecting a location and having the AI take the fastest road. There have been too many instances where I've called in a unit, forgotten about them in the heat of a firefight and they've blindly driven into an enemy line. Other than that the game is great, there is a massive amount of units to select from allowing for a huge amount of variety. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses and I have yet to find any overpowered units or exploits, the game is very skill based and well thought out. It isn't too often you find games of this quality. I would reccommend this to anyone willing to put in the little bit of time it takes to get past the learning curve.

Wargame has always been a series that focuses on realism and fantastic graphics. However this game is very complicated and for newcomers may be quite daunting. Sandygunfox's guide  Here  is a fantastic guide that is free and gives some great tips for newcomers to the series.\n\nThings I like:\n\n-Fantastic range of units and factions to play.\n-Graphics are fantastic and very detailed.\n-Maps are very well designed and thought-out.\n-3 big DLC packs that were released for free.\n-Gameplay is very slick and the larger maps with 20players run very smooth.\n-Massive online maps and battles.\n\nThings I don't like:\n\n-Sometimes the AI is a tad dumb\n-Not enough maps possibly.\n-No more dlc have been announced and I feel that possibly more maps would be good.\n-Game can sometimes do some strange things, like planes flying through mountains.\n-Online can be a bit pub-stompy with higher level players dominating lower level ones. While not really a problem as you can view their wins etc and just make custom games with people around your level.\n\nOverall I think this is a fantastic game, I've put alot of hours into this and was also a beta player. During this time the game has evoled greatly. The free DLC was a great bonus but these three were the only ones planned and they plan to work on other titles. Despite this Red Dragon is a great RTS title with superb graphics/gameplay that may appear daunting at first, but is very rich and diverse once you get to grips with its style of play.","October 1, 2014","true","167.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Naval battles are especially exciting as they are new and fun, but they really lack units. There are very few large ships to choose from and they seem to neglect many ships that were being used in the 1980's-90's; namely the Ticonderoga class and the Arleigh-Burke class in the US. That being said it is still extremely exciting to sneek some smaller patrol boats up rivers and take out enemy cammand vehicles and tanks. The land units are absolutely amazing. There is a huge range of vehicles, tanks, and infantry. They have put more importance on having specific infantry units than ever before. There are still some of those same annoyences with tanks sitting in the middle of a field staring at clearly seen enemy and not shooting or moving.

It is fairly easy to get into and will take effort to master, but it very rewarding once you do so. Managing multiple actions, many weapon types and all kinds of tactical situations is very fun. It is also a game that rewards forethought, correct force composition and having a plan. Red Dragonj is very engaging on both a tactical and strategic level, some of the best fun I have had in the past few years has been playing this series while on VOIP with friends, fighting challenging battles.\n\nShould you need further convincing, I’ve clocked in 1038 hours into this game so far according to Steam and that number is likely to keep growing.

But, never the less. It's complex gameplay makes up for a hard learning curve, so at the start of your playing of wargames, you will get obliterated by other players in online matches. Deck system and no traditional basebuilding, Every unit has their strenghts & weaknesses and everything has a counter. These reasons help this game to stand out from the rest. To be really good at this game, you just have to learn constantly about the mistakes you make in your past games, so you know what not to do the next time you wind up in a match again.\n\nNaval combat was advertised for this game a lot, but it winded up to be a big disappointment. It's all about who has more  anti-ship missiles or CIWS. But where this game shines is the land combat. No one really plays naval on multiplayer for that exact reason.\n\nYou really don't want to play in the 10vs10 servers, because it is usually, in my experience very inconsistent. I had a thing going on for 10vs10 games, but it just winded up too many loses for my profile, often due to other players leaving too soon or after deploying their sovre without any escort to the sea and ragequitting when it gets killed by anti-ship missiles. So you really just get sick of it. So stick to the usual matches, 3vs3 etc.\n\nBut, it's positive sides really outweight the negatives.\n\nSo I really really recommend this game to any RTS fans out there, it's an very solid RTS game optimized for PC gaming.","April 10, 2015","true","635.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vauun/recommended/251060/","vauun","Vauun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vauun/","187 products in account","This. Is. A. Fantastic. Game.\n\nHOW I GOT STARTED WITH WARGAME RED DRAGON\nI am a die-hard Supreme Commander fanboy, and I was skeptical of this game. I had tried European Escalation and it really wasn't my jam, however my friend bought this for me (Thanks, Jack) and I decided I should give the series a second chance.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay mechanics are, well, great. If you play a great deal of RTS's within a small area of time like me, then controls can get confusing, but that's just boling down to if left click or right click assigns orders. Through my time playing this, I've found that unit placement is far more important than numbers. Having one Stinger standing in the treeline of a forest is far more useful than two stingers in the open. Unit placement is also key, because the enemy gets points for destroying your stuff on the most common gamemode. One problem I have always had is anti-ship missiles versus ships, as the missiles would get destroyed and then my plane would get shot down. I am not sure if the range of the AA on most ships is intentional, but I feel like I should get that out there. There is also a counter to everything, and make sure you cover every type of potential attack in your deck, which I will talk about next.\n\nDECKS\nIf you are a fan of Wargame long before Red Dragon came out, you can skip this section entirely as I want to share how decks work and how a deck with a blend of cheap/expensive units (versus all cheap / all expensive). Decks are a lot like unit designators. You design your custom deck (Or use a prebuilt one), and you have two options to start with. BLUFOR, or OPFOR. Within those choices, you have the option (But you don't have to) to pick a country within those two factions. Within THOSE choices, you can ( But you don't have to) specialize within that unit, which will restrict the use of some units, but unlock others and give you extra unlocking points towards infantry/armor/air/etc. Finally, you can restrict yourself to a time period to give you more activiation points, but you lose the avaliability of some units. I have never had to use this type of deck. Covering the blend of Cheap/Expensive units, if you have an army of crummy, cheap units, then your army will get destroyed quickly by the enemies (Presumably) superior force. If you have too many expensive units, then you will not be able to get enough units out to cover all your sides, and you will be flanked.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nThe multiplayer is fantastic. But I write that with a conditional tone. The multiplayer is some of the best you'll ever experience if you have teammates that know what they are doing and support each other. However this is only 40% of your random games. I don't have much else to say about multiplayer, except it is certainly a challenge no matter what sector you're holding down.\n\nOVERVIEW\nThe whole bloody review was an overview. Great game.\n9/10.\n\nI realize that my review was a little pieced together and guide-ish, but read some other reviews and keep mine in mind and you'll see if you'll like this game or not.","June 13, 2014","true","661.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

To compete against experienced players takes a lot of learning, as the massive selection of units, maps, and mechanics makes it an enormous task. This does not mean you can not have fun learning though! (read on..)\n\nIn skirmish modes (Against the AI) You have the option to slow down and stop (as well as speed up) time to give you more time to give orders to your units\n\nThe deck mechanic is really what adds so much to this game. You can spend many hours (I have) browsing the armoury, analysing and comparing unit stats, adding them to your deck, checking out the amazing unit models, and then getting to take them to combat! With 1450 units in the game, there is an amazing feeling with finding that an understated unit is a beautiful performer - You can get very attached to them.\n\nThe devs have really taken what was excellent about the two previous games, and then piled on more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doktorsoviet/recommended/251060/","doktorsoviet","Prime Minister Sinister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doktorsoviet/","213 products in account","Wargame: Red Dragon will certainly come off a dissapointment to most AirLand Battle players, and while it isn't terrible, there aren't many reasons I could think of to recommend this game over AirLand Battle, especially for its hefty pricetag.\n\nTo go into detail, let's look at what the game gets right. There is a huge roster expansion, with many new vehicles, factions, and maps. Sadly, most of these new units are reskins of existing ones, but this is true to life, so Eugen deserves some lee-way. The maps are massive and expansive. I am not sure if they are bigger than AirLand Battle, but it sure felt like it. Logistics is more important, as vehicles run out of fuel much quicker and the bigger maps also eat up more fuel. It is an interesting system that adds a dynamic to the game that we haven't seem previously, as going after supply vehicles will actually damage the enemy greatly.\n\nNow let us talk about where it goes wrong. Oh, there are so, so many ways this game goes wrong. First and formost is that they screwed up the deck building system. Now, when you make a deck, there are only five open unit slots, where as previous games held all 10 open for use for any deck. The problem is that the game forces you to use specialized decks, but specialization is a bad idea. What if you happen to bring a specialized deck that is vulnerable to the enemy's deck type? Well, you're screwed. The five slots prevent you from making a well-rounded deck. I get they wanted people to have incentive for using specialized decks, but this was not the way to do it. They should provide postive reinforcement for choosing to specialize, like making the bonuses for specialized decks greater (and making their unit restrictions less harsh: many units that certain specializations exclude you from don't even fit into the opposing category, meaning it just removes units for no reason), not by removing stuff that made normal decks good.\n\nBalance is all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. AirLand Battle struck a nice balance, with only the jets being a little overpowered. Now that is flipped on its head. One SAM (or Redfor equivalent) can easily pummel a jet. Sure, anti-air availability has been cut, and so has their ammo, but now planes are weak as ♥♥♥♥ and they rarely even reach their traget. They are just a good way of wasting money. Infantry is also useless. Before, putting infantry in buildings was an effective way to ensure that area of the map was basically yours, unless your enemy used specific anti-infantry vehicles to counter. Infantry are now weaker. They die quicker, and their weapons are far less effective against heavy armor. They are, however, cheap. The worst thing is artillery. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ went through Eugen's Systems combined heads when they thought of making artillery more destructive. Artillery is supposed to be a support tool used for bogging down and enemy and lowering their morale in preparation for a ground attack, but in Red Dragon they are an offensive tool that can snipe units from across the map and continuously pound just about anything (and I do mean anything) to death. Entrentched infantry? Dead meat. Top-teir armor? Be gone after 3 salvos. Even helicopters can get ruined by these things. It is such an abysmal decision and it ruins a game like this, where arguably balance is everything.\n\nThen there are navies. actual, proper ship on ship warfare can be fun, but there really isn't much to it. Whoever has more ships wins. You can spam extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low-level ships, but nothing will get through their output of fire.\n\nThese changes completely ruin this game and remove any fun from it. It is replaced with frustration, as opponents cheekily snipe you from across the map (including the all-seeing AI) with artillery, amass fleets of ♥♥♥♥ teir boats and tear through everything you have, and make the airforce a complete waste of time and money.\n\nI thought Red Dragon would be fun because of the new units and setting, but I just got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, unbalanced version of AirLand Battle that does not do justice to its predecessor. ALB is more well-rounded and balanced, and it is altogether more fun. Don't be tricked by fanboys throwing heaps of praise on this game, and don't waste your money. By ALB or EE.\n\nAs a sidenote, there is ONE group of people I can recommend this game to. RD has the easiest and most fair AI of all the Wargame titles. That doesn't mean it is easy or fair, it just means it is actually ♥♥♥♥ing beatable. So if you are mostly a singleplayer type of guy, you should probably pick this up.","July 8, 2014","false","15.9"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","2"

No. It is because players don't have time to rally around a solid game since they get clubbed in their face with new one each year.\n\nThis is how it goes:\n\nRelease of the game with many things that would make it enjoyable to play being absent -> adding those things with "free DLC"-> game is finally what it should be for actual release-> new game 4 months later (this time it will be with bases)-> most migrating to new game leaving you in a game that is to rts games what G+ is to social networks.\n\nInstead of focusing on MP part of the game (which Wargame should be solely about) and polishing it out considerably before release, they split their focus on both MP and SP thinking they will be able to pull it off but failing and ending up with rather sad product that will die out in about a year or so.\n\nSad because in its core concept is a very good game. However instead of upgrading ALB they sidegraded, upgraded non cruical parts and even downgraded on some areas. And that is not something sequel should be about.\n\nShould you buy it? If you get it on massive discoutn.","April 29, 2014","false","187.4"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","0"

The game takes place through two screens: the map screen and the battle screen. The map screen takes a form similar to that of WW2 planning boards you always see in movies, and is quite novel if not effective. The battle screen is as one might expect: a bird's eye view of the battlefield(with the option to zoom in to an incredible range) but what is interesting is not the screen but the mechanics of battle. If you've ever played almost any other RTS then you'll know ammunition is not usually a feature of those games. However in Wargame: RD you must worry about logistics, you'll need to send in supply trucks to keep your tanks armed and your Helicopters filled with missles.\n\nThe only real failing point of this game is the lack of the proper tutorial. The entire game is summarisied in text screen tutorials which do little to explain the complex mechanics of war. The RTS afficandio will quickly pick up the tools of the trade but I fear that someone not familiar to the genre might not fare as well.","October 15, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love to play this game, my friend and I play this all the time, and the DLC is free.  Games are easy to get into, you can find multiplayer games on any difficulty.\n\nCons: AI.  I have a few problems with the AI in this game. 1. Whenever I try to play the campaign, I lose, even on easy, the AI somehow has enough great tanks from 1000 points to bum rush and defend against 4 K1s.  2. Stupid stuff- My friend and I sometimes play against AI.  Whenever we get to the last zone the enemy controls, and destroy their command, the game doesn't end, which it should if you destroy their last command, and we spend 30 minutes looking for it (we don't quit because it will put a loss on your record) and we finally find it hidden in forests in the middle of the map, and even right next to out main base!  It is literally trying to find a needle in a hay stack.  3. Balancing- I played a 4v4 game (3 very hard AI and I vs 4 medium AI) and the 4 medium AI won! (I did better than all the very hard AI).  4.  Spam- I had to make my own deck for the AI to use because every time I play against AI that is using a regular deck, they buy commands and billions of attack helicopters that frustrates me to no end.\n\nOverall:  I love this game and highly recommend it.  Yeah, the AI has some problems, but multiplayer is very fun, plus, how can you beat free DLC?

Normally it isn't even noticable but if you zoom in a lot on areas that get heavily bombarded you will see problems.  This was not a problem in ALB and hopefully might get patched in the next major update.\n\nThe game is the first in the series to let you set up AI players to use your own custom-made decks, which means you can create target-practice decks or simulate historical or hypothetical engagements (well... sort of, heh).\n\nThe addition of new units really changes the gameplay mechanics, as enemy AA defenses will rely far less on easily-vulnerable radar guidance systems.  Also, although you get a few more units per card than in past titles, the maps are much larger and can really punish you for losing certain units.  These arguments are all illustrated best in the AH-64D Longbow, which is the US's endgame glass cannon capable of turning a match completely around... or being a large waste of points never to return (you get 1 or 2 per deck, period).\n\nA very fun title which is also relevant enough to get denial-of-service attacks from the North Koreans on a monthly basis.

In fact, this is my first Wargame-...erm, game, ever bought and played.\n\nBut played, I have.\n\nI'd come into Wargame originally from RUSE: another game out of the Eugen box. As for RUSE, it served as a wonderful experience for me: I've sunk in hundreds of hours into it throughout a total of about three to four years. And especially for my version being an X-Box port purchased before I really had a gaming PC, me still playing RUSE on occasion to this day helps cement how wonderful it is.\n\nSo understandably, I came into Wargame: Red Dragon with high expectations of perhaps my favorite Strategy Games studio. I'd become legitimately hyped on the trailers, and I'd always wanted to try out European Escalation or AirLand Battle.\n\nI'm not going to lie: this was a weird game to get into when it first game out. There were no in-game tutorials and no singleplayer, making the current lack of a dedicated tutorial mode (to my knowledge) a cubscout picknick in comparison. I had to teach myself how to manuever units through a private MP lobby, and that was a difficult task when I had no idea how complicated the controls in Wargame were.\n\nThere were thankfully at least a few good and decent guides out there, but for other Wargames of course: thankfully, since I purchased it, a number of Red Dragon guides have arrived both from Eugen and from the vast community of players.\n\nTo summarize getting into the game, it's difficult even today. It's a heavy difficult curb, but that's also what makes it wonderful: Red Dragon is AS REAL AS IT CAN GET, by all assumption. Playing Wargame is a legitimate way to learn a little more about how real warfare tactics, at least from the Cold War era, were like (to a limited extent, of course). Eugen put a lot of effort into making this game flow smoothly in terms of both difficulty placed on the computer and on the player's own abilities: while your computer is going along just fine with relatively impressive and immersive graphics, you're trying your damn best to keep up-to-speed in an MP game.\n\nThere's also a large amount of singplayer capability as well: the uniqueness that the deck system provides (perhaps my favorite piece of this whole game) not only allows for the common joke of players spending more time on deck/army building than on playing the game, but also allowing for players to have their own customized adventures and battles.\n\nIn addition, there are a decent number of singleplayer campaigns set during various points in the Cold War. These campaigns are decent in story and certainly immersive, and provide a really interesting challenge for the player. Of course, these aren't really the good meat of the game.\n\nAs for the multiplayer: it's really the main bit, though not required. I'd still recommend anyone buying Wargame to try out MP at least a few times per month to continually improve battlefield skill and preformance. It's honestly interesting to watch a deck go into combat, and to analyize how one could've preformed better and which parts of the deck went by the "make or break" principle.\n\nIn addition, it must be added that Eugen consistently releases free DLC. FREE DLC. THAT YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET. This includes new maps, new units, and new campaigns. How consumer-friendly is that?\n\nAs for complaints, they're predominately based around the gameplay mechanics and are mostly deck-based. For starters, I play as an American deck and understand that nations are weak in some areas based on historical weakness (E.G. North Korea having relatively poor anti-aircraft abilities in comparrison to some of its allies). However, a few instances of favoritism seem to pop up with the French: a nationality which Eugen is part of, as a French studio. For one, the French are capitalized on favoring quick and mobile strikes, though in reality their units can preform a number of tasks *extremely* well. French Infantry AT weapons are some of the best in the game towards the 90's era, French tanks are relatively powerful, French aircraft are highly potent in all areas, French helicopters are some of the fastest and most combat-effective, and so-on. France has downsides, but very few in comparison to some of its counterparts and enemies: thus, it could seen that France has been given some relative favoritism by Eugen, but I digress.\n\nIn addition, another complaint perhaps could be leveled at the lack of a very solid training mode for beginners. I know that I myself would've loved access to a dedicated training mode when I first started, and a flip-through guide isn't going to help with learning units outside of a textbook fashion.\n\n\nTo summarize....\nPros:\n-Decent Graphical Fidelity and Running Capability\n-Excellent Customization Capacity\n-Immersive, Authentic and Risk-Taking Gameplay\n-Decently-Captivating Campaign\n-Free DLC\n\nCons:\n-Eurocentric Favoritism, potentially\n-Lack of Newbie Integration and Tutorials\n\nIn short: a highly-recommended game.\n","November 12, 2014","true","052.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only RTS games I have played are the earlier AoE games, 1, 2 and a little bit of Mythology; so my review of this RTS game may not be framed in ways similar to others who may have considerably more RTS gaming experience. I also have really only played the Destruction multiplayer game mode and tend to only play with friends or play solo.\n\nWargame: Red Dragon is a fast paced RTS set during the Cold War. Players control individual units that they deploy from a pre-selected group of units called a 'Deck' that they can build (or share with friends!) based on nations belonging to NATO or the Warsaw Pact.\n\nW:RD takes out the boring aspect of resource collection and keeps the action fast and intense; It is not easy to learn and very hard to master. After 144 hours I still have yet to beat the first campaign. (My perfectionist habits have something to do with that, but only a little bit).\n\nPros:\n- Obvious learning curve (only a pro if you're into that sort of thing. I am).\n- Intense, fast paced action.\n- A lot of units and nations to choose from. Deck building actually got me interested in other nation's military hardware/history.\n- Multiplayer is great with friends; ignore the overall community in the global chat. Frankly just turn that off.\n- The AI on higher difficulties punishes you for stupid strategies.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of tutorial content. (Lots of good stuff on YouTube if you don't have any friends to help you learn).\n- Maps start to feel a tad boring/same with how many there are. This game could benefit from a lot more maps.\n- Without your own server you can't host games larger than 4v4. (This game supports 10v10)\n- Lack of simplified mod support. There are mods, but the support for them could be more streamlined for creators and users.\n\nNotes: I'm sure a lot of people may talk about 'balance' and such but I have yet to fully experience the full potential of this game and different potential strategies so I cannot rightly speak about balance yet.\n\nFavorite deck style: West Germany Mechanized.\n\nThis is a definite buy for me. Full price. Even better if you can get it on sale or in a huge Steam sale Wargame pack deal and get the older games, too. See how the series has changed between releases.","March 28","true","170.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XXDahlXX/recommended/251060/","XXDahlXX","XXDahlXX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XXDahlXX/","50 products in account","This is quite possibly my favorite game of all-time. The game is an RTS in the same sense as the latest C&C4 (No real Base-building) Except it doesn't arbitrarily limit the number of units you can have. Maps are gigantic, battles are huge, and there are some aspects of it that everyone just loves. That being said, there are a few limitations that might drive some away. I'll address them below.\n\nGood:\n-Battles are gigantic\n-Amazing variety of Units\n-Free DLC\n-Large Map Replayability\n-Wide variety of countries available\n-Land, Air, and Sea combat\n-Immense experimentation possible\n-Challenging Campaigns\n-Multiplayer battles (TO THE MAX)\n\nBad:\n-Sea is kind of half-baked and does not work realistically\n-Otomatic was never sold to Denmark (Hehe)\n-NO GOOD TUTORIAL!!!!\nI know a lot of people complain about this one, but to be honest there's really nothing there! The in-game tutorial explains what each value means, but it never really explains how to play the game well. Many people just come in without any knowledge whatsoever and pick units arbitrarily. It requires some pretty intensive effort from experienced players (Like myself) to actually help these new guys and give them a hand. There are plenty of resources available for them on steam, but it's not always obvious where to find these.\n-Planes are unrealistic as well\n-SPAAG ground range is arbitrarily set at 1050m (Except for otomatic which is 2100, down from 2275)\n-Tank Range maxxes out at 2275M (for no real reason)\n-Ships don't fire KE/AP Rounds!!! (like they do IRL!)\n\nOverall, I absolutely adore this game. The dings I gave it above are things most regular players won't care about or really notice. If you like RTS, you couldn't go wrong with purchasing this game and having a blast. Please read the tutorials after you do, and check out a guide or two! If you're still confused, ask someone like me who knows how to play the game well for advice! We're happy to train you new guys!\n\n","April 5, 2015","true","712.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Best played with friends of a similar skill level to have a fun experience.\n\nThis is the first RTS game I've got properly in to and after an initial (and considerable) learning curve I'm really struck by how solidly made and deep this game is. There is quite a high barrier to entry here and you will be frustrated at first by tactics or units you are unfamiliar with.\n\nIf you are new to RTS games or even the Wargame series I'd recommend playing against friends at first - as the difficulty ceiling is so high, you'd be spending hundreds of hours to become competitive with other players who already have a good understanding of the game. Unfortunately the AI appears not to be able to fight you in the same way a player would and this becomes more and more apparent whilst playing against real opponents.\n\nI had no technical issues with this game at all and the it runs remarkably well considering the graphical detail on screen.\n\nIf you are a long time RTS player or new to the genre all together there is enough depth here to keep you hooked for a long time.","January 5, 2015","true","38.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avagantamos/recommended/251060/","Avagantamos","Vindicator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avagantamos/","82 products in account","A truly fantastic RTS, this game really should go up on the shelf alongside Command and Conquer, World and Conflict, and all of the other classic Real Time Strategy games out there. Wargame: Red Dragon is the refreshing 2014 installment and sequel to the 2013 Wargame: Airland Battle. Red Dragon is the third installment in the series and provides new features and choices for gameplay while retaining the best features of the Wargame: ALB. This time the Cold War moves from it's Theater of War in Northern Europe to the Pacific and Eastern Asia. Fans of the previous Wargames franchise as well as players new to the series will be really delited with this latest sequel as developer Eugen Systems debuts it's 2014 installment in the Wargames series. Oh Yeah, did I mention they added Naval Combat?!\n\nSingleplayer:\nFor those of you who have played Wargames before, whetehr it be Wargame: European Escalation or Wargame: Airland Battle, you will know that the plot line for the franchise is set in a ficticious alternate historical timeline set in the late 1970's and well into the 1980's. Wargame: Red Dragon features four new campaign plot lines set during the cold war in Asia; each is set in a different time with a different faction. The reason there are four different campaigns is because of the fact that each campaign goes along with a difficulty setting: command the South Korean military forces in order to repel an overwhelming North Korean invasion force on Easy Difficulty. Try reigniting the Sino-Soviet border conflict as the Chinese on Medium Difficulty. Repel an immense offensive by the PLA of China in an attempt to reclaim Hong Kong as the British on Hard Difficulty. And for the finale, lead a conquest of the Japanese mainland before the American forces can arrive in order to support their comrades in distress as the Soviet Union on Very Hard difficulty. So, with all of these different campaigns the player is given more choice in how they go about tackling a situation then in most RTS campaigns which I found to be really enjoyable since the game conforms to your playing style. I think that the developers of this game did a great job in not just the way the game plays but also in the storyline in order to make it as realistic as possible but still balanced enough to fight a fair war. Choosing the late Cold War as a time to set an RTS is really interesting because weaponry and warfare are still balanced at this point between either the PACT faction or the allied NATO forces. The context of the setting takes place before the information era so weapons systems haven't quite yet reach a point a point where a drone strike can whipe out a unit of hostil forces with the push of a button from all the other side of the globe. This games storyline and multiplayer provides two different ideologically parted empires waging violent and destructive skirmishes across the globe. While Wargame: Red Dragon's campaign is a fantastic embodiement of these features and incorporating them into it's storyline, the only thing that bugged me a bit was how in the singleplayer storyline the conflicts didn't seem to have much connection to each other and should have been drawnout longer.\n\nMultiplayer:\nWhile the Wargame series is infamous for it's setting during the Cold War, the embodiement of these factors is better brought out through the multiplayer experience. Set on a number of maps throughout Asia (I presume) the multiplayer element feels the same and doesn't stray too much from Wargame: ALB with the exception of new Asia based factions and units added to the game. In terms of map diversity however, the game does feel a bit different in the details. The more traditional maps of the first two Wargame installments were set in European countryside towns with some Urban presence including buildings for infantry to duke it out in, but usually it would be forests and farms. Wargame: Red Dragon's maps are different both visually and aesthetically. Since the addition of naval warfare to the series, the maps in Wargame generally revolve around coastal areas with dense jungle and plots of rice farms. The forests have now generally been replaced by jungle. One of the latest items of the maps for this game I was excited about was the introduction of denser maps which means more urban areas and denser jungles which really allowed for the tank battles to take place further away then the infantry battles. The overall experience of Wargame multiplayer feels like it's gotten a refreshing new update and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good pop-in and pop-out RTS.\n","July 24, 2014","true","69.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Is NATO overpowered ? I would say yes, but is Pact just going to be like meat on the chopboard? That's 100% no. Yes NATO has its advantage, but it's not like PACT is rubbish. Sure, it matters who's got the biggest stick, but it matters a helluva lot more who's swinging it. PACT also has it's advantage, and if you use it well, and can lead you to victory. So stop complying about how weak you are and instead figure out hwo to play it well, 90% times I win by NATO is because PACT players are just, well, how do I put it, very interesting....\nSo anyway, wargame red dragon does a greaat job on simulating morden combat, one peoblem about the game is that the terrain texture, if you get a little bit closer I ensure you will shout what the **** is that, dude, fix that place, waht ever that is, that is clearly not ground.\nWargame red dragon is a good game, not great, but I will say that it worthes 40 dollars. I like the game and I had quite good times playing it, If you like RTS, and if you like games such as HOI and Aarma, that wargame red dragon is your choice.","May 24, 2014","true","320.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

People blob tanks, airplanes, infantry, AA... why would they think they wouldn't blob naval?\n\nThe only real way this could happen is if boats had a larger collision radius, and could not physically be blobbed, forcing distance between them.\n\nThis version of the game without naval is superior to Airland battle.

"Tacked on" is too much of a compliment actually, none of the ships, from landing craft to destroyers make a sound. They glide silently, clipping through the ugly water textures, no noise, no waves, no voices or alarms or hundreds of men visible on these ships. They have the same firing and movement mechanics as the tanks, and can often be ignored entirely in the matches.\n\nThe single player is nothing to write home about, the campaign is a little more rushed than AirLand Battle, and attempts to add a bit of a narrative, but other than a nice intro for each, the writing is non existant. The gameplay is frustrating, with certain campaigns (Pearl of the Orient, Busan Pocket) forcing you to play the exact same battle 20-30 times.\n\nMultiplayer has devolved into experienced players filling up the NATO/BLUFOR side and waiting for a team of newbies to crush, quitting is endemic amongst foes and team mates alike and half the nations haven't had a timeframe update like France, W-Germany and the Commonwealth.\n\nThis game seems like a beta, give it a miss til it's actually finished.","July 2, 2014","false","93.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Has a high learning curve so don't expect any handholding.\nPROS:\n\n+ No Unit Limits. (I've had upwards of over 300 units on the field at one time this includes tanks/infantry/vehicles/helicopters, and jets not counting my allies or enemies units.)\n\n+ Thousands of Different Units. (Though some are kind of reskins each unit has their own special role on the battle field.)\n\n+ VERY Strategic. (Should I postion my infantry in the nearby town and have them take cover in the buildings below or just march a few thousand infantry in forest cover over that mountain and risk getting napalm bombed if spotted by a recon unit.........meh I'll just fire a few hundred artillary rounds at their base camp and try to get lucky.)\n\n+ Cinimatic AND Functional. (Not often does a game manage to create so many cinimatic moments yet be fully about a functional playing experience)\n\n+ Polished Land Combat. (Land combat is pretty much perfect in this game more on water combat later.)\n\n+ Resource Management. (Your Frontline Base(FOB) comes with a set supply number. Pay close attention as this will be your life blood. Your resoures are split into 3 categories Ammo, Fuel, and Spare Parts. Managing to supply units far off will prove to be rather challenging but all the more fun. You have a limited number of units that can deliever supplies with their own varying strengths and weaknesses. Supply ships can be sunk, Cargo Caravans can be stolen/blown to hell, and supply choppers can be shot down so be careful with them in high conflict areas as they will be high priority targets for the enemy.)\n\n+ Multiplayer. (Yay for some Nay for others more on that later)\n\n+ Lots of Factions. (From Nato, to North Korea, to Russia and many more)\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Water Units/Combat Sucks. (Red Dragon introduced water units into the Wargame franchise and it really shows. What lies before you is a lackluster experience. Water combat is clunky, ship pathing is wonky and besides the many other obscure reasons I'd rather fight a donkey. Ok lame jokes aside the new water units mainly ships with the occasional sea helicopter or jet are sorely under utilized as most players have just given up on water units and maps altogether because of said problems. Not to mention maps that have a heavy water and land mix screw over infantry that ride in vehicles as they can not travel across water and there are no ships that can ferry them across. The only way to get infantry around on a water/land map is if they're helicopter troops. Eugene has something going here but it really needs more work put into it.)\n\n- Multiplayer. (1. If you expect to enjoy that glorious 10x10 multiplayer action BEWARE! As the game will kick you if your internet speeds are too slow. Honestly I've never played a multi match until the end because my internet speed  is such garbage. Thankfully the game has a great single player skirmish mode with a very competent AI where most players spend their time.  If you have pretty decent speeds this shouldn't be a problem though. 2. Because of said problems and a few other's finding a multi match may be a bit hard and even if you do the game will kick players for speeds or some may just leave for reasons causing you to be put in a situation where it's almost impossible to win a match.)\n\n- No Resupplying of FOBs. (Ok some people are gonna say that's what's so good about the game or that I'm a noob and using too much or I'm not playing strategically or I should have just built more before the start of the game. While that may all be true at times it shouldn't be used as an excuse to cover up such a glaring fault. If this game sales itself as a realistic strategy I don't know how they justify real world bases actually getting supplied but not here. Though you can increase the amount of supplies a FOB has in a txt file in the directory, an ingame feature where you order a resupply for limited amount should have been added.)\n\n- NO NEW MAPS! (There's been a lot of reasons given why Eugene hasn't added new maps such as they had to take time from the development to fix bugs and exploits instead . But now they're working on their new game AOA which is taking up all their manpower. What has constantly been requested is a Map Editor or some sort of tools where we the community can make our own maps. The excuses for this not being a thing have been varying and confusing from Eugene not owning the engine the game is made with too maps being too complicated for tools to recreate or something along those lines. Really we have the original maps but having something new to play on would be GREAT at this point)\n\n- No Modding Support. (Sure there are a few mods here and there but they're almost unheard of. Some people who have played the game for a long time still don't know their are mods and that mods could even be made for this game. So far there are a fair bit of skins and a few other mods like sandbox but nothing MAJOR grandbreaking like you know.......NEW ♥♥♥♥ING MAPS!!! When Eugene returns to the series they need to seriously think about making the franchise moddable)\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: The game looks good, plays good on land, has ALOT of stuff and resource management but water stuff sucks, multiplayer is jacked for most, NO NEW MAPS and no mod support.\n\n\nFinal Rating: 7.5/10  Updated Rating(5/4/2016): 8.5/10\nGreat game but lacks in other areas luckly most of them are non-important. A must buy on sale and a must have for any RTS fan.\n\nUPDATE 5/4/2016: I was planning on doing this update to the review MONTHS ago but kept getting side tracked. Anyway the devs have not let us down and updated the game with all new maps FOR FREE! No dlc or microtransactions bull just free updates with new maps. And these were maps of our choosing as well since we had a community vote on it. The maps added new longevity to the game. Now here's hoping Wargame 4 is even better.

This game is a blast and as my hours show, my favorite game of all time. The unit choices are amazing, but keep in mind alot of those units you will never touch as they are outdated or useless, still it is quite amazing the level of choice you have. The game is quite simple, you build a deck thats unit choice is determined by its country, coalition (more than 1 nation) and so on. You fill these decks up with various units and play. The campaign is decent apparently, I have never touched it but it is worth playing for new players to get used to the mechanics. The learning curve is quite steep, but is completly worth it in the end. The community, while sometimes cancerous, has an excelent community initiative called the Wargame Learning Program that offers 1 on 1 personal tutoring that is completly free and incredibly helpful. People are more than happy to show you the ropes as the community is quite small and new players (who try ) are very much appreciated. I personally believe that playing with friends is mandatory and makes the experience far better. Since the game is often on sale, I reccomend palying with your mates. Finally, dont get this game for the naval combat, it is a silly gimick and has been completly abandoned by the devs. Ships still lack sounds and it is quite unblanaced. Also FRENCH BIAS IS REAL.

It just add some new units and Ship into the game include Naval map for Naval battle. Gameplay still the same as other Wargame Series. So this disappointed me because it cost  30$ to play few Naval map, Naval battle and boring campaign. From this point i can't say its not good at all but its not worth your money on this price if you already own Air Land Battle. When i said gameplay not change thats mean it still hard for new player, you need a lot of time to learn and enjoyable this game. If you are someone who looking for really strategy game that require plans and tactics (Micro a lot of units as well), this game is for you. But as i said before its still not worth you money if you already own AIr Land Battle. It's your money, It's your decision this just my opinion. Not recommend for who already own Air Land Battle except you can buy it in half of current game's price.

This has almost none of that, its all about clicking speed with the mouse - it's more like 10 to 15  % planning and 85 % clicking on the map like a idiot.  I have played hardcore RTS (modded) games that revolve around realism and other realistic game genre such as operation flashpoint and ARMA series.\n\nFrom graphics to concept and gameplay everything has alot of potential and alot of it is well executed.  However interface and command options are abysmal and poorly executed, tutorial is completely lacking, the shortcuts are not intuitive. the interface and command options of the game '' AI war'' are thousands light years ahead of this game.\n\nWhat it comes down to is either capturing zones on the map or blocking the routes to that zones.\n\nThis game revolves around micromanagement and speed of clicking, getting the right unit type to the right spot on the map at the right time. Everything about planning is thrown out the window in favor of poorly executed micromanagement and clicking speed.\n\nOne of the worst interfaces and deployment/planning sequences of all the RTS i''ve seen. Basically you are put in the role of the general but without any shortcuts, interface options or planning details in order to execute a plan - you are on the field without the options a real general would have. You cannot draw on maps, pre plan orders for units before the game starts and compose battle groups before the game starts.\n\nThe singleplay is the worst i have seen since 1998\n\nSorry but this game is highly overrated, its micromanagent all the way and has little to do with real strategy, tactics or planning. Unit balance is really bad and the Stats of units do not correlate to gameplay , the range of some weapons are ridiciously low and some units are just vastly superior. Also some eastern  units and real life tank types are missing.\n\nThe Dutch nation DLC is ridilious and should be free , almost every conflict country is available but you are being punsished for being dutch. The dutch have been in every theatre of conflict since the 1st word war. Also most of the dutch units are just units that are available for other nations.\n\nWhen it comes to realism, interface and command i give this game a 4/10 , which is really poor\n\nWhen it comes to just casual RTS like games i give this game a 8/10, which is good\n\nIf you like clicking around the map like a maniac get this game. Harcore realism has to do with intelligence , the ability to plan ahead and delegate everything in a proper way but also to be flexible when you have to change a mission template. This game has almost none of that and feeble minded players could easily rush you with  extreme clicking/micromanagement speed.\n\nIf you expect real life realism don't even bother, it feels like a unpolished RTS version of ARMA 2 but and without al the options. Sorry but this game is not realistic.","May 25","false","80.2"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","6"

Naval matches do need some work, they typically devolve into numbers based slugfests.  Additionally naval units lack some commands that would make them more effective.  This game uses a class system ie. armored, marine, support) with each class having unique units that aren't available to other classes.  In order to be at its best, teams need a blend of classes.  In addition to being able to play as nations, you can also play as coalitions.  For example, you can play as england, ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand), and Canada, or you can play as the Commonwealth that has units form all three.

It differs from the first two in that the battles and campaigns take place in Asia, mostly the Korean peninsula, instead of Central and Western Europe. It also differs from the first two in that naval combat is present in this game, but more on that below. Now onto the review.\n\nGraphics and Sound\nThis is first thing most people see when watching the trailer. They don't dissapoint. All three games in the series have amazing graphics, and Red Dragon is no exception. Watch in amazement as dozens of rockets, shells, and rounds pound the enemy and the ground. Craters are left, forest burned down, and entire neighbourhoods destroyed as you fight for control of the strategic sectors scattered around the map. Sounds are also well done. Not only will you see that 500 pound bomb hit the ground, you'll hear it loud and clear. Some explosions can even be heared clear across the map!\n\nCampaigns and Skirmish Mode\nSingleplayer consists of two game modes: campaigns and skirmish mode. Skirmish mode has stayed the same from the previous games. Not much to say about it, pick your army deck, your enemy, and your map and fight it out. The campaigns are where things have changed. There are currently five campaigns:  Busan Pocket, Bear vs. Dragon, Pearl of the Orient, Climb Mount Narodnaia, and 2nd Korean War(DLC). So far I've tired Bear vs. Dragon and Pearl of the Orient, which are pretty challenging. I've more or less played through Busan Pocket and 2nd Korean War, each of which play well and are pretty balanced.\n\nThe main addition to the campaigns is the seperation of units. Unlike Wargame: AirLand Battle where each division had reccon units, tanks, planes, ect., Red Dragon seperates units into armored divisions, infantry divisions and squadrons. I found this an interesting addition, and I think it adds to the game. You'll now have to decide who gets air support, who gets armored units and even who gets proper supply lines. There are drawbacks however. I noticed that there are little or no random events and the strategic options such as commando raids and air reccon arn't present either. While they didn't really affect the campaign overall, I did miss the air reccon.\n\nNaval Battles and Gameplay\nFor my last trick, I'll talk about the long awaited naval battles! From what I gathered, these were a long awaited addition to the game. Let me just say that if your buying this on account of the naval battles, don't. To be honest, they're harder than the ground battles, and not really in a fun way. If you play as NATO, you'll find yourself massing your fleet of two destroyers and seven PT boats together to avoid the rain of anti-ship missels being thrown at you by the Soviet-Chinease fleet, which is made up of one or two large destroyers, and dozens of light ships. I suppose it could just be me(I didn't really try to conquer the sectors to get more points), but it feels unbalanced. It also felt unrealistic because the larger ships can't fire over obstacles or even very far. If your like me, and your playing this more for the land battles, then you'll enjoy it. The navel aspect means some vehicles can cross rivers, and the PT boats are fun to use on the smaller rivers. Reinforcements can also come by sea in landing craft.\n\nOne thing I did notice from all this is the AI has been downgraded a bit from AirLand Battle. I find that the AI is constantly massing units together and rushing me. This usually ends in 90% of the AI's army being destroyed at bridges or other choke points. It did ambush me a few times when I was on the offensive, but overall it seems dumber. Another slightly annoying thing is that when your making custom decks, your now limmited to a certain amount of transports. So if I want to build an airborne army consisting of Huey helicopters, I can only select five units before I have use a different helicopter. Again, It's not a game breaker, but it is a little annoying. I suppose it does challenge you, though, as you'll have to decide who will get the best transports.\n\nSo overall, here's what I see:\n\nPros:\nExcellent graphics\nGreat Sounds\nGood campaigns\nLots of new units and new nations\nF-86 Sabres with rocket pods!\nNew naval combat units for you to rule the coastal maps with\n\nCons\nNew naval battles a little out of wack\nAI seems a little dumber\nDeck building a little more complicated\nNo random events or strategic options\n\nOverall, I've really enjoyed this game, and despite it's few problems, I still reccomend it. It's a good addition to the series and it is a lot of fun. If your on the fence, or still want it for the naval combat, then I'd wait untill it's on sale.","December 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is like a birds eye ARMA 2 from 1000m in the air while you are controlling thousands of units. Infantry charges can end with men dying in piles with their bones turned to splinters, armour can shatter defences or get stuck in the mud and become targets for Anti-Armour, You can combine Armour, Moterised Infantry and bombers into critical daring assaults and defences, nothing is more satisfying than seeing a well thought tactical plan fall into place. Artillery can turn cities and forests into smoldering ruins. Use special chemical weapons such as napalm and cruse missiles cause utter destruction as two superpowers destroy eachother and the world too! Use navy too support your troops, do naval assaults of their own or have crucial sea battles, as navy adds millions of new tactical options. The days of cavalry charges are over, Imagine huge fleets of hundreds of helicopters engaged with infantry whilst armour punches through defenses and cruise missiles are tearing the earth under their feet whilst fire and blood scourges the earth and bombers fly overhead wasting anything that ♥♥♥♥ing moves, at any price this game is definately worth a buy...","October 1, 2014","true","102.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of people will disagree with me, and say that the 2nd; Air Land Battle was the best. However, this one here adds a completely new realm to the series; naval combat. I've played the second, and to this, this is much better. Not because of naval combat, but "stuff".\n\nThe Red Dragon version is just into "stuff". You load up the game in some sort of military command room lit with ominous red lights and given 16,000 units to chose from. Yes. Sixteen thousand! Now, a lot of the units are just different units with different weapons, but I'd say 75% of them are completely modeled, textured, for their roll. Now, the issue I had when I loaded this up was to understand the difference between a "USA Marine Stinger" and a "USA Marine Igla" was. The two weapons are anti-air, have the same strength and so on. And you'll realize how confusing it is when you are juggling tons of units.\n\nThe game play is completely different to all other RTS. You really need to coordinate with your team. Tell them to flank here or there, smoke a certain position to cover retreating units, send recon helicopters behind enemy lines near a mountain top and spot what ever they're doing. Don't expect to walk into a game and win. You'll either lose the ones you play, or just be carried by some amazing commander.\n\nThe Campaign is lack luster. Not amazing. It's good for starting out, mainly for practice. But I would rather do skirmish battles. They're a little more fun, and you have more freedom. There isn't even a story so to speek.\n\nWould I reccomend this? Yes. It's a great game. I don't have much hours because I don't really have someone I can trust in a battle to protect me from getting flanked. And that's an issue you'll run into. Many unskilled players. So you either learn quickly, or dominate the other team.\n\nI'd get this if you want a change to most generic military RTS's out there. Just get ready for the incredable learning curve this game offers.\n","December 23, 2014","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With about 150 hours of playing, I still don't have a firm grip of the intricate parts of the gameplays and mechanics. Though Wargame: Red Dragon is an impressive game overall, it is difficult for the new players to become the part of the active community due to its time consuming learning curve.\n\nThis is the first Wargame franchise I have played and I found lack of guidance in early experience of the game. It is necessary for the new player to spend hours on solo campaign/skirmish without much guidance to try and feel the every bits of the game. Also the overwhelming amounts of information in deck building/armory panel did not help in simplifying the experience.\n\nAs for the playing experience, Wargame: Red Dragon has many immersive battlefield system such as terrain, morale, logistics, garrisons, flying altitude, stealth/reconaissance that will keep you well occupied through the match. Each engagement requires careful examination and preparational positioning and only then, will you can gain the upperhand advantage.\n\nIf Eugen gives more friendly guidance for newcomers, I know many more players will be hooked on Wargame: Red Dragon rather than 'veteran players' from previeous franchises dominating the community. As of now, in my opinion, Wargame: Red Dragon is mostly dependent on its hardcore fan base to keep it a relevant community.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 12, 2014","true","642.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't understand it, and thought it would explain itself as I played the campaign...  Little help did that do...  I then started playing skrimish matches, trying to understand this game.  Later did I find out what the deck really was, then as I played more and more and experimented with more and more the more I began to understand this game.\n\nNow that I know the weapon types, skill, level, and tactics to use, I know quite a bit about this game now...  now no I'm still not a stratigic Master, however the more and more I play with others and find their strategies, the more and more I begin to know.  Now I still consider myself a noob at this game, but the more I understand it, the more I find out about how to do things...\n\nSo about the game, let me tell it to you like this... It is kind of like chess, however the peices have already been set up by you and your opponent, and another thing... you don't know where they set theirs up at and they don't know where you set yours, now,  once you find the peice and thing you want to make a capture with your peice that is already in position... you have to consider if there are other peices out there they can use to take your peice you just used, or if you have peices that you think they can't see in position ready to help that peice once captured...  So take it like a mix of chess and battleship...  you don't know where they are, but when you find them how will they react to your attack, or defence\n\nI give this game a 7/10 and recommend it to anyone who likes real time strategy on the battlefield that you can control a bunch opf units at one time.","September 20, 2014","true","399.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The thriving community and chat alone contribute so much to this game and make it even better than similar games. When I first started I sucked, and you will probably also suck to begin with. I mean I doubt you will memorize all 1400 units before playing your first multiplayer match, if you do then you are awesome. But my first few matches were fun and they still are now that i am no longer a novice. Even though I lost I still had fun, and you know a game is doing somthing right when even losing is fun. This game has tremendous replay potental in the Multiplayer though the campaign doesn't have the best AI. No two games will ever have be the same because of unit diversity. I reccomend reading Sandy Gunfoxes 200 page guide here on steam or in google docs if you are new to the seris to help familiarize you with the basics and unlearn conventional RTS strategies and adopt real world tactics which this game relies on. This game is amazing, and if you get bored of the game (which I doubt will happen anytime soon) you can sit in chat and talk about all sorts of things from the F-35 fighter jet to the Syrian crisis with the community. This game should be owned by anyone who loves military strategy and/or history. 10/10","August 11, 2014","true","496.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is because it is not simply about who has the most of best rated units. It comes down to who uses their deck to the fullest extent. For example in Total War games (one of my favorite RTS) you usually end up with a zerg fight at the end of the battle and huge cluster ♥♥♥♥ of units going at it.\n\nYou could have the best tanks in the game and ♥♥♥♥ up and walk into a city with infratry waiting to amubush you and lose all your units.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tun4f15h2/recommended/251060/","tun4f15h2","Noodle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tun4f15h2/","213 products in account","First, let me explain why I think that this is a good game and why I'm giving it a negative review. If you want a TLDR, scroll down to the bottom.\n\nThat being said, let me start the review by saying some positive things to it.\n\nIf you like the gameplay of RTS', then you will absolutely love this game. This is an extremely complex RTS with tons of theorycrafting, designing, building, and playing. It's a very refreshing take on the RTS genre because of how dynamic and versatile the builds of other decks in the game are. (For those of you who haven't played, 'building decks' is basically drafting units into a faction which you can then save and choose from.) You never see the same deck being used twice, and that gives it such a nice twist from other traditional RTS'. You can party up and take place in either small scale, or massive games, with a maximum size of 10v10 (i think). You can spend hours just going over one unit and coming up with all of the viable possibilites for it, which makes this game very cerebral in addition to its other qualities. The 1-1 scale may make it seem daunting at first, but over time you'll find that the interface is actually very streamline, which allows for fast pace gameplay on a massive scale. Overall, this game is probably the most unique and charming RTS I have ever played.\n\nHowever, this is not without its merits.\n\nLet me tell you a story about my experience I had online recently, which reminded me to write a review for this game because of its online community. Oh yes indeed, the community for this game is absolutely toxic. But first let me tell you an experience that I had online.\n\nMy friends and I, a party of 4, wanted to go online and play together in a match. I will be the first one to mention that we don't play competatively because compared to other players online, I'm not particularly good. We found a 4v4 lobby with only one person in it. We joined up on the other team. After a little while, one player joined the host's team. After maybe 5 or 10 seconds, the host kicked him from the match. "Huh, that was weird." I thought to myself. Maybe the host didn't like that player, or maybe that player did something bad.\n\nAfter 20 or 30 seconds, a different player connected to his team, and the same thing happened. Another kick. Something weird was going on, so I asked the host why he was kicking these players. And this is what he responded with.\n\n"I'm not playing with people who suck because I don't feel like losing"\n\nThis continued on for about 3 or 4 minutes, until one of my friends who was more experienced with the game, saw that the host was kicking players on his team that didn't have a win% above 50%. I told him that he can't kick players based on their win % because it's wrong. He ignored us. My friends and myself had already spent a good amount of time looking for a 4v4 match, so we decided to stay, even though the host was intentionally stacking his team with players based on their win %.\n\nAfter we lost, the host then proceeded to harass us by saying things along the lines of "talk smack get rekt" and "you got a big mouth, its almost big enough for my d*ck". The only "smack" we "talked" was us trying to convince him that it's wrong to kick players from a casual match based on their statistics, and that he shouldn't be surprised if he wins because he's given himself an advantage over us by drafting better random players. That was the end of the match.\n\nThis was only one of the many examples of various online matches where my team, or the enemy team, has been without honor or integrity, and has somehow affected the overall gameplay of the match.\n\nI understand that in this community, some people believe that this sort of behaivor is okay, but I am part of the very small percentage that believes it isn't.\n\nIn addition to that experience, there is no real way to report players that do this sort of thing, because it's not breaking any rules, it's just gross. Even if it was against the rules, there's no report system to this game. There's no matchmaking system that matches you against players with similar or equal skill to you. As far as who you play against or with goes, it's "anything goes".\n\nIn my experience, out of all of the online games I've played, including moba's like LoL, Smite, Dota 2, and WoW, all of which have terrible game communities, this is the single worst community I have ever encountered.\n\nThat being said, there are good players in the community who have great win ratings, and don't mind playing with people like me. These good players also don't smack talk, and also find that each game is an opportunity to learn more. These players are worth finding and playing with, but again, this is only a very small % of players.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking.\n"Just because the community to a game is bad doesn't mean it isn't worth playing"\n\nI agree. But this game doesn't have a great single player, which means that the majority of the gameplay that you will want to experience will be online, where you will inevitably interact with other players of this community, and almost all of them will be toxic.\n\nIf you buy this game, I strongly suggest that you go into the multiplayer with an open mind, that you will eventually encounter people that will make you want to throw your computer out of your window. But if you overcome the matches that you play with people like this, you will eventually run into someone that will want to help people with open minds, and help people who are patient and willing to learn, and when you do run into someone like this, it's like winning the lottery. I lucked out because my friends that play this game are like this, and I've been learning a lot from them. I'm still not as good as I'd like to be, but I'm learning how to play this game on terms that I can agree with, and not on the terms set by the ridiculously negative community.\n\nIf you do play this game with an open mind, and if you decide to take part in the small % of players who are positive, open minded, willing to learn, and willing to lose, you will learn much more about this game much quicker, and you will learn more about yourself along the way.\n\nTLDR: This game is probably the best RTS you will play, it just has a sh*t online community. Be ready for frustrating matches, but you will find players who are positive and will want to help you.\n","March 22, 2015","true","336.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoy Real TIme Strategy games, then this will be perfect for. This game features hundreds of units to choose from and play as. You can choose which type of person you want to be in the game as well. You can be the artillery man of the battle, the spearhead of the operation with your tanks, control the seas with the ships, or have complete air superiority with your planes. The only complaint I have with this game is that there is not a huge emphasis on ships as advertised.\n\nI give this game an 8/10 and I highly recommend you play it if you enjoy RTS games.","October 26, 2014","true","644.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a little time and breaking the mold of normal rts games.\n\nNormal rts strategy games. Get the most powerful unit(s) and spam to win right?\nNot so much with this game. There are over 1500 different units in this game, ranging from infantry, APC's, trucks, supply trucks, tanks, mobile tank hunters, atgm's, helicopters, mobile sam rocket launchers, airplanes, boats, artillery and more. Every unit has a very specific function, whether it is dedicated anti air, or robust like infantry. There is a lot to learn about this game, but the community is helpful to new players learning, and everyone is always ready for a new challenge.\nGoing back to earlier, spam to win. That doesn't work in this game because you need to balance quality with quantity. You normally have to defend many zones, and if you have your best troops in the center (and hoping they dont die) you have nothing to defend against the 30 squads of rangers creeping through the forest, or many you spent your points more wisely, and you have your own militias to counter, but they have better troops. You need to balance your troops and with a little luck, you may survive the charge.","October 10, 2014","true","299.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
