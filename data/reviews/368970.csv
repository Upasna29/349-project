It's a very fun, yet hard game! If you were a fan of Alterd Space you will love it. I haven't experianced any bugs to speak of yet aside from maybe the enemy robots getting stuck in doorways for extended periods of time...almost always doors you have to go through. Other than that, I'm enjoying the game... for a one man shop, he put together a great retro style game that is challenging and fun. I recommended it!","September 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The quirky atmosphere is definately amusing and the puzzles require a bit of thought.  As I'm not that good at the old isometric platformers I haven't gotten that far in it yet, but it's definately worth the experience.","September 28, 2015","true","6.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Coli","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993331366/","287 products in account","This is a fun game with a very strong nostalgic feel. The robots are very cute and the story elements presented through visuals with limited dialogue reminds me in some ways of Wall-E. However, don't expect an easy game to go along with the cutesy graphics. This is one of the hardest games I've played in a long time. Perfecting the jumps, remembering the layout of the space station, and juggling the correct items is a pretty serious work out for both your coordination and your memory.\n\nThe description gives you a pretty no BS account of what the game is. If you want an isometric platformer in the classic style with a lot of challenging elements, then I would say that this is a really good choice. If you're not looking for a challenge, don't like the style, or the perspective; then this is definitely not the game for you.\n\nTL:DR  There is no easy mode. The game is a really challenging isometric platformer about cute robots. If you like that you'll probably love it. If not you'll cry about it after an hour and leave an unfair negative review, because the game, which is exactly what the description states, wasn't easy enough for you.","October 2, 2015","true","28.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Don't become enamoured too quickly, those walking tin cans won't blink while redecorating the walls with your electronic innards. What you really have to watch out for are the trecahrous gaps that need to be leaped over though. Haywire on Fuel Station Zeta is a classical, tough-as-nails puzzle platformer.\n\nThe characters and environments have a smooth, cute look throughout and the same can be said for the animations and accompanying sound effects. Just watch your robot squeeking along with every tiny step and you'll get the idea :)\nFor some reason I can't help but be reminded of stop motion animations and feel very nostalgic while playing Haywire.\n\nAs alluded to earlier, the challenge is steep here, particularly those jumps. For example, some require a box to be dropped and jumped off mid-air, others require perfectly timed changes of direction mid-leap and many are of the "barely reachable" type you'll remember attempting over and over in older platformer games.\n\nDefault controls use a grid-based system, so you'll move according to the orientation of the squares on the map. You can switch to a direct control system where up will move you directly upwards and so on, but I would recommend sticking to the default setup because it's easier to use the squares to judge which direction you'll jump in using that setup.\n\nI didn't encouter any bugs or glitches, apart from the odd occasion of your robot shuffling/stuttering instead of walking (mostly in the very first area).\n\nIf you're looking for a quirky, challenging puzzle platformer with a unique look & feel, give this game a try. This is the first release from a one-man crew, so let's see what Mad Goblin Games comes up with next!\n\n\nWatch some gameplay (and lots of exploding deaths) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLVq-W-PEjU\n\n\nGiveaway here (ends January 2nd 2016): https://www.bobmanbob.com","December 17, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be warned, this game isn’t for the faint of heart. It is difficult. As this is a throwback, this game isn’t going to hold your hand. If you are used to current games that point you in the right direction, give you waypoints that show you where you need to go, or constantly spew out hints at you about things that should be obvious to you, this game might be too difficult for you. This game is made for those who like to challenge themselves to think & who like puzzles. It is not for Call of Duty scrubs.\n\nIf an actual challenging game doesn’t make you cry, ♥♥♥♥, moan and give up 5 minutes in, then this game may be for you. If not, go back to playing your tacky mil-sims against 12 year olds.","October 2, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

It looks great and has lots of character. From what I played it seemed to have a great quirky almost Douglas Adams-esque style. However, I found the isometric perspective just too much, for me making jumps nigh on impossible and leaving me extremely frustrated. The store page says it is inspired by some games I've never played, so I might be missng out on a nostalgia factor here.\n\nFirst game I've ever requested a refund for, I wouldn't recommend it. Again, it might be because I haven't played the games it was inspired by, it is only the isometric platforming which let it down for me, everything else was great.","September 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"
