Only better.  The level design is lovely and everything just works.  The puzzles are simple enough but there is a bit of random key pressing in the game sometimes to get things to work.  Hopefully that can be patched.  Apart from that, the story seems to unfold nicely and has a dark tone.  It's a slow game, reminds me a little of "Year Walk" in it's pacing and atmosphere.  Well worth the money!","February 3, 2015","true","4.6"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","30","38","0","0"

It plays out like one long psychological nightmare, where the plot is told through flashbacks and floating text.  I liked the art style, and while there wasn't much music I enjoyed the bits and pieces of it that were scattered about.  The game doesn't rely on jump scares, rather it unnerves you through its story, and certain gameplay elements.  The sounds the mechanical birds make got to me, as well as the whispers when leaving a fire.  While the game is short, the experience is one I won't soon forget.\n\nI also feel like I should add that during one of the levels, I encountered a glitch that would not allow me to go down any ladders.  This in turn blocked a path I needed to take.  The end result was simply having to restart the game.  It doesn't detract from my enjoyment overall, just something I felt was worth mentioning.","August 25, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The whimsical art style matches the slow, subtle psychological horror perfectly. I was worried at first that the strange graphics would make this less enjoyable, but after starting the game it definitely fits.\n\nOverall the puzzles were simple and the game quite short (I finished it in three hours), but the experience is definitely a memorable one! You play as a man suffering from mental illness as he tries to deal with his fractured memories and thoughts. A majority of the plot is told through flashbacks via floating text and disconnected psychiatric evaluations. It gets progressively darker as the story progresses.\n\nAll in all this is a simple puzzle game definitely worth experiencing!","February 7","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I loved the art style of the game, but I think the soundtrack should be the main selling point for this game. The ambiance noises and effect sounds are amazing, I'm in a constant awe everytime new sequence starts.

I think there are two endings, not 100% certain, I chose the wrong one by accident! Hand crafted models and enivronements. It's very low brow, but very very good. The narrative is pretty grim and dark. If you like puzzle games with morbidness this might be your type of game.","February 18","true","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sadly this game therefore invokes the feelings it should and having lost a friend quite recently, I wasn't really able to play  the game that well prior to reviewing.\nThis is also one tip, I'd like to give to you: If you are momentarily having a hard time, I would not really recommend to play the game.\n\nMechanicswise the game works fine, but there isn't much to it.\nWhat I'd like to point out though is that the art and music blend in really nicely into the theme of the game which rounds up this whole experience.\n\nAgain I want to say the same thing I've said with Gravity Ghost: This is a game with a narrative behind it, so take yourself a bit of time and delve into it.\n\nSadly due to its narrative the game is very linear, so that might be something to consider.\n\nLastly I'd like to say that performancewise I  really have nothing to complain about.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is 10€ which might drive away some people, apart from that the game does its job well and in a later sale I'd consider it a good buy.","February 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","18","36","8","0"
