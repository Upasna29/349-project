It is like somebody scraped together a bunch of unfinished questlines and maps from the maingame, mashed them together and called it a day. It took me about 2 hours finishing this using the endgame save from the maingame and it is pretty much more of the same, but somehow worse - because the writing feels like they just did not care anymore, with many misguided attempts at comic-relief killing all sense of atmosphere.\n\nConsidering it is stand-alone, it might work as a sort of quick fix if you crave some mindless hacking and slaying but want to be done with it all before dinner. It carries all the issues of the maingame (boring dungeons, crappy combat-system, lots of crappy loot) and doesn't bring the closure to the ArcaniA-chapter of the Gothic-Saga that I had hoped for. Pretty much a waste of time and money unless you played all the better alternatives.","January 16, 2014","false","2.1"," 119 of 137 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","119","137","7","0"

Pretty nice game. But I can not recommend this because it is too short. Stand-alone expansion for about 5 hours of gameplay.

And if you do want to continue Arcania's story, get this on sale.\n\nIt took me about 5 hours to meander through the whole thing.  You can take your character from Arcania along with all his loot and stats.  My character progressed a few more levels but there was not enough content to really make much of a difference.  In contrast to Arcania's wide open areas, the Fall of Satarrif features mainly a trench/corridor environment for most of it's story.  Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as the original, even down to the end game fight.\n\nThe story itself is fairly simplistic but I didn't think it was noticeably worse than the original game.","September 20, 2014","false","5.9"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","26","32","2","0"

It is a very painless transition and unlike games, such as Mass Effect, every item in your inventory are carried over.\n\nHowever, this is more likely because of the Expansion-like feel of this game. Overall it is an anti climax to the prior game. There are fewer encounters, those that exist get pretty tired. The Boss battle at the end is almost identical to the boss in ArcaniA.\n\nIf you have to get the game to complete the saga, I guess do it. However, there are only a few new enemies, no new powers and you will feel that the expansion really only rounds out the story.\n\nIf you were picking this up as a standalone, I don't  think you will get the relationships between the characters and thus the story will just feel like a shallow chase to kill a demon that is cursing a kingdom. The greater conflict is lost and the chance to make something epic of that showdown is lost even without the prior story knowledge.","July 12, 2014","false","5.5"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

The possessed human's are colorful.\n-Worth getting if you plan to play it right after Aracania, AND if you buy it for 75% off or more.\n-You can import your high level character from Arcania. You keep all the gear and cash which is nice, and almost feels like cheating.\n\nCONS\n\n-Very short.  It has a short main story, and several really mini side missions.\n-Map tracking wasn't improved.

It explains what happens immidiatly after the events in Arcania but does so in a painfully enclosed environment consisting of deep trenches and long tunnels.  Again the voice acting is just appauling and you are not offered any new weapons or armour to spice things up.  The game ends rather abruptly following the last battle and you are left craving something, like a refund or a real game.  Same graphics and combat feel as Arcania.

The flaws of this game are so obvious that they scream in your face. The AI is dead stupid. When the enemies go into attack mode, you can dodge on the side and continue attacking while they aim where you last stood. At times enemies fail to attack you at all and just stand there while you're finishing them off.\n\nAnother thing that bugs me is the loot, or rather the lack of it. The environment is rich in detail but you can only interact with a fraction of it. I also noticed that when you loot clothes, amulets and rings, the game sometimes replaces them with items you've already equipped. The stats of the equipment seemed higher in a way so I'm thinking if the game was programmed to do you a favor. I sometimes discovered that my character was wearing some amulet with very good mana stats and the amulet with decent health and armor stats was placed in the inventory.\n\nThen there were those little logical flaws that were ok 10-15 years ago, but start to appear as amateurish when you still see them now. Example: a guy is locked up in a bamboo cage, you have to help him out. What does your character do? He asks where they keep the key. I mean, c'mon, I'm sending archdemons to the abyss here, if you need a key for a bamboo cage then I've got this magic ore battleaxe here, just take one step back. Or on other occasions you're fighting off 30 feet tall trolls and sending exploding fireballs towards a swarm of enemies, yet can't climb a wooden fence. I wish games were past such nonsense and come up with something better.\n\nOn top of everything they also didn't fix the moon gravity. The nameless hero keeps floating through the air. I guess they thought it looks cool. So cool that you don't get tired of it till the end of the game.\n\nI had hard time rating the game. I was in between. The graphics still looks great, the design department has built a stunningly beautiful world. And there are some splendid features in the game. For example in some places you get to play as Lester and Gorn. Having gone through all the Gothic marathon just think how cool is that. The game's got a great sense of humor. Someone in the development team did they're job.\n\nI decided to lable it as a negative review only for one reason. Throughout the game I kept thinking about the flaws and bugs and what they might have done better. What this means is that the game lacked atmosphere. It didn't suck me in as games are supposed to. The lack of atmosphere is quite unforgivable.","October 12, 2014","false","4.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

It was a great game and it seemed like it would offer plenty of fun for the money but there were other things in the way of long playing sessions - like life! - and I started playing Skyrim. Needless to say Skyrim kept me busy and Arcania fell by the wayside, waiting in the wings for me to take it up once again. Tonight I did just that - by the lambent light of my keyboard I loaded the game and set the options, no problems incountered - my Asus ROG 74X machine has 12Gb of DDR3 ram, with the Nvidia 560M graphics card that has 3Gb of ram onboard, and to top it off the machine has the Intel I7 dual core 2.0 Ghz chipset. The game runs great, no chatter or ghosting or other problems as I killed a pack of wolves and took up my life with a sheep no one else wants and I can't kill - I tried with sword and bow but nothing works. Thus far the game has my attention and I doubt I'll finish it in less than 100 hours as I tend to look under every rock and behind every bush for loot and potions. I love playing a game and squeezing every drop of programmer minutae from it, my money bought the game and therefore\nI feel justified in taking as long to play as I like. No need to rush, I do that in real life and frankly, I'm sick of doing it at all. Gameplay is solid, a bit easy even on "normal" but the upper modes of play are more challenging and there's enough of them to satisfy just about anyone playing the title. My knight is awesome looking, his armor appearing solid and strong, the weapon in his hand, a flaming sword, looks very dangerous and the shield looks as if it could hold back a dragon! No complaints on the gameplay or graphics. HOWEVER - there is no help file on how to play the game or what keys do what! For instance, I cannot level up despite the fact the message has appeared twice already to do so. How does one level up? I'll keep playing, but I'm getting better in battle and can't benefit from the improvements or points earned to upgrade with. ]Saving is a snap and the game loads quickly and smoothly. Some people have had problems with WIN8, which I have installed on my laptop but I don't share their problems with the game, which is not to say they aren't having any, just that I'm not. Game is easily worth the money dropped on it and I have no regrets on the purchase or playtime invested.

In this one, almost everything dies well with shock ... except for the final boss who seems best done-in with ice.
