It works great and has all the potential in the world to be a fun experience. The physics already do their job (and quite well at that, the game always gives you the feeling that you'll be able to do some pretty awesome stuff by mastering movement), it already has a large assortment of weapons, it's just missing those final touches.","October 23, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The game play is simple enough with the goal being to get the most kills before the time limit or to reach the score limit in a free for all deathmatch.  There are many weapons to use ranging from warhammers to bazookas.  All in all a very fun game even in its current Aplha state.\nHere is a gameplay review.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kbxWGBJvfU4","April 2","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n\nCarroting Brain\nCarroting Brain is a cartoon rabbit shooter. The goal of this game is to kill as many other rabbits as you can with the weapons you find. Have up to 6 A.I rabbits to fight against in a total FFA. Choose from all types of weapons such as sniper rifles, assault rifles, various shotguns, various pistols and melee weapons and MORE. Go to various planets in the deep outer space, visit the moon and other made up planets to fight and destroy.\n\nWhat to do in the gameTheres not a whole lot to do in this game, its a 2d platform arena with rabits with guns. This game is early access and there will be more content coming soon. They will be adding more guns, more maps and more content. This game shows a lot of potential and can become something great. This game has some amazing and intresting physics that are fun to mess around with.\n\nPros  Bunnies.\nBunnies with guns.\nFun physics.\nDestructible maps.\nBunnies... again\n\nCons Not very many levels.\nNo bunny customization.\n\nFinal VerdictOverall I rate this game a 7/10 it is still in early access and has some great content. It is still a fun 2d platform game with bunnies. Run, hop and gun your way to victory against the evil bunnies. I recommend this game to anyone who likes platform shooters.\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations Steam Group  LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews","November 1, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

At the moment it's just an amusing little battle arena that will last a good 10-20minutes or so.","January 27","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bFunk/recommended/404750/","bFunk","...---...","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bFunk/","3664 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI won this game on SteamGifts and the condition for entering stated:\n"In case you'd win, don't delay playing the game and write a Steam review for it, if you'll like it. Indie developers deserve more attention."\n\nHere's my review (16-Nov-2015):\n\nSomehow there's no way to play this game on keyboard because the default kb+m layout is messed up. So I hooked up my X360 controller and fumbled around in training mode for a while. Even in training mode, the controls feel awkward. Fast aiming is a key component in the game with all the bunny hopping going on, pro stick aiming is a requirement for this game. Only for melee weapon can you just go button mashing and hope your enemies don't come into the fight with anything non-melee or stronger-melee.\n\nIn short, this game really needs a lot of work and is therefor an Early Access Game. At the moment, I strongly recommend against splashing down EUR 11.99 which is probably USD 11.99 on this title.","November 16, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
