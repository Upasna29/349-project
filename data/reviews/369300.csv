Totaling 10 hours and 45 minutes.\n- Had fun interacting with the characters of the show.\n- Overall liked the visuals of the game (But it has its issues).\n- Lots of puzzles (If you're into that sort of thing).\n- Stellar voice acting by the main cast.\n- Funny and witty dialogue for the most part.\n- Chance to explore a bunch of different locations from the show and interact with its inhabitants.\n- An abundance of in jokes, references and easter eggs that fans of the show will appreciate.\n- Cool to see a fanmade character appear (Sunny).\n- Lots of interactables.\n\nCons:\n- Game can get really slow at times to the point of it getting boring (Especially Chapter 3).\n- Some characters aren't voiced by their original voice actors.\n- Visuals sometimes look like someone tried to mix multiple different artstyles (Cartoony, photorealism) but it doesn't mesh well.\n- LSP is incredibly annoying in this and is far more antagonistic than she is on the show.\n- You'll end up visiting certain locations multiple times which gets stale at times. The Marceline DLC fixes this issue though.\n- Some jokes and dialogue is very hit or miss.\n- No replayability.\n- Combat isn't very good and just ruins the pacing.\n- Sometimes character dialogue is skipped at the last second.\n- Dialogue should have been made skippable as checkpoints can be sparse at times.\n\nOverall:\n- This is something only fans of the show can enjoy, so if you're not a fan do not even think about getting it.\n- I enjoyed the game. It was fun playing as and interacting with characters from the show. It was also cool to visit locations and get the chance to walk around and explore the areas. The amount of hours I got out of the game is worth the price. But if you want to play it safe, get it if it ever goes on sale.","February 4","true","10.8"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

I know marci dlc is out but lets hope it gets more dlc. If you enjoy Adventure Time and can't decide what AT to go for, I have played most of them, yes they are all funny, making you laugh I would have to say this one has to be the best so far.","December 26, 2015","true","9.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

If you enjoy Adventure time and can put up with the lack of polish here and there you'll enjoy it. The whole time I played it I wished they implemented skipable dialogue like modern games. Also its pace is just a bit too slow. Still enjoyable, it's just frustrating because of it.","February 7","true","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
