"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/recommended/338050/","Insignus","Insignus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Insignus/","520 products in account","Anoxemia is a game about a stranded diver and his robot helper. You explore, collect upgrades, try not to run out of oxygen, and pass through puzzles and game stages, and collect plants in order to progress to the next level. Very simple premise.\n\nGood things about this game: It has great art, the backgrounds in particular are nicely done. The art direction (Being a very gray low light environment - in fact I think the game only uses something like 4 or 5 colors outside of grayscale) is well executed. It is also fairly inexpensive - I picked it up on sale at about $7,99 USD.\n\nI am very tempted to ask for my money back. Here's why:\n\nIts not a bad game. Its just not worth even $7,99\n\nFor starters, the game is dull. Its simply dull. There is a paper thin plot: Your submarine crashed and you're on the bottom of the ocean and you think you're going nuts and that your robot is trying to kill you. No big deal, I've enjoyed paper thin plots before. However, you generally have to fill that gap with something. Anything that engages the player and says "Stick with it! You're having fun blowing stuff up!!" Or "OOOOO MONOTONOUS YET ARTISTICALLY RENDERED MYSTERY!" Or "Compelling yet one dimensional characters dieing in macabrely humorous ways!"\n\nAnoxemia has none of these things. It fails to engage you to continue playing other than the self-flagellating realization that you paid $7.99 for this, and therefore must crack on to try and pass the movie-ticket test (In that you feel compelled by your own fleeting sense of frugality to extract entertainment value from this expenditure). That is literally why I played at it. My play time owes to the lack of a "Request Refund" convenience button for Steam. Should've played the demo. But I digress.\n\nThat said, I've encountered this before and played, and even completed, other games for longer periods. However, Anoxemia has other problems.\n\nThe controls are clunky. Most of the movement is modeled on a tethered partner system. You move the robot, the human (Which the game implies is you) laggardly follows along. Clumsily. Poorly. Stopping to pick up that oxygen container despite the fact that the DRONE OF BEE LINING DOOM is about to magically get you and kill you in one hit. Poor nameless human. Granted, you are on the bottom of the ocean (This is discussed later), so movement should be clumsy, but not unpredictably, stupidly clumsy, to the point of annoyance.\n\nThe human, by the way, seems to be functionally pointless in this game. Aside from carrying dynamite, his purpose is four fold:\n\n1) He is the anchor for the "Robot is secretly trying to kill you" plot tension\n2) He is how the player would theoretically relate to the game as a protagonist (This may have been a miscalculation)\n3) He is an excuse to introduce use the color pink in the game's intro cutscene.\n4) He is the generator of one half of the completely uninformative dialogue in the game.\n\nWhich bring us to back to the dullness. The dialogue in the game is almost never related to what you're doing. It explains things unreliably at best. The most useful dialogue line from the ATMA robot was along the lines of "THIS IS A MINE TURRET, IT TRACKS HEAT AND MOVEMENT. IF YOU'RE HOT ENOUGH!"\n\nThis very one-dimensional dialogue provides no real explication of why we are doing anything. It tells me I'm gathering plants. I do not know why. Perhaps it is revealed later. Perhaps they are magical plants that are the causation of this war that spread oxygen canisters and comical WWII Mines across the sea scape. Maybe they eat radiation or the magical acid that serves as the INFINITEFOREST of this game. Maybe my character is helping to secretly develop some kind of special wax for his mustache. Don't know, don't care.\n\nAnd that is the failing of this game. At no point was an observable attempt made to engage the player.\n\nBut the game makes a more critical mistake.\n\nIts not challenging. The game is as advertised in one sense: It is hard. However, the developers appear to unfortunately fall into the trap of conflating difficulty with challenge. Dieing profusely is not an indicator of challenging gameplay.\n\nAnd you will die alot, but not because the game is challenging, but because your controls are poorly designed, and the enemies seems mismatched to the puzzles they are placed in. Some of the BEELINEY drones don't even patrol. They just randomly zip around until you go for the plant, at which point they tag you as the level fades out and thus reset your progress. Meaning you have to restart. Sometimes dark enough that you'll think you've won, except SURPRISE! YOU GET TO REPLAY THE LEVEL YOU JUST COMPLETED!\n\nWhich is the other failure of the game. Level start checkpoints only. Granted, the levels are generally short. But it is annoying to have to rinse repeat myself three times in a row for a simple puzzle that failed because my diver dude decided to hang on a corner or randomly pickup a canister. In and of itself, this is not a game killing problem. Checkpoint deserts happen.\n\nIt becomes a bigger problem when you consider that hitting the escape key causes the level to reset when you go to the ingame menu. There is a pause/play option, however. It is the enter key. It does not appear to have entered into the development design process to integrate those two functions (i.e. a pause menu)\n\nTaking final stock, Anoxemia has an interesting premise that is undercut by its execution, despite its artistic merits. Its control scheme, however, does accurately render the experience of trying to solve a rubix cube in quicksand. These may seem like a harsh thing to say, but it is my honest rendering of my albeit limited experience with this game.\n\nBased upon these an other factors, I can't recommend Anoxemia as a solid investment of your gaming dollars at this time.\n\n","January 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","54","77","5","6"

It’s a 2D action game that takes you into the depths of a strange ocean and immerses you into an eerie atmosphere, and guess what? Atmoshpere is  almost everything for me in a game..\nOne of the main things that attracts attention to Anoxemia, is its apparently simple gameplay. Whereas the controls are intuitive indeed, the actual control of the character is very tricky at times. In the game you actually control an advanced robot drone and the human you follows it around as if he was tied with an invisible rope. Whenever you stop the drone, your character might still move a bit passed it and it could spell disaster when you’re running too close to a mine. You do get to use a practical water jet powered mini sprint but even that can work against you xD\nThe point is a game that’s a lot more than what you think. At the start of the game, it feels like a simple ‘collect objects to win the level’ kind of game. Then, as you keep moving forward in each level, your character starts to speak his mind more and more, sharing some thoughts with you. All of which add up some tension and start to unravel a different story.\n\nGraphics        7.9/10                Voice/Soundtracks        8.6/10                Gameplay        8.1/10                Story        9.3/10                Atmosphere        9.8/10            Generally        9.1/10","October 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

Since updating several times since launch, bugs amd issues that are mentioned below and in other reviews have been fixed and some gameplay mechanics have been slightly tweaked to make this a more fun experience.\n__\n\nOLDER REVIEW\n\nGetting a bit of heat for this one, but please give my thoughts a chance.\n\n**Please read the comments below from the developer regarding my issues below**\n\nThe ambient music, look and simplistic gameplay are nice and there is quite a bit of stage variety when you get later into the game.\n\nThe controls (using mouse at least) aren't always ideal. I found myself accidentally using the harpoon quite a lot after first finding it because it's set to the same button I used to move. I think it would be nice if mouse 1 was harpoon controls and mouse 2 was move (or something like that).\n\nThe human following you, who ATMA refers to as 'it' (Markiplier, right?), can sometimes be a bit foolish. He seems to love stopping to collect things when there is imminent danger present, so you need to make sure you lead him away from items if you're trying to get away from something. I actually don't mind this mechanic all that much, because it means he really is relying on you to get him out of harms way, so you're own movements mean a lot more.\n\nI found that I wasn't absolutely correct in my video, as you CAN avoid all the extra boxes and still get through the game, providing you know where to go,how to get there and have a sufficient amount of o2 and power. So ideally, to give yourself a good chance on the next level, you should scout out the level, die, then give the level a quick run through getting everything you need.\n\nExploring the levels can be quite fun and rather rewarding. However, sometimes you can't really afford to if you want a good chance on the next levels, so unless you want to play levels you've already completed over and over, you just want to get all the plants/documents/items as fast as possible to avoid starting the new level with 1 minute of life.\n\nI still maintain it's a bit annoying to collect something, accidentally die (which is quite easy on some later levels) and never get the opportunity to get it again, unless you completely reset your progress and start from the beginning. That seems unnecessarily punishing, especially if you start off with around a minute of power or o2 and don't really want to replay older levels.\n\nPersonally, the reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because I begin to get bored repeating older levels to prepare for newer ones, but if you don't mind that, give it a try.\n____\n\nOriginal review 3 hours after release -\n\nCurrently, there are bugs which cause some boxes and some drone power refills to only spawn once per play, meaning you have to speedrun this game and get everything right the first time, or run out of power and die.\nThe game seems interesting and has a lot of potential, but I warn you to stay away until this vital part of the game is fixed.\n\n____\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAQJw7xfl74 - The first few levels and my experience with them.","January 16, 2015","true","11.9"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","11"

Sure dude, going underwater to collect samples from an acid infested, booby trapped underworld is easy when your submarine inexplicably crashed and all you have to save you from certain destruction is a little circle/drone that can detect dangers for you ...or accidentally send you straight into them.\n\nIt's a platformer. I kind of like the game. I found out however to my annoyance that if I want to press escape to skip something, I end up closing the game instead, which is irritating. I want the option to skip without closing the game each time and therefore resetting my progress. In this same vein there are no checkpoints. If you fail anywhere during the level, you'll start back at the beginning. It has potential, but there are a few things that could be changed to make it better.\n\nI wouldn't mind the font being bigger for the speech as I found it hard to read. The music is quite relaxing, and the atmosphere/feel of the game gives a dark, claustrophobic feeling. At the same time it can feel peaceful and relaxing … just as long as you don't blow yourself up on a bomb.\n\nThe controls are a little awkward at times since you need to be careful how you control the drone, since the character following behind it moves at a different angle/trajectory. I think this could be made more responsive.\nAt this moment in time as well you can't seem to be able to purchase the game for whatever reason.

The best description I can give is It's like combining an active game of mine sweeper with a monster that follows you while having different parts within the levels to figure out how to get past. The levels are short but there can be some of a challange in each one.\n\nFrom some of the comments I've read, it's supposed to mess with your mind as you read the bits of information in each of the levels. The text that is supposed to get you pulled in for the psych part is so small you will probably miss a lot of it until you notice more of it appearing. This game feels like it had a hint of psych thriller but not enough to pull me in. The monster you are chased by appears to be the thing life guards would have at pools, the long floaty thing attached to the board that is supposed to help injured people safely out of the water. The game play is enjoyable but not great. The feeling I had while playing it is unenthusiastic, not in a bad way because I did enjoy it a bit. It's a game to play when you just don't care. Don't care about winning, dying, or giving up half way through a level.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and have no worries about however much of it went towards this game. If you are interested and want to get it, I'd say wait for a bundle or sale before getting it. The $4 price tag isn't bad but I'd put it more towards a $2 game.","January 19","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Your guy can easily get stuck/killed which is frustrating.\n- No checkpoints. Especially frustrating when the level is long and tedious and you die to something stupid.\n- Essentially boring. The game has a very slow pace and lacks excitement of any kind.\n- Suffers from Missing Key Syndrome (MKS). Progress can be blocked because you couldn't make out a black item next to a black wall and black background...\n- Hacking system does not have a mini-game. You simply wait and you have a % success rate. Kinda lame.\n\nSo basically, get this game if is on sale for super-cheap for and interesting experience.","January 27","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So you need to have too much patience to play this.\nOther thing is when the press "esc" to acess the menu, naturally we press "esc" to resume the game, but no.

You control a drone and the gameplay mainly consists of waiting till the human that is following you has caught up. You progress by picking up the plants in the level while dodging mines, pushing the occasional rock out of the way and looking for dynamite to blow up walls blocking the way. If you make a mistake and your human runs into a mine, you restart the whole level.

It's super buggy.  I probably wasted an hour of my time replaying levels where the game broke in a way that made me stuck, and I lost several upgrades due to the physics pushing them through walls.\n2. The controls are so frustrating... it's an interesting design choice to control the drone instead of the diver, but it ends up making things very awkward.  The diver will constantly get stuck on corners and random boxes.  This probably wouldn't be a big deal but there are a few parts which require fairly tight maneuvering.  Not to mention the physics puzzles which require you to position the diver so it's not in the way, but due to the short leash on the stay command it will often charge in and mess everything up anyway.\n3.  The game drags on in certain parts.  Some levels are needlessly long just to add difficulty but don't offer any interesting new challenges or story development.\n\nWhile the asthetic is quite cool and the game oozes atmosphere, I was ready to stop playing halfway through the game.  Instead I pushed on just to be done with it, but the end result wasn't impressive.","October 22, 2015","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything is described so vaguely but yet so intriguing that I wanted to continue pushing to know what happens in the story. But 4 hours into the game (level 25) nothing has really been explained and nothing new has changed the story or plot. There seem to not be any actual essence in the story, just small oneliners that sound deep and fascinating but really doesnt mean anything.\n\n"You are the one..." "We will all die..." "You must not finish the mission..." "Do you believe in ghosts?" "Everyone else before you was also you" "Can you feel the insanity?"\n\nI made some of those up I believe, but that still gives you the general idea of the story. Everything is just oneliners in a similar fashion to those above, but without tying anything together at any time. They all lack substance.\nYou are also presented with a graphic comic between the levels, but it adds nothing to the mysterious side of the story. It generally composes of the diver saying "Im now deeper into the cavesystem" in different ways with different angles of him swimming in the cavesystem.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite boring. You have control over a small drone that can swim in all directions and your goal is to steer the diver in the right direction, who follows the drone, in various underwater cavesystems and keep him alive. You have a couple of abilities, like a sonarwave to search for enemies and a harpoon to pull items and kill some lesser enemies, but most of the time you just fly around aimlessly and wait for the diver to catch up to you.\nThe boring-part would be okay if it wasnt for the unforgiving nature of this game, one mistake and youre dead and have to start the level over. The levels are completely random in terms of layout. I guess the developers wanted to give the player a sense of exploration, but with everything looking the same and with the same game mechanics being used over and over again without introducing anything new, it felt tedious every time I entered a new map. I just swam around randomly knowing already what I was looking for, just not where to find it in this particular map.\n\nI dont know how the game ends, maybe the ending is supercool and ties everything together in an awesome supernova, but up to this point I have just grown tired of the story, I dont care how it ends anymore. The gameplay was quite boring almost right from the start and with the lack of motivation to advance in the story there is nothing left in this game for me to continue playing it.\n\n4/10, not the worst game I have ever played but there are better games to spend your money and time on in my opinion.","February 14","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The problem is the game and its wacky controls.\n\nActually you could get used to the controls eventually, that might be part of the appeal, for some people, but there should be a measure of forgiveness to get used to the wacky.\n\nAlso, there are few rewards for finishing new levels.","May 27","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls (I'm using a usb converter for my old N64 controller) were difficult to get to grips with initially but thats kind of the point with this game. The keyboard and mouse options nearly made me give up on this game but now I'm using a controller it just seems to make much more sense.\n\nI'm loving the atmosphere and the strangely beautiful parallax graphics. The minimalist sounds, excellent soundtrack, as well as the voice acting are all top notch as well for an indie title.\n\nFor a game that cost me next to nothing it's managed to pull me away from some newly purchased AAA titles which cost a hell of a lot more and this is about as big a compliment as I can pay.\n\nIt does have some minor isues such as save points (you die you restart the level which can be frustrating) and my drone has gotten stuck occasionally but this inexplicably reminds me of my  Amiga gaming days - yep I'm an old fart and started on the ZX80 spectrum before getting heavily into the glorious C64 etc - so I can easily forgive these little quibbles in order to envoke those feelings again.\n\nYou can get this on most sites now for pennies and if you have access to a controller that you're familiar with then I strongly suggest you treat yourself to an unexpected gem of a game.\n\nLike I said, loving this and I REALLY hope there is an Anoxemia 2 in the works.\n\nA strong 7 out of 10 from me. It would have been a rare 8+ but the keyboard and mouse controls diminish the enjoyment of the game to the point that a controller is a prerequisite and I appreciate that not everyone either likes or has access to this option.","May 28","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
