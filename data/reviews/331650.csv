"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/recommended/331650/","Kailen","Kailen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/","1108 products in account","I just played the trilogy recently.  The 3rd one has problems.\n\n-They changed the control scheme on it.  ...Probably for the better, but still.\n-The Eagle doesn't feel quite as powerful in it as it did in the previous ones.  ...Which is again is probably for the better, since you basically never have to swap out the Eagle until late game in them.\n-The time limit maxes out at 4 minutes.  And not just "maxes out the display" and keeps rolling, but actually taps out at 4 minutes.  THIS is my biggest complaint with it.  You are basically forced to keep going in it, you never get a chance to really sit back and explore.  I like exploring the levels.  Pedestrians also give you almost no time.\n-The missions.  They were every other level here, not every 4th level like in the previous game.  They also... I dunno, mostly were uninspired?  They're not bad, but they seemed to be fairly bland, particularly early on.  They are hit and miss overall.\n\nTwo other issues:  This game includes the Nosebleed Pack.  Now, it's nice in that "more cars, more maps, more content!"  However, these vehicles are not well balanced, and are available from the beginning.  And are available in the opponent's pool from the beginning.  And the hovering car can be very, very annoying to deal with.\n\nAnother issue is that the game crashes on story missions.  This is a known issue.  There is a workaround.  The workaround is to turn off the mip filter.  HOWEVER, due to another glitch, that being badly coded menus where the content doesn't contain itself to the windows, you can't actually turn off the mip filter in game.\n\nYou CAN do it from the setup though.  So open the setup, go to options, video, advance, and where you see "Mip filter", set it to none.  You may also need to disable Pixel Fog (though I didn't need to).  This should fix the problem.\n\nThere's a lot to like about the third game though.  The graphics are a big step up.  The final levels in this game really look fantastic.  The story IS there, even if it's annoying at times.\n\nMy favorite of the bunch is the second.  The third has problems.  So, why am I giving this a "yes" recommendation, despite all the flaws, including crashes?  Because, at the end of the day, it's still Carmageddon.  And if you need to get your fix, there ya go.","December 5, 2014","true","0.7"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","1"

Most modern computers experience a glitch caused by an antiquated Mip map and vertex fog better handled by Voodoo Rush and TNT Riva cards of yesteryear.  The fix is simple: backup your game cache through Steam first. browse Local Files, Open GFX file with Word Pad. Scroll to line 74 and edit line which reads all twos. Change last two to a zero, Save and done. The game has 25 races and 25 missions. For help with missions check out ZodApe's YewTewb Channel. I have seen complaints on here about the game is broken,too hard,not enough time etc.  Yet i imagine these same complainers plow happily throught the latest NFS broken crap because the Dice Team made it and they made Call of Droopy Diaties. Blow that!  Need more money to buy that sweet Hotty? Try racing the first level in The 20's and for the love of Pete,mow down every ped on the sidewalks. Keep  those Combo Multiplies spinning and you will make serious bank ~ $250K - $600K per play through.  Race it over and over until you have serious ends. Also the Train Station generously has Armor,Power and Slots All Around so you need not buy those,merely fill them for more even more nefarious power. Do You need more time? Use a bigger and slower car to hammer the competition. The "Jaws" car is a personal fave. Most Opponent Wasteds yield an extra minute and sometimes more added game play time.  Is this game for everyone? Hell no! You have to work hard to succeed. Without some skin in the game there can be no reward. This is a game from fifteen years  past when games were brutal but satisfying because you felt like you had accomplished something. if it is too hard then maybe Mario Kart or one of it's Brawzillion spinoffs is a better bet for you. Thanks for reading,be safe,keep well and happy gaming Playa.","March 6, 2015","true","67.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I made the usual trips to the computer games isle in the Tagret my family frequented. This one time, something caught my eye from an endcap while leaving the games isle. It was the jewel case US version. It looked dark and cool, comparitively to what was on the shelves back then. I asked my mom if she would buy it for me, and she obliged.\n\nThe boxart was punk looking and i was into that phase a the time. Crimson red, with chrome lettering. The screenshots on the back were fascinating.\n\nThis was my introduction to to the Carmageddon franchise, and community. At the time, it was not so regarded as a turd, at least not so openly by the original devs, but i had no idea of the politics at the time regardless. It was fun. The physics were spot on, collisions were impactful, the vehicles were creative and creatively ripped off from things i'd seen in movies and tv shows of the time, some before my time.\n\nThe music, was just what i was into at the time. Odd, punk and metal. I still play the soundrack that i ripped from the disk back then, and thats my preferred way of listening to the music in game now that it isn't included in this version.\n\nThe graphics were great, but this was the first title that i realized... i had a ♥♥♥♥ eMachine. This game was my introduction to learning why my computer was slow and what to do to make it faster, or learn what i would need theoretically to upgrade. It also taught me about modding communities and it blew me away that i could add things to these games. I downloaded everything i could find, 5-10kb/s at a time.... sometimes a car would take all night.\n\nAnyways, despite the devs taking a ♥♥♥♥ on, and disowning this game, its what lead me down the rabbit hole.\n\nPros:\nPhysics are great.\nGameplay is full of carnage.\nMusic is a good match.\nMods and Add-ons (Max Pack).\nVariety of Environments and Cars.\nTechnology was amazing for the time.\nWidescreen support (without 3D stretching; there are 2D textures and hud items that stretch).\n\nCons:\nGlitchy as ♥♥♥♥ (just hitting an opponent or wall sometimes will crash the game).\nMissions can be irritating as ♥♥♥♥.\nGets easier the more APO you gain.\nWeapons could have focused a little more on car to car projectiles.\n\nI'm just glad and grateful, despite hating this game, that the devs allowed it to be on steam at all (it's not on GOG).\n\nP.S.\nToshiba-3 - you are still a rockstar!\nhttp://rr2000.toshiba-3.com/","February 17","true","10.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

The timer is clamped at 5:00, so there isn't as much time to screw around on a map as the others. It also seems you get a mere couple extra seconds from mowing down 10-15 pedestrians compared to, say, a full minute, or 3, in previous games.\n\n+ The updated graphics are refreshing. They're a bit sharper than Carma2, and the pedestrians don't look as blocky. I'm no texture artist but I think custom car skin support is a nice touch, especially when the textures are exported for you when creating a new skin.\n\n+ Perhaps my favorite track is the racetrack, driving the wrong way and causing a pileup at 200mph is always funny. The splat pack environments are definitely unusual, and add a nice twist to the game.\n\n+ Missions are usually fun.\n- Missions get extremely repetitive\n\n\ntl;dr Carmageddon TDR 2000 is a great game, but time limits and missions feel a bit more serious than a Carma game should.","December 26, 2014","true","54.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/recommended/331650/","Deimenried","Deimenried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/","240 products in account","SHORT VERSION\n\nExpect:Frustrating missions, timer from hell, annoying cops, invisible barriers, PHYSICS!, tiny locales, OP car v car damage, tedious APO system, lots of cars (which you can't afford), accessibility ramps, computers on the roof, mutants, rampant jaywalking, lots of jumping over walls\n\nDo Not Expect:Any feeling of accomplishment, to be able to win by killing all peds, um.. er.. PHYSICS!, a fair fight, an epic boss battle, any variety (despite appearances), a good story, humerous situations to share with friends, friends.\n\nLONG VERSION\n\nIt was so tempting to give this game my reccomendation. I played it an awful lot when I was younger, and not knowing a lot else about Carmageddon at the time I really liked this game. Coming back to it after all these years I got to thinking that maybe I should have left the nostalgia as just that, but I craved the sense of fun this used to give me and I just couldn't see where I got it from.\n\nFirst of all, the game isn't terrible. Running people over and smashing into other cars is still largely taboo in driving games and so is still quite fun to do. It's the execution that lets this title down. The races are the standard Carma Kill all peds, kill all opponents or just finish the allotted number of laps, but it's not that simple. In TDR2000 the timer is most certainly NOT your friend. Want to hunt peds? Forget it. They take forever to kill and only yield a +2 second bonus which hardly offsets the 10+ seconds it took to finish them off in the first place. Want to waste everyone? Fine, but expect them to forget you exist half way through fighting (or in some cases, they don't even want to acknowledge you EVER existed at all.) Just want to race? HAH! Chasing checkpoints will run the clock down by the second lap.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, in the races you APPEAR to be given the choice of how to complete them, but they always pan out in exactly the same way because you are constantly chronologically challenged and you pretty much have to waste at least one opponent to stand a chance of completing the event in ANY of the three possible ways.\n\nWhat else is on offer, you ask?  Well luckily if uniform race completion isn't for you then there are "missions". Missions like in GTA? Well... No. Sure you kill some people and race around trashing cars, but since you cannot actually LEAVE your vehicle, everything has to be possible to do whislt driving one. How do you access a computer? Why, just smash into the oversized console, of course! Need to destroy a mainframe? Well now, it's just sitting on the roof waiting to get trashed. Yes, THE ROOF. Somebody thought "You know, the ROOF is a great place for this computer that controls base security. Not like somebody is going to ramp up there and knock it off... or it RAINS." The placement of objectives that aren't just "gang leaders" to waste make you feel like you are using accessability ramps to get everywhere, like somebody thought "What if a CAR wanted to get into this office? Did we set up the keyboard to show detailed secure files when a car drives into it?".\n\nWhen the missions aren't being rediculous, they are being immensely frustrating and tedious. I understand that there is only so much you can do from the cockpit of a car beyond smashing into consoles or interfacing with rooftop computers, but there is very little variation beyond that. You end up wasting someone, collecting pieces of something scattered across the map, smashing peds or doing some crazy stunts to get to some unexplained point on a rooftop that defies reasonable explanation.\n\nPHYSICS. So much physics, it's just a shame that most of it is wrong, so very wrong. Invisible barriers. Yes, they are here, and they will wreck your ride and fail you some missions, because why not? If you're not getting beached on your own bodywork, you can bet you'll be getting beached on just about everything else. Vehicular weapons are great too, and in all fairness they do help, but wave goodbye to them as the slightest knock will detach them and any other piece of bodywork you hold dear, because in the TDR 2000 universe cars are not made of metal, precision welded and fastened to provide a sturdy shell for your car, no. Everything is held together with biscuits. Hit a bump in the road, and BAM those biscuits crumble and most of your bodywork is sailing away from you. Why am I complaining about this? Well, metal tends to deform when hit. It dents, it scratches, it tarnishes, it doesn't just fall away. Hell, it doesn't just fall away and then orbit you for about a hundred meters, pulling your car around and making it impossile to drive (I'm looking at you, "The Vulture"). There are times when the physics do good. Drive your car fast enough into another car and/or crush it between two objects and it will bend, or sometimes, very appealingly, split in half entirely. Rare, but very satisfying when you use your afterburner to turn your car into a high-velocity wrecking ball.\n\nSpeaking of wrecking, a note on the APO (yes, it's back and more irrelevent than ever.) Upgrading your armour, power and offence seems like a great idea, until you realise you are just as slow as you were when you started, you are just as easy to waste and you are just as overpowered when ramming opponents/cops but you have NO MONEY LEFT. Seriously, save it for the cars, find one you like, they're all essentially the same except for King Merc (Much fun) and The Wheel (for when you want to spin around pointlessly unable to go in a straight line.) Go nuts. It really doesn't make a difference.\n\nSuch destruction does often catch the attention of the police, but they are little more than a nuisance. Wasting them often proves easier than wasting some of your opponents, and they have no special weapons or abilities to make you think "Oh, damn. The police. Better avoid them!"\n\nI can't leave this review as it is without at least touching upon the humour. Carmageddon is supposed to be about all-out crude crazy chaotic nonesense, and TDR 2000 has none of it. I realise this particular installment wasn't developed by the original team, but boy does it show. The pre-mission "Cut-scene" dialogues aren't even funny (even though they are begging to be) and the power-ups/stunt/collision one-liners are pale in comparision to what the original developers drenched the other installments in.\n\nJust wait 'til it's cheap.

I'm not speaking relative either, it's a just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nA lot of the fun in Carmageddon comes from the fact that it lets you drive around like a jackass, running over innocents, destroying your competitors, or exploring the large tracks. That is removed in TDR 2000. It's miraculously stingy in awarding you time, you only get 2 seconds for each innocent killed, as opposed to 8 in the first 2. It may not sound like it's that big of a deal, but there are not as many peds  as in the Stainless games, and it rewards the same for ramming opponents, but it doesn't give you credit for it 80% of the time. It's so inconsistent it's infuriating, and in a game that's supposed to be "free form" all it does is force you to play it like a normal checkpoint chaser.\n\nNot to mention it runs like ♥♥♥♥ with every possible setup on a computer that exceeds it's recommended specs.\nThe only thing this game actually does right is having a control scheme that let's you play on a craptop without needing xpadder.Only buy if you want all the Carmageddon games, otherwise stay away like it's Swine Flu.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMulletron/recommended/331650/","TheMulletron","TheMulletron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMulletron/","198 products in account","Well lets start with a little backstory, imagine me about a decade ago, a teenager pining for the glory days of the original Carmageddon, where peds equal points and racing is for wimps, when lo and behold I found it.  A budget re-release copy of Carmageddon TDR2000, and at less than a fiver! I bought it instantly.  Maybe the fact that it's already a re-release title after a couple of years on the shelves should've had alarm bells ringing in my ears, but I bought it nonetheless, and after playing the first batch of races and missions I realised that this isn't the franchise I know and love, and by about halfway through I was bored and fed up with this game. After I completed it, I never touched it again.\n\nSo what made this such a terrible gaming experience?  Lets start with the environments. At best they're mediocre, and the locations at least are as varied as the original game, but they also looked more dreary and washed out, and to be honest, rather uninspired. Also, althogh the game engine itself is fairly solid, I've got stuck on the level geometry enough times for it to be annoying.\n\nAs for the pedestrians that inhabit the maps, they would be satisfying to run over if they didn't all have adamantine skeletons.  I swear, unless you are going full pelt at them, you have to reverse back over them at least once in order to kill them (and even then it wasn't a guarantee!) If that wasn't bad enough the game only gives you a pittance of a time bonus for running them over. 2 seconds?! It took about that long to kill them in the first place!!!\n\nAnd the missions, oh god the missions!  Having one or two to break up the game is fine, but there were missions shoe-horned between every ♥♥♥♥ing race!  I just wanted to cause some carnage.  And if they weren't asinine fetch quests, they were convoluted and tedious, like shooting sharks with a slaughter mortar, which on paper sounds zany and fun, but in a vehicle can be awkward and frustrating to pull off.\n\nThen there are the cars themselves, all the rest might have been forgiven if the cars themselves were fun to drive, but they aren't.  They're ♥♥♥♥.  That in itself is a cardinal sin in ANY driving sim, let alone a Carmageddon sequel.\n\nTo begin with, the line-up looks like an A-Z from a Poundland toys catalogue, Rangeing from the silly to the uninspired, with things like a motorized wooden hamster wheel, a pallid attempt at a steampunk monster truck, (which looks more like a boiler mounted on a horse cart,) a tank, nothing special, just a tank, and even a man driving a bathtub (really?), none of which fits the game's setting, bar one, Max's own Eagle, which you started with.\n\nThen there are those cars which goes beyond uninspired to just plain lazy: one of the cars is literally called "Sports Sedan", and is just that.  I watched a video of this game about a month ago and I couldn't tell the opponent vehicles from the rest of the traffic milling about on the map.  Needless to say you won't be tempted to drive every vehicle in the game.\n\nAs for the handling it's okay for the most part, but a few vehicles refuse to turn from a standing start, some spin out like they have greased tyres, and then theres the novelty vehicles like the hovercar which is almost impossible to control and ends up adding nothing to the table in terms of gameplay.  I could go on about the gripes I have with the cars in this game (the damage modelling, the sounds, the physics...) but those are the biggest and as far as I'm concerned the worst.\n\nNow for the upshot.  Is it worth shelling out for this game? My advice is no.  There are better games (and sequels) out there that are worth paying for.  But what if despite its glaring flaws you still have fond, nostalgic memories from when you first played it, and want to experience it again. My advice is still no.  You can get this game and its two prequels for FREE if you buy Carmageddon: Reincarnation, which in my opinion is a far better investment, especially considering how well Reincarnation itself is already panning out.\n\nSorry for the wall of text there, (it seemed shorter in my head) but tl;dr: Don't buy this game.","December 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 25 of 57 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","25","57","0","7"

It has various faults, namely a crashing bug on one of the missions and no music.\n\nBut I have played this game before on disc and got it here on Steam because I lost my original disc.\n\nSo I will base my review on the game I played on disc.\n\nTDR is...and always will be, the black sheep of this family.  Its not as good as its older siblings Carma 1 and Carma 2...but its not to say its a bad game in general.  Far from it, it is quite enjoyable.  Its different in that the game has the guts to be a little different.  Hows it so different? you ask.  Its got STORY to it.  Albeit a rather tried and tested style of story, but a story none the less.\n\nBasically the rich and the police walled off cities in a bid to keep the " Drogs, Dregs and the Scum" out of them for a life of peace and tranquility.  They even went as far as NUKING areas to limit and cripple the outside populace.  So this sets up TDR as a post-apocalyptic game.  It does that rather well in the settings that you race around in, especially the city areas where you see wrecked buildings, motorways, hoards of people around bin-fires to keep warm ect, coupled with the police patrols to keep survivors and gangs in check.\n\n\nNow TDR does return to Carma 1 roots in a way, in that you can upgrade your car in a garage pre-race or mission as opposed to the odd Carma 2 way of doing it on the fly in a race or mission.  But it also has the Carma 2 way of dealing with new cars in that what you wreck, is there to buy for you post-race and the opponent cars are pretty nice, they are in the spirit of Carmageddon.  IE theres useless little cars thats nothing more then just an easy wreck, all the way to trucks, which...yeah...they are trucks.\n\nIt's got a smoother art style the games before it and does look good.  Impacts do a good job of peeling away and hitting off parts of vehicles that are unfortunate to be hit, much like Carma 2, but I think a bit better then that actually.  The game is a bit meaner though in areas such as time awarded for killing peds, hitting and wrecking others, but it softens the blow a bit by making checkpoints give time, so in a sence giving racing a much bigger incentive then previous titles.\n\nThe biggest complaint, and I feel its the same for a lot of others who played this, are a certain type of misson.  The type where you have to collect 3 pieces of something, usually a bomb.  I'm not against this type of mission, but sweet jeez, theres LOADS of them and they are tedious to do.  One little mess up and those 5 minutes you spent doing that mission, are for naught.  And you will mess up often cus i feel the driving in this game is not as tight as it should be.  Almost an afterthought in my opinion.\n\nTDR is a Carma game, theres no doubt on that, but it will be overshadowed by those older brothers of Carma 1 and 2, however, the game isnt as bad as people make it to be.  Its Carma...but...I guess call it Carma Light....Carma Decaf.  It will still do the job just fine and at £3 currently, its not much to give this a go.  I played worse and paid 10x as much for other titles of a particular game series, so really its not bad for small out-lay.  Give it a shot and see what you think.  Just hoping for the game on here to get fixed up though, cus no music ( despite it being poor ) makes the game feel empty.","December 27, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play Carmageddon games since the demo of Carma 1 came out, all the way to TDR 2000, and still own the box versions. And of course I finished TDR 2000 many times and played it for dozens of hours, before Steam was even invented. This is the most hated Carmageddon game out there, even after the dissaster called Carmageddon: Reincarnation. But I never saw a real reason behind that, so I recommend this game to anyone who liked Carma 1 and 2, it's a decent game all around.\n\nPros:\n+ Everything you might want from a Carma game is there\n+ Funny missions (much better than in Carma 2)\n+ Nice looking graphics that aged well\n+ The single player campaign is quite long and challenging\n\nCons:\n- too much missions for some\n- compatibility problems\n- less time in races\n\nAbout the game:\nAs a follow up to Carma 2, TDR adds even more missions, now after every race there is a mission. Some people never liked missions in Carma to begin with, but missions in TDR make much more sense than in Carma 2, have an actual story behind them, and some are quite hillarious.\nThere is plenty of cars in TDR, but all of them are new, not a sinle good ol' ride from Carma 1&2. The new cars are good looking and most are fun to drive, but most people me included miss the old cars.\nAll of the maps have a bit "post-apo" feeling to them which not everyone likes, but they are big enough and vary a lot.\nThe visuals are a matter of taste, but I always loved the graphic. It is much more vivid and colorful game to look at that both it's predecessors. And in my opinion it stood the test of time very well.\nAbout compatibility I can only say that while I had some problems initially, now the game runs on Windows 7 absolutely without any problems.\n\nCarmageddon races always were time limited and you have to collect time by "various carmageddon means". In TDR the time you can collect is capped at 4 mins and you get a lot less time for everything, especially at higher difficulties. This makes the races more challenging, but it's a bit shame since you have a lot less time to explore the maps. This was probably the biggest issues I had with the game, but you can get used to it. My verdict is while Carmageddon 1&2 are better games overall, TDR 2000 is a good game that I would recommend to everyone who is interested in Carmageddon games.\n\nWhy Stainless hates this game:\nAll SCI ex-carma developers, headed by Noby, trash talk this game every time the have a chance. Why? Because they did not get to develop this game, and that's it. I don't know the story behind why this game was handed to Torus to develop instead of SCI, but Torus did a good job and I what Noby&rest are saying about them is just a disgusting slander. Would they made a better 3rd Carma game back then? Maybe, we'll never know. But after they made the excrement called Reincarnation, and then run away with our money, they don't get to say anything.","August 3, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
