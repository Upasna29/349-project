"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/recommended/396860/","jfietkau","jfietkau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/","6646 products in account","When you're traveling through a war zone on foot during a storm, you tend to not be very picky when an opportunity to find shelter presents itself. This is how one wounded former soldier, having abandoned his comrades during one of North America's many formative wars in the early 1800s, winds up in a shed together with a young Native American girl waiting out the storm. The shared experience is sure to tear down some of the cultural barriers between them, but will others be too sturdy to be toppled just like that?\n\nOver The Hills And Far Away is a short kinetic novel (a visual novel without choice-based story branches), developed and self-published on Steam by WarGirl Games in collaboration with Collateral Damage Studios and Seycara Music and Arts. It uses western-influenced visuals as opposed to the more common anime style, and tells its story in about three hours.\n\nThe VN is built on the Ren'Py engine and has full SteamPlay support on Windows, Mac and Linux, which is something that I personally greatly appreciate. You can save and load at any time (somewhat curiously, the developer chose to provide no less than 250 save slots). It runs in fullscreen or windowed mode, and while it does not quite achieve full 1080p graphics, it runs at a very comfortable widescreen resolution slightly above 720p. The characters are not voiced, and at the time of this review, the VN is only available in English.\n\nThe visual style, while having some anime influences, is pretty unique and distinct from most other VNs on Steam. It makes expert use of color and lighting to set the tone, the backgrounds are as pretty as they are detailed and always fun to look at. The character sprites and CGs tend to be consistent between one another, and the characters have strong visual designs. While the coloring and most of the drawing technique is impeccable, I have to nitpick about the faces. The artist is good enough at drawing faces for it not to be too jarring, but they often end up looking kind of wooden or distorted and not really fitting the rest of the body. In one instance this actually made me laugh when a character was clearly supposed to be looking angry, but ended up looking more like he was struggling with constipation. That is the one unfortunate weak spot in the otherwise delightful painterly artwork.\n\nSince I don't have the knowledge to assess whether the soundtrack has any particular relevance to the time period of the story, I can only say that it seemed well-produced and always fit the mood. It's one of those immersive soundtracks that you tend not to notice anymore after a while, which can be a good thing, even though it makes it hard to identify any stand-out tracks (besides the vocal track during the credits that I enjoyed very much). That said, I really have to highlight the sound effect engineering in this VN, which feels like it has a unique little bit of audio for almost everything that happens. It's clear that a lot of attention to detail went into the sound design, and the result is impressive. In this particular regard it may actually the best VN I've read so far. The only sound problem that I noticed is that the background music does not loop very well and you frequently hear it fade out before starting over from the beginning. This is a common problem that always challenges my immersion unnecessarily and I wish more developers would take it into account. That said, if this is the worst audio problem that I can find, then that says more about what they did right than what they did wrong.\n\nI always perk up a little when I see someone announcing a VN with an interesting original setting, and in this regard Over The Hills And Far Away certainly brings something valuable to the table. I don't know all that much about American history, so a lot of the context of the war and the motivations of the various factions were undoubtedly lost on me, but it's worth noting that I never felt like I was being admonished for that. The story carries all the context that it needs to function, and I would imagine that many aspects of this story would transfer with little issue to many other wars in human history, so this title is not only for the history buffs to appreciate. If you are hoping to learn more about Shawnee culture from this VN, you are likely to be disappointed, as what little information it gives about them stays on a very superficial level. This is not an educational story (in the scholarly sense) like, for example, Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) tries to be.\n\nAs original as the setting is, the rest of the broader plot framework unfortunately cannot keep pace. The tragic story of the battle-hardened warrior meeting the innocent little girl is a safe genre staple, which regrettably also makes it feel a little stale. You know there will be a time period of the two warming up to each other, you know there will be lots of moments of joy, and you know it's going to tug at your heartstrings a bit. That's all just fine, and taken by itself every one of those moments works well, but you tend to see the heartstring-tugging coming from a mile away if you've read a few stories of this kind before, so depending on your own degree of genre-savvy cynicism, there's a tangible risk that this story might leave you feeling like you just went through the motions again.\n\nAll that is not to say that the writing isn't good, it's merely not particularly innovative. I'm under the impression that Over The Hills And Far Away is the first "big" serious project of its writer, and sticking closely to a proven story archetype was probably not a bad idea at all. The writing shows very few rookie mistakes (some misplaced humour, some overreliance on clich√©s) in an otherwise rock-solid and immersive experience, and I have high hopes for the raw talent of the writer, who I'm sure will spread his creative elbows out a little more for his next work.\n\nI've often said that a great execution can do a lot to make up for some things that the framework may be lacking, and this is definitely true for Over The Hills And Far Away. I've already talked about the attention to detail in the sound design, but the same excellence extends to almost all other detail areas of the VN. When the protagonists are walking through a forest, you can see the thicket draw leafy shadows on the character sprites that lightly sway in the wind, the animated fog effects are a joy to look at, and the occassional sprite animation when a character falls down or climbs a tree just gives the whole thing an aura of authenticity that you only get when the developers pay ample attention to the little things. Over The Hills And Far Away is practically polished to a mirror sheen.\n\nEven if it breaks less new literary ground than the setting made me hope initially, I have no qualms giving Over The Hills And Far Away a positive recommendation. There's almost nothing to it that needs criticism, and at the end of the day it is an enjoyable story with a very competent presentation. For people who dislike anime-style art, this is an obvious recommendation. Everyone else will have to weigh it against other VNs that they have not read yet and ask themselves whether the setting and the attention to detail are strong enough selling points.","September 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 89 of 94 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","89","94","8","6"

Over the Hills and Far Away, a debut kinetic visual novel by War girl Games focuses on the aftermath of a battle when the British Empire suffered a major defeat and Procter abandoned his army. Our protagonist, William Aubrey survived the battle and has ran to an abandoned farmhouse where he meets a young Shawnee girl called Mai hiding from the storm.\n\nThemes  and Characters\n\nThe characters are well defined in the short time we spend with them. We get a real sense of their personalities, motives and backgrounds. The story has some light touches  thanks to the character of young Mai, a counterpart to the world weary and cynical Aubrey. Mai, despite being a smart cookie and resilient, in her childish actions delivers some sweet, funny moments. She remains upbeat throughout the story which rubs off on Aubrey. He may try to convince himself of his selfish intentions  but I see Mai as Aubrey's first trajectory for the redemption he seeks.\n\nHome and Identity are two strong themes running through this story. Aubrey feels like an alien in a fractured country and is looking for his own place to belong and call home. Their methodologies may vary but both he and Jackson are both looking for independence, home and freedom. Mai, on the other hand has a strong sense of home and belonging from her religious beliefs and community.\n\nMusic and Artwork\n\nThere is a lovely use of orchestral music by Seycara Music and Arts . It is not intrusive and matches the ambience for each moment. A particular standout piece I noticed is the field scene. The final song at the credits, After All, have some lovely vocals by Sagispon. The artwork doesn't have the usual anime aesthetics instead opting for a soft, muted pastel look. It makes good use of tones, light and attention to detail.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601111381\n\nConclusion\n\nThe game is short running at around the three hour mark but is within the normal steam price range. Despite the shortness I feel that it was the correct length and successfully managed to get a sense of the characters and the story. History would tell you a different story about how about how most Native Indians were treated but if Disney can do it with Tiana in Disney's Princess  and the Frog why can't War Girl Games? They both want to give us some heart warming entertainment. so we should let it go...\n\nI highly recommend this as Over the Hills and Far Away, like The 39 Steps, will appeal to a wider audience as well. This is due to the lack of anime tropes, aesthetics, atypical story and unusual setting which may have some extra appeal for history enthusiasts.","January 19","true","7.8"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","39","40","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/396860/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","No matter who wins or loses a war there is always pain left behind -for the victor, the vanquished, and even for those who try to remain neutral. Set in the War of 1812, Over The Hills And Far Away tells the story of a soldier and a little girl on the run in a harsh and unforgiving world. This game is a kinetic visual novel, meaning there are no choices to be made, the entire experience is reading. While this may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea the story itself is very much worth it as this is an engrossing piece of historical fiction.\n\nIn the game you follow an Englishman named William Aubrey, a redcoat who was conscripted into the British army and sent to fight in North America. While the game doesn‚Äôt require you to be an expert in American history it does require you understand the basics of the period. Aubrey, as the game refers to him, has abandoned his regiment due to its poor leadership and is now wounded, on the run from his own countrymen and American forces. Aubrey takes refuge in an old barn sharing the space with a young native girl.  Finding her name too hard to pronounce, he nicknames her ‚ÄúMai‚Äù. What follows is a touching story of two people from different worlds trying to find the same thing- safety and happiness. Through Mai‚Äôs innocence Aubrey becomes slightly less jaded and more aware of the plight of the native people in America, a theme featured heavily in the game.\n\nThe artwork in the game is lovely, the models are well done and really express each character‚Äôs personality. There aren‚Äôt many characters in the game as most of the time is spent with Aubrey and Mai and we rarely see much of Aubrey at all so a lot of the time you are stuck looking at just the background images while reading text. Thankfully, there are a few scattered cutscenes mixed in during certain plot points which add to the visual appeal of the game. The music is also enjoyable, fitting of the time period and location of the story. You can purchase the soundtrack separately as well.\n\nThe game is a visual novel and being as there are no choices to be made there is little in terms of gameplay here. The game runs well, all the menus are easy to read and you are given basic options that I feel any visual novel should have; mainly adjusting the text speed and the ability to put the text on autoplay. Since it is a kinetic novel, the autoplay feature allows you to sit back and relax while reading along. The game also has a gallery so that you can look at past cutscenes, concept art and background art at your leisure.\n\nThis is an outstanding piece of work, the story is rich and the characters are enjoyable and I found them easy to relate to as well. I enjoyed the historical background of the story, I even learned a few things as well. Over The Hills And Far Away has many different layers to it, the harshness of war, the treatment of native people, a person‚Äôs own struggle to find where they belong but it‚Äôs all told wonderfully in this visual novel format with great art and music to move along with the story. The game also has Steam trading cards and achievements that you can easily get by just playing through the story so that is also an added bonus. It may not be the happiest of stories, but most happy stories to come out of war are despite the war, not because of it.  It‚Äôs worth reading, so open yourself up to something new.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproduction.com]","April 16","true","6.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I think it was just over $5. I am not through with it as of the time of this writing and will probably not update my review, but I can tell that I am close to the end. This is a good story, decent writing, some humour, some heartbreak, really puts you in the moment of what is happening to the characters. Can't speak of the ending yet as again, I am not there, but the majority of the game has been good. While there is little interactivity, they really do add things to the story visually and audiotorilly (not sure what the right word is here) that enhance the experience more than if you were reading it out of a book. Character portraits, moving character portraits, maps, sounds of random stuff like hiccuping or door creaking, shaking the camera when someone falls or snatches something out of someones hand, shadows from the sun shining through the trees, little flames shooting up from a fire, etc. Some of the art is absolutely beautiful and some seems a little less well done, but none of it is bad imo. It just seems rather inconsistent in quality but this does not detract from the novel much. The real draw here is the setting. I don't think I've ever seen a setting in a video game about this time period (war of 1812) that was story based. Just a very unique visual novel and if you can get it for around 5 bucks it is totally worth it. $9 seems a tad expensive for around 3-4 hours of content but the story is quite good so who knows maybe you will value it more.\n\n\nEDIT: Sooo I wasn't going to update this at all but the ending really blew me away. It was brilliantly done. Saying anything more than that is borderline spoilers but IMO the ending sequence, art, and ending song on the credits are really beautiful. Really made me think philisophically (sp?) about things, much more than a game normally would. With that being said, I would now say this game is definitely worth $9 but still try picking it up on sale if you can.","February 15","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was an enjoyable read and followed a setting that I find intriguing, that being the War of 1812.\n\nSince Reviews should have some Pros and Cons, I guess I can provide that:\n\nPros:\n-Nice Character designs and Backgrounds\n-Good character writing (But can come off as kind of generic for some of them)\n-Interesting story (Better if you aren't like me who thinks too much about it and winds up unsurprised at the end)\n-Music isn't annoying and blends in with the story\n-Unique Setting. Not many games are set during the War of 1812. Although it has been glossed over in most nation‚Äôs histories (UK and US, minus the Star Spangled Banner and MAYBE the White House Burning.) It has become important for Canadians and their national Identity. (Half con, an idea not brought out in the game but would have been unrelated to the story) For that, I give it props.\n\nCons:\n-Short. Lasted me around three hours, and a lot of that was because I kept the game running from time to time while I was away. Probably shorter if you're a fast reader.\n-No replayablitiy since it's a linear game with no branching paths. I would only replay it if I wanted to re-read the story, but I highly doubt I will.\n-Sometimes the Grammar is a little off and can cause you to sit there being like "What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• do they mean?" or something. (Bad for Grammar Nazis probably)\n\n*MINOR SPOILERS BELOW*\n\nHistorical Nitpicks *MINOR SPOILERS* (I have some Knowledge of War of 1812 History and found some small unimportant issues, but it‚Äôs fun to nitpick them anyway) *MINOR SPOILERS*:\n-US Rank insignia displayed improperly. A Captain in the US Army is represented with One Epaulette (The fringy things on the shoulder) on the Right Arm, not Two on both. Both shoulders indicate Staff Officers from Major to Colonel.\n-Aubrey‚Äôs Uniform is a little weird. For a man in the Enlisted ranks to have BOOTS of all things is strange, he‚Äôs probably have shoes and spats on instead. I don‚Äôt think his uniform matches with the Regiment he served in, but I always get a little lost with those details.\n-General Proctor does suck.\n- Where is his Captain‚Äôs Hat? Americans love their massive Officer hats. Also, I dislike the lack of Shako representation.\n\nI hope this works out and helps you decide on whether to get it or not.","February 11","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
