But I keep trying because eventually I find titles like this that make it worthwhile.\n\nWhat made this title standout for me? In this particular case, I couldn't find a character in the story that I did not like. Even the most unlikable one had a certain malevolent charm. With many stories I find I'm barely moved by the protagonist, let alone the supporting characters. In this story, I was so interested in the supporting characters I felt I had to get the original story immediately. Also, the voice acting for the whole lot of them was impressive even when compared to mainstream expensive titles. They seemed so energetic and invested, it made it much more fun.\n\nThis is primarily why I recommend this game. I feel there is a good chance other visual novel fans will really like these characters as well. Additionally, the storyline itself is very enjoyable, the political/debate system intriguing, and the visuals engaging.\n\nA couple cautions. First, not all text is voiced, mainly just the major parts of the storyline. I purchased the title without expecting the voices so it was just a bonus for me. Second, it can be more difficult to win the debate mini-game if you don't focus on one character/house to support. Call me neutral or wishy-washy, but I kept spreading my points around even when it meant losing some debates. Still, I got the ending I was hoping for, so I'm not complaining.","March 16","true","4.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

It's a prequel to story presented here, but you won't have any difficulties understanding what's going on if you skip previous game - actually, I recommend it, since here, they went with some sort of "canon" ending for Serafina, so it may be quite disappointing to see your decisions don't have any impact. What I remember about story in the first game? Not much really. A little bit about setting and lore, few characters (many of which have a important role in "Serafina's Crown" as well, or at least make a cameo or are mentioned by someone) and the feeling that it was "alright" game. Just it. It was okay. Writing was solid, but not very engaging, story was long and detailed, but, at certain points, badly paced and not deep enough. Various, yet not so interesting endings and a lot of characters with great potential, that didn't seem to be fully used.\n\nSo what about this game? It does almost everything right. I was a bit concerned at the very begging (because of one too dramatic, emotional good-bye scene), but the story quickly pays off. Game mechanic (regarding very interesting necklace) is great, I enjoyed the debates (although they are really easy once you get used to the system) and its consequences. Characters are unique and even though some of them feel a bit "stereotypical", they all have a certain depth to them. I like the politics in this game, the various intrigues (although I wish there was more of it, especially regarding main character), military setting, lore and many different ways of approaching the situation - plus reactions of other characters if you choose to agree or disagree with them. Everything feels natural and realistic, which makes the game very engaging.\n\nBad things about this game? Well, I wouldn't say it's really "bad", but I found voice acting really not suitable for the characters and at certain points few "groans" made me laugh. I know why many developers these days decide to voice their games - because players demands it, but I've never seen the appeal in this, since in so many instances, the voices are not "professionally" done and thus take away from immersion instead of adding to it.\n\nTo put it shortly: It's great, engaging story and a deep, unique visual novel with so many different outcomes and high replayability, which makes it worth so much more that the base price. Try it.","June 5","true","10.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Although I guess some would say a visual novel is not a game per se, I disagree. Serafina’s Crown is an active adventure filled with intrigue, murder plots, mischievous Gods and choices that can change a Kingdom.  Odell is thrust into court politics as the reluctant Regent desperate to complete her family duties and return to her beloved Lorenzo, however the longer she spends in her role the more she realizes each house is lead by a ruler with their own agenda and their own desire for the Crown.  The choices you make direct the flow of the story and the information and relationships you develop.  Whether it be developing friendships with old enemies, actively flirting with your court guide or pleasing a God, each one turns the story to a new direction and revelation.  You are aided in these decisions by mini debates where you challenge other heads of the families in decisions over the realm.  Win or lose, these debates shift the balance of power within the kingdom.  Who did murder Queen Belatrix and will they succeed her to the Crown and become Monarch?  I don’t know yet but I’m keen to read on and find out.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","4.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There are many different characters you can choose to support as the new ruler, more than Serafina like the title suggests...even yourself! There\'s also many you can romance, both GxB and GxG with most of the characters available to pursue. Besides choosing people, there are many other decisions from the good of the realm, to what you want to serve at a ball, to what color dress you want to wear and your decisions impact the color of your hair! Most of the characters were likable by the end, the game world is detailed, and the heroine has her own personality. Everything I like in a dating sim!","June 1","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has funny dialogue, good characters that are consistent and charming (for once, I found all of the romantic options to be good) and a really fun playing system that's very unique to this game. You end up hating the villian (letting you find out who that is for yourself) so much but in the way the writers intended. The art style is a perfect balance between being too cartoony and trying too hard to look real and failing. It's a fun, funny game with a mystery, a good progtagonist and very fun to replay between the different endings and the different way you can socialize.","May 18","true","20.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"
