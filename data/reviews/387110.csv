The statement of it being a modern bullet hell style shooter is ridculous, as the slow and lack of impact gameplay will immediately turn anyone who's played a SHMUP before off. With badly written dialogue, lacking visuals, absolutely NO sound effects, and a really really silly choice of using the mouse as the only means of controlling your ship, Shmup Love Boom fails on pretty much every level. And yes, clothes do get destroyed on the protagonist, but honestly, if you're that hard up for those kind of visuals, I'd like to introduce you to the thing called the internet. I'm still attempting to figure out how the pricing of 10 dollars and full price made sense. Avoid. Run.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/uWTNFDc5yaw\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nThe character models.....are ok I guess? What you'd expect from an anime influenced game.\n-:\nGameplay. Slow, SHMUP like only if you put it at 25% speed. It's boring.\nRestarting. Oh by the way, you know what you want to do when you're playing a visual novel/SHMUP? Start over when you lose all your lives. And have to go through the text again. Nope.\nControls. Store page says no controller support, OK Fine. But only Mouse controls that don't respond 1v1 to your movements, with a delay on them? How did this make sense?\nVisuals surprising make missiles hard to see, and generally is an eye sore.\nSound. Were you expecting sound effects in a SHMUP? Silly you.\nWriting. Typos. Bad dialogue. “I feel tingly.” I could go on.\nNo resolution options. Plays in a small window and that's it.\nThe fact that it tries to ask for 10 dollars, when games like Jigoku Kisetsukan blow it out of the water, and that game is free.\nPretty much everything.","September 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","56","65","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/387110/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Shmup Love Boom is a vertical bullet hell in where you play as some anime teenager who is the last hope to fight off the aliens. Your character has no name and you will be able to give him a name after completing the first mission. You will be accompanied by one of the two AI women of your choice and together you will fight your way through hordes of enemies. Your first choice is a purple haired girl that gives your ship missiles that fire randomly and the second is a brown haired girl that fires laser beams randomly. Each are dressed differently and will strip off more of their clothes each time you lose a life. True to the visual novel genre there is a lot of talking, mostly about uninteresting stuff like how you were the ace pilot of Earth even though you appear to be a 13 year old emo looking kid. There are tons of spelling mistakes in the game and is a rather uninteresting tale from what I have seen so far. I have not finished this game or played more than an hour for reasons I will state throughout the “review”.\n\nTo start off there is no full screen and when you try to alt+enter into it you will only see the upper left of the game. That means you will have to play on a tiny window. Okay, fine, I could live with that but you will soon discover that you control this game solely with the mouse. That is already a big mark against the game as most prefer using a controller or an arcade stick for this genre but due having to play on a tiny window with your ship being at the bottom, your mouse cursor will frequently go outside of the bounds of that window, causing you to lose control of your ship. In a genre where the slightest distraction will spell your doom that is a fatal flaw. Even if that were not a problem the controls feel floaty and delayed, it feels like you are dragging your ship around instead of being in full control. Your ship will automatically fire when you move around and it does remind you of a phone game though done much worse. Enemies are bullet spongey as well so there is no real sense of impact when you shoot them.\n\nThat lack of impact is also due to there being no sound effects. From you dying to projectiles being fired there are no sound effects to be found anywhere making the game feel drowned out by the music. Unfortunately the music is not all that great and gets old fast. So far we have terrible controls, no sound effects and are forced to play in a tiny window. Surely it can't get worse right? Wrong. Once you lose all of your 5 lives you will be thrown all the way back to the start of the game. While not uncommon for bullet hells (even though most feature continues) that is a terrible idea for visual novels as you have to go through all the text again and again. There is nothing interesting to be read the first time around so you can imagine how tiresome that would get. While fighting enemies they drop blue items that when enough are collected will upgrade your firing speed as well as other benefits. Sadly even collecting them is a pain, the range that you have to be to attract them is very low and even when you are in range it takes a long time for them to zoom into you which means a lot of them will be dropped as you are forced to dodge projectiles.\n\nThere is so very much wrong with this title. It may actually be less time consuming to list the positives of the game. The graphics are okay. That's pretty much it. Though they do not do a good job at distinguishing the projectiles and often times found myself killed by something I didn't see coming. At this point it really does feel like I am just picking on the title but it is not beyond redemption if more work is put into it. Fullscreen, savepoints, controller support and some other tweaks may make this title worth a play-through at such a low price. As it is right now there is no way I can suggest this title to anybody, it feels like a prototype of a game by people that don't understand how to make a bullet hell. I truly can't speak of it's worth as a Visual Novel given the low amount of time I put into this title but given it's uninteresting opening and common grammatical errors, it wasn't a compelling reason to force yourself to start from the very beginning every time you fail at the terrible bullet hell sections. The bullet hell sections add nothing to the visual novel and the visual novel adds nothing to the bullet hell gameplay. It is a Frankenstein of a game that will appeal to neither of the genre's fans.","December 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"

Tiresome Japanese style story spam before you get into the action.\n\nBut seriously, it's not for PC.  It runs in windowed mode, you can't even go to fullscreen, you have absolutely zero control over the graphics configuration.\n\nGameplay is the same as any other (but better) shoot'em up.  If you like shootemups, this is still not the game for you, because it's worse than all the other ones.","February 4","false","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I was so full of rage after playing it that I wanted to let my emotions settle. It just didnt happen though. SO Im just gong to bullet point my thoughts:\n1. The ship moves so ding dang slow. What the hell guys? hy did you think it was a good idea to make a shmup in which the ship feels like its moving thgouh cold honey?\n2. Too much jibber jabber!\n3. Everything looks so static. Work on brining your models to life\n4. The ship moves so slow. Wait... sorry, I mentioned that. But sseriously... Why? It kept telling me speed upgrade but the ship never went faster.\n5. I cant tell if Im actually causing any damage when I shoot the mother ship in the midle of the screen.\n6. The ship is too slow\n7. the music is like a 16 year olds idea of a good rave. its jus tthe same 2 bar pulse over and over.

The choosable waifu sub weapons don't really help much either\nThe selling point of the game, the story, is badly written, with spelling mistakes and poor grammar in it.\nThere are no sound effects, just the background music which isn't bad, but when it's all you hear, it really does get annoying.\nThe other thing that this game does is the lives system. When you die, your chosen waifu loses a bit of clothing, nothing too risque, they just end up in their underwear by the last life.\nSadly, even this was ultimately disappointing and could not redeem the game.\n\nOverall, I would give this a 2/10, playable but not for long.\n","April 20","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
