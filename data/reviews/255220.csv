"http://steamcommunity.com/id/low-rez/recommended/255220/","low-rez","lowrez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/low-rez/","559 products in account","Here are my neatly categorized observations about GRID Autosport (GA).\n\n►Controls:\nThere are no dead zone options for my Logitec F310 gamepad. There are no options to reduce steering lag (speed of my joystick motion vs steering input). Several users report that a bug from GRID 2 has cropped up in GA concerning steering wheel support. You might have trouble getting your favorite wheel working with GA.\n\n►Physics:\nSudden steering input does not result in under-steer as it should. The cars have a bias towards oversteer in almost every situation. Hitting debris such as broken car parts and cones has little to no effect. Everything feels like GRID 2 with more grip. The physics are not better than GRID 1.\n\n►Graphics:\nThe graphics look pretty good; especially after installing the high rez pack. Frame rates are fast on my Nvidia 750ti. However, the graphics feel like a step back from GRID 2. The building models of Chicago look WAY better in GRID 2. Blur cannot be disabled in the cockpit. IncGamers review of GA speculates that Codemasters have retrofitted all of the car interiors from a free community mod from GRID 2. Also the RPM and speedometer needles don't move. XD\n\n►Voices:\nTeammates say the same thing over and over. If you improve your times on each lap he'll literally say the same thing "thats the fastest lap this race" over and over. This is a clear step back from GRID 1 and a FAR CRY from DiRT 2.\n\n►AI:\nOn "very hard" difficulty the AI becomes EXTREMELY aggressive. You'll get hit and spun worse than any EA title. At lower difficulty levels the AI does show some signs of personality and can be mildly entertaining.\n\n►Online Gameplay:\nIn online mode you (supposedly) can race with friends and compete on leader boards. You can also buy, sell and tune cars. Multi-player is dead; the lobby is always empty. I've spent 3 hours waiting. 1 Hour for Friday night, 1 for Saturday afternoon and 1 for Sunday morning. The result? Not a soul showed up. It probably has to do with the fact that there are so many reports of cheating.\n\nAs for vehicle tuning I think its sad that a game like Gran Turismo 1 (from 1997) has a much more engrossing and detailed tuning system. The mods don't even feel all that effective. I tuned my engine, lowered the weight and adjusting my gearbox for a bit more acceleration (for a tight course). I'm a pretty good driver, holding several records on a few online racing sims. The result of my mods? Nadda. On average my lap times stayed the same. I call shenanigans!\n\n►Single Player Gameplay:\nSingle player gameplay does NOT include buying, selling or tuning cars. This is a grave mistake considering the multi-player situation. In single-player you will drive what your team tells you to drive; like it or not. If you don't like open-wheel racers TOO BAD! You will drive open-wheel racers to progress the game; like it or not. All so you can earn XP to go on to more events. LAME. Sadly none of the team building from GRID 1 made it to GA. Too bad.\n\n►Summary:\nThe game feels rushed and has poor production value. Models and program-code are reused from GRID 2 and possibly even ripped from free community mods. There is no motivation to race in single-player and there are no people to race in multi-player. All I wanted was to earn some dough, buy a car and tune it. And wouldn't it be fun to build a team and climb the charts? All in single player of course!\n\nI don't recommend this title on any level whatsoever. If you already own it I don't recommend buying the season pass. If you're looking for a great simcade grab GRID 1 or Need for Speed Shift (1 and 2 are both great). Heck, I'd even recommend Test Drive Unlimited 2 over this.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review. Please push yes or no so I know if its helpful. :)","June 24, 2014","false","36.4"," 1,359 of 1,603 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","359","1","0","44"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/255220/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","UPDATED: 5th Sept 14 Patch\n\nThere is much emotion within the community in this latest instalment to the GRID series. It's been promoted as the ‘community's game’ with many of the new additions/changes from GRID 2 being done based on our feedback. Many love it & many despise it, with myself falling in the middle as I feel both viewpoints when I play.\n\nAlthough this may read as a negative (& long lol) review, let me state straight off the bat that GRID Autosport (GAS) is a solid racing game, its fast, challenging & fun to drive with a good selection of tracks (some new, some old), a decent range of balanced cars & various modes to choose from. At the end of the day that is what a good racing game should deliver & is why I give it a 'Thumbs Up' overall. It is easy to sink a lot of hours into GAS. That being said, although I do think this is a decent improvement over GRID 2 (and more closely aligned to GRID 1), it is still most lacking from being the definitive PC racing experience for me, so let me explain in more detail.\n\nOne of the main disappointments for me was the Career mode. Actually, not really a Career it’s more an offline practice mode for your multiplayer career, as it primarily only a series of single events. Each series is a season (huh?), and you simply progress by completing each series in sequence for each racing discipline. Once you reach certain level, you unlock the GRID Tournament events which are larger playlist of all racing disciplines (with around 10 events). There are about 500 races in total which is approximately three times as many races as career in GRID 2, but this is basically it! It's boring!\n\nYou cannot run your own team as in GRID 1, as in GAS you are a driver for hire, so no choice of car, livery or sponsors etc. Nothing to work towards collecting or unique events (like 24 Hours of Le Mans) to aim for, or other things you need to unlock... it’s just mindlessly follow the event list. Team co-op would have been nice to see in GAS, but obviously not setup with that in mind (focus clearly seems to be on Multiplayer, but more on that later). There is also no choice to specialise your career to say just Touring Cars or stick with one team, as you are forced to complete all disciplines & teams seem random based on the event.\n\nAI is an improvement to a degree, with much tougher competition to contend with from GRID1-2, which is a huge plus to the experience. They still suffer from being overly aggressive, will not honour racing line and will often cause you to have multiple restarts after the notorious first corner. Still with the improved physics, handling & damage models in GAS, it makes it less hurtful than getting hit by AI in GRID2, let’s say, but it remains a source of frustration. In the end it forces you to race aggressively too, rather than racing a 'proper' race.\n\nLikewise with the AI, it seems to have minimal randomness, from seemingly predictable lap times to the driving results. In offline 'ahem career' mode, your racing team mate will almost always finish last making it unlikely, even when you win every race, that your team will win the event. I also noticed some strange behaviour when team mate is winning all through the race & you overtake, he almost immediately drops position after position every time! Also a little odd, the AI seem to race faster than qualifying laps. You could be 6-8 seconds ahead in qualify, yet struggle to keep up in the race or find on some tracks the AI are always super-fast & others they are always super-slow; they seem predefined and not adaptable to your experience.\n\nAI get a boost at race start so you always play catch-up for the first few corners, which means you miss out on all the starting grid hustle or you start on pole and get taken out from behind! These sort of issues end up drawing your attention the more you play & end up breaking your immersion.\n\nMoving on from Career & AI, the Multiplayer online component of GAS has got more positive feature changes. There is a much longer progression curve, where you also level up your purchased cars to provide more modification. You can join a club (or create your own) & compete against your friends & the world. Clubs seem to be underutilised (no event creation, no group racing, no club vs club, limited in-game info/management). There is an improved Global Challenges with tough times & decent rewards. Overall, I have found the online racing experience to be much better than in GRID 2. Damage is more severe (& costly) although this unfortunately doesn't prevent bad drivers taking you out first corner, or any corner for that matter (Kick from game is improved tho :)).\n\nMatchmaking & finding games still needs much improvement. Online play is still region locked, which was a big issue in GRID 2 still not addressed for those outside of UK/US. It means for players like me in Australia, where online games are limited that I cannot race with others around the world without changing my Steam client region. This segments the community & is compounded by a lack of visibility of the games in progress to see what you might like to join. Matchmaking is good to have but not at the expense of manually finding games too; this is console-centric online play not PC in my view. You eventually give up trying to find a specific active game mode as it normally isn't populated with any active games anyways (& you don't know what is), so you just choose the Random playlist.\n\nIt would have been great to also be able to create your own customised playlists in advance & save them for selection later online. So you can prepare as a host & setup some unique configurations for others to race.\n\nMost of these issues or limitations I have highlighted you can live with, although not as good as I expected, there is enough done decently to make it fun to race! Those that wanted the cockpit view however, may be disappointed as this is not much more than an in-car angle, blurry without a real cockpit functionality. Not an issue for me, but just to mention for others that might be an important factor.\n\nOmitted from the original release version due to issues was Time Trial mode. This has returned in the July 14 patch (in limited form). You can only choose the primary circuits (not the 100+ variations), no reverse tracks & selection is limited to the discipline. Still no friends times in career mode (ala GRID 2) nor any online times recorded. Great to have this feature finally to compete with your friends, but is lessened by limited implemenation.\n\nThere are other artificial limitions throughout GAS, such as limited garage slots, limited custom cup events to 5, limited number of laps, or the extra long multiplayer grind. Rather than fixing some of these, CM instead brings out a XP Booster & Garage Pack DLCs for us to buy! These are a joke & are simply a money grabbing endeavor providing a solution to a problem they created. Shameful!\n\nPlayers from GRID 2 will also find a lot of reused components in GAS, such as cars/wheels/logos/livery patterns/tracks. This is not necessarily a bad thing to maximise the amount of content & customisation, but it does feel light on new content. I would have liked to see more of everything or at least some integrated modding support for community to create its own?\n\nGAS is still a blast but it's far from a perfect game. I think CM can do better which is why I feel disappointment seeing some of the corners cut in GAS (pun intended .. time penalty enforced!). The 4k UHD Texture pack brings GAS back up to code graphically, but still feels more like an expansion to GRID 2. Can't help but to feel its rushed & not well enough rounded (or refined) to be a real classic!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","July 7, 2014","true","180.2"," 250 of 290 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","250","290","0","17"

Here's the shortish version.\nI'd just upgraded and sent my old parts to a friend who is currently out of work in Greece. Hi Miatakias\n\nHe NEEDED to upgrade and no-one I knew wanted the bits. So off they went.\nHe fitted them but after he installed his current GFX card drivers he got blank screen. Nothing we tried fixed it nor did any suggestions from these forums or others.\nThen I stumbled on an official 5 month old thread on their site saying a fix is still weeks away.\nHaving 2 AMD 6970's on the go and a pair of replacements planned, I decided to send him one of my 6970's as well. For me it meant playing half speed for a while but at least I COULD play.\n\nLoore had sent me a message and asked me about Miatakias' problem, I told him the above story and that the GFX card was going soon.\nMiatakias was over the moon with the parts when we got them running and asked if I was going to buy GAS? if so he wanted to buy it for me as thank you for the parts I'd sent.\n\nI contacted Loore later to let him know all was now ok with the PC and how Miatakias reacted, I got this back.\n"Loore May 10\nTell him not to buy your copy, I've got it covered  Consider it a reward for helping make the GRID community a better place."\nCool, a freebe for bein a nice guy and helping someone out\n\nTo my surprise, when Loore contacted me again. He supplied me with a passcode for the game plus the access to the press preview levels and cars we've seen in vids. Stroll on!\nAll hush, hush till now so here goes..\n\n\nA week with Grid Autosport.\n\n16 hours played and tested as I write this and upload some eyefinity vids.\n\n1st off. The big one... The handling, Is it any good? Did they listen to all the whining we did?\n\nOoooohhh yes it's good VERY good, and yes again, they did listen to us fans of old and acted on it (or most of it so far?).\nFINALLY! After years of waiting, we get a trueblooded, direct descendant of Grids epic gameplay.\nGrippy cars on tarmac that you need to DRIVE to succeed. Slide any race car about like you had to in Grid 2 and you'll fail at the first corner.\n\nDriving Autosport right on the limits of speed vs grip round Istanbul Park intermediate and the old grey matter started fizzing again, those Grid ingrained responses to what I was seeing on screen and feeling through the wheel took over and the Grin was back.\n\nThe assists are of the same style as Grid 1, where turning them off made every car soo much harder to control leading to slower lap times.\nParadoxically though turning off the assists in GAS lead to the opposite, better times than I got when they were on. I might have been fighting with the stability control instead of letting it do its job here.\nPrecise throttle control is critical for success but you reap the rewards for such restraint. so analogue controllers or wheels will do well, no idea regarding KB as I never had much in the way of KB skills to start with.\n\nBear in mind this is press preview and not full release. Only 4GBs it's just the core game elements I'm playing with. I'm playing on this lot.\n\nAMD 9590 @5GHz, Asus Sabretooth Rev 2, 16GB DDR3 @2133MHz, Sapphire 8GB R9 290X all running 3 screens @ 5932x1080 maxxed out GFX, AA, AF settings etc with 50 fps as a minimum. Using my old and trusted DFGT wheel for the tricky bits.\n\nSo Here's some vids of the basic career modes, All in eyefinity taken using fraps and saved using windows live movie maker.\n\n1st up, Touring cars Istanbul Park Intermediate.\n\nThe racing is just as much fun as the original Grid was for me. trading paint with a bit of shoulder barging here and there, got slapped by the corner cut system, so that works.\nThe "x5 race" option made for same fun racing over 15 or 20 laps but be warned, In 1 event  I lead from pole and no contact with the AI cars, I lost 5th gear all the rest were fine this made the last 2 laps  somewhat interesting.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/_XcgMprvQYg\n\nStreet Racing, Washington in the Mini Cooper S Works\n\nTrying to get the "lift off" corners just right was soo much fun. as was trying to get clean passes.\nI DID manage a complete race with no contact in this class but it was hard to get, you'll see why....\n\nhttp://youtu.be/2P4_-BDfidU\n\nDrift Tuner, An essential for myself and a few others around here.\n\nRuined in Grid 2 with tea tray on ice handling, Drift's back to the circuits (or 1 at least in the preview) Tracks are split into "Score sectors" so no multilap chains of drifts scaring off all but the pro's.\nPrecise control inputs are a must here if you want to look like a pro\nYou can still hoon it like a BOSS with style and get points, I'm off for some much needed practice....;D\n\nhttp://youtu.be/HgFNrsVQjNA\n\nhttp://youtu.be/I4M0PYsZpBw\n\nhttp://youtu.be/nuWe8y2luWQ\n\nOpen Wheel, Yas Marina (and dodgy cockpit view)\n\nSlipstreaming is back just a shame the cockpit view looks like it's "unfinished" or an "afterthought"  at best and so it's of no practical use to the headcam, hud off players.\nThe mirrors are like impresionist black and white paintings of the skyline behind you.\nLike a tiny wee policeman pops up wherever you look saying "Nothing to see here, move along..." This has to be unfinished or the Modders got some work to do again....\nAgain though, it's only the press preview surely it'll be better for launch day\n\nhttp://youtu.be/bg79ms19tGo\n\nEndurance, be careful, this category bites.... No pit stops.\n\nTyre wear in Grid? HUH? Well much as I wouldn't have missed it, it does add a big tactical element to your driving. In an 8 minute race grip dissapears like an ice cube in a volcano, I kid you not.\n1st try, I shot off into the blue, by the end of a lap I shredded 20% in less than 1:30 and had none for the end. You really neeed to nurse the tyres as on the 2nd try I used only 6% in one lap and still won the race albeit with 30 and 32% left of the rear tyres.\nPit stops would help here but it's about tyre management instead of outright speed.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/mn1sr0ca4HI\n\nAs I said above it's the core of the game here and no where near complete, though with the way it handles, looks and plays right now I would be buying a copy without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nFerreted about in the mp section and found a few gems when looking at tracks,\nYou might wanna add to the confirmed track list RallyDriven\n\nhttp://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/289/grid-autosport-confirmed-cars-tracks-features/p1\nAutodromo Do Algarve\nIndianapolis\nOkutama\nHong Kong\nRed Bull Ring\nAutosport Raceway\nBarcelona\naaaaand SPAAAA!!!\n\nNo other tracks/locations listed and no cars as a load is still locked in career mode or limited by it being in essence an abridged and unfinished version.\n\nIf I find out there's more to it between now and launch I'll keep you posted while I work on some more vids.\nPost edited by SRS13Rastus1701 at 2:28PM","May 28, 2014","true","980.0"," 1,297 of 1,705 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","297","1","0","128"

The Tuner and Street disciplines are too similar and I feel it would have been better to have some sort of off-road discipline instead.\n\nPros.\n\nVehicle damage. From full on physical damage to progressive gearbox and clutch damage.\nPretty visuals most of the time and everything outside looks clean and crisp.\nGood track atmosphere, planes, helicopters, crowds, pits and even tannoy announcements.\nLoads of cars on the track, gritty racing, when the A.I doesn't try and kill you.\n\nNeither good or bad.\nDriving physics, the mix of simulation and arcade isn't to my taste, it's more towards arcade than simulation and I would have liked it to feel more alive and direct. Often the cars feel like they float and you're not even connected to the tarmac.\nDisciplines, some people will think it's great to be able to choose "5" "different" disciplines for each season but if you don't like a discipline you still need to complete it in order to unlock the 5th discipline. There's no distinction in terms of race rules between the disciplines so they all feel so similar and that's my issue with them.\n\nCons.\n\nThe A.I is horrible, they just seem to follow a set path and totally ignore the player and as you might say they're on rails.\nAnother issue with the A.I is their pace, they're extremely inconsistent, you can catch them quite easily but once you're in front of them suddenly they spring to life and you cannot shake them, unless they're Ravenwest Motorsport and once they're in front they're are extremely difficult to catch.\n\nThe tracks. There's 22 full GP circuits, what CodeMasters have done is taken those 22 and then reversed them or used the Indy version of that circuit, basically the same circuit that has had a corner cut out to make it shorter and now CodeMasters claim Grid Autosport has 100 circuits. I guess CodeMasters are correct but the core aspect of the track is the same as all the others from that location and when you have 5 disciplines to create tracks for it means there's hardly any variations in each discipline.\n\nLoading times, I guess this will be improved in time with a patch but as of now there's a ton of loading times, even when you select a car you have to wait for the image of that car to load and it just seems so slow and clunky.\n\nRace seasons. You pick a discipline and take part in an event, it could be 1-10 races but for some horrible reason you have to race around a track, finish and then race the same track all over again just with a different grid order and it becomes boring very quickly.\n\nNo pit stops! It's a game with full damage and without a pit stop there's no way to repair your vehicle so you're just stuck with the damage.\n\nEngine, cockpit and mirror visuals are non-existent, they are straight out of a PS1 game. Cockpit and mirrors are just blurred out so you can't see anything other than outlines and engines look like they were modelled for Minecraft.\n\nThe disciplines all have the same race rules, full contact in touring cars is to be expected but it's also acceptable in Grid Autosport for full contact in open wheel events. No safety cars, warning flags etc Just T-bone the car in front and drive off without any consequences.\n\nNo sense of speed, you could be doing 140mph and if feels like you're doing 30mph, it feels quite lazy and slow paced quite often.\n\nOnline multi player is a mess, hordes of cheaters, clans who purposely crash in to you and constant disconnects.\n\nGrid Autosport has the makings of a great game but it's just not there, maybe CodeMasters bit off more than they could chew with this one, their previous game, F1 2013 which is just focused on F1 is much more refined, detailed, complete and if they had that kind of refinement in Grid Autosport it would have been an amazing game.\n\nGrid Autosport currently isn't average game but it's not a great game, I guess Grid Autosport gets a "fair" rating. 6.5/10.\n","August 12, 2014","false","39.0"," 133 of 162 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","133","162","0","6"

By doing this you no longer have any personal attachement to the team, the car or your teamate who btw always seem to suck. The Ravenwest team is your constant rivals while leveling up, always one tier above the rest of the AI.\n\nAnd whats your reward once you've jumped through all the hoops of said leveling? Driving for them of course! The team you've been drilled to loathe is suddenly your employer and youre supposed to feel proud? honored? pfffff.....\n\nThe aquiring of cars and making your own livery is still present, but only in online modes.... which is divided between the challenges we know from previous iterations, sadly updated only weekly and only offering a single entry per class making buying a car kinda useless while starting out, since you'll most likely only be able to afford one car, the chances of getting to drive it are slim, since the challenge also needs to be for the right tier of vehicles.\nOr you could go for the other online mode - forced matchmaking...or wait no you can't because no one plays that.\n\nMechanically the games is fine bar the rubberbanding which seems everpresent in all modes and the drifting which is horrible, gone are the linking up of high speed drifts from the original grid in favor of doing snail-paced burnouts while streering, easily doubling the score of the AI. In the race modes the AI are boring robots rarely doing anything out of the ordinary, no spin-outs, crashes or remarkable performances, every race will end with you first, then both Ravenwest drivers, then the rest of the field and lastly your teammate. It got so boring I spent and entire season just trying to run the Ravenwest drivers off the track... all i discovered was that the AI seem to have Scalectrix levels of front end grip.\n\nThere are two bright points in the game however - Open wheel classes which have a distinct feel of downforce and good pace, and the managing of tire conditions in the Endurance mode. The latter should have been expanded to all modes and the pit-stops from the old TOCA games should have been brought back and this game would have been more than it is which is an incredible beacon of mediocrity 5/10.","November 2, 2015","false","23.1"," 161 of 203 people (79%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","79","161","203","11","4"

The cars wallow all over the place, the grip modeling is bizzarre, you have to brake at sim-like distances, though the AI does not--and meanwhile the AI's only goal is, seemingly, to wreck you at every opportunity, or at least shove you off the track or into the nearest barrier. They will honest-to-god plow into you at the startline if they can. It's like multiplayer with twelve-year-olds.\n\nThe cockpit cam is pathetic.

Autosport caters to the latter. Those who enjoy buying, tuning and personalizing their dream cars should leave this game on the shelf. Grid Autosport offers very little theater, ditching the fictitious racing series and fake Sportscenter news clips in favor of no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rubber on tarmac racing. Players will find that they are free to move between different touring car races, endurance races, open wheel racing, tuner events and street races. Players level up in each race type independently and in doing so they unlock new events and sponsors as well as Grid race series events. The freedom ends there however. Once an event is selected players are given the choice between two race teams who have pre selected cars and unappealing liveries. While certainly a realistic touch, it takes the joy out of earning your favorite rides and making them your own. Additionally, each sponsor has different objectives and tuning affinities. The higher their affinity for tuning the more settings players will have to tweak their machines so choosing a sponsor is more like choosing the difficulty of a series and additional experience can be earned by succeeding with an underdog team.\n\nThe realism continues once players are secured via five point harness behind the wheel. If you are expecting to be at the front of the pack then participating in qualifying is necessary. Forgoing qualifying laps mean fighting to the front of a dense 12 to 16 player field and contending with some seriously aggressive AI. An extensive damage model and strict penalties for cutting corners means that moving up a position or two is a bitter fight. It feels like an accomplishment to move through the pack but since most races consist of two or three laps aggressive racing is essential and often times you will find yourself crossing the finish line with a car that has wrecked steering and is not pushing as much horsepower as when the race started. Race ending collisions can occur and like Grid 2 the damage models set a genre standard. Unfortunately, qualifying means completing every race twice and qualifying isn't a possibility for certain race series. For those who don't have an obsession with cleaving a tenth of a second off of a lap time it's tedious.\n\nAlso complicating matters is the fact that most race events have you teamed up with an AI driver who helps determine your placement in the team standings at the end of a season. Perhaps I made a habit of selecting the wrong sponsor, but my teammates all seemed to be tailpipe fetishists who were content to follow the entire field. While it is possible to order commands for your teammate to drive more aggressively or hold their position it seems to have little effect other than hearing your partner spin out if you forget to back them off of the most aggressive behavior setting. Fortunately, the opponent AI also makes mistakes but all too often the work you put into capturing a podium finish is undermined by your teammate, ultimately costing you valuable experience at the end of the season. Gaining experience is essential to progressing through the career so it doesn't take long before the game feels like a grind.\n\nVariety is a hallmark of the Grid series and Autosport offers touring car racing, endurance racing, open wheel racing, street racing and tuner racing. Endurance races take place over a fixed time and the driver that travels the furthest in the allotted time wins. It's is possibly the most challenging race type since careful and consistent driving is required to stay at the front of the pack and protect the soft rubber that keeps your machine on the road. Open wheel racers are incredibly fragile and the threshold between cornering at max speed and being murdered in a nasty crash is thinner than a human hair. Open wheel racing in Autosport is not as complex as Codemasters' own F1 series since adaptive aerodynamics and the KERS system have been omitted but never the less offers a commendable and accessible experience. Tuner races are largely comprised of time attacks and drift events. Street races tend to be the most enjoyable events simply because the excise the game's long list of real world grand prix tracks in favor of the more detailed city based tracks. Finally, touring car events adhere to the addage of rubbing is racing by placing you behind the wheel of road cars tuned to unrecognizable specifications while you bump and bash your way through corners defending your position against a tightly knit field of racers. Sadly, togue events are absent from Autosport and the live route system—possibly one of the most intriguing features in a racing game in years is also absent. Additionally, players varying tastes means that some events will become a tremendous test of patience for some and leveling across all event types is essential to unlock Grid events. Once again the vehicle selection is slim but covers a tremendous variety of machines, including the platypus of the automotive world: the Aussie Ute.\n\nOnline is much the same in Autosport as it was in Grid 2 with both weekly challenge events and direct competition with 11 other drivers. Cars have to be earned one by one and leveling up each of the racing disciplines contributes to your overall level and unlocks more slots in your garage. Each car must be leveled up through use, unlocking tuning options and upgrades. This proves to be highly problematic however since it takes an absurd amount of time to unlock enough tuning options for the feature to be usable. Tuning is a delicate art—the kind of thing you would do with a scalpel and Autosport's initial instinct is to provide you with a jackhammer. Tuning options are controlled via sliders and the greater your affinity for tuning, the more settings available along the slider. Also the way vehicle availability is divided between race types and classes within each race type means that it's hard to dedicate yourself to using a single vehicle in order to upgrade it. All this comes together to make online play a grind of it's own.\n\nAutosport does provide an excellent assortment of tracks across it's single player and online suits, many of the tracks in Grid 2 can be found here as well as a large selection of new Grand Prix tracks—many of which are not found in any other mainstream racing games. The most exciting inclusion is the brand new Circut of the Americas with it's tight hairpins, long straits and winding sections. While Codemasters has included a number of details that liven up the real life Gran Prix tracks, races through the game's cityscapes is far more captivating and lively. Presentation wise, Autosport maintains the same high quality as Grid 2 but by popular demand a cockpit view has been added. Corners have been cut however with a depth of field filter that blurs the detals in the cockpit.\n\nutosport makes some strides toward addressing the issues that many TOCA and Grid fans had with Grid 2 but features enough quirks and questionable design choices to remain frustrating. It's a game that caters to serious race fans and shrugs off features that lend themselves toward giving players a sense of progression. You are simply a driver tied to a team that you are in no way invested in, who is, in turn, leashed to a corporate sponsor. It's a bit of realism that most gamers could do without. Autosport is a challenging racing game with perfect handling and tenacious AI but the dense racing fields and low lap counts combined with a rigorous damage model can irritate. Extensive plans for DLC also raise eyebrows and will likely cause would be wheel-men to steer around this entry.","August 4, 2014","true","22.0"," 97 of 125 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","97","125","2","5"

I'm also an intermediate level racer.\n\nI like the "sim-cade" genre, I like Gran Turismo and Forza a whole lot. Unfortunately, Neither Sony or Microsoft would ever see those particular cash cows on the PC. GRID is one of the few options on PC.\n\nOkay, usual complaints that PC gamers have on console ports- Controller oriented UI. Still, not nearly as bad as say, SHIFT 2 was. Uneven graphics. Wierd sound stuff. (I noticed it most when driving an open wheel car, the wind sound would go away if I looked side to side or behind me.)\n\nOn to the meat-\n\nLimited Tuning, you can't really fine tune the car, just move some sliders around.\n\nThe team offers thing is wonky- yeah I get it, you only have so much choice in pro-level racing who you drive for and who's graphics are on your car. But it's a game. Come on man.\n\nCars are extra, super, crazy tail happy- I expect this from a heavy, vintage V8 Sedan, NOT a super high downforce openwheel car. The opening level GT's are nearly undrivable in my feeling. The Dalara F312 has HORRID snap oversteer even when you click all those dumb sliders to what should be the most stable settings. It's an open wheel car, it has tremendous mechanical grip AND downforce, I expect it to get loose if I kill all that downforce but NOT when I'm at speed.\n\nThe AI is set to murder- they don't do clean racing. They love to shunt you, cut you and generally drive like ♥♥♥♥♥. Every race is a street fight in this game.\n\nIt makes you Drift. Drifting isn't racing. Drifting is a hell of a show, but it isn't racing and I've never enjoyed it. (I prefer to get my drift on running tail-happy Sixties race cars or Rally cars in various other games.)\n\nUnlicensed/Fake cars. :(\n\nThe pricing/amount of DLC is silly. I bought the Drag pack because of how poorly represented that aspect of motorsports have been in the game world... It does it half right at best. Staging is there but it leaves out the burnout box. It just doesn't feel right anyhow.\n\n\n\nAlso, I bought the game on impulse, I broke my own rule- "Don't pay Codemasters again until they FIX Dirt3." I still want them to fix Dirt3.\n\n4/2/15 HEY THEY FIXED DIRT3 THATS COOL. STILL DON'T LIKE GRID. :D","November 10, 2014","false","5.6"," 187 of 263 people (71%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","71","187","263","19","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/255220/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Codemasters had a plan when they rebranded under the Codemasters Racing Studio banner. That plan was to have the GRID and Dirt franchises to release a game every other year in syncopation. This started with Dirt Showdown, followed by GRID 2. However, Codemasters have abandoned their plan after only a single iteration. Possibly in part to the release of the next generation of consoles and the learning curve required in developing for the new platform, but ultimately it can be put down to the fact that GRID 2 received such a mixed reception from the fans. No cockpit view? A story driven racing game? What were Codemasters thinking?\n\nSo what is GRID Autosport then? Codemasters claim that the “time and technology were right” to release another version, only a year later than GRID 2 had graced our shelves. What the fans really think is that GRID Autosport is an apology for GRID 2. One thing is for sure, it’s a fine game.\n\nCodemasters went to a lot of effort in listening to their fans. One of the biggest gripes of GRID 2 was the lack of a cockpit view. Well GRID Autosport has two of them. Codemasters reason for leaving it out of GRID 2 made a lot of sense, saving on resources that could be better used making the rest of the game beautiful, something they definitely achieved. So while GRID Autosport has brought back in the cockpit view, it is relatively low detail, with no sign of dials or monitors anywhere on the dash to provide feedback to the player. This is still a bit of a sticking point, especially when the player is encouraged to play without any UI for an extra XP reward bonus each race.\n\nThe difficulty settings are pretty much back to the way they were in the original GRID. You get a set XP reward from your performance during a season, and this can be enhanced depending on the difficulty settings you pick. Not just the level of the AI, but driving assists, forcing the view to cockpit only and driving with no UI all help raise your XP bonus. It is rather key then that with the low end internal view that Codemasters provided some further form of feedback to the player. This is done in terms of a race engineer.\n\nIn previous games the race engineer came onto the radio when the game felt the need, start of every lap, after a bad crash etc. In GRID Autosport you can request information from him at any point. Your position, your team mates position, your rivals position and a damage report are all just a button press away. This works really well during races, but Codemasters have still slightly missed out here by not having it available during the timed events or qualifying sessions.\n\nA gripe of mine when it came to GRID 2 was the forcing of multidiscipline play. The GRID series has its origins set from the TOCA Touring Car games, and it has always been what they have done best. GRID Autosport goes some way to correcting this by getting rid of the whole story based driving idea and focusing a lot more on circuits over open road tracks. The selection of tracks is not huge, twenty two locations combine to provide over a hundred different track layouts. There are a couple of new tracks in there, but the majority of them are old favourites.\n\nYou can race on these tracks across the set disciplines available in GRID Autosport. These are Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuner and Street. The set up is a lot more like the original GRID where each season you pick a discipline, then select an event from that discipline to race in over the course of that season. Each event category will give you a couple of driver offers to chose from, with season objects set and XP rewards in that discipline for completing them. Once you reach level three in all disciplines you unlock the first of the GRID Championships.If you chose to complete a GRID Championship season you will compete across all disciplines, but the season objectives will be challenging yet rewarding. These are probably the best way to boost your XP across all the disciplines.\n\nHowever, if you are like me then you will prefer one or two disciplines over the others. In fact, I see no reason for some of these to be in here at all. Tuner, for example, is mostly filled with Time Trial and Drift events. Who plays these? The Open Wheel discipline is nice, but all it does is make me look forward to the next F1 game. I wouldn’t be upset if these two categories were not in the game. Street is good, it has been a strong part in all the GRID games, though the loss of Live Routes is a shame, as it was easily the best feature in GRID 2. Endurance requires a lot of skill, with the minimum length of races being eight minutes and tire wear playing a huge part in each race.\n\nEndurance racing is very much about consistency, and it’s the discipline where you see AI mistakes more than any other. Touring is the bread and butter though. I’ve already mentioned that the GRID roots are in the TOCA series, and to be honest, I’d love to see Codemasters go back and make a pure TOCA game again, and I don’t think I’m alone.\n\nThe multiplayer side of the game works off the same experience system as the single player, with every race providing you with XP in the selected discipline. To begin with you will be loaning a car in each race you enter, but once you own a car you can start competing with it if the right events show up in your playlist. Codemasters have gone to a lot of effort to make the online experience a lot more personal. You can customise cars you own in terms of livery and sponsors, but each race also earns the car XP which will unlock upgrades for it.\n\nOverall GRID Autosport has taken a step backwards, but in a good way. One big shame in single player is that you never form your own team like in the original GRID, picking the livery and sponsors. You are just constantly a driver for hire. The discipline system works well though, and if you are not bothered about the GRID Championships then you can just stick to what you enjoy.","August 22, 2015","true","149.6"," 74 of 91 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","74","91","3","4"

It did not. I'd definitely recommend Grid 2 over this game, and if you've already played 2, don't bother with Autosport.\n\nMy biggest problem is with the driving physics (which are similar to Grid 2). I get that it's an arcade racer; that's fine. But the cars don't feel like they have 4 wheels contacting the ground. They're more than just "floaty". They are kind of like cardboard with a pencil stuck through the middle. When you turn, the car seems to pivot around its center (you can feel the rear wheels swing out). So I'll brake before a turn, start turning in, and keep traction through the turn. But while doing this, the car has pivoted and feels like it's drifting... but I have traction?... it's a bizarre sensation and just feels "wrong".\n\nAs a comparison: Project Gotham Racing was an arcade racer that nailed driving physics. Even though PGR was arcadey, the cars felt weighty and had momentum. You could feel the road under the wheels and could tell when you made little mistakes. Very satisfying to master. Grid's physics don't have that magic at all.\n\n\nBeyond that, Autosport's career mode is dull. My experience with Grid 2 was that, in spite of the poor physics, the career's trickle of exciting tracks and cars kept me playing. However, I do not feel this in Grid Autosport. Your career progress is only portrayed through menus, and everything (everything!) boils down to filling XP bars. Gone is the illusion of building up a racing career, gone is collecting cars, gone is my garage. For the first few races I was actually confused: "what is my GOAL here?" It turns out: I don't need to win, I don't need to beat my rivals, I don't need to finish objectives. I just need to play enough to fill XP bars up.\n\nCouple that with the fact that most of the tracks are straight from Grid 2, and I'm left super disappointed. It's a shame because I've always liked Codemaster's Colin McRae and Dirt series.

I started doing multiplayer directly. I learned that like in every multiplayer game, the sooner you start with multiplayer, the easier it is, because you get access to the faster cars earlier. I started out doing streets discipline because that is what I loved from Grid2 most too.\n\nThis worked for me. I like the cars and the tracks I drove were nice. It did seem the same tracks were in the rotational though, but on the forums they mentioned to do something about that. It immediately came to me that this game has a steep learning curve. Nothing you do will guarantee you to win and many things just don't seem to work and you have to figure out why. For that reason I wrote a beginners guide to Multiplayer with all the do's and don'ts. A lot of people are thankful to me because it answered many questions they had.\n\nIf a game has this, that is not a good sign, but lets try and keep things positive. I mean, you learn how it works, and then it works.\n\nMy first encounter with the AII started doing Open Wheels with a friend in custom lobbies with AI to fill up the spots. This is where I found out that CodeMasters made a big mistake with this game. The AI is badly programmed. They say they are very fond of how the AI is, and that it is very realistic. This is a lie. The AI really is AI (artificial) It follows the racingline, and if you happen to be there, they are happy to crash into you pushing you away. They'll get you to spin off the tarmac easily, and if you try that with them, they seem not to be harmed at all. They break early so you easily crash into them unless you take the inside corner and use them as a moving wall.\n\nDamage system VS AIGrid multiplayer has a damage system. Basically, when you damage your car, at the end of the race you have to repair your car which costs money. The real problem with this is that the AI does not seem to care and happily crashes into you, causing you to have a high bill to pay. There is also the impact rating that tells other drivers how clean you drive. Even if you attempt to avoid all contact, the AI easily can cause such accident that your rating becomes yellow, causing other players to think you are a bad driver.\n\nRacenet ChallengesThen there are the racenet challenges. They suffer the same problem: They included the AI in most of the races, and you start at position 12. This means that it is no longer a race to get the fastest time, but to find out how you can effectively take over 11 cars in the first 2 corners. The faster you do that, the faster your time is. Thats all there is to it really. CodeMasters has mentioned that they'll look into this, but CodeMasters also mentioned they really love the AI and are not planning to make any changes to it. Lets hope they decide to remove the AI completely.\n\nSingle playerI did some single player too. I started doing Streets as that is what I did in Multiplayer too. I had to learn how to adjust to the AI. I basically learned that: crashing is good, do everything you have to do to get in front of the AI as quickly as possible trying to minimize the damage as much as possible, and you will guaranteed win. Of course, everyone else learns this too, and they take these experiences to multiplayer. Yes, this game has a lot of crashes and rammers in multiplayer too. You'll have to find custom lobbies if you want to avoid this.\n\nGood points vs Bad PointsThere are other issues too that are small problems and thus not worth having a section per item. I'll list them as good and bad points.\n\nGood points:\n- Good graphics\n- Physics of the cars are very good.\n- When you start a race, you get to see the map so you always know what the track is going to be like\n- You can enable raceline which helps greatly in learning the cars and tracks, both in SP and MP.\n- Most settings are shared between SP and MP.\n\nBad points:\n- AI behavior vs you\n- AI in multiplayer vs repair costs\n- AI in Racenet Challenges, doesn't make sense, see above.\n- Keyboard players have a big disadvantage over controller players in Endurance (basically, forget this mode all together)\n- Big learning curve\n- Time spent waiting too long\n- MP, time before first race can easily go up to 10 minutes if you're out of luck, but on average it is 5 minutes or more)\n- Game says cockpit view, but it isn't really a cockpit view. No working dials, everything blurred.\n- Assists aren't really assists. Except for ABS, the rest makes you go slower and loose bonus points, giving a false sense of help.\n- Menu system is hard to navigate and reponds slow.\n- Quitting MP takes a lot of time, you cannot quit when you want to and have to wait for a certain moment before you can quit. ALT-F4 works, but you'll loose your progress.\n- Cheating happens in MP, even though CodeMasters are banning cheaters.\n\nEnd verdictLong story short... Grid Autosports on paper is this: the best things from Grid1 and Grid2 together. The actual outcome however isn't this. With a short development time for this game, yet a full price, it is clear the game is a quick job trying to generate money because of the negativity around Grid2.\n\nFor who is this game? If you are very good at racing games and you want a bit of realism, yet you want to have a challenge, you'll love this game. If you are not very good at racing games, this game just isn't going to make you happy. Any other racing game will do it, just not this one. If you don't want too much realism in how your car drives, this game is not for you either. Grid1 might be, Grid2 definitely is going to be. If you have raced a lot in Assetto Corsa, this game is not gonna do it for you. If you race with keyboard and do not have/want to drive with a controller (gamepad or steeringwheel), this game is going to be harder for you. Can still be fun but you'll have a disadvantage in certain disciplines.\n\nIf you want to get this game solely for multiplayer, I would not recommend it, because the racenet challenges are an important part of multiplayer, (gives you the most XP/money in a short timespan) and right now, the racenet challenges are crap.\n\nI hope this review helped you make a decision. I didn't made the decision lightly to write this review, but I feel I have to.","July 20, 2014","false","61.5"," 43 of 57 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","43","57","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snipernext/recommended/255220/","snipernext","snipernext","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snipernext/","551 products in account","It seems odd that we had to wait close to five years at an official sequel to Codemasters incredible Race Driver: Grid, and now only a year later, sitting with the series' third game. It tastes undeniably by a developer as well by the jokkede in the spinach, and therefore has worked diligently to together splitting the successor as the series' many fans had hoped for in the first place.\n\nTherefore, it is not surprising that the Grid: Autosport in style feels like an extended, graphic prettier version of the series' first game and never really manages to put his own stamp on the whole for fear of differ so radically from the original as Grid 2 did.\n\nThere should not be many button presses to before is started with the first race, and actually Codemasters discarded part of the personalization that or has characterized several of their car racing. Five different race classes means that you can decide how you want to approach it all the way and is a welcome approach compared to some of the more restrictive structures you find in many of the genre's other games.\n\nTouring is the closest the new games come on the series' roots, so then Codemasters yet called the TOCA Touring Car Championship. Here it is on standardvognsræs with lots of horsepower, clashes and cars stretching from a Honda Civic to a Nissan Skyline GT-R.\n\nEndurance is a completely different size and is about ran over long distances, which means a completely different approach. If you want to see the finish line, let alone join in a proper location, so at all times make sure to treat the car properly and get the rubber of your tires to stretch as far as possible. It's a really exciting form of racing that few other games have had the courage to include and the right discipline requires that you have the concentration skills in order.\n\nOpen Wheel is the game's fastest class and focuses on small, fast single-seaters, among other means of races in Ariel Atom, Dallaraa F312 and Caparo T1. If one before has been caught by developers F1 series, it is also where you will feel most at home, despite the fact that simulation trends obviously not Special focus.\n\nStreet is by-race as in the first Race Driver: Grid and is definitely where the game most frequently shows its graphical muscles. It's also the closest race, and you are almost constantly surrounded by a whole field of other cars, making the class very intense.\n\nThe last wild lass is Tuner, despite having its own qualities also seems like the least adequate in the game's complete package. Here is the following of ardent running competitions and time trial with everything from muscle cars to the tuner-favorites like the Mazda RX-7 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X.\n\nYou have to take my hat off to the tremendous work Codemasters obviously put in to ensure that each of those five classes not only clearly different from each other, but also is relatively faithful to the racing classes from the real world that inspired them. If you are planning to transform yourself into the ultimate Grid cruise control, however, you can look forward to spending time in all disciplines, as it is the only way the game closes on all its content.\n\nTo master race classes means that you will greatly be working to find the balance in the variety of cars and it is really encouraging to Codemasters have returned to a management that has far more in common with it from the first game than the powerslide-happy approach from Grid second\n\nCodemasters has again orchestrated a controller that clearly lets you mark how far you can push the selected car before it goes wrong. If that kind of gets simulation alarms ringing in you, there is nothing to fear, for Grid: Autosport are just as motivated by arcade racing as its predecessors. Mixing balance is the developer's own, and again, they have hit the mark with something that works accessible, speed-filled and action-oriented without the chamber completely in Burnout territory.\n\nIt is no secret that the development time on Grid: Autosport has not been very long, and despite a thoroughly solid game racing, it's something you feel in virtually all aspects of the game.\n\nThe aforementioned inability from start to personalize the experience is just the first symptom of a game where there seem saved and reused in all the edges and looking where it has been possible. Most cars, tracks and race types have already been included in the series' previous edition, and the graphical difference from Grid 2 to Grid: Autosport is not enough to hide the problem.\n\nSaved there also seems to have been on the development of artificial intelligence, and Autosport offers the series' most unprofessional opponents to date most of the time does not seem to suspect that there are others on the field than themselves.\n\nElsewhere must wonder a bit over the configuration of the various races, and even races in fast single-seaters can be boring when you are forced into a time around to run six to eight different tournaments where each race to be run twice before one again gets to choose another runaway lass.\n\nGraphic is also not much has happened lately, and though sometimes it still is impressive how many colors, effects and cars Codemasters manages to force the screen without sacrificing frame rate, it's a little disappointing that there is at least not been lavished little more for the PC version.\n\nGrid: Autosport is certainly not without talent. Whether you have played the series before or not the race is on the field still fun, intense and delivered with a really good management. However, it is without doubt those who do not have experience with the series, which will make the most of Grid: Autosport, for the rest of us will find it hard to ignore the clear taste of recycling.\n\nThomas Blichfeldt\nGamereactor Denmark","April 14, 2015","true","640.0"," 59 of 91 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","59","91","8","3"

I have just bought this game recently and in my opinion it is amazing. The best thing to mention is that the game focuses on the player only, you do not have to go through a boring career method, you can freely do the events as you would like to.\n\nThe game has really wide range of motorsport genres, you can find almost everything what you like, including drift, formula car series etc.\n\nThe gameplay, with the RPG elements also fantastic. In online games, you will start the game with a loan vehicle, which are the slowest one. As you progress and earn money for racing, you can finally buy your first car and upgrade them through your online career. As soon as your car is leveled to the highest level, you will experience some really difficult and enjoyable races online.\n\nThe online community is also good, the game has an “impact rating system”, which means if you make an impact with other players, your rating will be lowered and you will be temporarily banned from some of the events which has impact rating enabled. If you would like to improve your impact rating, you need to drive safe and look out for the other racers and stay away from impacts at all costs.\n\nThe mixture of arcade and simulation style is also a good idea, it is not easy as an arcade game for example Need for speed series and it is not that difficult either. You need to have some skills, if you would like to finish in the top places, so the challenges will last long enough to play lot of hours.\n\nOnly two negative thing to mention. The first is the blurry HUD, which is painfully awful. I do not even know, why codemasters did not do it perfectly (they do it right in the first GRID). Secondly, the silly AI is can be really annoying. The system did not even notice whether I am on the track or not.\n\nAltogether, a game which is really fun to play in my opinion and I will play many more hours in the future. Hopefully, the negative problems will be solved in the future through a patch or something. I am really recommend this game, if you are looking for good competition, it is an 8 out of 10 for me.\n\nI am really looking forward to see you soon in my rearview-mirror! :)\n","October 16, 2014","true","131.9"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","40","60","4","0"

I has a few downfalls, but overall it is very enjoyable.\n\nStarting with the graphics/visual side, it has some great looking effects and beautiful lighting. Car models look a little on the low-detail side, but its not a very big problem.\n\nThe in-car cameras, I have to say, fail. There's no working dials, and very low detail on the interiors. The mirrors don't work either. Depending on what your requirements are, this could be game breaking or just a 'meh' situation. I can live with it, because I'm not a hardcore sim player. It still needs fixing though, because sometimes it is a nice change to play inside the car.\n\nPhysics wise, the game is super. It feels great with an Xbox 360 Gamepad, and absolutely jaw-droppingly amazing with a wheel (and I'm even using an old Logitech Momo wheel!). Haven't tried it with a keyboard yet. It's very accessable, but also quite deep. A very good example of 'simcade' handling, and a great improvement over GRID 2.\n\nMy old Momo steering wheel worked fine first time, so thumbs up for old wheel support :)\n\nI don't know whether I like or hate the AI. I think maybe both. They are so damn agressive, it makes for some hair-raising, what-the-heck-how-did-I-pull-that-off racing, but also gets a bit rough, and can get on your nerves sometimes if you want to race clean. They'll grind and bump you quite regularly, so get used it it :)\n\nI haven't had a go at Online yet, I'll update the review when I do.\n\nCar list is good, ranging from the VW Golf, to the Bugatti Veyron and Koenigsegg (did I spell that right?) Agera. Like said before, it would be nice to have some higher quality car models, but it's not game breaking.\n\nThere are a nice range of tracks, from Bathurst to the original San Francisco from GRID 1 (finally! I loved that track!).\n\nPerformance is good, running it all maxed out at 1080p with a solid 60FPS on a GTX 980 Ti and i7 6700k.\n-------------------\nPros & Cons List:\n\nPros:\n+ Nice Graphics (eye candy, track detail).\n+ Jaw dropping handling (in my opinion).\n+ Supported my old Momo Force Feedback wheel.\n+ AI provide a good challenge, and make the races exciting\n+ Good car list, nice variety (all DLC included).\n+ Nice range of tracks (all DLC included).\n+ Good optimization, had no hitches getting it running.\n\nCons:\n- The car models are not as high quality as I'd like (but lower quality models help with optimzation).\n- Interior views are lacking detail.\n- AI can get too rough.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n------------------\n\nThanks for reading :)","December 23, 2014","true","36.8"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"

I expected some kind of GRID 2-ish handling, but it drives way more like DiRT 3 with more grip and only on ashpalt. Although it is pretty much realism-trimmed, It´s still very fun to drive, especially the Street Cars.\nAnd if you´re looking for the most realistic game of the GRID franchise, here you go.\nThe Drift Races still suck tho.\n\nContent?\n\nYes.\n\nHow much?\n\nVery much. Most tracks are taken from GRID/GRID 2, but all of them are redone. San Francisco looks way better now. But of course there are multiple new tracks, a few city tracks and race tracks like Hockenheimring and Red Bull Ring (I think, read that somewhere)\nThere is a huge range of cars, everything from numerous kinds of street cars, over classic japanese tuners, muscles and even damn racing trucks, to formula/indycars and touring cars.\n\nGrafficks?\n\nThey exist. And it looks awesome for a game on an engine from 2006. And the difference in graphics between DiRT and GRID Autosport is like the difference between Battlefield BC and Battlefield 4.\n\nayy lmao, dis no sim racur, dis no hev weel optiuns.\n\nYou´re right, except you´re wrong. Codie´s fixed that in the meanwhile and if you got a Force Feedback Wheel, please try this, this is so much fun with a FFB Wheel.\n\nMultiplayer?\n\nExists too. Haven´t tried it yet though.\n\nOverpriced?\n\nActually not at all. GRID 2 is overpriced, I won´t pay 30 bucks for Tokyo Drift Simulator. But for the content this is actually wellpriced. Wouldn´t buy the DLCs though, not a fan of them anyway.\n\nCockpit view?\n\nYeeeeahhh-no. Something weird. You have a Dashcam and a normal Cockpit Cam, but the dash in Cockpit Cam is all blurred out for you, so you can´t see that Codemasters didn´t put an HQ Cockpit in your car or even the dials don´t work.\n\nStory?\n\nnoone cares m8\n\nThe End?\n\nYes. Overall this is a Wellpriced, good looking, well drivable Racing Simulator. Get it. And if you´re a ch33ky ♥♥♥ n199a like me who doesn´t want to pay 40 bucks for a game, get it on *steam censorship* or *steam censorship* for way less money.

(old one see bottom of this, hypocrite maybe)\n\nSo, I did like this until Codemasters and a few of the devs on here mentioned they are working on a new engine. Then the placebo wore off. Then F1 2014 came out, nearly everyone complained it was a clone of 2013 and again Codemasters stated they are working on a new engine. So basically all we have here are 2 games, very similar to the last, with yet another price tag to pay.\n\nIf you own 1 and 2 I would say save your money. The online mode is almost dead, the game hasn't delivered in fairness. You will still see the same cars winning above any other like the 4wd Golf etc. The crash system hasn't stopped fools having a laugh. The tracks are mostly the same, along with the darby races brought in as a "free" dlc (wish they brought more of Showdown into that dlc).\n\nAnd finally, my biggest problem, the real life physics. Disk breaks still only glow for a few second and don't ware, the handling is still too "drifty" and you get no sense of the car your driving from any other. Cars are all the same blah blah blah blah.Again if you buy this try and enjoy the placebo while it lasts. Otherwise wait for Project Cars this March or the next in Codemasters plans. Provided they give the new games the lift it really needs, not something that feels very very much descended from ps1's Colin Mcrae...\n\n26th June, 2014YES YES YES! Thank you to all the team over at Codemasters! I never got early access, but read many reviews. Most good, but some talked about handling being well rubbish, wobbly, no grip. Obviously these people haven't taken a real car into a corner at 70mph. I would say its near spot on. Grid 2 I hated, you just turn full lock and floor it. This you think, you slow down and you gently turn into a corner. Just what a good racing game should be. I finally feel we are all out of this NFS arcade way of driving. Its very early days now so haven't really played the game enough to fully see how things go but one things for sure. Your not going to play online only to have one option of wining a race, Ie follow the sheep and only drive one car on each class. Just what racing games needed. I will give a better review in the coming weeks. And once again thank you!!!\n\n","January 25, 2015","false","85.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","0"

I'd give it 3 out of 5.  This game is very good, and really is worth the purchase.  (At least until something better comes along.)\n\nSome will criticize it as being "simcade", harping on "mediocre physics", etc., and they're right that it's a simcade but not right about the physics at all.  So here's how it really is.  The physics are top notch, simulation grade.  However, great physics don't make a simulator.  True, great physics are a requirement of being a simulator, but a simulator is more than just a set of well implemented physics rules.  That is where such critics get confused: they tend to view physics and simulation as one and the same, but that's just not reality.  The handling and physics models really are quite good.  (The only aspect of physical simulation I think they could improve greatly on is the force feedback - it's good, but not great.)\n\nHowever, this game is a GAME, first and foremost.  What separates it from the likes of iRacing is not "bad physics" (again, they're quite good) but the approach to development, which is very game oriented.  For instance, many of the cars DON'T actually handle like their real world counterparts (for instance the GT-R is far more "understeery" than it is in real life)... however, they DO handle very much like *A* real car... just not necessarily the car being represented.  I believe the reason it is that way is because of lack of research - research I'd guess the developer didn't feel was necessary since the goal was balanced gameplay, and as long as they acheived balanced trade-offs within a given class of car, and it was approximately true to life, that was "good enough".  (However, in my opinion, it's NOT good enough, but I digress.)\n\nAnother aspect that is very game-ish rather than simulation-ish, is the A.I. (computer driven) cars/players are extremely and frustratingly aggressive.  I read in the developer's blog how proud they were of their aggressive A.I., but I feel they missed the mark.  In real life racing, there is aggression, no doubt, but there is also a sense of caution... no pro race car driver will intentionally derail another driver into a potentially fatal crash - unless they want to be arrested for manslaughter.  Gently tapping/touching/etc. to throw another driver off their game, sure, that happens in real life (and is very controversial)... but repeated hammering until you spin out of control or completely T-boning your car is absolutely NOT realistic.  At times, Grid Autosport reminds me of the old game "frogger", where it feels like the point is to dodge speeding cars as you cross the road, cars that are actually trying to hit you (or at least don't care at all if they do.)  To make this worse, if you return the aggression, the A.I. cars are very difficult to disorient or make slide/spin, whereas they can feel free to derail you at will.  This is the most frustrating aspect of Grid Autosport.  To introduce this kind of A.I. logic is to add a layer of "random chance"... a layer that is very inappropriate in a purely skill oriented venue.\n\nFrankly, I don't think that Codemasters (the developer) really understands their audience - we want the wonderful online gameplay and comradery (which is excellent by the way), great cars to drive (and they are) in an immersive and realistic environment (also quite good), but we don't want to waste our time on "games of chance".  Racing is a purely skill oriented discipline... there's no element of random chance whatsoever (not counting weather, which Grid Autosport doesn't have anyhow.)  We want the good aspects of "gameplay" with the best of simulation... because we want to believe that we're real live race car drivers... that's the illusion we want to buy when we give them our money.  This is where Codemasters really misses the mark - they don't seem to get that at all - they seem only to understand the "rules of game design" without considering what we the audience really, truly want: A racing simulation that keeps us immersed and believing that it’s real but gives us a sense of PROGRESSION and ACHEIVEMENT found primarily in games.  Ruining the illusion with random chance and puerile A.I. ruins the experience, and wastes our time and money.\n\nThe bottom line is that the physics are excellent (if you can forgive inaccurate representations of specific cars), the graphics are excellent, online racing is outstanding, but the A.I. is horrible, frustrating, and hardly fun at all.  If it weren't for the great online gameplay, I'd say avoid this title, but on the whole, it's worth getting.","March 16, 2015","true","426.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","7"

While games like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars concentrate on realizm and driving simulator game play, Grid Autosport balances nicely between Arcade and Sim racers. Course designs are easily familiar to the real world courses and course diversity is average. Custom Skins and the abilty to make groups is great but the online multiplayer sessions can be a bit confusing at times when you are trying to meet up with a buddy due in part to the cumbersome RaceNet interface which differs from regular online play.  The stoyline, while lengthy and appears to be full of diverse content, ultimately forces a driver to be all things to all forms of racing, which si not something that actually happens in the racing world. Graphics are 9/10, Audio is 9/10, Controls support 9/10 and content 8/10 (just because I am not into all the tuner and drift stuff).

I am playing with a Xbox controller and the controls are not super responsive and direct when it comes to the steering with the L joystick, but it's acceptable. You might need to get used to it a bit in the beginning, after that it's fine.\n\nThe game has a ton of cups and challenges to keep you busy for many many hours (enough content). Even with the arcady feel it is actually quite chalenging to drive against the AI! So far as I have played the amount of different tracks is quite low, I played for 7 hours and only driven half a dozen different tracks (and reversed), also the amount of different cars and classes is quite low.\n\nOne really noticable quality gap in the game is the cockpit view. It is really low detailed in most/all cars and they made the cockpit on the lower part of your screen blurry to camouflage it. It is extra noticable, because basically everything else in the game is pretty solid and good quality.\n\nAs for realism I think this game falls far below the racing sims on the market. Even Gran Turismo feels more real (direct/responsive) when it comes to car handling, but the AI in GRID is way more fun to race against and the races are more custimizable then in Gran Turismo. I also don't think that this game tries or was intended to be a realistic racing sim, but an enjoyable not over complicated racing experience. And that it does quite well.\n\nOverall I think this is a pretty solid and fun racing game and worthy to pick up during a sale.","December 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

The "authentic handling" as stated in the description caught my eye as GRID 2 was all about drifting every single car around corners at crazy speeds. I was very disappointed to learn that nothing has changed. This game feels like GRID 2 with better graphics, the same drifty handling, and the same waste of money for someone looking for a, "authentic handling" or simulator experience. This brings me to the controls, I'm sure the game is manageable with a controller or even a keyboard and mouse, but with a wheel like a G27, good luck. The shifting, should you choose to use a manual transmission with a clutch and H shifter is horrid, cars pop out of gear at random times and most of the time you can't put the car back into gear because the game simply won’t recognize it. All in all, the game isn't what I was looking for and Codemasters has only given the series a new set of pretty textures and not much else. If you liked the other GRID games, by all means this is nothing different but if your someone looking for a sim experience I recommend you look into Race 07, and Asseto Corsa and not dump $50 on this game like I did.","June 27, 2014","false","1.8"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","36","61","0","0"

I have invested easily twice the time when comparing to GRID 2 and there was a reason for this. The multi-disciplined Events offer you a lot more variety and it's great for those who are a fan of mixing different race styles. From Endurance races to Tuner and Street you also have Touring Events and Open Wheel as well giving you different tastes of what's available in the racing words. For me all were great aside of any Drift events. It's nothing personal but I love to race in all sorts of classes but when it comes to win by points in a corner by making good use of your handbrake the racer fan in me feels a bit bored.\n\nAs you advance in all events you will get a chance of having better sponsors interested in you with more difficulty and challenging objectives to complete such beating a rival time, finish above 5th place, then 3rd place and so on.\n\nThere is a clear effort in making this game a pleasant experience for the racing fans but even after so many efforts there is still much to be done. Endurance races are great but it lacks some proper tuning and the duration of most of them are not really what I would call endurance since the bigger ones are around 12 minutes long. Qualifications are back and it's a great opportunity to set a time to start on a better position.\n\nThe audio is the best effort I've seen in the grid series. You really do not need any soundtrack or any other sound effect. You just need to remove all the hud in the game, increase the volume and you will have such a good time driving while pushing to the max to the next gear. There are also little things that did not go unnoticed. For instance, you can ask (with the D-pad) what is the current state of your car (gearbox, engine damage, etc) as well the position of your rival, team-mate and so on. If you are entering a tunnel and you ask for this info you can see there's a difference in the sound from the speaker since the signal may be weaker. These little things are always appreciated. One last thing regarding the sound: I loved GRID 2 main theme and it's a such a shame that I felt a downgrade regarding the tunes/themes in the menus (not to mention these menus are quite... bland).\n\nThen there are the community feedback that Codemasters did or tried to achieve with things like the Cockpit view. For many racing fans this view not only is a must but it's also the only view they play their racing games. So, in order to keep fans happy Codemasters implemented this view but to be honest this was the most poor effort I've seen in adding something that is a big request in these games. First I thought that my eyes were deceiving me because I've played and seen many recent games with great looking cockpit views like Driveclub and Project Cars so it crossed my mind I was not being fair to GRID Autosport since this game was released some time ago. Then I just remembered. Games like Dirt 2 or Dirt 3 do have a cockpit view and they are quite nicely done, if you ask me. So what happened here? Was no time to develop a better view and they just tried a quick solution? For those who haven't seen it, go check it out. It's a dark, blurry mess with no details at all. Seriously. This was such a wasted opportunity and I can see why so many fans were upset with all this.\n\nOne thing I also liked was the Cups between the major events. This would be races without a team member and they had a great selection of either prototypes or older gems, something I'm fond of. But still, I wish I could have seen more of them.\n\nIn the end, I had great fun with Autosport. I played more than 50 hours, I did more than 400 races, leveled up every single category to level 10 or above and finished all the major events, all cups with many qualifications as well.\n\nSide Curiosity: It is thanks to Ben Gouldstone, the Senior Game Designer of Driveclub that the racetrack from Algarve, in Portugal is a reality after he gave this feedback to the Codemasters team. It's great to see when companies are open to all sorts of feedback in order to bring more variety and content to their games.","February 12, 2015","true","51.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

Bought Grid AutoSport + Season Pass just because I had money to waste (and maybe to show off to others that I buy expensive games) and I think it is one of the beautiful mistakes I've made in my life.\n\nI was always an avid follower of F1 and thats why I love racing games. Played almost all newer NFS titles where you kind of get a supercar and blast through all the racer and get 1st , 2nd or 3rd place almost every time. Played this game and I got a reality check about what actual racing is. I selected the "Easy" AI Mode but after 4 races (15th Place , 14th Place , 9th place and 16th place *I ain't joking*) . I had to set the AI to "Very Easy" mode. Even after that , I've managed to get the podium 2 times ONLY (2nd and 3rd) even after playing almost 30+ races.\n\nIf you think you've mastered racing games just because you can play NFS , play this game. I'm sure you'll love it. Although I understand that this game is frustrating at times just because the amount of complexity you'll have to go through e.g. In Online mode car damage will affect your car's performance and trust me when I say that I wanted to threw away my laptop just because I couldn't come 1st in a race just because my car's handling failed after getting hit by another car. I've only played like 2-3 games online so I dont know much about that but I'm really enjoying the Single Player mode.As of now , I've only tried "Touring" and "Endurance" disciplines but I plan to try other ones soon enough.\n\nAnd about the optimization part , I'm running this game maxed out in Intel HD 5200 and haven't encountered a visual glitch till now. Also , the visuals are really top notch. Somethimes when playing , I felt like I was racing in a real world (but I'm too much dreamy so you can ignore that part :'D ) This game also has a good set of cars and racing tracks .....\n\nWell , to finish , I know I spoke too much in my review but if you can , buy this game. You'll have countless hours of fun like I'm having .... Thank You again for reading this length pile of garbage.  P.S. I never played Asseto Corsa and don't plan to. So , please don't tell me about how Asseto Corsa is better than Grid : Autosport even if it is !!

Similar to the Colin McRae Rally games, GRID Autosport takes us to the world of professional racing, on a variety of authentic tracks, with real cars from around the world. Not exactly a driving simulator, more like a racing career simulator, as you get sponsors, achieve objectives. I compare all racing games to Gran Turismo 2, which is arguably one of the best racing/driving sims ever made, and GRID Autosport does a good job of trying to live up to such high standards. Unfortunately, I found the lack of individual car customization to be a disappointment, and I wish that you could buy cars as you win races and earn money. This isn't the case however, as  you earn reputation and experience, instead of cash, for winning. Still a great game, lovely detail, the tracks are challenging, the AI is competitive, I think racing fans will enjoy this game.","December 1, 2015","true","5.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","0"

Not even close to being one. Handling certainly is more natural and realistic than in GRID 2 (in which drifting somehow gained you more momentum out of corners), but it's still pretty arcady. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but since this game was advertised as more sim-like racing game, I wanted to clarify, that it's not really true. It's still a good game though, if you don't mind somewhat "floaty" handling model (typical to all Codemasters games). AI is kinda fun to drive against, although they tend to ignore any clean driving rules, so you need to get used to that.\n\nAlthough to be honest, I wouldn't buy it for full price - definitely wait for a sale, hopefully GRID 3 will be better.\n\nPros:\n+ Okay optimisation\n+ Well structured career mode\n+ On-demand radio communication\n+ Overall nice sensation of speed\n+ It's fun, yet somewhat challenging\n+ Dem nightrace graphics\n\nCons:\n- Blurry cockpits\n- Races lack some depth, no pit stops, no weather changes, etc.\n- Seriously, no actual mirrors on cars in racing game from 2014?\n- AI is reckless, especially in first lap, flashback is a must on higher difficulty levels\n- Annoying control bug - sometimes I just lose throttle or steering wheel for no reason\n- Just handful of actual tracks (somewhat compensated by many variations of one circuit)\n- Multiplayer is almost dead by now (August 2015)","August 25, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm also not extremely well versed in the GRID series so I don't have any comparison reviews here. This is a "hey look what I got for free with my GPU" review.\n\nGRID visually is stunning. I like it, I like the fact I can race about any car (especially F1 cars). Maybe it's because I'm playing on a keyboard, the steering seems a bit stiff. Tried switching to a gamepad and still sort of found it the same. The campaign itself is nice, gratifying as you go along upgrading the car you drive or buying another. There is also a feature where if you messed up royally on a turn you can hit "rewind" and go back before the turn.\n\nGRID is simply another racing game to be honest. The graphics are unbelievable but so are many other racing games. The driving sort of feels arcade to me. Does it mean GRID is a bad game? Not necessarily no. But I wouldn't say it's worth $50.00.\n\nI would give it an 8 but it's another racing game in my eyes. I would recommend Need For Speed Shift 2 over this.

Now this doesn't have to be bad actually I liked it at first but I never really got into the game during that time, rather played different genres.\n\nI played it now and then and every time I had the same feeling and ended up playing other stuff again because of the following reasons:\n\nGrid Autosports has upgrades that you can install into your vehicle to boost its performance (Better acceleration for example), for these you need to have a certain level on your car (which you have to buy with ingame cash if you want to level up the car ). Basically this means if you play the game a lot you get better cars ( besides owning cars in the first place ).\nAgain this is something most online games have, reward players that play the game.\n\nOne problem with this is that the game is basically unplayable and very very very frustrating in multiplayer as a "beginner" as you can't theoretically drive faster than people that have upgraded cars, which means you can't, again theoretically (before you argue you can still do that by skill... ), do better than people with upgraded cars.\nAs you get XP and Cash mainly based on your placement and the amount of players this means you're going to have hard times leveling up and buying new cars. (Cash problem can easily be solved by doing RaceNet-Challenges ).\n\nThis problem also gets supported by the fact that the Multiplayer is pretty much dead ( EU-Experience ). You may get a full touring lobby on Sundays but then again you will have to race mostly high level players ( Talking about people with somewhere between 700-2000h in this game ).\n\nThe "reward people that play the game " - system can also be seen at the start of a race: The guy with the most points starts first ( If you just sit in a lobby for long enough and play a lot you will always start on pole ). If you're lucky enough to find a full lobby with some low rank players you will have to start at the very back and probably get rammed out of the first turn.\n\nNow you could still have more driving skill than some high skill players, maybe you're thinking because you own a wheel you get advantages as you do in other games but I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong.\n\nAs I said earlier this game is somewhere between Arcade and Simulator, therefor it's easily playable with a controller or keyboard, multiplayer doesn't have any specific rules on game supports ( ABS , Shiftmode , TC , stability control, ... ) you can enable what ever you want. Enabling those also doesn't really give you a disadvantage ( you get less xp but that's not really noticible ), having TC enabled for example just saves you from accelerating too quickly but if you choose to fully accelerate you still accelerate perfectly.\nI am personally using a racing wheel ( T300RS ) and I feel like this is sadly the case for most settings. Manual shifting / sequential is worthless, just more work for your brain and automatic shifts perfectly anyways.\nBasically this means you can play this game just as well on a controller as you could on a racing wheel. Good if you own a controller - bad if you own a 300€ or more racing wheel and get no advantages.\n\nConclusion:\nAs reviews should tell people who are interested in buying this game if it's worth it or not I'm going to say: Probably not.\nIf you're looking for an arcade game, don't care if you finish last most games and not play with a lot of players ( yes there are private lobbies ... sometimes ... if you're lucky ... so basically never (  let's be real )  ) or if you just want to play this game in singleplayer, go ahead and pick it up.\nIf you actually want a racing sim, play a game where you feel like it's good to own a wheel and not get dusted by people who may be worse drivers than you but still win because they played the game a lot then don't buy this game.\n\nPersonally I never expected this to be a racing sim but rarely finding lobbies and having to play people who play this game all day is annoying. Also I feel like you should be able to drive better if you own a wheel, support systems shouldn't do everything perfect so there's something to improve by using a wheel.","January 2","false","34.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

TEN'AH'TA'TEN! - BuckfugglyGaming\n\nGrid has and continues to be less of a simulation fans racing game for the sake of being more of an arcade racing game. And it does what it does as well if not better than it ever has before in Grid:Autosport. That being said, there is precious little telemetry and car customization and you're given little to no selection for what you'll be driving from one race to the next. And I hate that, I'm a sim-racing fan more than anything else. But I've enjoyed my time in Grid:Autosport for sure. You won't find bespoke graphical / mechanical car customization and selection in Grid, but  you will find lots of solid arcade (think ridge racer) fun.\n\nThe HD textures (while perhaps one of my favorite optional free DLC offerings from devs of any game) causes what appears to be memory-leak crashes for me but the game is pretty enough in high-res mode for me to be fine without it. As for other visuals, I feel much more like I'm racing in particular cars than I have in other games, hatchbacks typically have some weighty body-roll thats ideal to pre-load going into a corner, and high-strung sports cars feel like their "twitch" is pushing your head around like it owes this game money.\n\nI have a few minor problems with the audio, but they're minor and can be completely overlooked unless you really care to hear them. The team radio announcer is a little bland most of the time and a bit uninformative. But I like the idea of having radio-comms to coordinate car condition and situational performance. I'd especially like it if more games swapped out some selectable or even voice activated voice checks for the typical HUD items that tend to litter most racing games.\n\nSplit screen!!! Thank you! I wish more games tried a little harder to put/keep this in their PC games. I like online gaming, but few things are as satisfying as sitting next to the person you're stomping into a dirty mudhole on the track =)\n\nI really like the idea of a youtube button during replays for uploading them to youtube. A wonderful addition to a very pretty and exciting racing experience. And it has been pretty user-friendly (as far as reply controls go) for me to capture some decent footage for machinima things I do in my spare time. But the manually selectable camera angles are limited to the same ones you have access to during the race. So that could have maybe been better. Note* - the automated cinematic camera angles are on a loop, so if you're trying to get footage, it's easy to accidentally repeat the same exact camera angles over multiple takes.\n\nI've had zero problems using my cheapo (but heaven-sent) logitech gamepad with analog triggers with no in-game setup at all. Right outta the gate everything worked flawlessly. There's a lot to be said for that.\n\nI can't speak for the online play yet. But if I get around to giving it a shot I'll sure update my review accordingly.","April 17, 2015","true","11.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'd seen the horrible reviews that Grid 2 had recieved, and was quite disapointed, as I loved Grid 1. Luckily, I caught Autosport on a nice sale, and was quick to ignore the shoddy reviews because I'd caught it at such a steal. Boy, had I wished I listened.\n\nOddly enough, Autosport proved itself fun in the start. While it presented itself as a hardcore racer for hardcore players, I was lied to, as Autosport's racing physics are at best arcadey, and at worst, unbearable. All cars felt like they handled the same- all that was changed was how much power they were capable of producing. Drifting F1 cars should not be possible.\n\nOn top of that, the video stutter made a playable game unplayable.

The graphics are stunning, the car models are great and the game is for the most part very well optimized for most mid to high end systems. The controls are very well executed, they feel smooth and responsive.\n\nUnless you're a hardcore racing purest I'd say pass this one up since you have no ability to choose and customize your own vehicle, they're preselected for you based on the sponsor you choose before entering into a season. The other part that bothered me significantly is that when you are leading a race your opponents appear to gain a significant speed boost and they easily overtake you and speed off into the distance as if you're standing still. The only way to midigate this issue is to turn down AI difficult which will actually impact the amount of xp you earn. If buying through steam I highly discourage it since Grid Autosport is not worth $40+ instead pick it up cheap on sites like GtwoA etc then I recommend it as a fun and addicting time sink for a few days until you grow tired of it.","July 14, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

That being said, I play with a Track IR 5 and Logitech G25 on the "manual H-patten + clutch" setting on a 34" ultrawide 21:9 display and it's very immersive. It's even possible to heel-toe downshift but sometimes it's a bit tricky since there's no feedback in the pedals. For a game, it's plenty of fun. The car selection is nice and the track selection is pretty good too. Generally I stick to GP circuits and play either open wheel or hot hatch since everything else just feels like a drift fest to me, but maybe I'm doing it wrong or something.\n\nOh, and did I mention that it works on Linux and MacOS X too? I've played a bit on Macbook Pro running El Capitan with a Xbox 360 controller pad and the splitscreen works beautifully with full rumble support and everything.

It had customizable difficulty, it had teams and sponsors and your really didn't have to be always first to win a championship (something that NFS Shift 2 had problems with). You could buy your own cars and customize it, so you can see how you progress through the game. And it was fun to play with AI, since it wasn't really good (i.e. cheating) or really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game just really balanced between arcade and sim and did it really good.\n\nNow in Autosport you still have customizable difficulty and same championship system. And it's pretty much it. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that would just crash into you giving no ♥♥♥♥ about it whatsoever.\nYou can't buy cars (well, you can in multiplayer, but you'll be given a car anyway when you joing a race). Well, I know that you race with teams and sponsors just provide you cars, but come on, it's not a sim, it's 100% NFS-like arcade, so what's the point of that?\nYou don't really progress, you just comlete one season to unlock another and that's it (it gets really boring very quick.

While not the worst racing game I have ever played, It is a long way from the best.  Controls and handling of the cars is not really an issue except to point out that keyboard players should expect to be at a disadvantage.\nThe main problems are the AI, the lack of visibility and the atrocious in car view.\nThe AI is following the same principle that has been used for a few years now. That is they are "heavy" meaning you cannot ram them and expect to see them suffer much. Unfortunately that the same does not apply in reverse, and you will often find yourself losing many positions or even out of a race after being hit by the AI. What make it worse in this game, is the AI generally doesnt see you or care. They will maneuver to overtake on a corner, then  switch into your lane after a few seconds, regardless of where you are. This only applies if your are not drift/sliding around the corner. In this instance you do not exist and that will blindly drive right into you. If by chance you get t-boned and stuck on the front of thier car, then race over. They will not stop to let you off, and will happily push you as far off the track as they can go before hitting a wall or running out of momentum.\nVisibilty in this game is not something you will notice much as the graphics are quite nice. The problem does become apparent on the more technical circuits though. The issue is you can see a lot of scenery, but very little of the road ahead. In many places the corners are hard to judge as you can not really see a far as you should be able to. It is like an artificial limit on the draw distance. Using the best line feature can help, but if you cannot see much of the road, you wont see much of a line on the road either.\nNow for the in car view. Its there.... partially. This is absolutly the worst view I have EVER seen in a car game. Not only do they further restrict your view by making you feel like you are to small to look over the dash, but the whole interior of the car is blurred W...T...F!!! Bonus xp for limiting views to incar only, but not worth it.\n\nPeople who played Grid 2 online are in for some good news. You can buy quite a few cars in this game without having to play online for 100hrs. Bad news is there are now something like 50 catagoeries, so you will still get stuck having to use loan cars until your 100hrs is up.","January 8, 2015","false","187.9"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","0"

Lots, but long story short this game rewards driving skill.\n\nYou have to hold the line, work the throttle, and have the patience to wait for the moment to pass. The bs drifting advantage is over. Only in select situations does drifting help. So far as I can describe through play, this game by design cuts down greatly on the demolition derby that was GRID 2. The A.I. is definitely challenging, but that may just be since the driving dynamics are different from other GRID titles so passing wouldn't be as familiar.\n\nThe sound of the game has some notable improvements from G2. There are cockpit rattles in various cars. The engine sounds are satisfying, tires, exhust notes, radio chatter...blah blah. It sounds better.\n\nOne aspect of the game I am enjoying a lot more are the RaceNet challenges. Again the driving dynamics make this particular game mode great, they take work to complete with platinum medals.\n\nShould you pick this game up?

First off, I don't think I have ever seen this game go on a 75% off sale, and for the record I got this game for free. GRID Autosport is probably one of the best racing games on Steam in my opinion. The graphics are great, and it runs well on my average PC.\n\nThe career mode is very unique, with you playing as a professional racer who drives across 5 different disciplines: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. Touring is basically normal racing on tracks all across the world. Endurance is similar, but the races are a lot longer and require you to manage your tires by deciding when to put wear on them and when to hold back. Open Wheel features open wheel Formula 1 type cars. Tuner events are drift competitions set into heats, and also time attack where racers begin in a staggered moving start and try to set the fastest lap speed rather than the highest position. Finally, Street is racing on tracks made in tight city streets with many sharp turns and short tracks. As you progress through the different disciplines you unlock new Season opportunities and get closer to racing in the GRID, where all disciplines are tested in one competition. For events you do not get to choose the car you drive, which some people don't like but I am fine with. The game is structured into racing seasons where you pick one discipline and a season with preset races and cars. Seasons can also feature a special event where maybe everyone drives the same car or something. When a season ends you can choose a new season from any discipline. The game will save your progress between events so you don't have to play a whole season in one sitting. For each season you can also choose a racing team which gives different challenges or offers which give you bonus XP. For example, improve your lap time, finish above 5th position, lead for a lap. Also, for most racing events each racing team has two drivers. You recieve a teammate with a description and stats (however I do not think the stats really have a great impact on them). During the race you can order your teammate to hold their position, push for a higher one, or just have the default balanced approach.\n\nThe racing itself is quite good, featuring a penalty system for infractions like going off track and gaining a position by way of that. There is also a replay feature, similar to Forza Horizon where you can rewind the last seconds where you may have crashed or made a mistake. For racers who don't like this feature, you can disable it, and you will receive an XP bonus. There are also other setting you can turn on or off that will increase your XP bonus or lower it. For inexperienced racers I would recommend turning on the driving line which displays the best path to take on the track and where to brake. Now, a lot of the times you can make big gains in races by way of road rage and muscling your way through the competition, I have to admit I do this some of the time. As long as you are on the track you receive no penalty, however if you take enough damage, your steering column, engine, or tires can be damaged.\n\nThe multiplayer is fun, one thing is that you have to set your Steam download region to UK-London in order to find matches. From what I've heard this will not affect your downloads and it hasn't seemed to affect me so far. Surprisingly the multiplayer features the rewind function, however it will only rewind your car while everyone else keeps racing, so its really only for big mistakes. By racing in multiplayer you earn money and XP and can buy new cars. There is no customization and the cars you buy are just for multiplayer.\n\nAll In all I think this is a great racing game and a steal for such a big sale. I probably would not buy this game for full price however, but if I didn't have it and saw it on this sale I would definitely grab it! Great graphics, good career mode, good multiplayer, nice music.\nNOTE: This game like most racing games is best with a CONTROLLER.","January 20, 2015","true","16.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Physics is pretty good, car damage also, but after some time game starts to repeat itself. Multiplayer becomes pure grind, and single play becomes boring since you are all the time just a driver for hire, without an option to create your own team.\n\nVisuals and sound are top notch, so if you look at the game from that perspective, this is very impressive one. This game has a lot to offer, but it also leaves a lot to be desired in many ways. Anyway, I reviewed it as a positive, since I still enjoy driving with my teammates in multiplayer, and chasing platinums in online challenges.\n\nGood one, but far from perfect.","January 17","true","139.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I previously reviewed Grid 2 and I will start with a familiar sentence those who read my grid 2 review will know. Codemasters, my dear old friend. I have been a loyal supporter since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, stretching from V8 Supercars 1, 2 (Xbox) to TOCA Race Driver 3 and even the Formula One games (My fave) Its only fair I review GRID: Autosport. In a nutshell, its an improvement over GRID 2. OK LETS GET INTO IT! Again I shall start with the cons.\n\n\n\n-Cons\nFirst the AI. Easy to catch, bloomin hard to keep them behind you. It seems there is a rubberbanding effect here where the cars behind get a performance boost when you pass, especially the top drivers (looking at you Westley). Rubberbanding provides a challenge to the player but it kinda makes it frustrating all your effort catching (even on hard difficaulty) suddenly goes to mud because the AI suddenly go faster. And on the subject of AI they REALLY get aggressive out there. For example in Open Wheel (more about classes in the pros!) It is supposed to be NON CONTACT. But they do not leave space, and I found myself getting spun when they slam into me in the breaking zones like im not even there or they re-pass on the inside and clip my rear wheels with their wing. THis is a long paragraph for a single con.\n-Damage. This is a pro and con. Its more about the AI damage. They don't seem to have any issues with damage. I went the wrong way, smashed head on into an AI at over 200kph and sent him flipping through the air. When his car righted again he just continued although he did have a lose wing and cosmetic damage... he finished 5th... SO work there needs to be done.\n-Multiplayer. Again... I cannot for the life of me find a public match. Inviting my only other friend who plays the game is ok, but sometimes hes not always avaliable to play. This needs to be fixed. It happened on GRID 2 as well.\n\nOK CONS ASIDE!! Lets get into the really great pros.\n-Classes. The best thing about this game. Different choice of cars. Its obvious not every one likes the same race series. I hate Nascar, I love Formula One. It is great to see you can choose 5 different choices, from Drift to Open Wheel to Touring etc. It is the best thing about this game, and it brings me back to my V8 Supercars years.\n-Damage. Much improved damage on this game, parts come off, or cause your car to pull to the left/right, even lose a wheel, and manage to keep on racing (Put this in F1 2015 pls? k thx) although some pit stops would be nice/\n-Career. A big con. The intro introduces you to the mechanics of the game with a 2 lap intro race which is good to get up to speed and you can select which class to start/end with maybe open wheel, or drift any category you want.\n-ONBOARD CAMERAS. YES. DRIVING CAMERAS. T-CAMS. ITS WHAT WE DREAMED OF. AND WE GOT.\n-Custom races. This is a great feature. Any class, any track, any team. Up to 3 events each with custom lap amounts, practice and qualifying and setups!!! Whats best is the first race can start from qualifying spot, but the second race can start from reversed 1st race position (finish 1st, start last, finish 2nd, start second to last.) Its great!!!\n-Graphics. Only one word Amazing!\n\nOverall a great game for any racer out there. Easy to use with my g27 wheel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/recommended/255220/","LDR","Kiksu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/","183 products in account","There's a problem with the Steam ratings system, and that's that you have a binary "YES" or "NO" as to if you'd recommend a game.  I need a third category for GRID Autosport, a wavy hand, non-committal noise, a sort of shrug.\n\nI'm a big fan of racing games in general and have been buying Codemasters racers since TOCA Race Driver 2.  I’ve bought GRID and GRID 2 and enjoyed them both, I actually wrote a positive review of GRID2 on Steam.  But GRID Autosport is...*does hand rocking back and forward motion*.\n\nSo what's wrong?  The biggest fault in this game is the AI.  It’s bad, not terrible, just pretty stupid.  AI cars really want to hit that racing line.  Quite often you'll find them piling up at the first corner as they all try to take the same line through.  A savvy player can avoid the melee and gain quite a few places straight away.  More annoying is when you're taking a corner and the AI clips your back end sending you spinning out.  Of course, this happens in real world racing but it feels all to frequent in GRID Autosport making the AI feel cheap and frustrating.  It made me wonder if the flashback game mechanic was implemented because they couldn’t be bothered to fix the AI and decided that the player could just rewind and take evasive action should they get rear ended and end up in a wall!  But because the AI behaves so badly you don't really care about smashing them up to get ahead.  This can turn races into something of a demolition derby and ruins the immersion somewhat.  Far better was the system in Need For Speed: Shift which rewarded you for a more passive (or aggressive) racing style, that way you could at least play a persona.  Also the less said about the total waste of an AI race partner the better.  There's also nothing new here.  If you've played the last two outings you've seen most of what this game has to offer.  I might be mistaken but I think all the tracks are recycled and they've ditched the point-to-point racing that was so much fun in GRID2 (though you can get it back as DLC, it’s not part of the main career mode).  Drag racing could have been new and fun (reminiscent of the ace drag racing from Need For Speed Underground) but again, that comes as a DLC and isn't part of the main career.\n\nSo what's right?  Graphically it’s quite the looker.  The cars are detailed (and there are quite a few of them), the tracks feel alive and interesting (racing through the construction site that is Dubai is a particular highlight).  The car handling seems to have been refined from the previous outing and the multi-disciplined approach means you really have to focus on how you drive as you, for example, switch between the easy to drive, stable at speed Touring Cars and the fast but skittish GT Race Cars.  Moreover the number of disciplines keeps things varied and interesting.  You'll be bumper to bumper racing in Touring Cars, managing your tyre wear in Endurance, getting sideways in Drift.  That you don't need to be the best in a particular discipline to progress is neat too (mid table finishes still earn XP, albeit slower than finishing top).\n\nThere's enough in this game to keep me coming back (and I will do until I finish it because I'm compulsive like that) so because Steam only gives me a binary choice I'll give a thumbs up.  But this is likely the last GRID game I pick up.  The racing marketplace is about to get a whole lot more competitive with the exciting Project CARS on the horizon, and I reckon the GRID series, without an overhaul, will end up languishing in mid-pack.","February 23, 2015","true","35.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That makes this game very fun and playable with w,a,s,d and arrow keys.\n\nThe car selection is huge, you get everything in between hot hatches and formula 1. Touring cars, muscle cars, hypercars, you name it, they have it.\n\nThe graphics are great, obviously not the best in the world right now, but still insane.\n\nThe frame rate is very constant, I dont have the best PC ever, only 6GB of ram and a core i5, but it still runs at 40-50fps pretty much no matter what I'm doing. I cant say the same for games like need for speed.\n\nThe track selection is immense, granted, some of the tracks are just variations of the same track, but it's still difficult to run out of places to race.\n\nMultiplayer is great as well, impact ratings keep all of the jerks out of the race and let everyone have fun without being killed by some idiot driving on the track backwards.\n\nHowever, there are some flaws. For example, when GRID autosport says you are going to drive formula A, or formula 1, it gives you an indycar instead. Indycar and F1 are NOT the same thing.\n\nAnother flaw has to be the DLC, which has been a problem for all of the GRID games. There is so much of it, and none of it is free. You want an extra car? Better have $5 lying around.\nThis also effects multiplayer, half of the time the party leader is using DLC that you probably dont have, and there is usually no other party to join.\n\nThe cokcpit wiew is super blurry as well, not a big problem, but still something I want to point out.\n\nMy final thoughts? Still an excellent game. DO NOT listen to the people who say you are better off with GRID 2, ive played the game before, trust me, you want this one. Although I do recommend buying it on sale, the GRID series tends to be on sale more than most racing games on steam, so I was able to get it for 10 bucks. Also, if you are looking for a racing sim, go buy asseto corsa, do not buy GRID.","February 2, 2015","true","31.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Thankfully that nice balance between Sim and Arcade is still there in GRID Autosport.\n\nIf you think you're not an arcade racer, but also not somebody who want's to play it too hardcore like a Sim, this is the perfect game","June 21, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That makes this game very fun and playable with w,a,s,d and arrow keys.\n\nThe car selection is huge, you get everything in between hot hatches and formula 1. Touring cars, muscle cars, hypercars, you name it, they have it.\n\nThe graphics are great, obviously not the best in the world right now, but still insane.\n\nThe frame rate is very constant, I dont have the best PC ever, only 6GB of ram and a core i5, but it still runs at 40-50fps pretty much no matter what I'm doing. I cant say the same for games like need for speed.\n\nThe track selection is immense, granted, some of the tracks are just variations of the same track, but it's still difficult to run out of places to race.\n\nMultiplayer is great as well, impact ratings keep all of the jerks out of the race and let everyone have fun without being killed by some idiot driving on the track backwards.\n\nHowever, there are some flaws. For example, when GRID autosport says you are going to drive formula A, or formula 1, it gives you an indycar instead. Indycar and F1 are NOT the same thing.\n\nAnother flaw has to be the DLC, which has been a problem for all of the GRID games. There is so much of it, and none of it is free. You want an extra car? Better have $5 lying around.\nThis also effects multiplayer, half of the time the party leader is using DLC that you probably dont have, and there is usually no other party to join.\n\nThe cokcpit wiew is super blurry as well, not a big problem, but still something I want to point out.\n\nMy final thoughts? Still an excellent game. DO NOT listen to the people who say you are better off with GRID 2, ive played the game before, trust me, you want this one. Although I do recommend buying it on sale, the GRID series tends to be on sale more than most racing games on steam, so I was able to get it for 10 bucks. Also, if you are looking for a racing sim, go buy asseto corsa, do not buy GRID.","February 2, 2015","true","31.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/recommended/255220/","LDR","Kiksu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/","183 products in account","There's a problem with the Steam ratings system, and that's that you have a binary "YES" or "NO" as to if you'd recommend a game.  I need a third category for GRID Autosport, a wavy hand, non-committal noise, a sort of shrug.\n\nI'm a big fan of racing games in general and have been buying Codemasters racers since TOCA Race Driver 2.  I’ve bought GRID and GRID 2 and enjoyed them both, I actually wrote a positive review of GRID2 on Steam.  But GRID Autosport is...*does hand rocking back and forward motion*.\n\nSo what's wrong?  The biggest fault in this game is the AI.  It’s bad, not terrible, just pretty stupid.  AI cars really want to hit that racing line.  Quite often you'll find them piling up at the first corner as they all try to take the same line through.  A savvy player can avoid the melee and gain quite a few places straight away.  More annoying is when you're taking a corner and the AI clips your back end sending you spinning out.  Of course, this happens in real world racing but it feels all to frequent in GRID Autosport making the AI feel cheap and frustrating.  It made me wonder if the flashback game mechanic was implemented because they couldn’t be bothered to fix the AI and decided that the player could just rewind and take evasive action should they get rear ended and end up in a wall!  But because the AI behaves so badly you don't really care about smashing them up to get ahead.  This can turn races into something of a demolition derby and ruins the immersion somewhat.  Far better was the system in Need For Speed: Shift which rewarded you for a more passive (or aggressive) racing style, that way you could at least play a persona.  Also the less said about the total waste of an AI race partner the better.  There's also nothing new here.  If you've played the last two outings you've seen most of what this game has to offer.  I might be mistaken but I think all the tracks are recycled and they've ditched the point-to-point racing that was so much fun in GRID2 (though you can get it back as DLC, it’s not part of the main career mode).  Drag racing could have been new and fun (reminiscent of the ace drag racing from Need For Speed Underground) but again, that comes as a DLC and isn't part of the main career.\n\nSo what's right?  Graphically it’s quite the looker.  The cars are detailed (and there are quite a few of them), the tracks feel alive and interesting (racing through the construction site that is Dubai is a particular highlight).  The car handling seems to have been refined from the previous outing and the multi-disciplined approach means you really have to focus on how you drive as you, for example, switch between the easy to drive, stable at speed Touring Cars and the fast but skittish GT Race Cars.  Moreover the number of disciplines keeps things varied and interesting.  You'll be bumper to bumper racing in Touring Cars, managing your tyre wear in Endurance, getting sideways in Drift.  That you don't need to be the best in a particular discipline to progress is neat too (mid table finishes still earn XP, albeit slower than finishing top).\n\nThere's enough in this game to keep me coming back (and I will do until I finish it because I'm compulsive like that) so because Steam only gives me a binary choice I'll give a thumbs up.  But this is likely the last GRID game I pick up.  The racing marketplace is about to get a whole lot more competitive with the exciting Project CARS on the horizon, and I reckon the GRID series, without an overhaul, will end up languishing in mid-pack.","February 23, 2015","true","35.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I am playing with a Xbox controller and the controls are not super responsive and direct when it comes to the steering with the L joystick, but it's acceptable. You might need to get used to it a bit in the beginning, after that it's fine.\n\nThe game has a ton of cups and challenges to keep you busy for many many hours (enough content). Even with the arcady feel it is actually quite chalenging to drive against the AI! So far as I have played the amount of different tracks is quite low, I played for 7 hours and only driven half a dozen different tracks (and reversed), also the amount of different cars and classes is quite low.\n\nOne really noticable quality gap in the game is the cockpit view. It is really low detailed in most/all cars and they made the cockpit on the lower part of your screen blurry to camouflage it. It is extra noticable, because basically everything else in the game is pretty solid and good quality.\n\nAs for realism I think this game falls far below the racing sims on the market. Even Gran Turismo feels more real (direct/responsive) when it comes to car handling, but the AI in GRID is way more fun to race against and the races are more custimizable then in Gran Turismo. I also don't think that this game tries or was intended to be a realistic racing sim, but an enjoyable not over complicated racing experience. And that it does quite well.\n\nOverall I think this is a pretty solid and fun racing game and worthy to pick up during a sale.","April 26","true","18.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/recommended/255220/","mcmetroracing","MetroRacer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/","111 products in account","Yet another beloved Codemasters game saga. "Race Driver" games have been out there since early 2000, and although the name of the latest games has changed gradually to "GRID", the focus of the saga keeps exactly the same as in its origins nearly 15 years ago. I have got the 2002 "Pro Race Driver" and from it I could get a well-determined scheme of what the saga is meant to be like. First of all, the title says it all: Pro Race Driver. Yup, you are a race driver going from the bottom to the top of Motorsport, always on tarmac races. What we get then is a large variety of cars and circuits to make the ladder along the career changing and entertaining.\n\nBack in 2007, with "Race Driver GRID" being released (and in my all honest opinion, one of the best games I've ever played), the saga was brought back. Later in 2012, the game library grew with GRID 2 to finally lose the name "Race Driver" and pretend like it was a brand new saga. Now, after the release in 2014 of GRID Autosport, some say this may be the end of the GRID saga. As exposed before GRID is actually part of the Race Driver saga, so maybe the next tarmac-racing game by Codemasters may not be called GRID but will still be part of the RD line. No developer is stupid enough to let down one of their most successful sagas ever while it still sells well.\n\nAfter some context introduction, it's time for the actual review:\n\nAt first sight this brand new game might look like a GRID 2 DLC. Visuals are almost identical to it, and as in the store page what you see from the game are screenshots, you feel convinced of your opinion.\nGRID Autosport shares a lot of visual features with GRID 2 indeed. But the game is directioned in a completely different way. First up, GRID 2 was mostly about street races with road cars. GRID Autosport is undeniably focused on circuit races. This may not look like a big difference, but it actually makes the game feel 100% renewed.\n\nI think I share the opinion that having to unlock the 75% of the cars in game sucks. Or that to race certain competitions you have to pass through the ♥♥♥♥♥est races in the ♥♥♥♥♥est circuits with the ♥♥♥♥♥est cars. At GRID Autosport they have broken up with that annoying tradition and you are completely free to start your career mode in whatever competition category you prefer. For example, if you hate street races you can always kick off the Endurance season if you fancy. A great kudos to Codies for that. Plus if you want to take up a quick race at any game mode you can race with any car in game. They are all available from moment you click the "Play" button on Steam for the first time.\n\nAnother huge improvement in which most of the upgrades of this game are based is the graphics engine. 4K compatible and stable at 60FPS or more, which basically means that the game is ridiculously well built. If you don't own a top GPU which supports these new performance features, you still get a good bit with high FPS and affordable higher settings. GRID 2 was annoyingly bad in that way, with massive FPS drops and nonsense low FPS on any setting...\nGraphics are clear and textures are the summit of all Codemasters titles. Grass, tyres, tarmac trees are brilliant. Cars keep the trend of "so-so" quality though. Modelling is not extremelly accurate, but still decent.\n\nPhysics were a huge problem in GRID 2. The 2007 GRID was much better in that field, and now these realistic physics are back. If you spin off the track and insane speeds and get onto the gravel, you are likely to end up rolling. Track bumps fit properly-made suspension works. If you go real quick on a staright and there's a steep lift on the track, you may take off the tarmac shortly. If you go full YOLO out of a turn and drive over the curb you can be sure to be going to lose control of the car. Just some remarkable examples of how well detaled this game is.\n\nHandling confirms that the latest addition to the saga is still an arcade. It would be better to say it is a mixture between a sim and an arcade. Handling is not at all precise. At any turn you'll have to make slight drifts to get hold of the car because if you just lock the pad axle on a single position the car is going to oversteer as if it had been kicked from the tail by Superman. This is common through all the previous games. If you get the purpose of this handling's characterictics you'll believe you're a pro racer saving the driving line with corrections. If not, you'll leave the game apart thinking it is unplayable. It's all a question of practice though.\n\nCodemasters warned that AI is so dirty in this game. They somehow managed to program an AI that is not dumb at all but behaves as any real online racer. It has personality... Plus the amazingly-superbly-awesome new feature of radio interaction with your trackside engineer. By pushing some buttons you can ask him for any information about race status and your car's damages and tyre wear. Also, you can tell your team mate to be more aggressive or to defeat his position. Real cool stuff.\n\nSound field. I do think that at Codemasters they copy-paste the car sound files from one game to another. It is true that GRID Autosport has a wider range of hi-fi sounds like wind, crowd cheering and more accurate gravel and grass sounds when you spin off the track. Engines just sound the same, just a ridiculous high-pitched monotone sound. Of course it has some remarkable distinctions for some cars. Some Endurance cars sound just too badass, but the sound itself looks too simplistic.\n\nCockpit camera was painfully missing in GRID 2 and now it is back. Interestingly there are two on board cams available, one nearer from the windshield than the other, more driver-eye like. At first sight you'll see a major difference from any other on board cam from any other game. I don't know if it is made on purpose to bring one of the best graphics effects ever on a racing game or a merely ridiculous attempt to hide bad work on the cockpits. The thing is that the interior of the cars are blurry and anything from behind the winshield is nitide. In my opinion it looks absolutely mega, but that's up to everyone's opinion.\n\nSo does GRID Autosport stick to the scheme of the rest of the "Race Driver" games? Indeed. Career mode keeps the essence of being focused on you as a driver exactly as the 2002 game did. So many circuits with their variants and an impressive range of cars. It never gets boring.\n\n8/10","April 12, 2015","true","14.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I honestly don't know what Codemasters is attempting to do.  With the first game, I thought they were going for the Forza/Gran Turismo market, which... they didn't succeed at.  With Grid 2, I have NO IDEA what the hell they were thinking.  So that brings us to Grid Autosport, which still doesn't seem to go for that sim feel, although it's much closer than Grid 2 ever was.  So if that's not the goal, this doesn't really feel like an arcade racer, either.  It just feels like a very pretty, but ultimately not-great racing game.  The entire series has an identity crisis, as if it doesn't know whether to be a sim or an arcade game, and that just leaves it teetering in the middle where nobody is going to be satisfied.","July 1, 2015","false","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Grid Autosport also brings back the rather enjoyable multidisciplinary racing aspect of Grid 1 and TOCA series where the game features cars from exotic hyper cars, Australian V8 Supercars, Formula 3 Open Wheel, GT3s, drift machines and so on. The career is serviceable as the whole team management aspect in Grid 1 was axed so you are very much a driver for hire now which is disappointing to me. Personally, I would still recommend Custom Cup (or commonly known as Quick Race in most racing games) where you can choose to race with any car and on any tracks to your liking, considering all the cars and tracks are unlocked once you boot up the game. There are some issues with the game such as the poorly implemented multiplayer mode, AI that can be too aggressive at times and a lot of recycled content that some might find it to be a bit lazy. Still, with a revamped and improved driving physics, driving on tracks such as the licensed race track, Red Bull Ring in Grid Autosport is certainly more enjoyable than Grid 2.\n\nI do recommend Grid Autosport to you if you enjoyed Grid 1 or TOCA series but was disappointed with Grid 2's direction.

In fact this game does do one thing better than any other racing game I've played, and that's making me feel like I'm the racecar driver and not the car itself. All other racers I've felt like a sentient car born with an urge to go as fast around a track as possible. In Grid Autosport I feel like a driver racing for my team and trying to get the attention of better teams so I can further my career. It makes winning more satisfying and battling it out against rivals even more intense.

It is an overall solid action racing game but is still lacking in great and important features that would greatly improve the series like better AI, pit stops, dynamic weather, dynamic time of day change, rally racing, longer races and get rid of that dam cockpit blur.\n\noverall I give it a 8 out of 10 for the great graphics, car selection and the replay value","May 26, 2015","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I had high hopes for GRID 2, eagerly awaited it while still churning out laps on GRID. GRID 2, put simply, was an abomination that Codemasters should be ashamed of. But then, to atone for their sins, along came GRID Autosport.\n\nIt is everything GRID 2 should have been. I feel like Codies made this game purely to make up for the god awful retch of a game that was GRID 2. But Autosport delivers the original GRID experience, but expands upon it in so many new ways. Better models, tracks, detail, and racing. It is deep, challenging, and fun. I am playing through Career on Hard and though I get the odd win here and there, it is a struggle. Which means the learning curve and difficulty is almost spot on.\n\nThe AI does not race like real racers do, however. They are way too aggressive, if you are on the racing line and ahead of them, they will hit you every time to put themselves on the racing line, often taking you out. It is a robotic AI, not so much a 'real racing' AI. But you have flashback, and once you become aware of how the AI drives and corners, you can work with it. It's not so bad as to become a real problem, plus as with all racing games, you can ALWAYS OUTBRAKE THE AI. I would love to find a racing game one day, where the AI throws caution to the wind and overtakes under brakes more aggressively than a human can. As with GRID Autosport, like most other racing games,  the game is won and lost in the corners, and who can outbrake the best.\n\nOnce day, a racing game will realise this - and adjust to the way a human drives - or at least, combat outbraking by outmanoevering or using [prediction, as a real human racer does.\n\nBut all in all... I love GRID Autosport. I use a Hyperdrive ockpit and Logitech MOMO Force wheel and pedals. Sometimes I will even put my motorbike helmet and gloves on to race. I'm that much of an e-racing Nerd. But I don't care.\n\nThanks Codemasters, for delivering on the GRID Legacy. Just a shame you didn't also deliver it to next gen consoles.  Cause in a month or two, it's gonna be all about Project Cars and the Legacy of GRID will fade again. Until then, I'm still a Legend in my own Garage.","February 23, 2015","true","240.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnallyo/recommended/255220/","mcnallyo","SteerClear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnallyo/","41 products in account","GRID Autosport is a very good game yet there's something missing from it. It could be because we've seen it all before, as there's nothing majorly brand new to the series in this game, however it does feel more like the original GRID than GRID 2. Which is a good thing for the original GRID's fans. A lot of tracks are repeated from GRID 1 & 2, but that's not a bad thing as most of these are the 'good' tracks including the made up San Francisco and Chicago one's.\n\nThere's a nice selection of cars in game which beats its predecessors, I think, by quite a bit. A nice bit of variety, but no way near the amount of vehicles that you'd get in Forza or Gran Turismo. Then again there isn't really any need for that many. The handling of the cars is more similar to the original GRID with that essence of both arcade and simulation (GRID 2's was arcade) however it does lean more on the simulation side a bit more this time. This game was made in about a year as it came out due to complaints from the original GRID's fans. Oh it also has in- car cam in it now, more about that below in the Pro's & Con's bit:\n\nPro's:\nNice variety of cars/ disciplines- Touring Cars- Street Racers- Open Wheel & more.\nGraphics- As always, great graphics from Codemasters. Sharp and shiny.\nLot's of tracks- Whether they be made up or real life, you will find a track that you like.\nOnline- Is (I think) better than the Career mode. You can look up or set up custom sessions. But if you can't be bothered looking through things let it plough you face first in to a mixture of races! You can also be in clubs and change car skins/ livery's whatever you want to call it.\nMenu- I like the menu's\nHandling- I think it's pretty damn good, no more drifting in every single car like in GRID 2.\n\nCon's:\nMusic- Lack's music. GRID 1 & 2 had more variety and had a big part in the games.\nIn- car cam- It's there, it's just blurry. There's also a dashboard cam. I'm not too bothered about it, I just don't get why they would have a good one in GRID 1 and not its sequels.\nRepeat tracks- Only bad for people who have played the other GRID's and want something new.\nAI- This one was difficult, they're nice and aggressive, but you can't help but feel they have the upper- hand some of the time. It's difficult to spin them out, but it's easy for them to do it to you.\nCareer- A bit bland the further you go in to it, plus having a teamate makes you not want to have one. Also you can't make your own livery's.","February 8, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is blurred. They apparently blurred it so that when you race all you see is out the window and not the car. This is very good concept but it failed. Even when the car is stationary the interior is out of focus. The sad part is that they did spend time making the interior as it is HD from outside. I would have thought that because it failed they would remove it so that I would want to play First Person.

The game itself is fun and challenging, but it's very arcade-like. More realistic than the other Grid games in the way that everyone's cars go the same speed, but it still doesn't feel like a sim, although it doesn't intend to be. So if you like arcade racing games, it's a gem, but if you prefer the realism from racing sims and are used to that, I don't recommend this.","February 8, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnallyo/recommended/255220/","mcnallyo","SteerClear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnallyo/","41 products in account","GRID Autosport is a very good game yet there's something missing from it. It could be because we've seen it all before, as there's nothing majorly brand new to the series in this game, however it does feel more like the original GRID than GRID 2. Which is a good thing for the original GRID's fans. A lot of tracks are repeated from GRID 1 & 2, but that's not a bad thing as most of these are the 'good' tracks including the made up San Francisco and Chicago one's.\n\nThere's a nice selection of cars in game which beats its predecessors, I think, by quite a bit. A nice bit of variety, but no way near the amount of vehicles that you'd get in Forza or Gran Turismo. Then again there isn't really any need for that many. The handling of the cars is more similar to the original GRID with that essence of both arcade and simulation (GRID 2's was arcade) however it does lean more on the simulation side a bit more this time. This game was made in about a year as it came out due to complaints from the original GRID's fans. Oh it also has in- car cam in it now, more about that below in the Pro's & Con's bit:\n\nPro's:\nNice variety of cars/ disciplines- Touring Cars- Street Racers- Open Wheel & more.\nGraphics- As always, great graphics from Codemasters. Sharp and shiny.\nLot's of tracks- Whether they be made up or real life, you will find a track that you like.\nOnline- Is (I think) better than the Career mode. You can look up or set up custom sessions. But if you can't be bothered looking through things let it plough you face first in to a mixture of races! You can also be in clubs and change car skins/ livery's whatever you want to call it.\nMenu- I like the menu's\nHandling- I think it's pretty damn good, no more drifting in every single car like in GRID 2.\n\nCon's:\nMusic- Lack's music. GRID 1 & 2 had more variety and had a big part in the games.\nIn- car cam- It's there, it's just blurry. There's also a dashboard cam. I'm not too bothered about it, I just don't get why they would have a good one in GRID 1 and not its sequels.\nRepeat tracks- Only bad for people who have played the other GRID's and want something new.\nAI- This one was difficult, they're nice and aggressive, but you can't help but feel they have the upper- hand some of the time. It's difficult to spin them out, but it's easy for them to do it to you.\nCareer- A bit bland the further you go in to it, plus having a teamate makes you not want to have one. Also you can't make your own livery's.","February 8, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only few problems with this game is how they have removed the option to create your own team in career mode, and you can only do this in multiplayer - which just insn't enough in my opinion. Also, dashcam/first person is absolutely awful.\n\nOther than that, a great racing game. In short, it's better than GRID 2 but not as good as GRID 1. More or less what I expected.\n\n\n7.5/10 - great fun none the less.

The tracks, the cars, the gameplay - all great.\n\nThe different classes of race and cups, the simple increase of level of each class and the selection of sponsors give this game a good linear direction. Something which was missing in Grid 2, which was all over the place like a crazy woman's makeup.\n\nThe upgrades on the cars are a bit restrictive, as it the setup on some sponsor cars, but having no control over that makes for good playability as you need to adjust your driving style for the car. And I like that.\n\nGraphics are nice maxed out, some dodgy 8-bit styling coming from building reflections on the cars.. But that's really just nit-picking. The engine seems to be a lot more polished and infinitely more optomised. A massive step up from G2.\n\nWhere the game falls down are, in my opinion, the strength of team mates and the audible names. 3rd generation of Grid should at least have more names than the first.

Looks great, sounds good, and actually plays really well once you get used to the new handling physics. Handles more like Gran Turismo 4 than it does the original GRID, but that's not a bad thing, it's just different. My primary complaint is that all variations of every track are not open to every class of car in time trials. You can only drive hatchbacks on the Okutama Sprint Circuit, for instance. The Grand Circuit is not an option. The menus are nice and sleek, too. I'd rarely make a point of that sort of thing, but it impressed me a lot for some reason.\n\nIt's a good game. So far, everything I've driven has been fun to drive, from Open Wheel, to Street, to Tuner, which I can't say for the original GRID (some of the EU and US events weren't very good). Just don't go into it expecting something which is exactly the same as GRID 2, or something that behaves like a proper simulator.","December 26, 2014","true","62.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The physics in this game are nice, you have to slow down/stop at the right point (something that can't really be said about the NfS series).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matabot/recommended/255220/","matabot","IN ITALY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matabot/","103 products in account","Ok. Look, here's how it is. Grid autosport is a beautifal game. The racing is pretty fun and more challenging than I was expecting, which is good. Unlike most games you aren't expected to win first every time and 4th-8th is acceptable for most starting racing contracts. You start off racing small class c touring cars so Ford Focus, Honda Civics and the like and then proceed into other classes. I haven't got to them all so I won't comment on that. I guarantee one of the ones around this will have.\n\nAnd whilst the UI is beautifal and well the whole game is beautifal, this WHOLE game feels like an after thought. I mean for starters when I first opened the game it felt empty, something was missing. I don't know what to say about it really. It lacks immersion maybe? And one of the most shocking things out of the box was that you HAD TO MAP IN XBOX 360 CONTROLS! WTF CODEMASTERS!!\n\nInstead of a cockpit you have the cockpit kind of blurred out, and it's modelled horribly in there. No dials in there work etc. Honestly one of the worst things I have ever seen and I want to slap whoever at codemasters thought that was ok. Because it isn't. It gives a nice effect I get that, but at the same time it is horrible and i hope i never see it in a game EVER again. THAT is one of the biggest gripes I have ever had with a game.\n\nApart from that it's pretty good, and seems to be sponsored by Intel HD Graphics weirdly enough so i am curious to see how well it might run on my new macbook air (in bootcamp obvs).\n\nShould you get this game though... well here's how I am going to lay this out. If you play A LOT of racing games you probably won't have an issue here. If you're like me who plays them occasionally you might enjoy it. If you like forza motorsport 4 and 5 well you will enjoy it but you cannot mess around and tune stock cars as much as you can on forza. This game needs to be taken seriously. And finally if you want this game as kind of SERIOUS simulator like i did save your money for project cars or assetto corsa.\n\nDon't get me wrong this is a nice game, but for some reason it's just not completely for me.\n\nNo game has really come out for PC with the kind of arcade / simulation style of Gran Turismo and Forza and thats really starting to bug me. I like forza because if i dont want to play career mode, i can just buy cars, tune them and play online and set insane lap times (1.11.459 around top gear test track nissan GT-R, 7:49 nurburgring). Which is great because forza's career mode takes hundreds of hours to do, and I don't have that time.\n\nAfter all this though do I recommend it... Well... If you can deal with the crap I talked about then yes. Else, save your money.\n\n","February 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First, I'm so exited that i can finaly tune my car! My favorite type of race in the game is the Street Race and after the Touring race, and I find these twe the most exiting part of the game! The gameplay is very good and compined with the tuning part it's getting even better. I would be happy if there was a way to do my one team later on the career instead of racing always for other teams. One thing that i don't like it's the way that the replay shows too much copkit view, the hud view and the rear spoiler and it shows less from a view that you can see the whole car and the other cars around you! Also, I really think it should have more manufactures and more cars like Subaru Impreza WRX STI, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Porsche, Lamborghini, Toyota Supra, newer models of Camaro and Corvette, Haven't played much multiplayer yet so I can't say much but all the times i had played with others there was no lag and we were more that 10 people in one race! I personaly believe this game is worthy and it's a very good racing game but always alla of us willl have something that we don't like in any game like i mentioned before the things i don't like and the things i like!","September 13, 2014","true","48.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(Yeeaah!)\n\nThis game is now closer to the good old GRID, but forget the handbrake lad, you won't be using it as you would on GRID :)\n\nGRID Autosport's assist are VERY well done, in my opinion. The old GRID assists would allow you do "derp" around with the handbrake, allowing you to go into a corner at full speed and just go around it with a perfect powerslide.\nNow Autosport's assists are an "assist". They don't give you the power to "derp" around and win, but they limit your car, in a way newer drivers would be able to feel how the game is, and drive around, but not to get good lap times.\nWhen you get rid of those assists (don't get off ABS so soon though :) ) you'll be able to really get into Hot Lapping, and getting the drifty feel around a corner and therefore going around it faster.\n\nABS should be the last assist to get rid of. Why? After letting your car oversteer all it wants, getting the brakes to lock isn't a very good idea, so, get those oversteers controlled, and then you can get into the brake locking, and being your own ABS.\nWithout ABS you'll be able to lose speed faster on a smaller amount of space, and time, therefore improving your lap times.\n\nNow, let's get into the game, not the driving itself.\n\nThe career, I found it a bit boring, but that's because of another factor we'll talk about later, and you won't be able to make your own livery ( :( ), but you'll be able to race with real sponsors, and choose the one that you want to race with.\nEach sponsor can have a different car, but they have different rewards on XP. You won't need to buy a car, since the sponsor gives you one, or several if other vehicle is needed on the event.\nSponsors also give you different possibilities in terms of vehicle setup and parts to install to improve your car's performance.\n\nOkay, I said the career was a bit boring because of the... Car color :( Nah, the Artificial Intelligence (A.K.A. AI).\n\nThis is where the juice gets sour.\n\nThe AI is a bit dumb, let's say. I've only raced it on very hard, but I think they act the pretty same on the other difficulties.\nI've experienced ramming, pushing you out of the track (into the grass, dirt, W/E), dumb lines on corners, and other "derpy" movement.\n\nThe AI is VERY aggressive but at the same time dumb and suicidal (who knows why...).\n\nOn the first races I had I found it very hard to get past the Ravenwest guys, their cars are a bit overpowered comparing to yours, and if you don't get them at the correct time, you'll have a VERY hard time, or you'll even lose the race.\n\nAI fails reacting to braking, even to other AI driver's braking, and it's a damn ramfest at the first corner.\nOnce I saw a Focus Touring car at the Hockenheimring just going straight past a hairpin, and flipping on the gravel (spooky).\n\nSo, biggest fail? AI, definitely.\n\nAbout the online.\n\nNow, here starts the fun. Racing people worldwide! Now that's amazing :)\n\nI'm a HUGE fan of online racing, but not on Sim Racing games, GRID Autosport IS NOT A SIM, it's a sim/arcade as people would call it, and this game fits me perfectly!\n\nThey have done a really good thing, so you can point out who's a rammer, and who's going to keep their line and race with the minimum contact possible.\nFollowed by the online name of the player, comes a plain circle with an exclamation mark in it.\nIt goes from Orange to White and can have 4 colors.\nOrange - Avoid this guy!\nYellow - Contact is common\nGreen - Contact is possible\nWhite - Contact is avoided\nYou'll start with a yellow circle, but don't worry, you'll get that to green or white in no time, if you race properly :) (Not like the A.I. ^^ )\n\nI've experienced some lags, like ramming the guy that was in front of me, but I didn't even touch him, but hopefully that's going to be fixed, also my connection isn't a big deal.\n\nNow, on the online you can create your own "Club", and people can apply to join it.\nYou can create your own livery for your club, just like how it was on GRID 2 :) You can change and paint wheels as well.\n\nBut, you'll have to buy your own cars. Don't worry if you don't have it, you'll be able to race anyways, but with a car that isn't your, therefore you can't change it's setup, install parts or repair it. (We'll get there very soon :) )\n\nWhen you buy your car you'll be able to level it up, and higher the level, you start unlocking setup packages, that allow you to change your car's setup. The higher the package, more freedom on setting it up. Level also unlocks parts to improve your car's performance, but everything will cost you GRID $, but not that much, a race or two can pay those :)\n\nAfter a race, you'll have to repair your car, because it was worn. It's called condition, and it's measured in percentage, the higher the percentage is, the best the car will react on an impact (more durable), and better it's performance, so keep it always on the 100% :)\n\nThe online prices are very good and equilibrated, you can also buy used cars, that are cheaper, but they have more mileage, and more mileage means the more expensive the car is to repair after it being used.\nI've never bought a used car, always stuck to newer ones, because on the long-run you'll save more money.\nUsed cars are more for flash using, let's say.\n\nTO SUM UP!\nWhat a huge review, huh :D\n\n-A bit overpriced, probably less 10€ would be it's price, but we don't know what's behind the making of the game.\n-Assist system is very well done, a newbie driver will feel safe driving on this game, but won't be faster than someone without assists.\n-AI is a bit dumb and aggressive.\n-Online is very well done and promotes fair-play.\n-I recommend this game, but probably you should wait for a discount.\n\nHope it helped :)","August 23, 2014","true","501.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emmehonsho/recommended/255220/","emmehonsho","EmmeHonsho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emmehonsho/","195 products in account","Short version: GRID Autosport is a fun and enjoyable game; it has its flaws and little problems, but overall it's a very good experience and I recommend it.\n\nNow for the whole review: in my opinion Autosport is what Grid 2 should have been. The game takes as its inspiration mostly the first Grid, with some features and ideas taken from the sequel and some new things to complete it.\n\nGRAPHICS: G:A uses (again) the Ego engine. In my opinion it works really fine, the graphics are still very nice (especially with the HD textures pack) but at the same time scalable and lightweight; I can play without problems on my not recent laptop on medium-high settings without any problems. Sometimes there's a little freeze of half a second (it seems a common issue regardless of the pc), but happens once every 5-6 races so it's not really a problem. There's the controversial point of the cockpit view: it makes its return from the absence of Grid 2, but we don't have the detailed cockpits of Grid; instead we have non-functional instruments (only the steering wheel turns), "hidden" by a blur filter. It's better than not having one, but it's quite disappointing (seeing also older games like Shift series having beautiful cockpits).\n\nDRIVING MODEL: it's known that the game doesn't aim to be a simulator. The game tries to be halfway between an arcade and a simulator, and in my opinion succeeds. The game is accessible enough, with a lot of driving aids like traction control, ABS, racing line, etc. but with all deactivated races become challenging enough without the "frustration" of a simulator. Clean driving and racing lines will net you good times, and the Grid 2 drifting is completely gone. Sometimes the car behaves a little strangely (from a realistic point of view), but it's natural in the game's system.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER CAREER: one of the most disappointing things of the game in my opinion. The scheme is: you have 5 disciplines to choose from, every championship won will make you level up and unlock more championships of the same discipline. But there's no other progress: you always drive as a hired driver and won't create your own team. There's no money earning nor car customization - you simply choose a championship, one from the teams that offer you a car and race. Honestly you can do exactly the same by playing custom cups, with the execption that everything's unlocked from the start.\n\nMULTIPLAYER: the real strong point of the game. As in the single player, there are 5 categories of racing (Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuned, Street). When you decide to go online, you can create or join a custom cup (which specifies the events, tracks, cars, etc.) or jump onto a default playlist, which spawns across the various cars and tracks available in the discipline. When you play online you can use rental cars or buy your own with the money earned from racing. The advantage of using your own cars is that everyone has its own "level" and gaining experience will unlock you upgrades, but only for the SPECIFIC car. So even if someone played 200 hours but never touched, for example, touring cars he won't have any upgrade available - and you can see that because there are 5 separated experience levels for the player, one for each discipline. You can create or join clubs, customize your liveries and so on. The races are really smooth and there's rarely lag. For me the multiplayer is a really good point.\n\nSo, to summarize, this game feels like the "real GRID2", it's the sequel of Grid. The average review scores are derived by the fact that this game has nothing "extraordinary" with respect to Grid 2, it seems like that Codemasters acknowledged their mistake with the second game and made this to return on track. It has many tracks and cars, it's a great experience, but if you were burned by Grid 2 you will be pleased by the return to the roots of the series. It's worth its price, but you can feel "cheated" by this game that should've been released years ago with the name Grid 2. In this case, it's better to wait for a discount before buying it. For the others, it's one of the best racing games of its genre, and it's still recommended for everyone, especially if you plan to play online!","July 8, 2014","true","76.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Grid though, is somewhat old now, but believe it or not, the AI worked pretty well in the first game. In Grid autosport, that is not the case, they have somehow gotten worse. The AI takes no account for you being on the track too, AT ALL. The game is a lot of fun, when playing against players, but when I bought this game I had hoped singleplayer would be just as fun, maybe even better then the first one, which had me entertained for a very long time. The way the difficulty works in this game, isn't how good the AI is at driving, which it should be, when you turn up the difficulty, their cars are simply faster than your car, and impacts doesn't throw them off course, which it most certainly does to the player. I can only hope, since this is a fairly new game, that these things are problems they will be fixed through updates, this game could be so much more fun, and it would be a shame for this game to never reach the same level as the first Grid, because if not, this will be the last Grid game we might ever see, since no one can afford to very bad games in a row.","August 31, 2014","true","73.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

All the ingredients are there. Impressive technical competency, a large amount of content, outstanding attention to detail in graphics & audio. But it fails at the fundamentals. The driving just isn’t as fun and interesting as it is in Gran Turismo or Forza.\n\nIn order to make a track racing game interesting over the long haul, the tiniest details need to be just right. Not only does the underlying physics model need to be complex, but it needs to be communicated to the player just right so they can instinctively feel what’s going on. The camera angle plays a huge part in this, which is easy to demonstrate in Gran Turismo. In Gran Turismo the bumper cam is the defacto way to play the game. The alternative angles, like behind the car, are all hilariously awful in execution. You can’t see properly where you’re going, it’s completely stiff in an almost unnerving way. When you use the bumper cam you can see the car rearing back, diving forwards, tilting to the sides, all in subtle ways which tell you how stable the car is, or if you’re about to spin out etc.\n\nGrid Autosport feels simplistic. It isn’t complex enough, it’s too smooth. It’s almost hard to nail down exactly what it does wrong, because there’s plenty of great arcade racing games which aren’t boring. They’re usually much faster than Grid Autosport. Like the original Grid which met criticism from simulator fans who thought it felt like a racing sim sped up to 200% speed. I loved that aspect of it! When you drive down the same tracks in Grid Autosport at a more realistic speed, you’re given time to reflect on how nothing interesting is going on in the game. In Gran Turismo it’s engaging to drive slow piece of crap cars thanks to the exceptional feel of the physics. In Grid Autosport I’m struggling to be excited about the fastest cars in the world.\n\nThe career mode in Grid Autosport is easily 50+ hours long, and I will never finish it. The game isn’t good enough to hold my interest. When I first got the game I played it a lot. Now I fire it up once a month and play it for a hour or two. That’s the level of engagement I get from it. And that’s fine! It has its merits, which make it a nice experience. But when their novelty fades, you’re left with only the underlying game to carry it. That’s where it fails.\n\nDespite this, I’m recommending it. It’s ok! Good enough to grab on sale. The first 10 hours or so are great. It’s only after that the tedium hits you like a ton of bricks.","December 16, 2014","true","18.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This game is offensively too broken to justify spending even $5 on if you intend to be chasing any sort of game progression or steam achievements.\n\nSure, the racenet site is pretty terrible, does a poor job of barely handling the minimal functionality required to support the features for which it is needed.  Sure, the AI and other humans are often out of sync between gamers in the same multiplayer game.  Sure, you will usually find multiplayer lobby empty unless you switch your Steam download location to somewhere in the EU.  That's all relatively trivial next to the known save game corruption bug that's wiped out my progress twice within 6 months.\n\nTwice now, the game has rendered my save data corrupt.  Both times, this was after normal quitting of the game through the exit option in the menu.  This is apparently not uncommon, and has happened with a number of others.  None of the online racenet progress is actually stored online in any way that can be recovered.  Nor, for some reason, is the Steam cloud being leveraged to recover one's lost progress.\n\nSome gamers have recommended  disabling Steam Cloud support for the game, citing repeated failures by codemasters to handle it properly in other games.  Further, it's been recommended that users go through the hassle of digging into their C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\Userdata\<steamuserid>\255220 to save backups regularly.\n\nAfter the first time it happened to me, I disabled Steam cloud support, and made a copy of the 255220 userdata folder on occasion.  I eventually got comfortable and a bit lazy, and had not backed up for some time, at which point it occurred again.\n\nHundreds of online races, purchases, upgrades, and funds lost.  Hundreds of career races and progress lost.  No way to complete the missing achievements without first redoing all the lost effort to get back to where you were before your save game data was corrupted.\n\nI honestly think this game could be good if the publisher could be bothered to fix the handful of bugs plaguing it.   It appears the developer has no intention of fixing any bugs in the game at this point.  Though one could argue hours of fun racing did occur, resetting users' progress when they are halfway through the achievements... repeatedly... is absolutely not an acceptable situation.\n\nMost active developers update their games with bugfixes as the need arises.  Codemasters apparently feels this game is complete, bugs and all, and is focused on putting their efforts into releasing new paid-for content instead of fixing the glitches.\n\nI could say save yourself the money, but honestly, save yourself the wasted time chasing achievements, and save yourself the frustration and anger at a developer who took your money and doesn't seem to care that the game is broken.\n\nTrivial lackings in addition to the above\n\n* no choice of tires\n* no choice of weather\n* no choice of road surface (all tarmac)\n* limited online garage slots prevent owning all vehicles","August 24, 2015","false","377.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

In case of this one - I have to admit - by looking at the screenshots I expected a redone GRID 2. I was both disappointed and surprised, but compared to GRID 2 this game is a completely different animal. It looks different, it feels different, and most importantly it drives different.\n\nAutosport is not a simulation yet, but it is definitely a hard game. In the beginning it's difficult to keep your car from sliding, and even Formula 1 GP racetracks seem somewhat narrow.  While the first two GRIDs focused on reckless arcade action with drifting involved even in ordinary touring races, here it's not recommended. You have to fight for grip, but after three seasons I easily got my driving style right with nearly no driver aids (I only left the ABS on) and no tweaking of my gamepad options (Logitech F710) was needed at all.\n\nProbably the only two things I dislike about the game are the cockpit cam and drifting sessions. In case of cockpit most people complain about its looks. I actually liked the looks, but after three races I switched to hood cam and discovered that the game runs smoother. Is it a shame? Maybe, but TOCA RD 3 didn't have a proper cockpit cam and I didn't mind. In case of drifting sessions I don't like that it feels like a completely different physical model, and the car isn't that different from the ordinary racing car, which you use on different tracks - of course then they handle quite differently. Additionally I hate that drifting was embedded into series full of racing. In most series you use the same car for almost all races. In the first TUNER event I used three completely different cars. So this gave the feel that TUNER series is just o compilation of things which didn't quite fit other series.\n\nOtherwise I recommend it. It definitely is a proper racing game, but no longer one for casual racers.\n\n-	Doesn’t run as smoothly as GRID 2 on my PC\n-	Cockpit cam\n-	Most of the cars taken from GRID 2\n+ Challenging and entertaining physical model\n+ Lots and lots of my favorite racetracks\n+ AI does mistakes again (I wish they implemented this function in Formula 1 games)\n+ Most of car models are nicely redone\n","July 20, 2014","true","65.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

GRID Autosport is going back to its roots and feels much more like a simulator as seen in the TOCA series of games and GRID 1 ( if you guys have been following the series for that long, you will know what I mean ). The driving in this game definately appeals more to hardcore "Sim" racer ( by bringing back cockpit view among other things ) and this game definately rewards you for that by giving you XP bonuses for driving a clean race without collisions.\n\nRight off the bat, the game looks graphically similar to GRID 2 but there are noticeable improvements in car textures ( Free DLC to update car livery textures to 4k res ), lighting and shadows.\n\nMultiplayer is quite fun with you having to work your way up from the bottom. Each car you own in Multiplayer has its own milage, so the higher the milage the more the car will cost to maintain. 12 players lined up on the ( AI can be used to fill in the blanks ) all racing to the finish line.

My steering wheel has zero force feedback going to it. Why would this be turned off in a racing game? Even after 30 minutes of tinkering I got a setup that was atleast driveable but sill felt disconnected After racing for a bit I only got further disappointed, handling is bleh, braking far too sharp and the worse part of this game, the AI. The AI is literally pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or overly aggressive, with any contact resulting in bouncing off of them or you spinning out. Interior view has everything from the dashboard back looking like a camera lense with vaseline on it. No idea if the high res texture pack fixes it but I refuse to download a 3GB "patch" for something that should have never been left like that in a title such as GRID.\n\nThe good, I really do like the option of having a second monitor display race information in a broadcasting layout. Would have loved it even more to pick what items to have up on the second monitor but I am not complaining there. I also like the benchmarking ability to better optimize your ingame graphical settings.

The graphics are ace and the framerates are f****ing amazing. The only slight annoyance is the cockpit view has been slapped on in somewhat of a hurry it seems (public pressure) and for that reason it hasn't been done justice.  However at least the cockpit feature is back and actually that's the reason I bought this game and ignored Grid2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Topherus/recommended/255220/","Topherus","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Topherus/","264 products in account","This game is pretty hit and miss. Gone are the GRID 1 days of building your own team, earning money, and hiring teammates. Now all you get to do is pick which team you’re racing for each season. And if you’re not racing for Ravenwest, prepare for your teammate to be utterly useless. If you are racing for Ravenwest, get ready for your teammate to try and kill you, because the AI in this game is set to M for ‘Murder’. The AI doesn’t even try and pretend to race cleanly. They will run themselves off track just to hit you. There are some good parts, the graphics are really nice, and the handling is better than Grid 2, but all of the cars are still way too happy to slide their tails out, especially in the Formula category. I can’t talk much about the online stuff, but the random challenges are a nice break from the monotony of grinding levels in each of the disciplines for single player. Speaking of which, you better enjoy all of the different disciplines, because if you want to complete the game, you have to play all of the disciplines equally to level them up and unlock the GRID Series tournaments. Don’t like Endurance or Street? Too bad, you won’t be getting any further. The last thing I have to say about this game is that I don’t condone the amount of DLC that Codemasters has started incorporating into their titles. The last thing I wanted to see was a Season Pass for this game, but here we are. Long story short, good graphics, meh handling, grindy single player. If you can find this game on sale and were a fan of GRID 1, go for it, just don’t get your hopes up.","November 13, 2014","true","69.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then Grid 2 was announced but they said they weren't including cockpit view. That's lazy as hell and I skipped Grid 2. Then Grid Autosport was announced and cockpit view was making a return. YAY! Just recently all of Codemaster's games recieved major discounts. I picked up Grid Autosport and gave it a try. I'm over 10 hours in and while the game is fun overall, there are a few things I don't like. The main thing is that yes, the cockpit view is back, but only sort of. The view is there, but the gauges are a static image, any car that has shift lights don't actually have working shift lights, and then the entire dash is blurred. The rearview mirrors don't even work and they, too, are blurred. There is also the lack of a field of view option.\n\nThere is also rubberbanding. It's the strongest in the touring car discipline. You can disable it by deleting a file but that file is tied to the game's anti-piracy system for some reason. This means that if you delete the file to get rid of rubberbanding, the game won't let you save your progress. That's ridiculous and pathetic. The AI is also extremely aggressive and will slam into you when you try to pass them. Codemasters wants this game to have some sim-like elements but won't include a full cockpit view and adds rubberbanding. It's like they want to make a racing game but also don't want to make a racing game.\n\nThere aren't a whole lot of tracks present but the ones included do look alright. The cars look nice as well. There's some DLC available (of course) but I'm not spending any more money on this game so I'm not sure how that content is.\n\nThere are some positives, though. The graphics are okay and there's no FPS lock. The game runs pretty smoothly. There's a few different disciplines and a decent variety of vehicles. Lots of input devices are supported and there's a nice amount of graphical options and difficulty options. The sounds are pretty good, from engine noises to crowds and track sounds, everything sounds nice. So while the game can be fun, I can't recommend it due to the half-♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit view and inclusion of rubberbanding AI. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it at its normal $50 price. Wait a while and pick it up when it gets to $10 if you really want to try it.","September 8, 2014","false","20.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is the best there actually is right now in PC racing.  In fact, I would venture to say that for a while this will be the standard, although we will have to see how Assetto Corsa and Project CARS turns out, but as for now, this is the crowning king.\nHowever, the DLC, about that, yeah, I don't like it, but I think that if the company themselves would market this as an MMO with a monthly, then release the features as they have been, then everyones jimmys wouldnt be rustled.  The bottom line, right or wrong, DLC is the new gaming concept over subscription.\nThink about it ESO $50 then $15 a month, WoW pretty much the same, SWTOR on its release was the same, you get what I am saying.  In fact many MMO's especially FTP, and games like The Secret World, offer issues on a quarterly basis, that expand the game, this is really no different.\nAm I defending the DLC tactic, not really, but on the same token the company has to have some motivation to support the game after launch, unlike MXGP, and other lesser games.\nThe true test will be what this game is like in a couple of months, and then see if the bugs and AI issues have been sorted out, at that time I will eat my review, but as of now I reccomend the game, and hope these issues are sorted.\n","July 23, 2014","true","90.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In fact, I would venture to say that for a while this will be the standard, although we will have to see how Assetto Corsa and Project CARS turns out, but as for now, this is the crowning king.\nHowever, the DLC, about that, yeah, I don't like it, but I think that if the company themselves would market this as an MMO with a monthly, then release the features as they have been, then everyones jimmys wouldnt be rustled.  The bottom line, right or wrong, DLC is the new gaming concept over subscription.\nThink about it ESO $50 then $15 a month, WoW pretty much the same, SWTOR on its release was the same, you get what I am saying.  In fact many MMO's especially FTP, and games like The Secret World, offer issues on a quarterly basis, that expand the game, this is really no different.\nAm I defending the DLC tactic, not really, but on the same token the company has to have some motivation to support the game after launch, unlike MXGP, and other lesser games.\nThe true test will be what this game is like in a couple of months, and then see if the bugs and AI issues have been sorted out, at that time I will eat my review, but as of now I reccomend the game, and hope these issues are sorted.\n","July 23, 2014","true","90.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Said it was very 'arcadey'. But as you can see form my profile, I ended up playing it quite alot and enjoyed it for what it was... Anyway, I had high hopes for Autosport when I heard Grid 2's failings had been addressed based on feedback from the community. Cockpit view in this version and more realistic handling. A cross between sim and arcade. However, even though I havent played this much yet, I was instantly disappointed. Cockpit view is a joke, it's really blurry and you can't see the car interior or the gauges. The first Grid is better! I'll probably end up playing Autosport with bonnet view like I did for Grid 2.

In case of this one - I have to admit - by looking at the screenshots I expected a redone GRID 2. I was both disappointed and surprised, but compared to GRID 2 this game is a completely different animal. It looks different, it feels different, and most importantly it drives different.\n\nAutosport is not a simulation yet, but it is definitely a hard game. In the beginning it's difficult to keep your car from sliding, and even Formula 1 GP racetracks seem somewhat narrow.  While the first two GRIDs focused on reckless arcade action with drifting involved even in ordinary touring races, here it's not recommended. You have to fight for grip, but after three seasons I easily got my driving style right with nearly no driver aids (I only left the ABS on) and no tweaking of my gamepad options (Logitech F710) was needed at all.\n\nProbably the only two things I dislike about the game are the cockpit cam and drifting sessions. In case of cockpit most people complain about its looks. I actually liked the looks, but after three races I switched to hood cam and discovered that the game runs smoother. Is it a shame? Maybe, but TOCA RD 3 didn't have a proper cockpit cam and I didn't mind. In case of drifting sessions I don't like that it feels like a completely different physical model, and the car isn't that different from the ordinary racing car, which you use on different tracks - of course then they handle quite differently. Additionally I hate that drifting was embedded into series full of racing. In most series you use the same car for almost all races. In the first TUNER event I used three completely different cars. So this gave the feel that TUNER series is just o compilation of things which didn't quite fit other series.\n\nOtherwise I recommend it. It definitely is a proper racing game, but no longer one for casual racers.\n\n-	Doesn’t run as smoothly as GRID 2 on my PC\n-	Cockpit cam\n-	Most of the cars taken from GRID 2\n+ Challenging and entertaining physical model\n+ Lots and lots of my favorite racetracks\n+ AI does mistakes again (I wish they implemented this function in Formula 1 games)\n+ Most of car models are nicely redone\n","July 20, 2014","true","65.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

DiRT Showdown) by listening to the community and what they want in a racing game.\nGRID 2 had a extremely arcade like driving model and lacked many features including interior camera, since then they've taken all the feedback and produced this great game.\nAI is extremely well done, they know what they're doing (most of the time) and have proven to be a formiddable opponent at higher AI difficulties.\nAlso there are many many camera angles to suit anybody's preference.\n\nStory:\n\nThis game features quite a flexible campaign to become the best at all 5 disciplines and become the GRID Champion.\nIt's pretty much the same as Forza in which you choose a series to do and then you do it.\nGRID makes this concept more enjoyable by making you pick what team you'd like to race for the series and that team has objectives to complete during that season and certain vehicles picked out for you. You also get a teammate in that series (Beware, They're pretty damn bad) which you control their aggression through 5 stages.\nDefend Position, Hold Position, Balanced, Push Position, Attack Position\nThis makes for very dynamic gameplay as you also have to focus on another AI's aggresion of the race and estimate their stress levels.\nEach team has a livery for particular vehicles such as: Kicker's Volkswagon Golf Livery.\nThe real joy is in the Multiplayer portion of the game.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nIn Multiplayer you have to earn money by doing challenges and racing other players in intense races.\nNormally that's all a Multiplayer is? Yeah but not in this game.\nThe real joy of Multiplayer is managing a garage of vehicles you've purchased and then making custom liveries for them giving a sense of personalisation and pride.\nThe higher the rank the more range of sponsors you can put onto your vehicle.\nYou can also make a Club of friends or strangers that has a custom made livery for all members to use.\n\nCons:\n\nThis game would be great if only these four things weren't on this portion of the review.\n\n- Interior is poorly textured and blurred. Originally made so people would focus on the track instead of the interior making\na saddening atmosphere in the vehicle.\n\n- No looking around the vehicle's interior. Another let down but at least 4K users get a great version of the game where\nthey can see all of the cockpit.\n\n- Blurred out mirrors. The side and rear view mirrors are blurred out and don't actually work at all which is another\nsaddening aspect of the interior viewing.\n\n- Not many people playing multiplayer.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this review and I hope this helped make you decide if you'd like to buy it or not.\n\nI give this a 9 out of 10","August 29, 2014","true","37.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(106 minutes when writing this).\n\nIf you're looking for a racing sim: this is the wrong game for you. If you're looking for a fun arcade racing game: you could try this game, but Need for Speed or Grid 2 would be recommended if you're an arcade racer. This game is in the middle of being a racing sim and being an arcade game.\n\nYou have to be able to control a fast racing car on track to play this game, but you don't need to driver super realistic. Sliding a bit trough corners are OK, but you have to fight cars in this game more than in Grid 2. I, my self, am a fan of the racing sim games, those were you have to hit braking points and apexes about perfect to have a chance, where sliding trough corners isn't the fastest way to finish. For me this game is fun to play, but not a game that satifies my racing sim needs. This game is just for fun in my opinion, not a game where you try your hardest.\n\nAI may not be perfect, they love to drive into you hard or gentle, enough to make you annoyed at some times. ALWAYS be careful when overtaking or defending. The game still is fun though, but again: just for fun, not a game for the hardcore sim racers.\n\nThe game runs very nicely on my computer, with high graphic setting. Average FPS on a decent gaming PC with high graphics can be between 45 and 50 FPS, so its fine.\n\nI would recommend this game, but remember: not a sim racing game for those of you who want that. Don't expect that. Handling is much better than arcade games though, so its not too unrealistic.","July 4, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Think more PS1 ToCA and a bit less Grid2.\n* Awesome selection of circuits/tracks and vehicles.\n* Multiple racing disciplines catered for (like Grid2) with Touring, Endurance, Street, Drift/Tuner, Open-wheelers.\n* Wear and damage mechanics fits the gameplay very well.\n* Vastly improved UI for tuning tweaks between races.\n* The garage system and XP levelling works very well, with a fairer upgrade system.  Aids longevity.\n* Streamlined menus and navigation (compared to Grid2 especially.)\n* Solo career mode is actually engaging this time.  A definate nostalgia nod to the Alain Menu rivalry of PS1 ToCA days.\n* The visuals and audio are highly optimised throughout for low-ultra PC system specs.\n* Above all - it's a fun, varied racer with that "i'll just have one more go" factor!\n\nDeductions and downsides are;\n\n* No text chat (or even spectator mode) that makes waiting around in lobbies for the next race rather dull, and democratic custom cups changes almost impossible.\n* Region-locked lobby creation is promoting tumbleweed already sadly... - i've only met 4 Americans and 1 Canadian all week [tsk, I fully realise some friends see this as a positive! rotflmao :)) ]\n* No gamepad/joystick calibration options contrary to supported wheels.\n* Disfunctional team radio feature (and absent from MP.)\n* No mirrors (or acceptable interiors for PC due to PS3/Xbox limitations) and fixed 90' headlook views.\n\nUpshot;\n\n* Touring with twelve car Mr Bean-esque pack racing in Minis around Brands Hatch is an arcade game exclusive and hilarious!  Truely it's a sight to behold, so come and join in folks.\n* Why sit there reading this Grid Autosport review when you could be on track having fun?","July 9, 2014","true","137.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

I was skeptical at first, but the more I play it, the more well designed I think it is.\n\nI read an article that Codemasters designed the game to be a mix between sim and arcade, trying to hit a sweet spot. I think they did a bang up job. The racing is solid. Cars take damage and you can check the condition. When car parts like bumpers and side view mirrors come off, they hit the road and bounce just like they would in real life. The single player is a lot of fun.\n\nNow here's some important info. You do level up in the game, and how many points you get is determined by what options you have on that make driving easier. The game takes away bonus point percentage if you are driving automatic instead of stick, if you have the camera view outside of the car instead of in the interior, the difficulty of the bots, if you're using a trail marker, stuff like that. I think that's smart and will cater very well to the hardcore crowd.\n\nThe AI in this game, is the only thing on my list of complaints. They will slow down to not slam into you, but they will run you off the road and slam you from the side. It's like playing with 12 year old trolls.\n\nYou can race many types of cars in this game, and they are categorized by 5 disciplines. F1 cars are also included. The amount of cars in this game will have you hooked. Very key in a racing game.\n\nHow's the online? For one, I don't notice any lag, really. I think the game might have a server system because I've been racing with mostly Americans/Canadians. I am located in Miami, FL, FYI. Also, you can play with your euro buddies as well. I just haven't ended up in matchmaking with any, but I'm sure others probably have.\n\nLet me make this clear: YOU CAN ONLY UNLOCK CARS ONLINE. The single player is fun but its just for achievements. You unlock everything in multiplayer. You can play with other people or do the RaceNet challenges to make money and XP. Very important. You can also start car clubs and earn XP for it. You have to go to racenet.codemasters.com to do it. As far as registering an account, you can do that in-game and there's no e-mail verification.\n\nTo conclude, I will tell you something you don't hear often in this day and age. This game has little to no bugs. I haven't experienced any. It is very fluid and well-designed. After playing this game, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I've been recommending it to friends. I say get it. It's not a complete sim and it's not a complete arcade.","July 5, 2014","true","13.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Not easy, but gratifying when you master turns.\n- I personally, in real life, drive a recent model Ford Focus, and the control of the Focus ST in the game is as i would expect when driving the ST version of my car. If i made it a point to negotiate turns as i would in real life, it worked out better.\n\nCONS:\n\n- HOWEVER (on the last point) the ST is known for it's ludicrous cornering ability, and i had to upgrade the car and Soften the front suspenstion/stiffen the rear suspension to get the most realistic driving experience one should expect from the ST. I could be biased but the car is an autocross machine and handles perfectly well just as stock.\n- car interiors ARE A JOKE. I only play racing games in first person in-car view so as to fully immerse myself in the experience. i hate to compare this to Need for Speed, but if you look at Shift, the interiors, even for the low-end/old drifter cars, are immaculately rendered, and you can look around. in Grid, looking left or right blinks the screen left or right to an un-interior generic side view, giving me no frame of reference because my driver didn't turn his head. In addition, on graphical settings where the cockpit isn't blurred, the instrumentation is blocky and disgusting. at night, no dashboard or other interior lights are visible. Again, i drive a focus, and although the shape of the top of the dashboard is correct (even reflecting *almost* as i would expect when the sun hits it, i'm sorry but at night that console needs to be LIT. So yeah, Codemasters, MASSIVE missed opportunity with the car interior. i can't bring myself to look left or right because what i get is a generic blank view of what's on the left or right because my driver doesn't turn his head like NFS Shift so i have no frame of reference, and the worst part is it's just as well because what IS rendered of the interior of the car is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ POS anyway in both texture and polygon terms. Bad bad bad car interior.\n\nThat's it, every other part of the game is straight up FUN, with beautifully rendered and presented cars on beautiful tracks and HOLY ♥♥♥♥ I'M DRIVING IN PARIS THIS IS SO COOL and the driving is awesomely gratifying in just the right realistic correct way that one can get better at before they know it. Car interiors are disgustingly, DISGUSTINGLY disappointing though. Need for Speed: Shift, i'm looking at the exact interior of a Lamborghini Reventon from radio to seat stitching to AC vents. Grid, i'm looking at something a 6 year old made using Duplo bricks.\n\n[ ]\n\nPS: the yellow paint is on the stock ST is just the right hue, and it is indeed shiny but not as much as is presented in the game where it looks as glossy as a trombone. The real Tangerine Yellow ST is almost almost flat with a slight metallic shine to it. But don't worry, NFS: Most Wanted got it wrong too.

The driving in this game definately appeals more to hardcore "Sim" racer ( by bringing back cockpit view among other things ) and this game definately rewards you for that by giving you XP bonuses for driving a clean race without collisions.\n\nRight off the bat, the game looks graphically similar to GRID 2 but there are noticeable improvements in car textures ( Free DLC to update car livery textures to 4k res ), lighting and shadows.\n\nMultiplayer is quite fun with you having to work your way up from the bottom. Each car you own in Multiplayer has its own milage, so the higher the milage the more the car will cost to maintain. 12 players lined up on the ( AI can be used to fill in the blanks ) all racing to the finish line.

I was lucky to get the game off ♥♥♥ for 10 bucks but that does not fix glaring problems I encountered in the first 3 hours of playing this game.\nFirst off loading into the game, I setup my G27 and enter career mode. My steering wheel has zero force feedback going to it. Why would this be turned off in a racing game? Even after 30 minutes of tinkering I got a setup that was atleast driveable but sill felt disconnected After racing for a bit I only got further disappointed, handling is bleh, braking far too sharp and the worse part of this game, the AI. The AI is literally pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or overly aggressive, with any contact resulting in bouncing off of them or you spinning out. Interior view has everything from the dashboard back looking like a camera lense with vaseline on it. No idea if the high res texture pack fixes it but I refuse to download a 3GB "patch" for something that should have never been left like that in a title such as GRID.\n\nThe good, I really do like the option of having a second monitor display race information in a broadcasting layout. Would have loved it even more to pick what items to have up on the second monitor but I am not complaining there. I also like the benchmarking ability to better optimize your ingame graphical settings.

While i find it hard to reccomend at full price, i'd still do so.\n\nOkay, first things first, what have you guys done to the name of this game? While it's safe to say the GRID series isn't nearly as closely related to the toca race driver series as it used to be, simply naming the 3rd iteration GRID Autosport sounds off to me. Having to explain to people which GRID title i'm referring to is time i could've spent talking about your title instead.\n\nI have no idea what to say about the carreer mode at this point, so far, i'm under the impression Team Ravenwest is the hot stuff in town, and i'm not having any of it. I'm far too busy fighting it out with the track and the people right in front or behind me. Atleast they've let me play around with whatever discipline i felt like doing without forcing me to do something else for a change of pace just yet.\n\nThe handling and physics are pretty similar to GRID2, and while i miss RD:GRID's wacky instant handbrake drifts, i can sorta understand why they went with a slightly less agile approach. However, with every iteration of GRID, the CPU controlled cars seem more agressive and heavy. While i understand driving people off the track to gain the lead has always been a bit of a problem in racing games, CPU Opponents shoulden't be able to effortlessly get me into a wreck just because they don't agree with my driving line.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, there's a few graphical glitches when using AMD's CrossfireX, sometimes the grass flickers, but seeing how other games just completely fall flat in this regard i can look past it, since the performance scaling is all right. It doesn't change a whole lot, since even at 1440p, maxing out the settings leaves more than enough headroom to comfortable run this maxed out ( safe from some intel only settings, thanks). While the shaders and effects stepped up quite a bit from GRID2, the environments and roads seem left behind on most tracks, leaving you with an uninspired and uninteresting landscape at times. I have yet to see some of the tracks for other disciplines ( i have mostly seen the circuit-esque tracks at the point of writing), so take this with a grain of salt.","August 21, 2014","true","65.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Anyway, I had high hopes for Autosport when I heard Grid 2's failings had been addressed based on feedback from the community. Cockpit view in this version and more realistic handling. A cross between sim and arcade. However, even though I havent played this much yet, I was instantly disappointed. Cockpit view is a joke, it's really blurry and you can't see the car interior or the gauges. The first Grid is better! I'll probably end up playing Autosport with bonnet view like I did for Grid 2.

I wrote it out of pure disappointment and frustration, that I could not get the game working in full screen. Well, the game itself was working but my keyboard and controller didn't respond. In the end the solution was a silly mouseclick after the game had started! At the moment there are more people reporting full screen issues, that are bypassable. However, CM should really fix this.\nI played the game for a good five hours now and I can give my first impressions of it. First of all, the thums down has changed to a thumbs up. I'm really enjoying the game so far. Car handling is just what I expected; semi-realistic but not too hardcore. I'm not a professional so I can't judge how realistic they actually are or aren't. There are some 12 year olds out there that can go really in depth on how spot on the physics are or why they just suck :)  For me it's just a really nice simcade. Totally different then Grid 2, wich was a total driftfest, wich got a bit boring in the end. Graphics and sound are really good too. It's not a big improvement over Grid 2 but that game already looked fantastic imo. Graphics options are highly adjustable. The game can run smooth on both high end and not so high end hardware. The whole game focuses on a more realistic approach on motorsport, with more believable contracts, the ability to practice and qualify before the race (thanks you CM!) wich is optional by the way. There's also the option to multiply the race duration in the career mode, wich is really welcome and adds again more realism. Some races are over too soon, with just the standard 3 or 4 laps. The AI is also quite good. On higher difficulty levels they are really competitive. I'm someone who enjoys racing against good AI more then against random people, since AI cars don't try to ram you off the track as soon as the race starts but actually race you. That's why I didn't touch the MP yet. I'm only interested in clean racing against serious players. If you're looking for that too, feel free to add me :)  So these first impressions were all about single player. I did however some online Racenet challenges that are renewed weekly, just like in Grid 2. So all in all a really good game and a massive improvement over Grid 2. If you loved the first Grid but didn't like the second one due to it's arcady physics you should really enjoy this one.","June 27, 2014","true","73.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","4"

I'm playing on normal difficulty with manual gear shifting and I the difficilty is just right. It's really hard to win races but I can keep up with my sponsors demands. The game looks great but for a racing game I expected that.\n\nA small issue with it is that I'm not seeing the difference in AI between open wheel and the compact touring or street racing. I would expect a really aggrasive AI in the touring and street races but they are kinda passive. For the open wheel races I sometimes get bumped by someone for a legitemate takeover and thus losing the sponsors zero collision demand. It's really hard to get that.\n\nA much larger issue is the sound, I have put all sound on low but there is still a lot of crackling especially in the cut scenes. I just have a onboard soundcard but I'm only experiencing this with this game. It baffles me they could not do the sound right, it's kinda important for a racing game imho.\n\nI would give this a 8/10 but without the sound issues I would rank this 9/10 since I'm having a ton of fun with it.","November 27, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It wasn't realistic, but it was fun.\nSo how does GRID Autosport stack up? It has its similarities to GRID but it isn't as good.\n\nPROS\nThe game is fun and there is a large variety of different vehicle types to choose from. The handling is a bit slippery but it's really easy to handle even with all assists off. This allows you to go around corners at really high speeds which adds to the excitement at the expense of realism.\n\nCONS\nThe game is NOT complete. The interiors are nothing but blurry pictures. Even at night, you can't see any lights inside the vehicle. What's the point of a cockpit view if you can't even see your own speedometer? The game also lacks content. Sure there are a wide range of different types of vehicles (Indy, Coupes, Touring, etc) but considering how the interiors are non-existent couldn't they have stuffed a little more in there instead of releasing an early DLC? The track selection is adequet. There are lots of famous tracks and a lot of city tracks but the number of different tracks is still relatively low. Finally, the game itself can get quite boring. The campaign is like any other campaign. You win races and you climb up into better and faster cars. The problem is, for the first several hours, you're basically driving the same car on the same tracks. This gets tedious especially since some events require you to complete the same track twice.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWith games like Gran Turismo 6, Forza 5, F1 2013, and Shift 2 out, it's hard to recommend this game content-wise. The gameplay however is not lacking although it may feel dull at times. The conclusion? This game feels rushed and Codemasters should have spent more time on it.","August 28, 2014","false","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After I got tricked into buying this piece of S(@T I swore to myself I won't buy any more Codemaster titles. Their Aspect of realism is something geared towards the masses that lead them to believe that a front wheel driven car is as easy going in corners as a RWD car. RWD cars can never spin in a corner even  with no Traction Control UNLESS you change gears while applying the accelerator.\n\nEvery race is a frantic event to the finish without letting you see yourr mirros, thinking your next move on opponents and strategically move across the track. you''re like a race horse. Only able to see what's ahead unless you press the look left and right keys.\n\nThe Drifting..... utter crap..... what stupid idiot made these physics? when seeing the hype created I expected more of a challange, no realism whatsoever. Steering input feels laggy and no real feal of what's happening. CANNED FORCE FEEDBACK EVERYWHERE, you go onto parts of the track with ON and OFF steering feedback.\\n\nIt may have been good when compared to games to 10 years ago, but I give it so much bad review just because of the crowd it tries to reach. and the stupid thing is, there are players that actually think they can drive cos they are doing good in this game..... well I did no assists full AI and most of the time...  the only challange there was, was to try and feel the road from the bloody wood crate on wheels and learn the track. If you want a real realistic car game, go for rFactor 2 or iRacing. Hell, even rfactor1 with "real feel pluging" and some decent mods is more fun than this piece of crap.\n\nBottom line, stick with your arcade stuff and games that know what they wanna be, games that try to be something they aint on the other hand.... end up giving you grief to your wallet.","January 9, 2015","false","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/255220/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ In contrast to the previous entries in the series, GRID Autosport instead opts to go the more realistic route in terms of handling and gameplay. There is a definite increase in the learning curve when it comes to the handling; if you play the game similarly to how you played the first two games, you will notice that both understeering and oversteering will happen more often and you will need to use your brakes on tight corners much sooner than you’d expect. However, none of this is a negative point to the game. While it does end up making the gameplay more challenging, it only adds to the immersion that the game tries to create by taking a more faithful approach to real motorsports\n+ As expected, the graphics--while not a huge leap in graphical prowess compared to the jump from the first to the second game--doesn’t fail to impress (for the most part). The lighting especially is probably some of the best I’ve seen in a videogame period. Though there may be some disappointing downgrades in some areas (such as the crowds and damage indications are noticeably worse, or barely any different than GRID 2), overall, they’re still at the high standard that the series has set out to achieve from the beginning\n+ There is also a noticeable jump in difficulty compared to the previous games. I could relatively easily complete the earlier games on Hard difficulty, but in GRID Autosport on Medium difficulty, some races it can be a struggle to even get a podium finish (most notably on the Touring and Endurance disciplines). For me, I saw this as a positive, as I was challenged to perform to my best in order to succeed. [Note: The AI can sometimes play overly aggressive when overtaking and defending their position, which can lead to the occasional annoying circumstance of you crashing, but it wasn’t enough of a deterrent to stop me playing the game.]\n\n\nNegative\n- Spending around 28 ½ hours in order to complete the career mode (essentially complete the GRID Legends Series) was somewhat of a struggle I must admit. I didn’t mind the long length. But it was the simple fact that you will be essentially be repeating the same events over and over (but in progressively better vehicles), which is very tedious to say the least. Granted some events requiring you to do two races on the same track back-to-back is how it is portrayed in motor sporting, but to the average gamer, it will only come off as the developers being lazy and just padding out the game by making you do the same races again and again. Being forced to play events you may not enjoy very much (such as drifting) in order to complete the career also only makes the whole experience more tiring than it should be\n- Adding on to the previous point, the majority of the tracks this time are essentially cut from the previous games and added here again, to an even bigger extent than before, with very few new tracks being added at all. Some championships even make you do the same track again (but possibly in reverse, or the longer/shorter version of the track), which becomes extremely repetitive. A bigger variety in the amount of tracks available would have been such a good way to diminish the tedious nature the game ends up putting on display\n- The same problem that existed in the first game has resurfaced here in terms of teammates being useless. You can direct them to play aggressively or defensively, but it ultimately has zero impact on how they perform in a race. It seems like they only put in teams to make it emulate motor sporting in general better, but it really just seems pointless to do so when they rarely perform higher than even 8th position\n- Lastly, the dialogue again this time is probably the worst it has been in the series so far, with barely more than a few lines that just get repeated continuously, it’s as if they’re not trying anymore.\n\n\nWorth Mentioning\n• While Codemasters did listen to fans and decided to re-implement the in-car view to the series here, people have complained (and it is definitely noticeable) that the view itself is blurry and poorly done. As I’ve stated before I don’t play using this view, but if this is the sort of thing that you dislike, then take this into consideration before deciding to purchase the game.\n\n\nVerdict\n“Unfortunately, GRID Autosport doesn’t quite hit the mark like the previous entries in the GRID series did. The exceedingly repetitive events and lack of unique courses really hurts the game. I’m not sure if the 6 month development time had anything to do with the end result of the game, but no matter the reason, it’s sad to say that this is a lower quality game compared to the first two. Though fans of simulation racing games may get more enjoyment from this entry, I’m sure the fans of GRID in general will be disappointed.”\n\n7.5/10 TJBs","February 15, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acextreme/recommended/255220/","Acextreme","エース極端","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Acextreme/","460 products in account","I will have to make a disclaimer upfront that I love race simulators (as at time of review, I have clocked 188 hours in Assetto Corsa), so my review of this might be biased since I would prefer realism and physics as high enjoyment factors, which of course GRID Autosport would be a huge disappointment. Says the dev before the release of this game: "GRID Autosport would be more sim than arcade". I am sorry, sim my ♥♥♥. All the cars turn with rubber band effect; it turns and just when you thought you turned enough and starts to return the steering to neutral, the car has that tendency to swing back about 20-30% of the turning you attempted as if you are turning against a rubber band. Like seriously? No cars behave like this.\n\nLet me qualify myself. I race racing karts, played enough simulators and drove enough cars to know that cars don't behave like this. At this rate, even Initial D and Wangan Midnight would be a better game than GRID Autosport. Luckily for me, I bought this from the 2nd tier of Humble Bundle; was considering the 3rd tier that includes the season pass, all GRID 2 DLCs, and Dirt 3 Complete edition, but seeing how horrible the physics is (it is actually worse than and more unpredictable than Initial D or Wangan Midnight), I have decided against upgrading my Humble Bundle package. Now, if only Humble Bundle accepts refunds.\n\n(TL;DR) In conclusion, if you are someone like me who only enjoys realistic physics and played Assetto Corsa, then don't even touch this with a 20-foot long pole. You might consider this if you haven't touched Assetto Corsa (not sure about other sims because imho, AC seems to be the best out there and I have tried almost every other sims) before. On the other hand, if you like arcadey racing games that makes you feel like "fast and furious", you might want to consider this only when there is a steep discount. Otherwise, may I direct you to Initial D or Wangan Midnight games?\n\nEDIT: I should also mention that I turned off all assists in this game, so that should be as raw as how a real car should behave. Perhaps it might have been better with assists but assists should be unnecessary with decent driving skills. I also play with no assists in Assetto Corsa but cars in Assetto Corsa have more "grip" and predictability, just like how you would have expected if you actually race in real life, which of course this game is completely devoid of. Complete failure even as an arcade game, made worse with claims of "more sim than arcade"; bullcrap, this is below arcade racing game category with that rubber-band turning effect.","January 23","false","1.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The same tracks, the same cars, the same computer-generated engine sounds and the same bad texture work and graphics masked by a lot of FX.\nEverything is as unrealistic as ever - (1) the aligning of wheels has to go out of place in order for everything else to break, and it's always the front left side, no matter where you hit the car, (2) AI controlled drivers and their vehicles are basically unaffected by the laws of physics - they regain speed faster once they exit turns, cannot be spinned out, yet they can spin out you, as if their cars weigh a lot more than yours yet can retain a speed impossible for such an object, and generally move faster even at max speeds.\nThey've taken a lot of what made Grid 2 any good like ability to use the car of players choosing and replaced it with less relevant content like teammates and some sort of inferior career mode.\nAnd you, for some reason, have to drive cars with their steering wheels on the rights side (even BMWs).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torsimus/recommended/255220/","Torsimus","Wave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torsimus/","76 products in account","If you want a proper racing simulator buy Gran Turismo 2 for PS1 and enjoy and don't touch this crap even with a mile long stick.\n\nGran Turismo will have more vehicles, REAL endurance races (instead of drive around 4 minutes), a way better customization and tuning abilities (more later) probably more tracks, better soundtrack, better voice acting (i.e. silence which is better than a phone-sex-line-granny-trying-to-be-sexy "Welcome back John" every time you open the game), better driving mechanics (more later), pit stops etc. etc.\n\nOnce again Codemasters make it look like a nice game but after a while you'd give away your aunt if you could just remove it from existence.\n\nGameplay:\nMechanics are something inbetween Grid 1 and 2, meaning you won't be powersliding (i.e. slowing down) all the time but anyway you'll be doing that quite a bit. I can somehow deal with it when driving a street or touring cars but FFS I DID NOT START A FORMULA SEASON JUST TO DRIFT AROUND.\nThe open wheel cars have just the same amount of grip with a little bit lower centre of weight and more power so they'll slide just as much as your Ford Mustang or Nissan Silvia but they may be recovered from it a bit more easily. Fun for a while or for arcade racers but not a part of a "simulator".\nIf using a keyboard to drive you need to have traction control on and thus (I suspect it's due to it) all other drivers are faster than you in the start.\nIf you try to ram the opponents you end up eating mud yourself every time because they're like moving brick walls on rails. They don't give a SH** about you and your pushes if you are not in with a total kamikaze, also you have a great chance to end up spinning out every time you hit someone.\nThe penalty system for cutting corners is complete utter bullcrap. In a same circuit you could drive 100 meters on grass and it doesn't do anything but in the next corner when you hit the kerb a bit too hard and touch the grass you'll be slowed down for something like 7 FÜGing seconds. The AI doesn't get penaltied and happily push you out of the track if you're too close so enjoy!\n\nTuning:\nNo.\nDepending on how far have you played in the career you'll have zero to a little possibilities to fine tune your vehicle. The changes are the exact same as in Dirt 3 but in Grid you may only have two options for each, 0 or 100%, depending on your team. This pretty much renders the tuning useless because unless you're looking for more sliding you aren't doing a thing with a possibility to set 100% of your braking power to rear or front tires.\nI also noticed that either something is terribly wrong with the open wheel cars or the game has differential lock tuning inverted, locked diff should make you slide even more but in the game open diff causes it.\nIf you can still remember the fine tuning in GT2, I can tell you it was real high-tech. Don't even dream about something like that.\n\nVehicles:\nAll same group (or class) vehicles are basically the same to make them even. When you have two team offers the XP is the only thing you need to check, your team mate will always suck and the car is just a moving image with exactly the same abilities as the other one.\nThere are something like 5 different cars in each class (except the formulas which have 1 or something) so basically you have a few to choose from but it's nothing like the hundred cars in Gran Turismos.\n\nGamemodes:\nAlong the basic races there are some other modes such as time attack (or something) where you have X laps to score the fastest laptime (so it's basically a qualifying but called race) endurance and drifting.\n\nDrifting was surprisingly pleasant and pretty cool but the same mechanics (meaning same controls but -100% grip) were seen in Need For Speed something like 10 years ago. It's also ridiculously easy, within a lap you can score 1,5 million points and AI scores 500-800k.\n\nEndurance races are about driving the circuit for X minutes and your tires will wear out. In addition to the "normal sliding" which is rather heavy you cannot brake or turn softly with a keyboard so you'll eat up your tires pretty quickly but it's fun enough. No pitstops though, would have been cool.\n\nMultiplayer is... well, online multiplayer. The lobby is plagued with an automatic voice chat which you have to switch off every time if you don't want to use it.\nCodemasters have a ghost car mechanic which makes everyone ghost cars when in a corner to avoid collisions and pushing but it's not working very well as it makes you visible when you're not braking heavily and thus you're again open for hits which means there will be hits just like there wasn't any ghost thing at all.\n\nOverall:\nI have really mixed feelings about this. I enjoy arcade racing but this isn't it. I also enjoy simulators but this isn't it either. It's not completely bad and I've had fun moments but it's not anywhere near the addictiveness and fun I had with Gran Turismo 2 when I was a kid. It isn't a best comparison but it's the last good racing simulator I've played.\n\n4/10\nIf you enjoy semi realistic racing and can swallow the crap they'll send you with it, you'll like this.\nIf you're in for a good simulator or action full arcade racing, you won't find either in this one.","October 1, 2014","false","23.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fusspot/recommended/255220/","fusspot","{CoS} Fusspot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fusspot/","486 products in account","GRID Autosport feels like what GRID 2 was supposed to be. It's sort of a split between 1 and 2.\nFor starters, you're back to the fairly open method of choosing races that was in GRID 1. You get a little board of different types of disciplines (Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, Street) and you can choose any of them right off the bat to dig into. They each come with different events you can sign up for, and each race has a few different sponsors you can race for, for differing amounts of XP based on how well you follow their requests. Generally, what you see is what you get in regards to what types of races you do. Touring is usually just touring car races, fast paced pack racing with you and 15 other racers. Endurance is powerful supercars that you race for 8 minutes or so. You have to watch your tire wear in this discipline, so lighter braking and safer turning. I haven't had any issue with my tires exploding on me yet (I play on the Medium difficulty) but they do tend to get close. Open Wheel is small cars that are, as you'd expect, open wheeled. So far it's been mostly Formula 3, but I haven't progressed too far in that discipline to say for sure if it'll become more. This discipline is also incredibly fun, which is a nice change from the stressful races that Open Wheel brought along in GRID 1. Tuner is light weight and small race cars and American muscle cars, which seem to be usually time attack (post the best time) races. Street is more along the lines of what you got in GRID 2 in the early tiers. There's a lot of hatchbacks and muscle cars in pack races. In addition to the above, there's a "GRID Championship" that unlocks after you get level 3, 6 and 9 in each of the disciplines. The GRID Championship is just all the other disciplines crammed in one event series, and gives you more experience to level the disciplines. There are also small "cup" events in some of the disciplines that'll pop up and break up the rest of your racing. They're small events of a few races, and the best is definitely Drift.\nThe AI is fairly typical of a racing game. They'll still follow their line regardless of how much you're in the way. It becomes especially upsetting when they hit you, and you go spinning off the road, while their car seems to be made of dark matter. Thankfully, they don't seem to be broken when they work for Ravenwest anymore. Gone are the days of watching those black and grey cars that you know you outpower speed off and leave you in the dust.\nSpeaking of, you don't seem to be able to have your own team anymore. You work exclusively for the highest bidder, and your codriver is whoever the team wants to stick with you. Most of the time, they're useless. You do have the ability to tell your codriver what to do, to an extent. You can tell them to defend/hold/drive normally/push/attack. Attack seems to be the only way to see them gain any positions, though, and I so rarely have them in a good place that I ask them to hold or defend, though the few times I have they lost their good position and I had to tell them to attack anyway.\nThe handling feels a whole lot better than it did in 2. The cars have some weight to them, and the tires don't want to squeel across the road with every turn (with basic assists left on). Not being able to drift around every turn and win by massive amounts of time anymore took some getting used to, but it's wonderful. I plan on turning off all the rest of the driver assists soon to see how it feels without them.\nThe feeling of speed seems a bit inconsistent, at least to me. Cars in Tuner and Muscle classes feel like they move really slow, despite the HUD telling me I'm going at 100mph. Then I jump in a Touring car and feel like I'm blasting along, but only doing 80. It might just be the way they handle, but it feels fairly odd.\nIt looks good, for the most part. The tracks and the cars are well rendered. The cars have a good shine to them, the liveries look good. The damage model on them is pretty weak, though it is a step above a lot of other racers. Cars still split apart by the seams like in GRID 2, so you'll get that weird piece of body flapping like a bit of loose skin. If you tap a car in front of you going into a turn, you will get scrapes all up and down the hood, regardless of how hard you hit. Does the same on the sides of your car, and presumably on your rear. It's not really a big issue, and I understand why it was done, but it bothers me a little. The backgrounds are, as is typical of racing games, weak. Low res, 2D trees that sparcely populate ugly, jagged hills. People in the stands are straight out of an RPG on the PS2. Perhaps the biggest issue as far as visuals, is the car interiors. Maybe I looked at it wrong, but it seemed like the reintroduction of cockpit view was a big deal for this game, and they are absolutely ugly. You don't get any movement on anything but the wheel, which becomes especially noticable when you're driving stuff like the open wheel vehicles and see the speedo screen make no effort to do anything. And considering this was stuff that was in DiRT 3, it's fairly shocking.\n\nI like the game. It's got a good simcade feel that leans a bit more on the sim than the arcade, it looks good, and it plays fun. But it still feels like a step back from GRID 1. It's a step forward from 2, for sure, but there's still that gap.","July 1, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It was like driving on butter all the way. The multi was so terrible that I'm still wondering "Why did they put a derby mode later on, because there's already that everywhere...?".\n\nThis year, it's the turn to Grid Autosport. I was really confused ; Already ? One year only ?\nBut they said they have listened to us, and it will be THE game that we want.\n\nWell, the handling is great ; Not quite as good as Grid, it's more like between Grid 1 & 2. But yeah, that's more pleasing to drive.\nLot of routes and destinations, this is quite enjoyable, even if all the tracks from Grid 2 are there and for several races I can see downgraded graphics there and there. But ok, it's not a next gen (current gen now) game, so I guess it's not a problem.\nModeling of interior cam is back ! AND blury as hell. Like if you're driving completly wasted, you'll probably see the car like that.... A HUGE disappoitment on that, Grid 1 had those, and that was really cool !\n\nMulti is hell on earth, again... Between cheaters, stock cars and players who deliberatly run into you... because they're driving the wrong way to annoy you.... Well, this is really awfull.\nPlease Codies, fix that ; I shouldn't be bothered by cheaters when I'm playing a game in multi on Steam....\n\nAnd finaly, my biggest disappoitment : Career solo.\nMulti is terrible, ok, so let's take my career and drive for me : Well, nuh hu.\nThe career is, in big sum up : You are a driver, sponsors will hire you to drive a certain amount of races, which rewards you with XP.\nThat's it.\n\nCome on Codies, where is the real career mode ? I want to have my garage, pay for my cars, CHOOSE MY CAR FOR A CERTAIN RACE ; Here, we have 2 choices from 2 sponsors. And you're stuck with 1 to 4 cars, and the choice is not really yours.\nThe partner is a real joke, the comments are not really usefull, and despite all the energy put on this, it's really an annoying career mode. You drive for one sponsor, you're done, next.\nThere's no challenge whith points or money earned, no big final like "Le mans" in Grid, no car customisation in solo, nothing.\n\nSo my review is simple :\nIf you want multi and you're willing to taste hell on the roads : this game is for you.\nIf you want a solid solo career, I'd pass...\nIf you want some fun, i'd wait for a discounted price.\n\nLet's prey the 4 will be THE ONE (even if it'll surely not be....)","July 7, 2014","false","19.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Great voice chat and mostly grown up drivers. There is a system that punishes players for the amount of impacts they have been in or caused which is proving to help players race more clean.\n\nAs for the sim elements of the game, the cars do all have a unique weight and balance feel to them and behave differently under varying circumstances. You have to use your brakes to be competitive in this game and to set the fastest pace. Accelerating at the wrong times or under heavy cornering will produce understeer or oversteer depending on traction, this will throw you off of the racing line or apex which causes you to have to overcorrect the next corner thus, slowing you down and pushing the car to it's physical limitations to stay on the track.\n\nUnderrated game in my opinion, it's a shame it's reputation was tarnished from Grid 2 and people aren't giving it a go, or it could have been one of the biggest racers to hit consoles and PC. I hope it eventually gets the credit it deserves.

I'd played some pretty arcady racers on various sources including PC but honestly wanted that legit racing feel without the tediousness of some of the more intense sim racers.\n\nOne thing to point out, if you're used to arcade racing games, get ready to spin out over and over. However, you should have faith. I'm playing on a 360 controller for Windows on 8.1 and setting the difficulty to the base "Easy" setting is giant help. It gives you the full racing line by default which shows you not only the best line on the track but also, via color changing as indication, shows you relatively how fast you need to be going for certain portions of the track. This really comes in handy when getting used to the braking in turns. This game is not a game you can simply swing your back end around the corners in. Once you begin to get the hang of it though, the whole thing becomes satisfying and rewarding. I like the way the different racing specialties are set up in the career mode. It allows you to choose from all but the GRID Autosport Series which is apparently reserved for when you've mastered all the others.\n\nAs of right now, I've played through a season in both the Touring and Street series'. The Street series seems like a great place to start because the speeds don't get too much above 100mph and the cars handle well. I have yet to play any multiplayer so I will refrain from commenting on it until I get the chance to join in.\n\nVERDICT: Great game so far.","June 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played Race driver Grid for about 200 hours when it first came out, I loved every moment of it! I found that Grid 2, while I still really liked the game it still fell short of my expectations.\n\nWell, Grid Autosport is everything I could have expected and more from a racing game! The cars feel realistic, the sound is amazing and the graphics are stunning! As for the gameplay; I would not go as far as to say this game is a racing simulator but I am not sure that is the point of Grid. Grid 2 had a very arcady feel to it; sliding around corners, bashing into people, etc; Autosport however will punish you severely for doing those kinds of things, the damage system is relentless and if you do not take the racing line or brake properly you will lose valuable seconds off your laptime through spin outs or driving off the track!\n\nThe multiplayer is really entertaining; in fact I prefer it to the single player mode. You have access to every car from the get go, however they are "Loan" cars, so you cannot upgrade them and they typically do not perform quite as well as Brand new cars (due to their condition rating). This adds a realistic feel to the game and also inspires you to buy your own cars and tune them properly!\nTuning is another important feature of this game, once you have purchased your first car and begin to race with it you will begin to unlock upgrades and tuning options to make the car perform exactly how you want it to! I found this really helps me set my cars up based on my driving style.\nEarning money can be tough in Grid Autosport multiplayer, however that is the point! If you crash your car or the loan car you will need to pay for repairs, this encourages you to drive sensibly, take the racing line and brake properly ( No more e-brake!) the cleaner you race, the more money you get and the closer you will get to owning your own beautiful motor car!\n\nIf you liked Race driver Grid then you will love Autosport!\n\nPros\n-Beautiful Graphics\n-Fun and Realistic gameplay\n-Amazing sound\n-Endless car tuning possibilities\n\nCons\n- Voice chat and some connection issues online\n- Long loading times\n\nOverall 4.5/5","June 30, 2014","true","97.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There's an annoying little glitch that causes the game to freeze at some point in every race. The sound and controls still work while it's frozen, but the screen doesn't change at all. I'll certainly change my review if this issue is fixed soon, but so far, I feel as if I've gone and wasted my money. Please don't let me down Codemasters.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nEDIT:\n\nAfter playing with the graphics settings for a bit, I've found that the cause of this problem was the smoke shadow option. Disabling this has seemingly solved the issue and I can now play the game fine.\n\nFrom what I can now tell, Grid Autosport feels like that excels at little more than being fun. It doesn't feel like a racing simulator, and it's missing many of the things that could help redeem it in that aspect such as full racing wheel support and a detailed car interior. However, the developers have clearly been hard at work, and I feel that this game has a lot of potential to expand. The physics are great, the graphics are decent and the game doesn't hammer your computer much if you're on the lower end of the hardware scale. As earlier stated, Grid Autosport is fun and is definitely worth picking up if you can spare the money.","June 26, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People who genuinely love motorsports.  People who have actually DONE motorsports before.  People who know what racing really is like in real life.\n\nThis review is written having only played the game with a G27 racing wheel and only manual sear shifting with all HUD's disabled for the most racing like experience.\n\nI've done my fair share of track days and i can tell you, think is the most realistic car racing game i have played.  There's plenty of people complaining the game feels too slow, the cars don't grip in corners blah blah.  Well guess what, those people have never driven on a track in their life.  When on a racing track, unless you're in a ultra fast ferarri or koensigg or something, guess what, you feel SLOW.  That's how it is.  Your car is slow.  People are so used to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car sims that put so much emphasis on feeling like you're flying along or arcade racing games that let you go around corners at 400kph that they have no idea what it's actually like to race a car.\n\nSo more on the good parts.\nThe handling of the cars:\n\nFantastic.  Cars handle how they should. FWD understeers coming too hot into a corner, or if you put power down coming into a corner and you can even get the ♥♥♥ out with lift off oversteer when driving really agressive.  All of that is true in a FWD cars handling characteristics and they are all spot on in the game.  RWD cars oversteer if you power on too much mid corner, or over a crest.  You can really feel the suspension working.  Coming super hot down a hill into a banked corner?  Your suspension will start to wallow like a real car trying to deal with sideways g-forces, and if not careful in a RWD car, will cause oversteer.\n\nGraphics:\nAMAZING.  Holy ♥♥♥♥.  The attention to detail is amazing.  From the different exhaust outputs of the cars (some will be obviously running rich, some not, etc) to the in car view of the dash being out of focus (because you're looking at the track, not the car) but obviously having some type of MOTEC carbon fiber HUD in place of the standard cars one, to the general cars decals and body panels.  The world around looks so gorgeous, beautiful lighting, amazing scenery, and really perfect track textures.\n\nRacing modes:\nThe only thing the game is missing in terms of racing modes is drag racing and rally.  Which is not a downside to me.  Drag is always a short lived interest in racing games and rally is much a massive part of racing it really does require its own game.\nOne massive thing to note is the different racing game modes all have different racing styles.  Touring cars are mega aggressive, open wheelers really require you to be careful with damage on and time attack is like how time attack is with sporadic cars you have to deal with.\n\nSounds:\nI love the fact you can hear the tyres gripping, the straight cut gears int he gear box and the pop from fuel injectors still being on when your changing gears, because screw fuel efficiency.\n\nIts the little things:\nTo me what really makes this game great is the little things.  Like picking a perfect line through a series of corners then coming out and realising you just shaved a second or 2 off your lap time.  The spectators not being 2d, the clouds and lighting are so gorgeous and the cars look amazing. Even the simple and elegant UI still keeping perfect functionality.  The fact you log in, and the game says with voice "Welcome back (name here), there's some new events in the touring car championship, go check them out!".  You can really tell Codemasters have really put their heart and soul into this game.\n\nSummary:\nIf you're a grown adult that loves racing, and has done it before, this is the game for you.  If your some pimply teenager that thinks GTA and Need for Speed are racing simulators, this isn't for you.","June 28, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I would and would not recommend this game.\n\nFor some reason my hours have not been updated on the time I played this game, and I have played over 10hours of this game so far, so I am confused by eh ho!\n\nLets start simple and then get some detail.\n\nGraphics are nice and clean polished out.\nAudio is car noises, really it is nothing special or amazing it's a car game...\nControls are the same as other racers, keyboard and mouse or controller and I chose the controller as it handled better and easier to play.\n\nNow the game.\n\nIf you like to drive on the inside view like me, then you now can in Grid BUT and it's a big BUT.  There is no detail, literally a blank crappy steering wheel with a literally shape style dash board, there is NO speedo or gauges (How ever it is spelt) or anything just a black shaped canvass to mimic the dashboard.  FAIL!\n\nCar control: The cars feel weird like driving into a control at 100Mph and it looks like 30Mph but the engine is screaming.... you turn in at 60 and it slide a little bit but responds soooo quickly unlike any other game.  Literally brake? No! All you do is role around corners literally role because you do not need a break.  I been winning races with no HUD at all and I mean nothing on, never touching the break and roling around the corners which is annoying.\nLiterally the cars handle like ice, sliding around things quickly.\n\nThere is a nice feature which is the second monitor feature which allows you to see a scoreboard and different viewing angles when driving, but when I turned this on the game played terrible and was super laggy, but I am unsure if this is because I have the main monitor at ultra 144Hz so I do not know.  Just still unplayable with that on and a nice feature at the end of the day.\n\nIf you like racing games then maybe this might suite you.  I love and enjoy racing games but I found playing this the same as others and offering nothing new.  Literally nothing new, and it feels like I've played this before (Grid 2) and I am bored of playing it after 2hours but thought to soldier on and play more and more.\n\nThe mutliplayer is where the fun is if you get a lobby where people race correctly and do not ram the hell out of you.  Ghost mode ACTIVATED! Drive through me now!\nReally the game has tons and tons of these and no one really drives like a correct race is supposed to and that bores me, specially having to create a ghost lobby to stop the rammers makes it unrealistic but then seeing the car control it makes it okay.\n\nIt literally feels like a DLC from Grid 2.  Really it's nothing special or new and that bores me and lets the game down!\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes and no but sadly I cannot choose these two options.  If you like a 5minute drive around a track then avoid this, but if you are a die hard racer who loves ALL racing games then play this.  I like it do not get me wrong but playing this expecting something new is the wrong way to see it and for that I cannot play anymore but I will really try.","June 25, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unintuitive menu and lobby systems.\n\nYou can buy your own cars, but each time you buy one, you have to level it up which is tedious and time consuming, and even then, there is NO guarantee you will ever actually get to race it.  Because there are so many different categories of car, WITHIN say the street class.  So you go to a street class race, but you still cannot use YOUR street class car because it's not in the correct sub category which you CANNOT choose, you just get what you're given.  It's a dreadfully designed system.\n\nThe track minimap doesn't show you anywhere near enough of the track, it is too zoomed in and cannot be changed.  Also the edges are faded which makes it even worse.  You get like half a second advance warning of where the next corner is.  It is almost useless.  By the time you can see the corner on the minimap you can see it in front of you on the road anyway.  Why not copy how other games do it, like Gran Turismo or Forza? Or NFS Shift, where the minimap automatically zooms outwards as you go faster?\n\nOverall a very lacklustre and unrewarding game.","March 11","false","30.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a rubbish simulator game, plane and simple.\n\nThe fact that I cannot play this game with my brand new Logitech G29 warrants this.  I should have known, since GRID 2 doesn't like this controller either, yet I bought this game anyway.  DUH, fancy thinking that the devs would support Direct Input.\n\nThe view is always looking backwards, the accellerator makes the menu seclection go nuts the INSTANT you enable the "Direct input device" as a controller.  Until I can work out how to play this Piece of JUNK, it will not get a word of praise from me.  Going back to Project Cars and iRacing, they work fine.\n\nEdit:  After googling around some forums, apparently you need to leave it to KEYBOARD mappings, and then edit each binding to be on your G29.  Pretty $h!t.  Then, drop the deadzones to zero, and the steering range to 25.  That makes it about a 180 degree lock to lock.  Now that I can play the game with my wheel, my opinon of the "simulator" does not change.  The cars drift almost every corner, and I have yet to totally lose control.  That's a new thing in simulators!\n\nThis is my LAST codemasters purchase.  No more, you have had your chance to fix the controls guys, this is garbage.  Give your money to Project Cars, or iRacing.  They work a lot better.","December 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It brings Grid, at least for me, back to the very first game. Which if you didn't know was the best of the three, as well as being my suggestion as a starting point for a new comer. The car physics, accidents, are some of the best i have ever seen in a racing video game. Also, the selection of cars is not that great, however; they are all very different from one another and all cars have something special about them while always being great looking.\n\nThis game doesn't leave without its bugs though, and there is one masive bug that doesn't sound like its going to be fixed soon. THIS GAME CAN NOT BE PLAYED FULL SCREEN. Yep you read that correctly, this game, for some odd reason, does not want to be played in full screen mode. I have no idea why. The so called "fixes" didn't work for me. I have learned to play windowed mode and since have been having a fair amount of fun in it.\n\nSadly Steam does not let me put a review that goes in between bad and good, so becuase of the no full screen option that sounds like it would be an easy fix for Codemasters, much like Dirt 3 runs perfectly on the same rig of mine, then i can not in my right mind give this game a thumbs up leaving me with this sour taste in my mouth only a few hours after purchasing it.","November 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","6"

It sells itself as a fairly serious racer, but 30 seconds is enough to demonstrate the absolutely terrible floating physics - quite what they are attempting to simulate I don't know - if it's hovercraft then they've got it spot on.\n\nI had the XBox version and played it for a few hours, and actually managed to get a small amount of enjoyment out of it until about race 3 or 4 when the moronic AI finally become too much. Restarting a race 20 or 30 time just to try and avoid getting punted off by the oblivious AI as they batter their way around the track finally became too much and instead of smashing my Xbox pad I took out my rage on the disc and snapped it in half. That was a few months ago and even seeing the box on the shelf still makes me angry.\n\nAnyway, after some time away from it I thought perhaps I'd give the PC version a go for 2 reasons - 1. I can use a proper wheel and 2. I can get a refund when it inevitably turns out to be terrible. First impressions were not good as it refused to recognize a Driving Force Pro wheel pedals in the default combined layout, and I had to quit and reload 3 times to try and figure out what was up. Setting them to seperate finally got it going.\n\nRather unsuprisingly 14 minutes from first loading the game I requested a refund. 2 laps of the first career mode race were enough to know that the physics are unbearably terrible - the car seems to rotate around a central pivot, which means from bonnet or nose cam the whole world seems to revolve around a point behind you, leading to a really weird feeling of having to steer too early and then let the slidey car sort of catch up. I thought they'd got over all this central-pivot rubbish that seemed to become apparent in the games after Colin McRae Rally 2.0, but apparently not, their physics system is just as hopeless as ever.  Also, for some reason it kept switching from bumper cam back to bonnet cam during gameplay, a bug that I also found happened on the XBox, and of course it always happens right at the worst moments. I assume even QA couldn't bear to play it for more than 2 minutes in one go to spot this obvious howler.\n\nI bought DIRT Rally a while back too after reading about just how good a sim it is, and again it soon became clear that while sliding around on dirt hides their terrible physics system to certain degree, once you get on tarmac it's just as bad as it is in this game.\n\nI skipped F1 2015 as I was frankly sick of buying the exact same game every year, and I think this is the last straw - any future Codemasters game will not be purchased as every single time I am disappointed.\n\nDespite the positive reviews in certain places, this game is completely destroyed by almost all of its competition and IMHO is not deserving of a 5/10 , let along a 9/10 as it appears to have been awarded by some reviewers.","October 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a rubbish simulator game, plane and simple.\n\nThe fact that I cannot play this game with my brand new Logitech G29 warrants this.  I should have known, since GRID 2 doesn't like this controller either, yet I bought this game anyway.  DUH, fancy thinking that the devs would support Direct Input.\n\nThe view is always looking backwards, the accellerator makes the menu seclection go nuts the INSTANT you enable the "Direct input device" as a controller.  Until I can work out how to play this Piece of JUNK, it will not get a word of praise from me.  Going back to Project Cars and iRacing, they work fine.\n\nEdit:  After googling around some forums, apparently you need to leave it to KEYBOARD mappings, and then edit each binding to be on your G29.  Pretty $h!t.  Then, drop the deadzones to zero, and the steering range to 25.  That makes it about a 180 degree lock to lock.  Now that I can play the game with my wheel, my opinon of the "simulator" does not change.  The cars drift almost every corner, and I have yet to totally lose control.  That's a new thing in simulators!\n\nThis is my LAST codemasters purchase.  No more, you have had your chance to fix the controls guys, this is garbage.  Give your money to Project Cars, or iRacing.  They work a lot better.","December 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Using an adapter with my old Dualshock 2 controller, when i set to the Direct Input Device preset, the buttons doesn't work for the menu, and i do not know what the keyboard shortcut is. When i switch back to a keyboard preset and map the keys to my controller, everything is fine until i quit and start the game, then i have to remap everything again.\n\n- Understeers like a cow, oversteers like a dog on ice. You make settings which you think should counter those problems - but no, the game thinks otherwise and you end up making the car worse.\n\n- Another AI problem ♥♥♥ physics. You car weighs as a car should. The other cars weighs like a ♥♥♥♥ing 100ton tank each. You push them hard and they refuse to budge, them tapping you slightly and you go sliding off the road, which brings me to my next point...\n\n- Penalties. So, it has become my fault that the ♥♥♥♥ed up AI pushes me out despite me having the line, and i get a ♥♥♥♥ing penalty for that?\n\n- AI related issue again. No matter how hard you try, the AI will always out-accelerate you at a stop-start.\n\n- Physics ♥♥♥ AI. Me, car. Them car. I ram them I damage, they ram me, I damage. Them ♥♥♥♥ing driving a tank?\n\nFortunately, i bought this while it was on a discount.\n\nBut damn Codemasters, what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Race Driver: GRID was a damn nice game.

Well in this version Grid Autosport that is all changed. The cars now feel like they  have some weight and you need to enter corners in a somewhat controlled manner no longer are you just required to brake and drift magically around a corner. It does require some finess. I have set it to easy and this feels about right for me. No more story line this is all about xp and racing.\n\nYou do have a slightly dumb team driver and he is terrible and often gets in 13 to 16 place. He was at the second spot and went all the way back to 13 once the race was over. You can give him orders to be more agressive but it seems to make little difference. The track and cars look super detailed. Not sure how accurate they are because I have never driven on them in real life. The difficulties range from super easy to easy. I will be honest I found easy to be normal I cannot imagine what normal or medium would be like.\n\nOne other reviewer pointed out the fact that the AI gets a boost and that seems to be true. I still feel even with this negative the game is still good. Also be aware the AI gets a little aggressive and can sometimes spin you off the track and that is annoying. Lucky the game has a flashback system in place.\n\nSo the negatives besides the ones I mentioned. The camera shake started making me ill and I had to tone it way down. Other then that it seems to be a very good driving game.\n\nJust a few more details. The endurance races are in my opinion the least fun to drive in. Its just a pain. Its at night and the tires wear down and there is no way to change said tires. Its annoying. Drifting is a pain however you can tune your car to make it able to drift around the track. So thats a plus. Gear dif. set to long and make it grip the corners and it makes it a lot easier to drift.","June 20, 2015","true","38.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It does not feel like reality, but it isn't one of those over the top arcade racers either. Overall, the racing is fun and satisfying. The AI is tough, sometimes even a bit over the top, especially in the touring car races. However, I'd much rather have overall tough competition and feel like I've fought and raced hard for every point, than go through a grid full of cars going on rails, not bold enough to challenge the human player. The only problem I have with the AI is that your team mate seems to be pretty much rubbish every single race, which leaves you fighting for the team championship alone. I've only done the first few seasons, so perhaps this will change later on. Nevertheless, I would very much like my team mate to be the biggest challenge in any race, which is not the case at least at the moment.\n\nThe graphics are nice enough, I doubt anyone has much complaints about them. The cockpit view, as stated a gazillion times everywhere, is not as good as it should be, but it's there nevertheless. I don't mind the blur or the bad textures inside the car, however I do find it annoying that looking around will flip the view straight to sideview, instead of smoothly "turning your head". You can remove the blur by the way, with some tweaks to the game files (google). The textures won't get any better though, neither will the displays start functioning. Like I said, to me it's just not important. I do understand that some people feel otherwise. For me, it does the job.\n\nThe handling is probably not quite perfect, but as soon as you get used to it, it is actually very much fun and satisfactory. I would like it to be slightly less airy, but I've already got used to it and have no complaints. In the worst case, it's going to make you feel a bit strange for the first few races, while getting to grips with it. It's not sim, but it clearly has some elements of more sim-like handling. I've played all assists off, with a gamepad, and it's good fun and extremely challenging at times. I can clearly feel that a steering wheel and pedals would much better suit this game. Even with the gamepad though, I really enjoy the challenge the handling gives me, trying not to break traction, not to lose the rear end while cornering, not over-correcting, etc. The sense of speed is brilliant. At some of the street circuits, or the fast road circuits, you really feel the rush, trying to stay on the throttle as long as you can, braking late, feeling like you're surely going way too fast! Just so you know, I'm playing with very hard AI, no assist, and manual gears, with a ps3 gamepad.\n\nThere are a lot of smaller things I like about the game, things like being able to change the duration of a race, being able to command your team mate and so forth. The team mate commanding could be better, but it's a nice addition. As an example, I was in a race fighting my way through the pack since the starting order had been reversed, while my usually very slow team mate was at the front, thanks to the high starting position. I found myself third when the final lap started, with my team mate in front of me at second. I'd told him to be aggressive, and thought to myself that perhaps I should tell him to slow down a bit, seeing that he was a bit all over the place going for the first position, and we needed the points to complete the team objectives. I then thought "nah, let's go for the 1-2", and a few corners later he spun trying to overtake and dropped to the back of the pack. So the team orders definitely added something there, as I felt like an idiot afterwards :D Not a huge thing, but nice small detail.\n\nMultiplayer seems to be great. I was doubtful about the "gaining xp" and "buying cars" business, but I have to admit that it adds more depth to the game mode. There are loads of options, from cups, single races, and time attacks (with everyone on track at once), to something called destruction derby, which I have not yet tried as I have little interest in that sort of racing, but it shows some variety nevertheless. Being able to have your own club with friends or others is a great addition, from creating liveries to trying to finish well to gain reputation. There are quite a few maldonados out there, so sometimes patience is tested.... very much. I guess you could find a group or a league, but most my experiences have been fine, and the racing is surprisingly good, especially as the damage tends to take the crash heads out quite soon after the start. Damage is nice by the way. Nothing spectacular, but done very well still.\n\nSo, like said in the beginning of this review, the game is good. To me it felt like a good deal as well, as it was £29 on release, as opposed to the usual £39-£59 most new games seem to be. I'm sure people who bought Grid2 might feel differently, given that the game is less than a year old, but myself not being one of those people, it felt like great value. It's a solid racing game, and I'm going to spend a lot of time with it I'm sure.

Yes they have cockpit. Not fancy but they have it. Cars feel better. You have to actually drive like a kinda civil person. Drifting in all cars will not get you ahead of ppl in turns. Like alos how u can make your teammate play passive or agrresive. It's very nice to see some control in teammate play style. Also vechicle damage is way more apparent in this game.  If you hit something to hard you will know it all race long. Still not Grid 1.....

In a pure race, you have only your wits--and, well, the mechanical works of art representing the pinnacle of human locomotion help too.  (This is why Mario Kart, with its muddied waters, is just a "driving" game--not "Real Racing.")  This is the thread that runs though my enjoyment of the handful of racing games I've played over the years:\n\nF-Zero (SNES)\nMotoGP 2 (Xbox)\nRallisport Challenge (Xbox)\nF-Zero GX (Shamecube)\nRallisport Challenge 2 (Xbox)\nDirt 3 (PC)\n\nBefore playing GRID Autosport (GRID), rallying was my favorite real-world racing theme for a video game.  I guess in some ways it still is; there's nothing quite like barreling through the wilderness, scraping by on barely-managed chaos.  In a hillclimb event (known as "Trailblazer" in Dirt 3), a spoonful of dirt or snow can mean the difference between a record time and a wrecked car.\n\nBut as exciting as rallying can be, point-to-point racing can get pretty lonely.  Dirt 3 included events like Rallycross to tide me over, but at some point I missed the nudging and dancing that goes on in a closed-circuit race.  Enter GRID.  Dividing its content into five different driving disciplines (Touring, Endurance, Open-Wheel, Tuner, and Street), it plays like a lovingly-crafted tribute to motorsports of all kinds--even ones I didn't know I could appreciate.\n\nThe Touring and Street events really hit the spot for bumper-to-bumper racing, but in order to unlock special GRID events, you need to reach a minimum level in every discipline.  I've also dabbled in Online a bit; finding a race is difficult if you don't have a group of friends to race with, but the weekly Racenet Challenges can be played alone.\n\nThe game subtracts vehicle repair costs from your winnings, which encourages clean driving.  When I first started out, I was sidling up against the AI drivers at every corner in attempts to wrestle away a position or two (pretty much how I've always played racing games aside from MotoGP 2)--it still happens, but now I'm more conscientiously braking to avoid collisions and earn places with grace rather than grit.\n\nCodemasters' love for the chase really shines through in GRID; and if the other events can manage to get their hooks in me the way Touring and Street racing have, this may be the last racing game I play for a few years.","July 11, 2014","true","49.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They will hold their driving line, even if it means smashing into your rear quarter panel, sending you off the track. Sorry, but if I have the inside line and carrying the speed into the corner (all whilst controlled), the AI should not be trying to send me into the wall because they want to keep their line.\n\nThe cockpit view is horrendous and obviously only put in after the outcry from Grid 2's omition. The fact is, they could have and should have put a few more hours into it. It's a blurry mess.\n\nThe Career mode is a simple set of menus and it feels like the available vehicles and tracks are limited, in comparison to previous installments. This isn't the case, however it gives that impression due to the menu's being so 'cut-off' from the player in comparison to Grid and even Grid2.\n\nThere is no sense of continuation in your career either, apart from five vertical bars that increase with arbitrary numbers after each race. You don't have your own team, you don't manage your team-mate. You are simply a gun for hire for random teams. You don't even get to choose your livery, colour scheme, or even your vehicle number.\n\nIn all honesty, everything in this game has been done before and done far better.\n\nRacedriver: Grid, is still the best in this series.\nSuch a shame.","June 28, 2014","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Handling is only marginally better than the last game, awful menu system - cant even just grab a ccar from a menu and practice a track, have to go through setting up a competition, career mode is basic, AI stinks - far too aggressive in open-wheel cockpit racing - its like it is barely aware of your existance.\n\nCockpit views are a joke, either right up to the window with no detail or a blurry non-functional cockpit from a behind the wheel position.\n\nObvious from the start that this is going to be plagued by a lot of DLC but its a cash-cow thats not worth milking.\n\nI bought this hoping for a good GRID again and after hearing positive feedback on the internet but it was blatant BS.

AI is excellent though often ruthless, car control is accurate but exaggerated, tracks have all been seen before but boast many new layouts, pavement has nuance, and damage has consequences. I’m struck by how consistently the AI races. Once the difficulty is dialed in, every mistake you make pushes your rivals ahead and every perfect line reels them in. Passing a racer is always the slowest line around a corner and I can see the affect it has on me in relation to the cars ahead and behind. It’s brilliant. The race menus are all new for Grid Autosport. Events are organized into seasons that encompass one discipline at a time and must be completed before switching to another. You freelance yourself out to racing teams like in the old contracts system in Grid 1. Each season could be as few as 2 races or as many as 8-10, and can include a wide variety of vehicles. Season offerings are numerous and allow you to lean on disciplines you enjoy and do the minimum in disciplines you don’t. Different race teams set different goals and award more or less points accordingly but, more importantly, different teams offer different cars to align with your preferences in the same races. The points increase your level in each separate discipline and progress you into faster and faster cars. Seasons are competitive enough that you can afford to have numerous non-first finishes and still win so long as you’re near the top. Individual races typically have a 10 minute practice session, a 3 lap qualifying, neither of which can be restarted, and a race which can be restarted. Practice and qualifying can get a bit tedious but are optional. Short comings are few. I wish I could command my own race team and create my own liveries but you could argue that that’s what multiplayer allows you to do. And though there are many new track layouts, you’ve seen all of these locales before in Grid and Grid 2. New facades would have been welcome. I’d say the game is most enjoyable with an xbox360 controller but delicacy on the triggers tires my knuckles which makes the G27 a more comfortable, if not leisurely, choice. Highly recommend.

The game force streaches to my 4:3 monitor's shape when I set it to play at a 16:9 res with 16:9 screen ratio, Other games work it out just fine, this is the only game I'v ever had a issue with in that. although the game is quite pretty when at high settings.\n\nThe controles for keyboard are just terrible untill you've played for a race or two (each time you play). you tap the A or D keys for half a second and your car is nearly sideways because it instantly goes full turn.\n\nSo in my opinion, and in my situation of having a 4:3 monitor and no stearing wheel, it's not really worth the 50$ I would have paid if it wasn't on sale for 25$. and even for 25$ I'd kinda rather have my money back than have the game... :/\n\nAlthough if you do enjoy the game there is a good amount of game to play.\n\nJust my opinion. Also, I bought this hoping for something a little more like GranTurismo so it may just be that talking... or that this makes me think of NFS Pro street, which is a game I liked even less than this game.","September 6, 2014","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Playing the older Grid 2 yields hours of interrupted gameplay, or anything else for that matter. Then lose all your progress from starting the game before the crash.\n\nCons:\n1. AI: Can concur with most that the AI is behaving in an unruly manner, especially ones by Ravensport. What's more as easily they can spin you out, you can't retaliate effectively by PIT because they seem to be immune from pushing?\n2. Downforce + Grip: I can expect the Touring cars to be slidy, but a F312 Dallara acts like its driving on ice. Or things one would expect to have more default downforce. Also AI seems to be able to slide at speed, while player cannot.\n3. Tuning: Inital mid level tuning is too coarse for some courses. It should be full tuning at all times or never at all. Tuning is\nalso a cure for the poor grip/downforce on the F312 for example.\n4. The nag everytime a season ends. If I wanted it to be harder, I would be playing Asseto Corsa with a phone keypad. Or drive a real car. Just saying.\n5. Endurance: At the shortest length, the tyre wear is overly much. If it happened in real life, you would sue the tyre company. Also losing grip means driftiness, but the controls won't allow finessed drifting, thus crashes occur.\n\nPros: 1. First time I had an opportunity to drive Aussie V8 supercars. I now understand why the country is divided into before races.\n2. Discipline variety: Keep alternating to relive the tedium of driving on the same tracks in every possible direction. Like the old days of NFS underground. Surprisingly apart from the speed, one can drive the same way  between all categories.\n\nSince I would not be able to finish the game without crashes every other race, this game is a reminder of my own folly of buying a pre-order sim from CM ever.","September 5, 2014","false","33.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The problem is that the physics engine is still the super arcade engine from previous GRID games. The arcade style physics feel really out of place in F1 cars especially. The game also gets extremely repetitive very quickly.\n\nThe career mode is nothing but circuit racing, with the occasional drift tournament in Tuner, in various cars. Alternate styles of race, such as Drag and Sprint, are DLC. You also have almost no options when it comes to vehicle choice for races. You are given the option between two sponsors with 1 or 2 cars each. A lot of the teams have no tuning options whatsoever.\n\nI did purchase the Drag DLC in order to see what the fuss was about. The DLC is highly disappointing. There are nine additional tournaments but they have no impact on your Career OR Online progress in any way. Vehicle options are also extremely limited.\n\nIf you are looking for a realistic racer, or any kind of variety, look elsewhere.\n\n","April 13, 2015","false","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Grid Autosport I want to like but it just feels like a chore, grinding out races so you can slowly unlock other races which you need to grind out to unlock more races...\n\nOf the 5 race types, Tuner is like driving a marshmellow around a track - no sense or urgency or speed. Drift is ridiculous - you hardly even need to brake, the car will drift as soon as you turn the wheel so there's little to no skill involved. I tried fishtailed left and right through a section whilst completely ignoring bends and still won. And Timetrials? Who cares - I want to R A C E!\n\nEndurance is pontless and in a game that already feels like hard work, why bother? Instead of looking at your lap counter and thinking 'Only 2 more laps', you look at the clock and think 'Bloody hell, 5 more minutes?'\n\nOther modes are good as you actually get to race but very frustrating in that you will bust a gut to get a win or a 3rd place against superior competition (actually, it's only 1st and 2nd that are superior, but it helps you to delude yourself that everyone in the field is) and your efforts are largely pointless because your teammate is still on the starting grid trying to find the ignition.\n\nTo be honest, it pains me a little to not recommend this game because the racing can be great fun.

The problem is that the physics engine is still the super arcade engine from previous GRID games. The arcade style physics feel really out of place in F1 cars especially. The game also gets extremely repetitive very quickly.\n\nThe career mode is nothing but circuit racing, with the occasional drift tournament in Tuner, in various cars. Alternate styles of race, such as Drag and Sprint, are DLC. You also have almost no options when it comes to vehicle choice for races. You are given the option between two sponsors with 1 or 2 cars each. A lot of the teams have no tuning options whatsoever.\n\nI did purchase the Drag DLC in order to see what the fuss was about. The DLC is highly disappointing. There are nine additional tournaments but they have no impact on your Career OR Online progress in any way. Vehicle options are also extremely limited.\n\nIf you are looking for a realistic racer, or any kind of variety, look elsewhere.\n\n","April 13, 2015","false","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As many do now a days, i searched the web of pre-access user videos and reviewers to see how the in-game play would be. So before even purchasing i could tell there would be a lot of things i wouldn't like about the game, and somethings i would.  Overall this game is not worth the price it is going for, there are so many things that are off about this game or just not worth the value. If you still need a reason why you shouldn't buy it, keep reading.\n\nI own and play many codemaster games( F1 2010-13 , Grid, Dirt 2,3) so i have a good idea of how Codemasters work SHOULD be, but it seems they decided to cut every corner possible in this game. The AI, the physics, the track design/layout, have all been half arsed in comparison to the other games they have made, specifically F1 2013 which is by far the best version to date. It's strange to even think that this game is even made by the same people unless you look real close at some of the details in this game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game, is the horrible attempt of the interior design of the vehicles, it's unbelievable how little f*cKs were given when they put these vehicles together. Considering games like Shift 2, forza 3-4 , which were made years ago, have superb interior and exterior design and a lot more cars! So there really isn't any reason for the excuse the designers may have.\n\nSome may still have an issue with the driving physics including myself, but i will say it can be pretty fun (like 20 minutes fun) when sliding about and buzzing of into the distance. Plus it's not like its uncontrollable, so i'm not going to knock on that door to much. Yes the problem is that tje they drifted towards....drifting physics, allowing the car to get extremely tail happy and overly dramatic body roll (tilt and lean) is apart of normal turning style, but in some cases it's a bit much considering that even the extreme formula cars suffer from snap oversteer and understeer if you don't get it just right.\n\nOne thing that is decent about the game, is the basic tuning parameters. Even if you're a noob when it comes to vehicle tuning( unlike Forza where you have to be just shy of a mechanical engineer), you can get a sense of (hot or cold) when it comes to picking the right settings, and even if you are cold when it comes to choosing the right balance, you aren't severly punished on track, yes your times will be off but you now know why and can easily change it accordingly.\n\nBut my last issue comes down to the detail in resolution. Its simply not there, there are still many areas through out the game that are simply too pixelated or not optimized. This may be a gripe with people who have spent a lot of money on their gaming rigs and want the best, of the best of the best, and for us this is not.\n\nIt seems to me this game was probably meant to work well for people who have basic or mid range computers, so I can see where over a wider audience why it has been optimized at this level. Even maxed out on all settings my computer doesn't even break a sweat, which means there is a lot of graphical computing that is still bottled away to keep from killing users computer's. Though i've yet come across glitching issues, which some people like, to me it means not to many areas have been pushed to its maximum potential. A good example of this is Ubisoft games, they crash like hell and glitch like no other, but for the 15 minutes it plays, the quality is superb!","August 18, 2014","false","37.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its graphical fidelity is on par with Grid 2, and its mechanics are a vast improvement over both Grid 1 and 2. The game feels quite a bit more realistic than the other Grid games, more of a simulator than an arcade game, though it still retains a sense of fun and forgiveness of mistakes, at least at the lower difficulty levels.

In full dificulty the games is quite challanging, and you feel close to real racing. I do miss some basic things like pitstops. And some collision bugs with cones, that get on the front of the car making it like 30% slower and that take like 2 laps to go off.

You will need few time to understand how to drive the car, but after that the driving feel is very good. Pay attention to difficulty settings, some driver addings need to be set On or Off based on your driving style.\n\nAlso, Online content is very good. Racenet Challenges is a nice way to play vs friends/community. There are leaderboards for each type of race. Ghost Car is also nice, can virtually compete with a friend.","December 7, 2015","true","66.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Clearly holding the F1 franchise is beginning to show dividends.\n\nThe most noticable change is car handling,something far from the case in its predecessor Grid 2 and while not exactly pick up and play as Grid 1 is worth the effort to master. The single player story/campaign is hit n miss but again Grid never did hold an award for that part and car tweaking is minimalist to say the least. That aside all runs smooth,nice tracks, nice cars, much improved handling from 2 and more than reasonable AI dependant on setting.\n\nI still hanker for and lord the original as autosport comes across a little to clinical looking in presentation for my liking but this doesnt detract from it offering itself up as a really good driving game\n\nGrid autosport with DLCs is the most complete grid package from cars,options,tracks to arcade amusement todate, its just a shame yet again to have to collect the DLCs to make it so.","January 24, 2015","true","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

GRID had interiors and even working dials.\n\nThe replays are less interesting, the smoke and damage effects are poor and the sound is really dull.  The inside of a touring car sounds like its full of cotton wool.\n\nIts not terrible but is not as good as the original GRID, and it should be leaps and bounds ahead nowadays.\n\nThe career is also very limiting and is simply a succession of single races.\n\nI do like the addition of practice, qualifying and reverse ordering of cars in round 2.  Also, the time penalties and ability to multiply the number of laps.  But good rules like this on a poorly driving car with no personal team is worthless.\n\nLets hope that the next GRID is the best of all the games in the franchise.","March 14","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also the penality for going over the sidemarks(red/white lines) are probably the most annoying thing. There is no user playing online which make the buy car/garage useless as the single player mod doesnt give you the choice to choose your car. You play for a contract, that give you only XP, no money, so no car, no upgrade in single player. In overall its a good game, but clearly overpriced for what its worth.

The handling is amazing (i use an xbox 360 or a xbone controller), gameplay is intense and fun, and the different seasons are many and varied, and it will be a long time before i complete them all. I previously played Grid 2 and hated it. The handling was absolute garbage, and the focus on drifting was obnoxious, and caused the car to swerve like crazy, even when you didn't want it to. This game is almost completely different in its feel, with drifting just being a side option, and not a centerpiece (thank God). A lot of tryhards here don't like this game because its not a hyper realistic driving sim or some crap like that. Honestly, it doesn't matter. If you want a fun game to play on your couch (splitscreen is awesome with a friend) thats intense, but still easy to learn, then this is the game for you. My only gripe would be that i'd like more cars. Seeing only 2-4 choices per event is a bit dissapointing, having played forza in which there are dozens of options. I'm not sure i should have to pay extra for the DLC just to get cars that should have been in the game in the first place. It's not too huge a deal though, as most cars in a class are pretty much identical anway.\n\n","December 25, 2015","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't need to dedicate my life to it to enjoy it, but it's also not so simple that it would become stale quickly.

If cut a corner you are limited to a low speed for a short time (Only kicks in on very big corner cuts)\nGameplay: from what I've played so far it is really going back to the original GRID style (build your XP for a discipline - Touring Car, Endurance, Tuner, Open Wheel, Street - then take part in the international stage for that discipline)\n\nFrom what I've played so far, I would really say "If you like Forza, or the original GRID - buy this!"","June 26, 2014","true","14.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

First couple minutes I was struggling not to slide the car around, but shortly later i got used to it and the handling is very enjoyable. The AI tend to go supersonic at the beginning of a race (slight exageration) but catching up can mostly be easy due to their braking point being early in the beginning. They also tend to be a little...slamy and follow the racing line intensely, they are not afraid to barge into you. They even spin out or crash sometimes. Overall I love this game, love the graphics. But one thing that i dislike, your teammate always sucks...UNLESS it's not a team challenge, in that case he/she's either first or very close.","June 24, 2014","true","48.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

They blew it completely. Here is why:\n\n1. Cockpit views - a bloody shame when compared to the lovely one that the original GRID came with.\n2. Handling - worse than GRID 2 and incredibly bad compared to the original GRID; trying to manage oversteer with keyboard is a chore to put it lightly.\n3. Car tuning - a total joke, even NFS Underground 2 was better; you might think that Codemasters could at least copy things right, but that would be smart\n4. Career - the whole team experience package from the original GRID is missing; no comment\n5. Endurance races - Codemasters managed to screw them up really hard; Le Mans is gone, as well as the day-night cycles during the race - instead you have to fight tire wear and AI that seems not really affected by that\n6. Blur - once you deactivate that, your eyes suddenly feel like they don't need glasses (yes, it's that bad), but you will instantly see how shoddy the textures were made; the rest of the game is similarly crafted\n...\n\nGiven this trainwreck, Codemasters claim that they listened to the community was a blatant lie. Unless acting upon the feedback was optional (in their opinion). You get the picture, I hope. In my not so humble opinion, this game and its developer by extension have managed to insult the first (legendary) GRID again, which to this day remains the undisputed champion. Those many awards back then were well deserved, but Codemasters as it is today does not deserve your money for this game right now. Do yourself and your wallet a favor, enjoy the first GRID (the game that does it right) and ignore the 'pretenders' that followed afterwards.

It was something special that some Racing games dont have.\n\nFinally we have Grid Autosport. One of my friends shared this game in a Twitch LiveStream and the moment I saw it I wanted to play it. This Game has ALOT to do and will keep you busy for a while. There is tons of customizing of your car from normal upgrades to just including better front and back suspension on your car.. To adding a little better braking to your tires.. And thats not all.. This game offers something I felt was needed in Racing games again. AI's that while can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at times.. Are Ones that make you have to read the road a little quicker before making your move. Timing your turns about 2 seconds before you make it or you'll bail out and be executing barrel rolls of joy. (Which Yes Peppy Hare would be very proud of you lol)\n\nThis game has some of the best graphics i've seen CodeMasters do ever. They are still a company by gamers and for gamers and I'm very glad they brought this literally one of a kind title to Steam & the PC.

The AI for Ravenwest...wow. Sure they're great drivers but at times I'm purely out matched (again no matter the difficulty) because the way they pull away from the rest of the pack or even if I'm at max speed they'll leave every one of us in the dust. It’s like they have a twin-turbo’d supercharger with NOS. Sure that’s worth a laugh on itself but that’s the way it feels. Another thing about the game design is if you get a lil rough with the NPC cars chances are you'll crash, why I don’t know. It's like they're a tank and I'm a Ford Fiesta. I touch them, I'll either crash or my steering is F'd for all eternity (steering went orange at 20mph after the 1st turn at Bathurst). If they touch me, well I'm just F'd. What's funny is a bit ago, on Bathurst, I got side-swiped by a Rick Scott and my car damn near did a 90 degree angle into the wall on a straight away. The rubber banding I've always seen on Need for Speed games I am seeing in this game as well, it’s horrible. I'll have a 5 second lead oh wait, here comes one of the Kicker cars out of nowhere catching up, and for some reason I still got the fastest lap time.

It's a must have for every GRID fan out there. The handling is great, difficulty is hard and    it's really satisfying when you master a particular car or discipline. Drift for instance is very well implemented but you'll probably need a pad if you want to make the most out of it. Overall, game is challenging, addictive and, most important, is really, REALLY fun.\n\nOne word must be spent for the cockpit camera, while there are plenty of camera angles the cockpit has some kind of blur applied on purpose to hide clearly missinng textures and details. Probably they just implemented GRID 2 mod but the 4K HD texture pack that comes free with the game pretty much forgives them.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely, it's been a while but we can finally play a decent semi-simulator and have fun with it.

I know what I like and I know what is good and GRID Autosport fits into both categories. The original GRID was an awe inspiring addition to (at the time) a flooded market of extremely good driving games, both simulator and arcade. Its greatest achievement was its introduction to road physics. Everybody lapped up (excuse the pun) the way you could feel the drive and know/react to the changing road surface. In GRID 2 the ball was dropped a bit. It was alright, but it did not live up to the original.\n\nIn GRID Autosport 'everything is awesome!!'. Each of the driving disciplines has been perfected beautifully. Driving is fun and the simulation options are vast, yet it still has a fun arcade feel?! It expands in every department compared to the original. The framerate is damn fast even at ultra settings with the high definition pack. I have encountered zero bugs and the multiplayer is quality.\n\nI am so happy with my purchase and cannot fault it. It is certainly worth giving a go. Join in multiplayer and lets race!\n","June 28, 2014","true","98.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The driving itself is very different from Grid 2, so if you're expecting the slide around every corner at top speed driving then you might want to look elsewhere. Grid Autosport's driving style is very sim like and more realistic then Grid 2. I'm only a few hours in and there are a few things that I would have liked to see in this game that seems to be left out. First off if your going for a sim style game I believe it should hold true to other sim racing games and Grid Autosport lacks some of those features. You cannot purchase vehicles, the upgrading system is lacking and almost seems useless at this point because all upgrades that are available seem to be installed for you. But even with those few issues I can still confidently recommend Grid Autosport because it is a solid racing experience with great handling and outstanding graphics. When I get some more hours in I may edit my recommendation but for now this is how it stands.\n\n*Update 6/28/14\n\nAfter checking out the multiplayer i found out that is the mode in which you can purchase vehicles and have a garage to store them in. I still wish they had this in the career mode considering i don't play a whole lot of multiplayer.","June 26, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

And the fact that AI now make mistakes is a very good feature. For ages I've wanted a game where the player isn't the only driver doing any overtaking or causing drama, because in real life every driver can make mistakes and Grid has finally managed to show that. The drivers actually pressure you in this game, where as in some games you feel like the AI dont challenge you enough. Lets be honest, there is not a lot of good touring car games out there, and this is probably the best of the touring car games.\n\nThe bad: It's WAY to predictable. In Grid 1, the ravenwest team was exactly the same, dominating every race and winning everything, and when Grid Autosport was announced, codemasters was happy to announce that ravenwest was back. The only thing i was thinking when they announced the return of ravenwest is "Not good". What makes racing exciting (for instance the BTCC) is competition. Anyone in the BTCC, ranging from matt neal, jason plato, andrew jordan, giovanardi, colin turking, and a lot more have the chance of winning races and being a potential champion. Grid Autosport however... has completely got that all wrong. I am soley a touring car driver, so i dont know About the other events, but in the touring discipline, you can pretty much gaurentee Nathan Mckane and his ravenwest teammate will come in 1st and 2nd, with the team kicker guys coming in 3rd and 4th. EVERY SINGLE RACE, you can pretty much predict where everyone is going to finish. The occasional switiching of positions, but thats rare to say the least. You feel like theres no point there being any other team, since ravenwest will ALWAYS... and i mean ALWAYS win the races. This bad feature alone has made me dislike this game A LOT. If the game was less predictable and ravenwest wasn't the only team capable of winning a race, this game would be much MUCH MUCH better.\nI also don't like the career mode. I never have in Code master games. They have improved it since Grid 1 since now i can specialise in touring cars, but theres no true progression in the game. Each season the teams are exactly the same. In games such as FIFA, each season is different as players transfer to different teams, new younger players are introduced, and old players retire. Each season is different. But with Grid Autosport (and likewise for games such as F1), the teams are always the same every season, and if you change to a different team, the other driver that was in that team just randomly disappears.. you'd think if i took one of the ravenwest guys positions, because they are "So great" they'd change to a different team, but no...\n\nSidenote: I also think they should of added team creation again. I wanted to be competing in the touring cars championship with my own team, and my own selected team mate, like in Grid 1.\n\nDespite not recommending this game yet, if they fix what I think is wrong with this game, I would recommend this game to ALL.

Grid 2. Everything About that game I loved its sense of speed the way the game felt and it wasn't just a Oh Hey i'm a Racer here on steam hoping you buy me.. It was something special that some Racing games dont have.\n\nFinally we have Grid Autosport. One of my friends shared this game in a Twitch LiveStream and the moment I saw it I wanted to play it. This Game has ALOT to do and will keep you busy for a while. There is tons of customizing of your car from normal upgrades to just including better front and back suspension on your car.. To adding a little better braking to your tires.. And thats not all.. This game offers something I felt was needed in Racing games again. AI's that while can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at times.. Are Ones that make you have to read the road a little quicker before making your move. Timing your turns about 2 seconds before you make it or you'll bail out and be executing barrel rolls of joy. (Which Yes Peppy Hare would be very proud of you lol)\n\nThis game has some of the best graphics i've seen CodeMasters do ever. They are still a company by gamers and for gamers and I'm very glad they brought this literally one of a kind title to Steam & the PC. If you have been wanting a Racing game that will really kick your butt but have you coming back for more This is literally right up your alley.

It only seeks to infuriate.  Why not have % points of AI speed, like RACE07. Why not have car setup like RACE07?\nWhy is "Season 1" 4 races at 2 tracks?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vindekar/recommended/255220/","Vindekar","Not Lucien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vindekar/","86 products in account","Autosport had a lot of potential. It's a deliberate step towards a more serious racing game, and brought a lot of features that fans wanted. The game looks brilliant on paper, with a superb selection of cars, better physics, a new AI and glittering graphics. Sadly the reality is, it's a very technologically impressive game but not very enjoyable to play.\n\nAutosport, at several different levels, feels like a game trying to be something it isn't. It advertises itself as a hardcore driver's game, and yet plays like an Arcade Racer. It feels outdated as well; the graphics are outstanding, but the AI and physics feel years behind the competition. If it was priced accordingly, it would be a big hit. Unfortunately, it's priced as a AAA title, which it very much isn't.\n\nThe driving Physics just don't match the game Codemasters were trying to create. Autosport feels like an Arcade racer; not even a Simcade, but a full Arcade game. Cars drift effortlessly almost by themselves, pull insane G-forces and reach ludicrous speed on the straights. I don't mind stylisation, but selling Autosport as a "hardcore simcade" is like pretending Mariokart 8 is a Formula 1 team's simulator.\n\nThe AI feels much the same as the physics. This isn't a proper circuit-racing AI; it doesn't behave at all like a racing driver, with no thought to rules or self-preservation. It's extremely aggressive, and will frequently ram you for no apparent reason. It also shows some significant perception-related bugs: it will occasionally drive into solid objects at full-throttle apparently unaware that they're even there.","July 11, 2014","false","55.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Codemasters had created the ultimate in arcade environments - sliding was faster than standard cornering. And those who wanted a true-blooded racing sim sequal to the original GRID spoke out. They were not happy.\n\nAnd so Codemasters made THIS game. GRID Autosport. Where cars feel like cars. Where endurance races can require endurance (depending on your option settings). Where winning a race is more than just swinging your car around corners casually whilst daydreaming about what your drifts must look like if not for terrible reply camera angles.

Features a few different disciplines of racing from touring cars to open wheel and drift cars. While the graphics are clearly from last gen, the lighting is superb and the sound equally matches it. Unfortunately the immersion is completely lost though as each 'season', which consists of only a few races, doesn't really make me feel like I'm accomplishing anything nor developing a reputation with a team. Picking a team to sign on with is literally just about picking the team with the most XP and easiest sponsor goals. If it fleshed out the disciplines a little more with a greater variety and some longevity, and insentive to stick with smaller teams, I feel like it would help develop that element of competition we see so often in real racing. This would also help me commit to one discipline longer as racers don't typically jump from Formula cars to drifters and then back to hot hatch time trials, it all seems a little incoherent.\n\nOn top of this, the car handling isn't the best. Cars feel very floaty and there's almost no difference in the way each car feels regardless of drive or engine placement. The interior view is also incredibly lackluster; nothing inside the car works and the textures are so incredibly low res that Codemasters has opted to blur it all out.\n\nWhile there are an incredible amount of faults to this game, it is still somehow fun. It has a few cool features as well, such as the 'second screen' mode, which for people with two monitors allows you to have the race standings and a TV-like broadcast of the race featured on your other monitor while you play the game on the primary monitor.\n\nIt's not worth the initial price of $50, but I'd certainly check it out for $25 or less, especially if you're a fan of other Codie games and are familiar with their arcade quote 'semi-sim' style car games. 7 / 10","June 26, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game looks and runs like a dream.  The only con is that the AI is extremely aggresive and looks to overtake you by any means.  On the otherhand this is also a pro because who really wants to race and have no competition?  The AI will certainly make you adjust your racing style while preparing you for multiplayer","October 4, 2014","true","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Though the overall game is amazing. Multiplayer is glitchy, as I have encountered glitches like me going from last to first than first to last while I am actually in last (I have a good internet connection) and then when it looks like I am in first and I finish, it says I got last. Also, the insides of the cars are terribly textured and modeled. They are hardly detailed. No speedo, and squarish modeling inside. Also they are blurred out if you turn shaders on. Also, GRID needs rain. I'm tired of there being just sun and clouds. I want rain! Just model the rain like the rain from the F1 games, and make the windshield wipers work!","October 3, 2014","true","28.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

[UPDATED 7/1/2014: SEE BELOW]\n\nI'm new to the GRID franchise, however I have heard excellent things about it and decided to jump in here with Autosport. When I first launched the game, wow. I've been a Forza diehard for the past 4 years and this is certainly a change. If you just want to read why I don't recommend, skip to the bottom. Before I go too in depth, here's a list of the pros and cons:\n\nPros\n- Engaging career mode\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Decent physics\n\nCons\n- 1 BUG\n\nI'll begin with the pros. The career is broken into different classes, Tuner, Touring, Endurance, and others. In each class, there are seasons that help you progress along your career as a racer. You'll sign on with different teams, such as Oakley Racing, for the season, you'll get a teammate, rivals, etc. Normal race car driver stuff. Each event (usually, unless it's a special event) has practice (for tuning, if available), qualifying, and one to two races. I found this to be much more fun than the career of Forza, where the races were short, limited, and very boring.\n\nI have yet to try online but we'll get to why in a minute.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous. At full tilt, it looks pretty real. Just be careful about your computer's proccessing power. It'll give it a run for its money.\n\nPhysics are ok. I have yet to get into the higher classes to see if grip really becomes a factor. Something does feel slightly off...\n\nBUG REPORT BELOW [FIXED - SEE UPDATE]\n\n"OK, so why didn't you try online?"\nGreat question! There's a bug... And if it wasn't for this bug, I would highly recommend this game. There is a bug that causes a screen "freeze" where the car and audio freeze for about half a second at random on all graphics levels. "Why's that such a huge deal?" Glad you asked. Every second counts in a race. So, if you're going through a technical, winding, difficult turn and suddenly everything just glitches out, you're focus is broken. This bug will work itself out, but it starts the race again before the screen can catch up. So you'll hear the car move (and incidently go off the track or hit other cars) before you can see it. "So what does that have to do with online racing?" This glitch freezes your car. In a tight race, where it's bumper to bumper, turn for turn, close quarter racing, a sudden stop ruins it for everyone. I may not feel the effects besides the glitch, but I'll inadvertently make everyone else despise me.\n\nTo sum it all up, great game that needs MAJOR bug fixing. The core of the game is great, however that one bug disastorously effects the gameplay, making it almost unplayable. If I was a potential buyer, I would wait until there has been a patch and one that has been reviewed as a proper fix.\n\nComputer Specs: Toshiba Satellite P50, Windows 8.1 64-bit, intel i7-47000MQ @2.4GHz, 16GB (8+8) RAM plus 2GB NVidia GeForce GTM 740M: driver version 340.43 (beta)\n\n[UPDATE] I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the game and now it works fine. It must've been a glitch that occured during "pre-loading" when I preordered the game. Now I fully recommend the game!","June 30, 2014","true","14.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
