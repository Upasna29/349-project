I played many many hours of it in the past. But compared to Commandos 2, It's not what it could be.\n\nWhere commandos 2. Had a smooth learning curve. Commandos 3, throws that over board and just throws you into the deep and straight after the tutorial.\nLets compare commandos 2 to commandos 3 for a quick bit.\nthe tutorial of commandos 2 was ok. First one was quite easy, but explaining the basics very well. Then the second one gave you the feeling of a real mission in a smaller setting. Still a little easier than the main missions, it gave a good learning experience of the game. Mainly because not everything was explained to you.\ncommandos 3 tutorial was too simple. You began training a whole long missions learning the basic moves of some of the commandos, all in a way too linear fashion. Then the second tutorial should have been the smaller mission. And it is. But compared to the actual missions, this one is way too easy, and again every move you need to make is fed to you with a spoon.\n\nbut okay, the main missions are quite hard. they aren't impossible. Just require a whole lot of messing things up.\n\nMissions. Hard, doable but okay. their settings differ nicely from eachother. Though the difference could be as good as it was in commandos 2. But what i disliked most, is the linear feeling most of the missions have. Do this, go to that do that again. It just doesn't feel like the past where you had open levels and you could do them in any way you liked.\nStory wise, they did nicely too. They actually managed to add in 3 stories in the game.\none about a traitor, one for the D-day campain. And one about a weapon if i am not mistaken.\nNot the spectacular stories you would hope for, but it's there at least.\nDiversity in players is lacking though. I feel that I am mostly just using the same players mission after mission. While leaving some alone. they even cut out some players from the previous game. But why they only used the diver in 1 mission i can't understand.\n\nThen we have the gameplay.\nIt's okay at best.\nAs someone who is common with commandos 2 controls this is a whole difference. Because mainly it's the same game as C2. Just with some major ajustments. Some are good, some are bad.\nControl wise, It could have done better. A lot of the shortcut keys are gone. And I have the feeling to get a different weapon out I am clicking more than I did in previous installments.\nBut that is just knitpicking.\nOf course there are mods to enable more shortcut keys.\n\nIt does improve on some mechanics though.\nWeapon distribution and handling is improved. And the free moving camera indoors works great too.\nIf yhey used these mechanics in Commandos 2, than that would have been a straight A game.\n\nBut last thing I am saddened about. It doesn't work as well on modern pc's. Commandos 2 still works greatly on my PC. but commandos 3 needs so many changes to the game files to keep it working. It's just not worth it.\n\nBut to make it short.\ncommandos 3. It is a good game. but only if you are a long term fan of the series.\nbut don't expect it to be as good as commandos 2.\n\nMy reccomendation. Get commandos 2 if you haven't already. It's longer and has better gameplay.\nIf you already got, and this game does turn up with 75% off. Then it's worth getting. Just so you can feel how it could be better. Otherwise, Just stay a long way away from it.","December 25, 2013","true","0.1"," 78 of 94 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","78","94","3","0"

In my opinion it's a step back from previous games. A lot of content got cut out, game is very short and linear, many missions depend on time and force you to play aggressively (even if you prefer the stealth approach). There are a few nice missions, but they seem more like Commandos 2 Bonus missions.\nAfter such an outstanding game like Commandos 2, I can't believe why they made something unappealing like this.\n\nOnly for fans who just need to have a bit more of Commandos (and then probably play previous Commandos games again...).\n\nIf you're new to Commandos - skip this game, get Commandos 2 instead, later play Commandos BEL and Commandos BtCoD.\n\nDriver (okie-dokie!) is missing :(","March 26, 2014","false","7.8"," 47 of 66 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","47","66","0","3"

Why? Because this one is even harder due to improved AI, time limits and fewer shortkeys which is not very beginner friendly but also because it is simply not as good as Commandos 2. The developers removed a lot of features that made Commandos 2 great, such as being able to seach furniture for useful items, bonus levels, difficulty settings and many more smaller things. Sure there were improvements too, like a fully 3D engine and a bigger variety of level designs but this was not enough to make the game stand out from it's predecessors.\n\nIn short: It's very challenging for Commandos veterans and other strategy gamers but near impossible for beginners who are better off starting with Commandos 2 to get used to the gameplay.\n\nLooking at the negative reviews of this game reveals that Commandos 3 might not work for your computer for unknown reasons. If you want to make sure you can play the game without any issues you'd better buy it at GOG. http://www.gog.com/game/commandos_2_3","June 29, 2014","true","33.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Which is a shame since it is actually really good in theory. Like so many other games, it collapses when let loose into the world.\n\nYou have a number of specialists - sniper, sapper, commando, spy, thief - who all do pretty much what you expect them to do. You job is to apply their specialties where they are needed. Need to kill something quick? The commando is the man. Need to do it from far away? Sniper. Want to make boom? Sapper. The thief and the spy are the hardest to use, but are also the cleanest when it comes to their job. They can sneak past right in front of enemies, given if the situation is right. The mission is to wreck the Nazis. So you have this great game and useful tools. What is wrong?\n\nThe controls are not very well organized and counter-intuitive. Even after you learn them, you find yourself scrambling to respond to the dynamic events occuring. The friendly AI also isn't very bright.

However, upon installing the game, I found that the pixels suddenly go all weird, the color scheme flashes through various, indescribable hues and the mouse cursor begins to track all over the screen. I looked up if there was anyway to fix the problem and Steam was no help at all. I checked google, and many people have had similar problems with no hope of fixing them. Honestly, the game is unplayable in it's current state. Too bad, because it really is a good game. Commandos 2 was better, and worked fine with my Windows 8 system.

I remember buying Commandos 1 on disk way back when and having a lot of fun. Commandos 3 attempts to make a strategy based game an action game and fails miserably. Commandos was originally a real-time hexagonal tile based puzzle. Commandos 3 keeps the same element but has tried to infuse more action into the game. It feels too overwhelming. The controls are too clumsy for an action based game.","July 27, 2013","false","1.0"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Starting with the HORRID controls that seem to lack every hotkey and ease of functionality that Commandos 2 had. They redid it to I suppose make it more streamlined but what they did is actually limit the all the fluidity you had in Commandos2. There seems to be a lack of hotkeys and that they just aren't as intuitive as Commandos 2 was.\nGraphically, the game looks a mess. The character looks heavily polygonized compared to Commandos 2 and faded. Tiny's face is literally a box with no detail on it. His arms are blocky as opposed to Commandos 2 they almost had a clayish look. I was able to improve the graphics though by cranking up my video card settings thru the Nvidia control panel as the in-game menu has zero options for the graphics. Even the sound display Commandos 2 had to show the noise your character was making is completely absent here. To be fair though, the interior detail is still pretty solid and the painted outdoor static backgrounds have great detail. Yet Commandos 2 outdoors still had a more crisp look to them. These do seem a tad blurry in comparison.\nOk, now onto the difficulty. Commandos series was always renown for it's difficulty. That actually was part of the fun to it. They at least had levels that progressed in difficulty but you could at least get a decent foothold of the game at the beginning. Commandos 3, no. It starts off brutally hard where just about any move you make sets off an alarm. It's rather frustrating when my above issue with the controls come in to play where you are fighting over controlling your Commandos and dealing with an impossible game to even begin playing. I even ran thru the tutorial but that was like super easy that it doesn't compare at all to the beginning missions.\nTo put it plain and simple, I do not recommend this game at all. For some reason, Pyro went completely backwards on it and it feels like this should be Commandos 2 and 2 should of been this. This is a highly frustrating game in every aspect graphically to game play from Commandos 2. Go and buy Commandos 2 or the originals and enjoy them as they represent the true end of the Commandos series for me. Even the first Desperados makes a great alternative to this. Look for that one on sale.","September 4, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The learning curve here delicately holds your hand through the tutorial then hands you a live grenade and asks why you haven't defused it yet\n\nThe good news then, for veterans of the game, you'll really find your skills pushed here. Time is the big stricture here for many levels, where before you generally had the luxury of ticking off every enemy in your own time. Clearing a rail-field in minutes to intercept a train, with just the Green Beret, was an incredible level\n\nIn many respects, Commandos 3 improves upon the 2nd installment. The levels are smaller, so less onerous. The variety is also pushed so it's not just repetitions of "clear out this encampment". Quickly move to the front of a moving train, assassinate a traitor, destroy as many vehicles as possible before they leave the compound...\n\nIronically though, these work against it in some respects. The game is ridiculously short (compared to the previous titles) - there are only 12 levels in all, a handful of which take 5 minutes (if that), so you barely feel you get started with a campaign before it's over. Too many also become a bit "Commandos and Conquer" - less about stealth and more playing an RTS of hero units. They were fine in moderation in Commandos 2, but I felt they took up a few too many levels here\n\nBut whilst I say it's probably the least memorable of the 3 titles - The quality and challenge is still definitely there","April 30, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
