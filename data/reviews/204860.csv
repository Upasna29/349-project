Men of War typically has bad narrative, so I like to picture it for myself as "just another moment from the front".\n\nPeople who enjoy a good challenge in strategies will appreciate this titles.","March 7, 2015","true","9.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","17","22","3","0"

Then play faces of war, men of war etc (some of them i already own a retail copy and buy from steam recently to support them)\n\nI mostly play story line mission and It's a quite bad game when u compare the past.\n\nMost of time, you are both out-gun and out-number, you have to get everything on battefield to complete your mission.\n\nSome of them, like AT gun, mortar, are esstential to complete mission. If you are unlucky, it will be destroy by AI (like off-map artillery, AT grenades, tanks) that force you to restart the mission.\n\nSome map are specially crafted, you can't kill enemy in a safe way such that you must fight against them at open which cause you fail. For example:\ngrenade can throw around 20m at same height,  the distance between the closest cover and enemy is 21m.\nonly gap to climb up the hill is covered by enemy MGs and there is no indirect weapon to kill him, no smoke, no sniper rifle. You can draw his attention by gunfire which will scarifie some unit, so he will look at other direction.\nAt some map, load game will change the behaviour of enemy. Change patrol route, go somewhere they won't go normally, see your unit at concealment.\n\nYou have to play/complete objective in the way they design, otherwise event trigger is broken, for example, reinforcement come at wrong time, no reinforcement, etc\n\nand some minor bug.\n\nSo far, It's a very fun game, only some mission is broken but i have to choose NOT RECOMMENDED.","June 11, 2015","false","80.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The way it is described it is made to sound like it will be on par with Men of War or Red Tide but instead the "campaigns" are just disjointed loosely linked skirmishes. Oh and its the buggest of all MoW's by far.\n\nNo voice acting,briefings, no cutscenes, no story arc. I was expecting an epic story of a criminal batallion trying to redeem their ways in the service of their nation complete with commisars shooting those running away. But instead it is just skirmishes and a paragraph of written dialogue with no reason to care for whats happening.\n\nVery disappointed in this game. No where near the quality of Men of War and Red Tide(which were fantastic and story linked with references to missions in both games). It should not be sold as a a multiple campaign story spanning from 1942-1945 standalone game. I gave it to mission 3 and uninstalled a long time ago. Now sitting in my "Junk" category of my library. A shame because the other MoW games are great. It also turns out there is only 8 missions in the game.\n\n2/10 because the engine is still amazing. Everything else is utter lies and lazy design. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

So, I welcomed the idea of playing this very Men of War title as it would feature better graphics, which is true compared to the original faced of war/men of war, not that it matters because most of these improvements either don't work(hdr won't work for me) or are too small to be noticed(the higher poly count in the models, tanks are cubical and zooming in to see the faces of soldiers is unwise during combat as it limites your situaltinal awereness). Not that I really cared because I always prefered the ability to have massive battles and ambushes via the editor rather than it looking better, which is my main problem with condemmed heroes: the editor is ruined.\n\nIt is not ruined as in it is broken, no not at all. It just lists things you can place that are implacable, i.e. they crash the game once selected or placed. Not a big deal, all men of wars have had this problem, they just had it in predictable places. You could easily avoid them but here, no not here. Here they are all over the place. Look at that, gun_1, gun_2, gun_3 and gun_4, very nice except one of these will crash your game, no matter what. even if you only scroll over it: using the mousewheel to navigate the menu=crash. It gets better, as you can select certain items(be it tanks, guns or even soldiers) without crashing the game, but when you place them the game does crash. The number of units is very, very, very small. There are only two factions whith the germans having their regular number of units(less even when it comes to vehicles) and the russian have a lot more units. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Perhaps it does, but some of the russian units make the game crash, or are the same unitmodel but with a name(e.g. John) instead of ''rifleman''.\n\nThe campaign itself has been untouched as of the writing of this review so I have no idea as to it being any good. Should you like the editor a lot than DON"t  BUY THIS GAME, buy the original or Assault Squad. Everything but this editorial heap of crash.","June 21, 2014","false","0.5"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Could this ever be a bad thing?\n\nWell that depends, how many times can you capture a German trench? Believe me, by the time you get to the end of Condemned Heroes you should have pretty much mastered the art of assaulting an occupied trench.\n\nCondemned Heroes can be difficult at times. Nearly every battle is a Soviet attack and as the game follows a Soviet penal unit, that means your guys are the tip of the spear. As grisly as that sounds, it's the counter attacks you have to watch out for.\n\nNo sooner have you shot, bashed or exploded the last German soldier must you begin to prepare for the inevitable counter attack. I bet you wished you hadn't thrown anti-tank grenades at the PAK or MG positions now, da, tovarich?\n\nI don't think there was ever a counter attack where I wasn't just holding on by the skin of my teeth and hoarded anti-tank grenades [Hard difficulty]. You can begin to appreciate how soldiers felt in such situations when relief finally turned up and helped beat back the attackers.\n\nCondemned Heroes is a visually pleasing and tactics intensive game that's only short fall is the focus on the Penal Heroes. Yes, they are the focus of the game but again, how many times must I assault a trench line then defend that trench line.\n\nOther games in the Men of War series provide a more varied pallete of missions, Condemned Heroes should only be played by those wanting to truly test their infantry assault tactics.\n\n7/10","August 3, 2015","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is also very few vehicles to avalible on missions,  which requires heavy exploting of AI controlled units (which for some reason are immortal half the time?), slowly advancing forward, pitching grenades around corners and luring tanks from their spawn. Many maps are clearly not play tested and are just frustrating to play. Writing this review after one of the  last maps, "The fortress".
