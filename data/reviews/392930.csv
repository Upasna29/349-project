Junior Edition. Not bad for the price. Entire game can be played with the mouse. left click steer, right click shoot, middle click camera and scroll wheel zoom. Gameplay consists of trade and missions between 4 different zones. Storyline is presented through visual novel-like cut-scenes when docked. Missions progress the story forward while still leaving the free roam options of finding loot, slaughtering pirates and picking up sub-quests. Supports 1080p and some basic graphic options. Should run on netbooks/laptops.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sog0_8DrX1Q\nMore aimed at the younger generation but I'm still having some fun with it. Would like to see the in-game trophies linked to steam achievements.","August 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","46","56","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/392930/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:A Sirius Game is a game where you take control of Sirius, a bad guy from family of traders, who decides to leave home and... sail until he die, trading and escorting ships meanwhile. Is that all? No, you can shoot your cannons to protect others, you can even cast magic! But now the important question - is it fun to play the role of Sirius, doing mostly a boring messenger work combined with repetitive cannon shooting to protect NPC ships? Not at all. Only thing worth mentioning and praising is the way story is being presented, with dialogues in style you may know from visual novels.\n\nPros:- Story parts. I guess this is the reason why Aldorlea Games took this game under their publishing, the character and background artworks are nice, same applies to dialogues.\n- Mediocre 3D graphics.\n\nCons:- Boring. Ships are slow and the sea combat is just average relatively for the genre.\n- Controls with keyboard are awful, but mouse control is just a little better.\n- Everytime I tried to get to the options menu the game crashed, so I had to play it only in small window.","January 6","false","3.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

The left mouse button controls movement, you rotate your view by pressing the scroll wheel, and you fire at pirates with the right button. Any one of which makes sense, but during combat it is unwieldy to say the least. If they update the controls I will revisit this review, but for now, it just isn't fun.","January 17","false","1.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Buy low, sell high. Don't bother trading, just exit the port, sail a bit and come back.\nI have 35,000,000 golds and am swimming in the most powerful weapons.\nDon't bother paying attention to all the weapons or suposed depth, the game ends after 8 quests or so and you can pad it out doing side quests,but why???\n\nEnjoy the short quests and utterly, utterly ridiculous dialogue.\n\nThere's a lot of strange stuff, and some downright brutal metal stuff like burning someone alive in their house.\nIt then goes right back to light humor.\n\n"Da ♥♥♥♥" sums up this game and I paid less than $0.50 cents for it.\n\nIt's worth it for the craziness. Doesn't crash very often either, which is nice.\n\nThere's four zones with pretty much 1-2 quest per zone. It's possible to get the game "ending"\nbefore half the quests...","January 9","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
