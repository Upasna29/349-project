Wildfire is like Jagged Alliance 2 hardcore. In the original one taking couple of towns in the begining was a walk in the park. All of them had just few guys with pistols and so on, but on Wildfire... boy, was I in for a surprise! I had to restart about three times before I even managed to survive the first sector. All the goons were armed with automatic weapons, hard hitting pistols or shotguns. It was raining lead. I couldn't just bull rush them, I had actually had use cover, sneaking, side stepping, avoid enemy patrols and the only time I can hope to capture a town is during night with stealth weapons. All of this was pretty much optional in the original game, but in this they are a must! I don't know if this will get any easier later on when I get enough money to hire bunch of top tier mercs and I can afford to buy the best guns and attachments, but atleast at the start of the game guerrilla warfare is the only way to go.\n\nIt really tells you something about this day and age when "game being hard" is a negative thing. Even though trying to take the same sector for several times, when all of my previous attempts have failed, is infuriating, I do enjoy the challenge.\n\nIf you like squad based strategy game with turn based combat that instead of holding your hand rips your arm off and beats you to death with it, then this is the game for you. Just remember to google what skills different answers give you when you create your own character since getting a psychopatic hand-to-hand combat guy is pretty worthless in the end, even though it might sound awesome.","January 15, 2015","true","25.5"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","47","53","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/215930/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Wildfire in its core is a major community made update to the Jagged Alliance 2, the king of the turn-based squad-sized tactical games.\n\nThere, in the Wildfire modification, we simply got a much more real-deal bang of firefights, more guns with more natural stats, more deepness in the economic model, refurbished layouts in the every sector, and more of fixed code, that was not perfect in the JA2. You know, those little bugs, which are not worth for a direct patch, but still troubles when you meet them.\n\nI repeat it in the usual pro/contra manner:\n\n+ Almost the same refined JA2 experience from the original game. Yet we have new economic system and difficulty of the game was raised significantly because of better and more complicated AI behavior. That means – even more tactical thinking is required.\n\n+ By “Refurbished layouts”  I mean rewritten maps, with changed buildings and other stuff in the sectors. That was done in favor of the possibility to take upper hand using different stages/floors of the buildings – which is certainly better than usual 1-floored flat-ground firefight experience.\n\n+ Speaking of firefights, enemies learned new tricks with maneuvering, and items using. Expect more challenges, more ambushes and traps (and also mine fields, fences, watchtowers, perimeter lighting, and alarms), more soldiers with better brains and much more wild and rapid fire on your way through Arulco.\n\n+ To the lovers of the boomsticks, there was added a plenty of them, all with real-world stats, sounds and behavior.\n\n+ Some newer team-mates were also added, to make new combinations and getting newer experience\n\n+ In comparison with the JA2 Gold edition without unofficial  1.13 patch, you’ll get a better visuals and compatibility with higher resolutions\n\n- Some fans of the original JA2 may find it hard to adopt newer additions in the economics or in the difficulty settings\n\n- Even with all thorough work made above code of JA2  in Wildfire 6, game still crushes and lags too often for a stable project\n\n- Some quests remained the same, and some were remade – and if it were about new voice acting, that was done badly, due the lack of pro actors for voicing anew\n\nFor new players, or for those who were not hard in love with original JA2, this mod will be over-the-head hard experience of being outnumbered and outgunned. And, again, crush of the game in the last phase of the long-going battle for the first airport killed many amateurs hopes for making a quick run through. Face it – it is a project for hard-headed fans of old-school turn-base. You can spend a dozen of hours clearing one sector there – and no, you’ll not get an achievement badge after success. Nobody will know, nobody will care, I fear. That’s the final blow of realism that game can offer.\n\nIn the end, I’ll give Wildfire 7.5/10 – because I love turn-based games and hard, but obtainable challenges. As a recommendation, I’ll suggest to try the vanilla JA2 first, add 1.13 patch after it, and only then, if you still be in pursuit of another go through Arulco, try Wildfire. Just try to get a normal life before – who knows? Maybe you’ll succeed and not be in that much awe of such tenacious time-killers, as that game there.\n","November 9, 2015","true","99.0"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","40","48","0","14"

This game is not for casual gamers or people who like to be a badass superhero instead a real challenge!\n\nJagged Alliance 2: Wildfire is basically Jagged Alliance 2 on steroids\n\nPros:\n\n- More weapons than in the vanilla version of JA2\n- All weapons are rebalanced\n- Loads of new items\n- A completely reworked map with more lively urban and more dense flora sectors\n- Harder difficulty, wich forces you to use actual tactics due to...\n- ...the fact that enemies will not behave in the same pattern like in JA2, there are different types of fiends that will use different, more sophisticated tactics which forces you to differ in terms of tactics and think outside the box more often (wich I really like! :)\n- Side missions are actually important now\n- New mercenarys (that replace old ones, its a Pro if you played JA2 a lot and want something new ;)\n- Up to TEN mercenarys in one squad (instead of 6)\n\nContras:\n\n- Can be punishingly hard (Novice in JA2:W equals roughly Expert in JA2), especially for new players! I would recommend to start with JA2 if you are new to the franchise, unless you seek a challenge or you think that games like frozen synapse or commandos 2 are way too easy :D\n- Sadly no Mod support\n- Infinite stopwatch bug which lets the enemy stay in an infinite round and forces you to close the game (though rarely witnessed^^)\n\nIn terms of bugs, typos and poor voice acting and incompability...i played this game for uncounted hours with the retail version and ten hours with the steam version (on Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit) and it crashed only once or twice, there are a few bugs, but not gamebreaking ones and none that cant be fixed by reloading an earlier safegame, except  the infinite stopwatch bug which only occurs rarely :P\nThe voice acting is quite amateurlike but in a likable way, afterall this is basically a Mod plus, the voiceacting of the vanilla JA2 isnt good either but afterall very likable and characteristic and...this game doesnt take itself too seriously all the time whatsoever, the overacted dubbing, borderline stereotypical characters and the sci-fi setting are proof enough for that ;)\n\nSo overall, this is a game for fans of the franchise, the genre, a challenging experience or strategiefreaks :)\nIf it werent for the 1.13 mod for JA2:Gold, i would say that Wildfire is the best installment of the Jagged Alliance franchise...at least in my humble opinion :3\n\nI Hope this review helps somebody to decide if you should buy this or not :)","August 10, 2015","true","12.5"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"

I was 8 years old. My sister and I would sneak in my uncle's room and play some of his game. Well of course, I don't know how to play. My sister were 11, she kinda know what she's doing,but not really. I remember we always choose Raven. One of our fave character. I got really scared when our mercs die, cause it appear a skelly icon when they died. My sis and I had a good memories together with this game. I am now 23 y/o woman. I've been played this game for few hours, die a lot. I'm not good giving any rating regarding turn-base game. Bought it cause of nostalgia sake.\n\np/s: I've already beat the game. Had to use tons of Mortar to kill those snipers. Mostly my team went fight at night and hide behind buildings. This gave us advantages to lure enemies coming to us. I also had helicopter and cars to travel. But we had to kill all enemies in SAM sides in order to have large safe zone for helipad. Cars has restriction too. Fuels is quite hard to comes by. I found most fuels down in residential area. Since I've already killed the b!tch, I'm now started a new game but this time I went and try non-realistic. I wanna see some aliens or weird creature if I could. I love this game so much.

A first timer does not stand a chance...\n\n\n\nPositive: Much more gear, although a lot is useless. New, larger maps (but it's in the negatives as well)\n\n\n\nNegative:\n\n- Difficulty set for the kind of people who don't mind re-trying 200 times the same map: Very, very few characters starting with a decent gun. Enemy who snipes you with handguns while your entire team can't manage to get a shot on him with assault guns. Really stupid cover system, way too random (Especially the roof bonus), every map from the beginning is very large, and you are massively outnumbered from the very start. That is the easy mode.....\n\nIf you like having fun in your games, forget it. This one is only for people who enjoy pure challenge and don't care about the game itself.\n\n- The re-voicing of some characters absolutely pathetic. Dialogue changes are made by people with no writing talent whatsoever. You already loose a lot of what made JA2 so great.\n\n- The game feels like a very amateurish mod. Patchy, inconsistent (new items and faces have a totally different style of graphics compared to the old ones etc), terrible balance and difficulty management. Calling a quasi-undoable mode 'easy' makes me think to these arrogant teens who plague the MMORPG.\n\n- The maps are so large that you need HOURS just for the very first steps of the game. Exploring the map for loot is as fun as washing every single car in a large parking lot.\n\n- The high resolution graphics, as usual with the amateur mods, only makes everything much, much smaller. Better not have eye fatigue issues.... Come back to the original JA and it all feels soooo comfortable suddenly despite the late 90's graphics.\n\n- The original graphics are dated, but they were proper graphics. The new stuff (especially weapons and the map) uses a better resolution, but look really silly (The new guns are blue?? Nope, it's to show a reflection effect. Are these multicolor LEDs on the guns??? Nope, bad reflection effects, again). The portraits could be allright if they were not in such a different style compared to the ones from the original JA2.\n\n- The characters personnality lost all interest with the new guys. They are just a caricature of the existing content, clearly made by people with no writing skills.\n\n- Iimagine your team in a good ambush position being slaughtered by a few underarmed sitting ducks... It does not always happen, but it does happens regularly.\n\n- If you don't know already every game mechanic by heart, forget it... You won't learn them because you will be slaughtered in no time.\n\n- Nothing more frustrating than a very addictive game making you mad because of some really stupid ideas that ruin everything... Not only you rage-quit, but you rage-quit a game that you want so much to play.\n\nWell, forget it unless you think that the original JA2 is way too easy, and you don't care about anything else but a harder version of JA2 with new maps.","August 20, 2015","false","7.7"," 53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","72","53","74","9","0"

When I got into the lore and backstory of this game, I was impressed. What amazes me about these older games is just how much they place into the game. Modern RPGs might advirtise open world, and an interactive world, and years earlier, games like this where already doing it.  The game is hard, like XCOM hard. At times you have to wonder if attacking with the mercs you have is a good idea, or if it is better to wait for you soldiers to heal up.\nUnfortunatly, the game is not meant for Windows 8. I got frustrated with the game, not because it was hard, but because of how long the opponent was taking thier turn. What should take 5 seconds takes a minute. Then you have to wait for the civileans to take their turn, its just a mess. That being said, this game is still a gem.

When recruiting, you can select whether you want a mercenary to join you for a day, week, or longer. You can also choose to outfit them with their preferred equipment, or equip them from your own stock. Each mercenary comes with a specialized role and relevant skills (+ equipment if you choose to pay for it).\n\nI've played a lot of Fallout, especially Brotherhood of Steel, and I am fairly adept at those games.\n\nIn Wildfire, not so much.\n\nAction points limit how far you can move/shoot, etc per turn, and fog of war prevents you from spotting any enemies outside of your party's field of vision. The feedback for weapon accuracy/chance to hit is very helpful, however, it should be noted that on Windows 7 and above you need to manually patch your game in order to fix the bullet drag animations (it is REALLY slow otherwise).\n\nAesthetics provide a good deal of nostalgia for veterans of older squad-based games, and the comments each mercenary makes when you are attempting to hire them adds nice flavor. The learning curve can be a bit rough if you are not already familiar with playing squad-based tactical games, and the tutorial definitely does not hold your hand. Character death is brutal, as there is no way to revive your downed teammates.\n\nCharacter skill upgrading is pretty diverse, allowing you to completely remove skill from an area if you do not care about it (ex: putting first aid at "0" will effectively make your medkits useless).\n\nRecommend giving it a try if you want a real challenge and do not care about dated graphics.","July 7, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Come in with some vets on short contracts and suddenly the enemy all has shotguns and hand cannons. You seem to get punished for strategy.

This appears to be a modified version of the original Jagged Alliance 2, and uses large chunks of the original.  Many of the changes are nice, such as the expanded squad size and changes to how some things display, but others are so poorly done they're cringe worthy.  Spelling and grammar errors abound, and while you expect the whole "English isn't our primary language" feel through the game, because of the game setting, these new errors are pretty obviously unintentional, and the result of poor writing.  The new, added and changed dialogues with NPCs are also very poorly done.  It's quite obvious the person recording them was reading from a script.  The pacing is forced, the it's done in a monotone, a few words are badly mispronounced, and the speeches leave you feeling like you just saw an act from a high school play. The IMP survey is especially bad.  It's been lengthened considerably, so much so that you find yourself wondering if it's ever going to end, and by the time it finishes you find yourself sitting there wondering "WTF?"  The choices, in most questions, are utterly horrible.  They look like they were written by a 9 year-old who failed English class, and quite a few of them make no sense at all in the question asked and the answers given to choose from.  I'd strongly recommend avoiding IMP altogether, which is a shame, since it was one of the better aspects of the original.\n\ntl;dr: If you pay more than a dollar for this you'll regret it, and you'll probably still regret it if you don't get a handful of change back from that dollar.\n","May 20, 2015","false","1.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"
