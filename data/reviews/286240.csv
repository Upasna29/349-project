I will say that my first impression is positive. I did not notice any obvious bugs or flaws. The gameplay struck me as repetitive, but not boring. It has the potential to be addictive. The game proved to be a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend a night. It does not seem overpriced, but remember to be wary of any early-access title.\n\n------------------------------\nCORE GAMEPLAY------------------------------\n\nThe core gameplay focuses on learning how to properly manage a team of dogs, and how to maximize race efficiency. Races use simple click and timing mechanics to manage factors such as sled position, hunger, jumping, and untangling. Proper racing is rewarded with speed and happy dogs. Awesome moments are rewarded with fame that can lead to sponsorship upgrades.\n\nLearning about each individual dog is important to team management. Each dog has a unique personality that will affect their natural sled position, likes, dislikes, happiness, and rapport with teammates. Dogs will have their own favorite things, skills, and faults. They will also have different levels of athleticism that will affect their fatigue and hunger.\n\nAll of the information about races and dogs will serve one purpose: managing the team. The overall goal is to earn money from victories and move on to more advanced leagues. The time outside of races is used to rest dogs to lower fatigue, fill the journal, change leagues, and hire new dogs. Raleigh will offer a piece of advice (chosen by you) at the end of each race. This information will be used to fill the journal and provide gameplay tips. The first couple of leagues seem easy once the core gameplay is understood, but that seems subject to change based on in-game progress and future updates.\n\n------------------------------\nFINAL DECISION------------------------------\n\nI’m sure there’s plenty more to the game that I have not discovered yet, but these are my first impressions. I have no reason to dislike this game, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds the above information to be to their liking.","December 8, 2014","true","3.0"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

I was looking for a more casual game I could play when I didn't feel like tackling a steep learning curve or intense multiplayer gameplay. Dog Sled Saga met all of those expectations and more. Personally, I find Dog Sled Saga to be one of those games that I might play when I'm feeling down or overwhelmed. The atmosphere, though its graphics are simple, is fun and upbeat. The game may not reap so much satisfaction for everyone, but I feel so triumphant and proud of those adorable, digital dogs when we win a particularly difficult race.\n\nI'm typically wary of Early Access games, but I've gotten more than my money's worth out of this game, and I'm not even close to getting bored. I'm happy to support the developers with whatever they choose to bring to Dog Sled Saga in the future.","March 3","true","28.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It is not yet finished but has already met my expectations in a sled dog game.  The graphics are retro flavored, caught between 8 and 16 bit style.  The dogs have so much personality in their faces (as well as their stats).  The game is fun to play, and while I would like to have more breeds to select from, and a deeper management of their stats, it is still a great game to spend a few hours on.  Cheering on your favorites, cursing when their faults kick in at the wrong time, and laughing because your favorite dog's favorite thing is.... snow.  Fun, adorable, easy to play.  Just don't expect a deep story or complex career mode.... not yet anyway.... they are still working on it, and I look forward to see what they add.... but the bottom line is this:\n\nEven in the state the game is in NOW, it is a FUN and UNIQUE game experience.

Your dogs all have certain talents, likes, faults, ect., so you'll have to decide which position on the team the dog gets in order to maximize it's abillities.  Everything is done with the mouse, making the game easy to control, and because of the simple gameplay, It's real easy to jump in and out of.

You click and hold the mouse button to initiate a variable trajectory with which you try and hurl dog biscuits into your awesome dog's mouth.  You'll know your dogs are hungry by their panting breath against the cold pixel-y wind.\n\nIt is actually quite easy to blunder this up.  First if you try and feed your dogs before they are hungry, it will comically bounce off their noggin and you'll have lost a doggy biscuit.  Second if you just clearly miss (some dogs seem to be better catchers than others) well then you're probably going to lose the race.  But sometimes you can miss because you aren't paying attention to the huge TREE INCOMING sign.\n\nSo what happens if your dogs are hungry?  Well, aside from going slow they trip up the works.  You'll have to, in real-time, adjust the length of rope dividing the dogs to make sure it has proper length to avoid getting tangled.  Outside of that, I'm not really sure.  I never went that far without feed my dogs.\n\nDog Sled Saga is surprisingly deep despite being pretty shallow.  All of the game can be controlled via the mouse and one mouse button.  You don't really need to tend to your dogs outside of the races, like a tamagotchi.  The only thing you need to concern yourself with is if they are tired and if they get along with other dogs on your team and what type of position they like to be in.\n\nDespite all of this, I did find myself becoming attached to my Dog Sled Saga team.  The pixel art is wonderful to watch and the music, my goodness the music.  It is great!  I mean, the music is 8-bit style, but it's SO WELL DONE.  Truly gets stuck in my head.\n\nI am a fan of Dog Sled Saga even though right now it seems kind of bare-bones.","December 9, 2014","true","0.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

There is no volume control on the music or sound effects - so you can either have them turned ON (and very loud), or OFF. There is no explanation as to what some of the more obscure options are ("Catch Cursor"? "Sharp scale"?). These should be explained simply so players know whether to turn them off or on.\n\nAlso, the other thing that really bothers me about this game are the dog breeds that you can choose from. Husky and Malamute are fine, but Labradors? St. Bernards? Schnauzers? Worst of all, Shih-Poos? Seriously? These breeds are NOT sled dogs by any stretch of the imagination, and they kind of break my immersion in enjoying the game when I see them on the "Hire Dog" list.\n\nThe game presents itself as otherwise somewhat "realistic" otherwise - I can't hire unicorns for my team, and I can't put rockets on my sled for speed boosts, plus there are weather and track conditions that affect my run - so having completely unrealistic dog breeds on my sled team really ruins it for me. I wish there was an option to only hire sled-appropriate breeds (and there are plenty actual dog breeds to choose from that are acceptable as sled dogs).\n\nSo this game needs a few serious tweaks - some improvements to the Options menu, some more dog breeds to choose from (and the removal of the ridiculous breeds or the option to filter them out in the Hire Dog menu), and possibly some other things to do besides run races. Some simple minigames to play with your dogs inbetween races would be fantastic.\n\nOtherwise, the game is enjoyable, and cute - a good way to spend some time, but it becomes repetitive quickly when all you can do is run races.","May 13, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Even though it seems simple at first, there are lots of different things that factor into races that make each one a challenge - especially when adding new dogs to your team or placing up in a higher league. There's more strategy involved than I first realized as well! As fun as this game is, though, I found it fairly easy, and after roughly 5 hours of gameplay I've managed to go as far as I possibly can with my current team. Despite that, this game is definitely worth the price, and I have high hopes that more things will be implimented before it leaves early access.\n\nPros:\n+ You have to interact/race with each individual dog to learn and unlock their quirks; the perfect dog just insn't handed to you (although more traits are visible when buying dogs in higher leagues)\n+ The dogs have personalities and can have rapport with teammates!\n+ Races truly seem randomized, don't think I've encountered the same course twice\n+ Weather and snow conditions affect the race!\n+ Refreshing breeds available. Never thought I'd see a Shih-poo or Schnauzer in a dog sled race!\n+ Lots of different fault, skills, and other quirks each dog can have\n+ Neat color choices for harnesses/names/accents for each dog\n\nCons:\n- Not very many breeds to choose from. Yes, there are 10 "different" dogs altogether, but three of those are just different colors of husky, not individual breeds. Greenland Dogs, American Eskimos, Alaskan Huskies, Pointers, Chows, Mutts even - there are plenty more breeds that are apt for racing that I'd love to see included!\n- You can't return/resell dogs once they're acquired. I feel like this would be a very good thing to add to the game, especially once you get to the higher leagues and find you have 12 dogs or so, five of which you don't race anymore because they have undesirable faults that keep you from winning a race. I hate seeing dogs "rot" away in the cabin with no use.\n- Only one save file. I know I personally would explore the game much more if I had three or so files to have different teams in!\n- No real plot/objectives. Race. Add dogs to your team to qualify for higher leagues. Then what? What happens after league seven? What else is there to do at Firebowl Kennels (not sure if correct name)? Winning race after race and sitting on over 200k with no end goal in mind gets boring after a while.","March 19, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game so much I'm such a dork. Anyway, this game is a must have for dog lovers, and animal lovers alike. I don't really like racing games to be honest, I find them usually boring. However the systems that Dog Sled Saga uses with each and every dog being different really brings out the best in this kind of game. Those adorable pixelated dogs just steal my heart as I worked to figure out where to put them all.\n\nMy favorite parts of the game are definitely those when learning more about the canines, and where they belong as I love the mystery element. It also allows the player to become more attached to the dogs, other than just being tools to boost your racing career. The graphics in general seem simple, but the way the dogs are animated puts them into perspective.\n\nVery minimal crashing for an Early Access game, thank god. I usually have huge trouble with EA since they usually crash a ton, and take forever to load. I've had the game crash on me maybe once or twice, but I never lost any progress in doing so. Along with this loading takes only a few seconds. They clearly care about the player's experiance.\n\nI love when racing with your dogs you have to manage them all, and that they have strengths and faults. It makes the game more challenging and allows for a better experiance for those who like the challenge. I failed my first few times horribly, but eventually got the hang of it.\n\nThere isn't exactly any story elements, and I don't really think there willbe, but it would be a nice addition. I alsoreally want to see even more dog breeds! I know it's a lot to ask, but non-sled dogs were added and knowing that, I am dying for a Pug, a Bloodhound, and a Beagle. Seriously please give pugs. I need pugs. Then I could name it after my pug who is currently trying to sleep. I would also really like to see more events, and things that happen to change up the game. Possibilities of your dogs getting sick and dying (morbid I know) if you don't take care of them well, and even certain things like tidbits of entrees talking about what a certain dog did or whatever.\n\nThe cons of the game reside mostly in the fact that it's a bit minimalistic right now, and still going on with development. This of course is to be expected though. However it can also get a tiny bit boring once you reach the top status. More things to do in game would fix this. One thing I dislike personally, is the skill meter and level meter going down over time. I know it's meant to be realistic and challenging, but it's disheartening when you work sohard only for their level to drop down to 0 again.\n\nOverall it's a really fun game and worth the price!

I love my dogs, and have unlocked every single hint available. I have around 11 dogs now, but the ones I use are;\nLead: Ranier (Malamute) or Owl (Normal Husky) | Middle: Bear (Yellow Lab), Comet (Chocolate Lab) , and Blizzard (Brown Husky) | Wheel: Mako (Saint Bernard) and Horizon (White Husky)\n\nExtremely fun game- was worth the money for me. My lead dog Ranier has an awesome skill that makes the whole team faster! All of my dogs are fantastic and their skills are pretty nice.\n(If you are a dog person like me, I would reccomend.)\n\n","December 29, 2015","true","77.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many races, dogs, and other fun little surprises along the way. But I think that you should be able to feed, groom, and play with your dogs. The only thing you can do with them is race. Other than that, I think this game and its graphics are awesome though.","December 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it's a simple game by design, it's challenging and deep enough to be rewarding. Definitely recommend.","December 26, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly complex in team management, you have to figure out who works well with who, and what conditions your dogs prefer. Totally worth every penny. I look forward to seeing how the developers continue to improve this amazing game.","November 29, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time you are trying to find out more about your dogs, and trying to become a better sledder. It's very repettative, but it's fun and relaxing. I love getting more dogs, and they all have their own specialties and things they like.","July 23, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
