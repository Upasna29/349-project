There are plenty of flash games on the internet that do this better, and of course for free. It's a very simple formula, and yet this game manages to mess it up.\n\n1.) First time running the game, I was treated to a splash screen advertising a different game by the same developer, complete with embedded youtube video. (I understand they were giving it away for an email address, but still guys, this is bad).\n2.) This was followed by a config window for resolution that can't be accessed from within the game.\n3.) Navigating the menus with the mouse was frustrating as the pointer displayed as higher on the screen than it really was. This meant having to guess where the volume bar was to lower it, and in some cases clicking the button above the one I wanted to click to get the desired effect.\n4.) The 'tutorial' level gives you controls, but doesn't really say what they do. I was plonked on a planet that I couldn't leave using thrust alone, instead having to toggle gravdrive first. I'm still not really sure what this actually did.\n5.) Those purple lines. Oh god those purple lines. These are horrific for three massive game-ruining reasons:\na.) They constantly move back and forward in a swaying motion, standing a really good chance of giving you a horrible headache after about 5 minutes.\nb.) As the lines are all parallel and always in the same direction, it makes it really difficult to accurately judge the boundaries of the area they surround. Just from the screenshots you can see this. Look at the stage in the shape of a 'W'. Where do the edges parallel with the lines even start? It's not where they're purple, because the space between them also kills you, and the lines are constantly shifting....\nc.) This is the worst part in my opinion - the purple-lined 'death zone' only kills you if you go a certain way into it, which isn't marked in any way whatsoever. From part of the trailer I thought that maybe just the purple lines themselves would kill you and you could maneouver between them, but this isn't the case. There is an arbitrary distance which you're allowed to travel over the lines. Worse still the game actually depends on this and gives you levels early on that require you to skip those gaps, with no way of knowing how far is too far.\n\nIt frustrates me that a game like this can make any money at all. Bugs can be forgiven, but this is just an absolute masterclass in terrible design.\n\ntl;dr - I spent more time writing this review than playing the game, and I also had more fun.","May 3","false","0.4"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","43","44","10","0"

If you wish to try your patience, you can hardly do better than this.\n\nThe premise is to move a rocket through space to a target. The challenge being that space, having no gravity, has no means by which to slow or stop your ship, other than its own rockets. So, you fire your ship's rockets to move, to slow, and to change direction. Generally pretty much all at the same time. Thus the challenge is great.\n\nYou do all these things in a contrived, shaped space. As such, not only must you do all the above pretty much concurrently, but you must stay within areas of unusual shapes and proportions. Only one level at the time is available for play (so far, at an early level), but 100 levels are available over the life of the game. You are attempting to succeed in reaching the target, but also with the best time and least fuel consumed. Thus, it's possibe to play with great caution, or "hell bent for leather", while consuming fuel rapidly. The feeling of success is substantial!\n\nThere is also a multiplayer aspect, which I haven't explored. For this price ($1.99US), you can hardly go wrong.\n\nHigh recommendation.","August 9, 2015","true","0.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","27","33","7","0"

While the goal of the missions is very straight forward: Get your rocket to the target destination while staying in the designated area. You can ignite your engines which will give you a speed boost but will also make you drift if you turn around and ignite again. There are no speed up and brake controlls just igniting of engine.\nGetting used to manoeuvering will take some time but once you eventually get used to it (and once you find out that you can touch and even move a bit into the non-allowed areas before getting destroyed) Gun Rocket turns out to be actually a quite nice and at times damn challenging game.","February 6","true","3.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

There are two additional abilities to consider: A shoot button which fires projectiles (not to damage anything...This isn't an arcade shooter, but to create "bumps" or push other objects out of the way) additionally there's a move which will make you imune to gravity for a very short time.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569605372\n\nThere's also Multiplayer, but you need to play on LAN.... and friends, so I wasn't able to try that part out at all.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569605525\n\nAchievements: There are no achievements for Gun rocket at this time. There is a scoring system, and if you wanted you could be competitive with other players online, or even friends.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569605423\n\nPrice Gun rocket is priced at $1.99, for a couple hours of entertainment, that's a fair asking price.\n\nConclusion: In a way Gun Rocket is a nod to some of the very earliest classic games, I found it much easier to play then astroids, but in all honesty I find the game lacking in motivation to keep me playing.\nI recomend this game to anyone who wants to play a minimalistic game for a few hours and then move on to play something else.","December 5, 2015","true","1.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

There are however, a few very fun and innovative levels, making use of a game mechanic called the "gravity drive" in which you can disable the gravity effects on your ship for a few seconds.\n\nOften times you need an extra arm to complete a level because when you press the button to start it, you die instantly unless your hands are already on your controls. I cut off someone else' arm and grafted it to my body, but you could probably just get a friend to help you.\n\nSome of the levels are also just balant lazy level design, made to meet the quota of 100 levels. Some levels also make you wait up to 8 seconds before you can even move.\n\nGood for a laugh I guess, don't reccomend wasting 25 cents on it though.","January 29","false","1.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","9","14","4","0"

Twenty-five cents was all it costed, and he bought it because he has no impulse control.\n\nI decided "what the hell" and decided to take a look at the game. My very first words were "what do i do" followed by "PURPLE SPACE STRIPES WHAT THE HELL". And thus began my descent into madness. It began simple; fly to the portal and avoid the majestic purple space stripes. It was a simpler time. But things began to pick up, as I realized three things.\n\n1. You can shoot purple space asterisks out of your face.\n2. You shoot white space asterisks out of your butt for propulsion.\n\nI failed to achieve thought number three, as I was dumbfounded by exactly what the hell my ship was supposed to be; an enigmatic green mountain with snow against the fluorescent stripes directly from the depths of hell. Eventually, the endlessly looping music gave me a new question; why do I have no hitbox? The purple space stripes are fickle mistresses; sometimes, you could fly deep into their embrace; other times, they'd simply tear my tiny little space mountain into tiny space mountain shreds.\n\nI then proceeded to punch my little brother in the face, and continued my adventure. All I could see now was planes of darkness, travelling across the purple space stripes. Travellers against the legions of hell. And as I flew, my little brother called the "space portal" a purple space hexagon, causing my final drop. I fell so far, that I pierced straight through hell, and found myself in the abyss.\n\nThe abyss of purple space stripes. That's about the time when, for the safety of my sanity and the entire universe at large, pulled the plug on my computer and lobbed it out a window.\n\nperfect 5 / 7, watch out for space asterisks and you'll be okay","January 25","false","0.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","58","14","24","22","0"

Simple... except there is no assistance. There is no gyroscope or breaking thrusters. Once you gain momentum you keep that momentum.\n\nOne thing I found odd is the only unlockable in the game was the final level. All other stages and levels, as well as 6 ship designs are available as soon as you start playing. This isn't really a bad thing, as it allowed me to skip more challenging stages and return to them later, as well as try out the different ships.\n\nSo if you enjoy a nice 2D space puzzle game with gravity challenges, this is a nice fit for you.

At this moment in time I not not gained any trading cards and am still hoping to gain them.\nThe game overall is a little bit lacking and lacks level design compaired to modern games. This game seems to be very far behing on graphics and the physics engine is not up to scratch. This game how ever is ok but is not worth actually playing. Simply purchase this game and leave it open. After 5-10 minutes trading cards will come knocking and you would have mad a mad profit of 10-20 p.\np.s you will have my you have my respect to purchase this game and leave it open for around 5-10 minutes to gain around about 10-20p.

Now the graphics are pretty simple. Also you don't have to land on a pad at a safe angle and velocity. You just need to make it to point A to B while avoiding the danger zones on each stage. Also you still need to maintain your fuel levels.\n\nThe nice thing about the game is that there is a couple of ships (I prefer to play as the top hat personally) with their own Properties and shape. This changes their thrusters and boosting power and how they can affectively change in the way the games space gravity work. The game also encourages you to either go and beat your time or beat a level with more fuel saved.\n\nIt is a simple game but once you get the hang of your preferred ship's thrusters you can get the hang of it and zip zap and zoom through space.","November 26, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novibear/recommended/391420/","novibear","Novibear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novibear/","912 products in account","This game is a redo of a classic game know as lunar lander. Now the graphics are pretty simple. Also you don't have to land on a pad at a safe angle and velocity. You just need to make it to point A to B while avoiding the danger zones on each stage. Also you still need to maintain your fuel levels.\n\nThe nice thing about the game is that there is a couple of ships (I prefer to play as the top hat personally) with their own Properties and shape. This changes their thrusters and boosting power and how they can affectively change in the way the games space gravity work. The game also encourages you to either go and beat your time or beat a level with more fuel saved.\n\nIt is a simple game but once you get the hang of your preferred ship's thrusters you can get the hang of it and zip zap and zoom through space.","November 26, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, just what it looks like.  A cheap physics puzzle game with exceptionally bad artwork.\n\nAnd the physics based thruster puzzles are not bad.  You can waste a few hours going through the levels.  Also the music is very decent.\n\nSo why am I not recommending it?  Didn't I know what I was signing up for?  Maybe I did.  Maybe the problem is with me, that when I saw this I was hoping for more rather than what it looked like at face value.  Ultimately I found the game not very fun.  The waving purple lines in the back really started to give me a headache.  The art was in this case so bad it became painful after a while.  Also, hidden in those terrible purple lines are hidden death zones that you just have to guess at.  Even the opening level does not really do much to teach you how to play and is a bit of messing with the controls to get past.\n\nThis game is what it appears to be, and nothing more.  If you don't get motion sick from the purple lines you might have fun with it.  I did not.\n\n4/10","May 14","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
