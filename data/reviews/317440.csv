After playing QR online for some time, I immediately bought QR Champions in early access tu support the devs. And as usual, I regret having bought an EA game... Here are some of the obvious flaws I've encountered, I've already listed that on the forum, and other players complained about them too, but it seems that the devs just don't give a damn about user feedback :\n\n- the menus with a gamepad don't work really well, it's OK sometimes, and other times it's a chore, almost impossible to navigate\n\n- the mouse cursor doesn't disappear when using a gamepad\n\n- there is absolutely no damage feedback, most of the time your shield and armor just suddenly disappear and you don't even know who or what hit you\n\n- primary weapon is useless, most if the time you just shoot the ground because the tracks aren't made to use this kind of weapon. Also you have to push the button each time you want to shoot... when it's supposed to be a rapid fire weapon.\n\n- "collisions" problems. And by collision I mean the hit detection of boosters and items. Sometimes you will take a booster even if you miss it by 2 meters, and sometimes you will be exactly on the booster but you're ship doesn't accelerate. Same for the pick-ups, I even saw an enemy behind me get the item I was going to take\n\n- there is absolutely no way to know what an item does, most of the time the icon sucks, and even when you use the item, you don't really know what it did\n\n- there is "that guy". You know "that guy" ? Almost every racing game has it, it's the nearly unbeatable ennemy that is always first, way ahead of the others for no reason because he is supposed to have the same ship, and seems completely cheated. Even when you get ahead of him, he manages to save and use all his energy at the end of the race to overtake you.\n\n- they removed the cash. In QR online, even when you lose a race, you earn some cash, so you didn't play for nothing. It's not the case here, and the game is so difficult that you'll have to restart again, and again, and agin, the exact same race, earning nothing, just to beat "that guy". The game becomes a useless grind really fast, except that there is nothing to grind...\n\n- stupid game modes. For example there is a mode where you have to grab packages on the track. Thing is, the AI doesn't seem programmed to do the same, so they just run a regular race, shooting each others and trying to reach the line first. And, as YOU have to kinda explore the track to find the packages, you will spend the entire race alone. It would be nearly impossible to grab the packages with the other guys around anyway...\n\n- death race sucks. Yup, generally death races in racing games are fun, really fun. Mario Kart, F-Zero, Gas Guzzlers Extreme, it's fun. Not here. Here it's a chore, too. First, for the reasons I already mentionned : primary weapon shooting straight into the ground, bad hitbox on items icons making you miss them all the time, weapons that do nobody-knows-what, and generally useless... you got the picture. But there are even more flaws I didn't talk about. For example I noticied that ennemies don't give a damn about their energy, they generally don't use the  blue tracks to regenerate it, but still they manage to be hard to kill. Also, you never know your position during a race like that : are you first with the most kills ? Where are you on the track compared to others ? Are you far behind and you have to boost to join them ? Generally, the AI manages to go really fast, using their boost like they don't have any energy limit, while happily shooting at each other to have a max of kills, and leting you far behind. They also take almost ALL the items, leaving you with nothing but useless ones, when you are already struggling to keep up with them. This makes the game absolutely not enjoyable, I re-started a death race like 10 times and the best I could do was 7th with 3 kills... IF you manage to got a good weapon that does some damage, it's generally not enough to kill a guy, you will just damage him enough to allow another ennemy to kill him...\n\n- the upgrades we win makes no sense : why do they seem weaker than the base equipement ?\n\n- most of the musics really suck, I deactivated it after 2 or 3 races. But the game is even more boring without it... I have nothing against electro, it's generally the norm for futuristic racing games, but those ones just suck.\n\nWell I could go on and on listing everything wrong with the game, but it takes time and I have better games to play. I've waited for months for them to correct the flaws of early access, and they kinda did nothing ( well at least they corrected the menus with the pads... ). Too bad, QR Online really seemed to have the potential to bring back the old F-Zero and Extreme-G feeling. Seems like we're not gonna play a good like like these on PC for a long time...","December 5, 2014","false","9.3"," 56 of 69 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","56","69","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/317440/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2487 products in account","This game is really hard to recommend as it stands.\n\nTo sum up this game simply, it's basically a Wipeout clone. For those unfamiliar, Wipeout is a game originally released for Playstation systems. It's a "futuristic" racer that excelled with strong AI and great mechanics. This game wants to be a spiritual succesor on the PC, but it doesn't quite get there.\n\nThat's not to say it's entirely awful. It looks very good. While the tracks lack oomph or big moments, they're fine and the art designers should be proud of the work they did on this game. There's one track that goes into an underwater tunnel and I liked the way the tube was designed. Things like sound effects and music, while not spectacular, do the job and do not take away from the experience. I also liked the weight that the vehicles seemed to feel. Turning was not cumbersome and for the most part bar one key gripe, "driving" was well done.\n\nWhere this game truly suffers is in races, which for a racer is obviously a really big problem. AI is bland and the lack of depth really hurts the game. I found myself bored quickly, and considering how high I hold the aforementioned Wipeout, this really sapped my interest in Quantum Rush. The lack of a multiplayer mode hurts replayability as single player races, despite varying modes (i.e. Death Match/Courier/Career etc) just don't feel fleshed out or interesting at all. Another aspect I found really tough to adjust to was I never felt the speed. The odometer reads over 800 km/h and it just doesn't seem like you're going that fast. There's a variety of different weapons you pickup over a course, but they lack any pizazz or help keep the race interesting. It would have also been nice to have an intro/tutorial immediately upon starting the game, but this gripe would've been overlooked if the final product itself was better.\n\nAll in all I cannot recommend Quantum Rush for a purchase. If you find it as a part of a bundle, I'd say to go ahead and give it a whirl, but the lack of depth really makes me doubt I'll bother with it ever again.","June 9, 2015","false","1.7"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","0"

My initial impressions with this game were high but quickly sank soon after as I became bored and frustrated as a result of the game's odd design decisions.\n\nPros:- Beautiful game\n- Runs smoothly\n- Music is good I guess (nothing for or against it)\n- Normal race event is fun\n\nCons:- No Dpad support is a huge oversight. Using RS for the menus is annoying and slow and using it for the hex grid in-game race menu up is a g0ddamn nightmare\n- Unskippable race intros, if you have to repeat a race get ready to re-watch the intros for the umpteenth time.\n- Unenjoyable and frustrating race events.\n- Extremely obtuse item pick ups. Whenever you pick-up an item you'll be left with this exact thought "What did that do?"\n- Collision detection feels off at times, I missed quiet a few pick-ups, bumped into walls while on the ceiling exiting a tunnel which reduces your speed and in one event causes your boost timer to restart.\n- Boss battles are garbage, boss gets a 3+ second lead and you have to drive through certain rings to send shock blasts until you catch up as pick-up are restricted for bosses.\n- Game lacks attention to details making the races feel rather dull. During some races you drive over water or sand and there's not even a particle of water or dust kicking up or spreading out from the base of your vehicle. You might as well be driving over metal.\n- AI is the perfect cheater, it takes corners at full speed disregarding the brakes entirely without even bumping into the walls. They sometimes however crash into walls so I don't know.\n\nVerdict:This game needed more time and play testing to figure out the quirks. Now before anyone says you're only judging it so harshly because you played WipeOut. Let me say this, I never played a Wipeout or F-zero game. The only futuristic racing game I played and loved was Roll Cage, Roll Cage: Stage 2. Those games were the sh!t and this game lacks everything that made those games fun. If you can deal with all the cons then get it, if not then forget it look somewhere else.","February 9, 2015","false","2.5"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","27","29","4","2"

No disappointments here! During my first play I was blown away by how fast the gameplay moves. It took me a good two hours to place in the top 3 on the first campaign race. This racer will not hold your hand--it is meant to be hard and doesn't seem to be geared towards casual players!\n\nI recommend this racer to enthusiasts, anyone that loves futuristic racers, and combat racing fans.\n\nGetting a few good shots on the racer in front of you and watching him explode is a great feeling. This game offers all kinds of powerups to help with that.\n\nQuantum Rush is skill based; there is no auto-aim or instant kill of other racers. You will need to earn your kills. Between aiming your main gun and powerups you will also need to manage heat and energy levels. If your car overheats it explodes. You can shoot your main gun all you want but the heat adds up quickly. Boosting uses up your energy and it seems that once your energy is depleted your racer moves noticeably slower.\n\nThe powerups provide a great feeling of satisfaction. The smoke powerup is one of my favorites. In most racers it seems like the vision impairment powerups don’t really impair the other drivers all that much. In this game when a racer uses the smoke powerup you better get out of the way, the smoke is very thick and will has immediate consequences on any unfortunate racer that attempts to drive in the smoke.\n\nAs you win races you are awarded with the ability to customize your car. Don’t like the main gun you have? No problem, swap it out for one that is suites your playstyle. Change out all kinds of parts to make the racer fit your play style.\n\nThe sound effects are okay but they feel a little bit hollow and more variety is needed. A game like this really needs lots of cool futuristic sound effects that have a lot of oomph, and even some bass, to them. The music tracks are also lacking, they are fairly short and don’t quite fit the tempo of the game. As for animation, some of the animations are a little awkward. Flying off a rock ramp in the desert at high speeds looks a little bit awkward, doesn't feel like gravity is working the way it should yet.\n\nI play using a usb xbox 360 controller. I think controller will stay my preferred method of play, this feels right for a controller.","November 13, 2014","true","7.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Quantum Rush Champions, at first, seemed promising, a spiritual successor to Wipeout, on the PC, with some cool ideas. But the game does not want me to like it. It actively resists such attempts.\n\nA heavy chicane series in the third track. Until engines and boosters are upgraded, races are a tedious slog to, at best, a silver. Weapon pickups have a hitbox a third the size of the boost pads, and the same goes for the packages of Courier mode. Weapons, for the most part, rely on either perfect straights, or getting close to other racers (Which is somewhat difficult when said racers have upgrades you do not. Like engines and boosters.) What is worse still, my upgrades in one tier count for... Nothing beyond being able to beat *that* Tier, of *that* campaign, with *that* craft. And Time Trial times require not only those upgrades, but a flawless line.\n\nI want to like Quantum Rush Champions. But it doesn't let me. Needing multiple attempts and specific unlocks to achieve even a silver medal is not fun. Needing to do it every racing class is not fun. In short, though I had high hopes for this game since Quantum Rush Online... This game has too high a difficulty curve, with too much grind, for it to be fun.

A lot of the negative reviews seem to spawn from having Wipeout-like expectations towards a 10-euro-game. That´s just unrealistic. For its price, the game is really good.\nThe feeling of speed is great, and while some things tend to be a bit annoying, it makes them feel extra rewarding when you finally manage to win. This would be different if you´d be penaltied for things you have no influence on, but especially boss levels that feel unbeatable and unfair at first become very easy once you figure out the best strategy. For example, if a boss has strong forward-directed weapons, it might best to stay close behind him and overtake him just before the finish line. Or, on tight, twisting tracks, you might be able to get an advantage by using all your boost immediately so you are always one turn ahead and lock-on weapons or straight missiles can´t hit you.\nThe only thing the game really lacks is motion blur. But that may still come in a future update.\nOverall, I´d definitely recommend this game if you look for a rather cheap, fun, futuristic racing game.","December 5, 2014","true","30.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Boasting a Career Mode with 9 different challenge (race mode) types, 21 Bosses and 14 racing tracks, a considerable amount of time will be required to see everything this game has to offer.\n\nGameplayCareer Mode\nCareer mode starts with choosing one of three racer Manufacturers. Ion Energy Systems specializes in racers with extraordinary shields. Nitroid Racing focuses on improving their racers' boosters while Nanofabric Motorworks aims to produce the most balanced and steady racers. After choosing a Tier (racer), 6+ different Challenge types must be completed in order to progress. Each subsequent Tier (7 Tiers for each manufacturer) is unlocked by achieving a required number of medals and defeating the Tier's Boss. These medals are received upon fulfilling certain challenge requirements. The following 9 challenge types are listed below.\n\nChallenge Types:\nAgainst the Clock: Every few seconds, the last-placed player will be eliminated\nCourier: Collect as many packages as possible\nDamage Control: Don't take any damage in order to increase top speed\nDeathmatch: Eliminate as many enemies as possible\nDefeat the Enemy: Destroy target enemy as fast as possible\nHit the Target: Pass through rings and finish as fast as possible\nSingle Race: Fight for the best placement\nTime Trial: Beat the best time\nBoss Race (Career Mode only)\nThroughout the race, an on-board weapon can be used to shoot enemies down. These weapons are part of random awards received at the end of each successful challenge. Some of the weapons include pulse-fire shooters or lasers. Due to the curvature of the track and the weapons' inability to lock-on, it can be very difficult to effectively utilize them. To supplement this, pickup items at designated locations are also provided for support. Three items can be carried at once and toggled for situational use. Unfortunately, these items can not be fired backwards (excluding mines). Some of the items include: armor, shields, lock-on rockets, AOE fire and straight-fire rockets. Although using these items are crucial to success, the hitbox for the pickup items are rather small. Even though they are presented as holographic squares that are the size of an average racer, a direct collision through the center of the item is required for it to register as received.\n\nArcade Mode\nArcade mode provides freely configurable challenges to allow customized races. Every challenge type is available for modification with the exception of boss races. The race parameters that can be altered are listed below.\n\nArcade Settings:\nRace Track\nDirection: Forwards or Backwards\nNumber of AI Opponents\nAI Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, Nightmare\nNumber of User Respawns\nNumber of AI Respawns\nChallenge Specific Settings: Boost Time, Elimination Time, Packages etc.\nPresentationGraphics\nThe graphics and aesthetics for QRC is very similar to other high octane/anti-gravity racers. A futuristic feel is generated with the use of the darker spectrum of the color palette and many vertical lines, imitating a sense of traveling through tubes, tunnels or wires. The tight level design helps create a sense of speed. QRC is a far cry from the common indie graphics seen in many shovelware that utilize the most basic native engine assets.\n\nHUD\nThe HUD presents three different meters located at each corner of the screen (Energy, Speed, Heat) and an armor meter with 3 item pickup icons located at the top. Due to the nature of the high speed racing and intense action, it can be very difficult to look away from the center of the screen to observe the various meters. A more centralized location with the 3 meters in a condensed form would allow for more effictive utilization.\n\nControlsController Support\nAlthough QRC has full controller support, this game should have went through more QA testing to fix all of the minor grievances observed while playing with a controller. One such grievance is the fact that the controller does not work on the title menu. Continuing with the troubles, the item toggle button is mapped to a very difficult to reach location and re-mapping it causes the "Summary/Detail/Custom" options to be unusable with any other mapped button. Also, the Alt-Tab feature has caused the game to freeze multiple times.\n\nRacer Handling\nEven with these minor annoyances, the handling of the racers during gameplay is fairly fluid. The racer is responsive enough to the analog control and the two airbrakes sufficiently allow for fine turning around sharp corners.\n\nConclusionCurrent State of the Game\nThe current state of the game may be a bit troubling to some players. The developers seemed to have moved on from this game to their other IPs. It's been exactly one year from this review's posting since an official update was published; Steam News announcements involve GameArt's newer titles. A quick look through the Steam Discussions will reveal a lack of developer-authored posts. What the game has to offer in this state is essentially its "complete" form.\n\nVerdict\nWith everything taken into consideration, Quantum Rush Champions is only recommended to those that are fans of anti-gravity single-player racers. The minor bugs and problematic UI navigation can be forgiven, but the lack of online multiplayer/local coop and continued updates will be difficult for many veteran gamers to accept.\n\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn","May 21","true","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The devs are apparently fixing the menus and still working on the AI.  Currently, it takes a tiny bit of tweaking to actually get the game working smoothly enough to be playable on my computer (starts in windowed mode, has major framerate drops), and the control customizations are not saved between game sessions.  The menu screens are very unresponsive, and the loading screens take a very long time.\n\nThe racing feels pretty close to Wipeout or FZero.  That's what I expected.  I'm going to enjoy this game once it gets polished a little and has its major bugs worked out.  I recommend waiting until the game is more playable before buying it, but if you want to take a leap of faith, go ahead and buy it while it's on sale.

It took a negitive review video for me to realise how massively flawed Quantum Rush Champions is, it's got numerous balancing issues, the difficulty is straight up broken in some areas, requiring expliots of the game mechanics to complete a challenge and that isn't fun, I thought it was my fault, that I wasn't good enough at first, but my patience began to drain and this negitive review was the last straw.\n\nQRC has the potential to be pretty gosh darn fantastic, it has the solid foundation of a lovely anti-gravity racing game, but it's got more flawed mechanics than a chop shop that damage it at it's core and ultimately kill it.\n\nA new hope.\nIf Quantum Rush Champions is ever fixed by Game Art Studios, who are parading the success of it's other games on the news page of this one that's in desperate need of QA testing, then I'll be the first to let you know, if you really want to scratch your WipEout itch, go invest in Formula Fusion by R8 Games, even in it's early access stage it's showing potential to be one of the greatest Anti-Gravity Racing Games in recent history.","December 13, 2015","false","68.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","14","22","3","1"

It seems to be inspired by Wipeout rather than F-Zero due to it being a car combat, the style of machines, and the fact they have different brands of machines and each are very different stat wise and would infulence you to drive each one of them differently. Currently they have a few different challanges varying from simple single races, timed eliminations, deathmatches, and a speed mode where you are reqired to drive around the track perfectly and quickly to gain speed boosts that stack and will go away if you hit a wall. So far its pretty stable only had two crashes, lags a little at times, looks pretty good, and it has enough content to get your moneys worth for five bucks. The track themes vary from a beach, undergound pipes, a city, and space. I'd like to see an area themed around a floating city or a track in the sky in general. This game is in early access and I'd like to see much more content such as more tracks, game modes, and maybe decaling your machines.","November 8, 2014","true","24.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Especially when you consider its indie price tag.\nFor those who insist on drawing comparisons to other games -\nF-Zero focuses more on speed and wide, flowing tracks, WipEout focuses more on technical tracks with tight handling and narrow roadways. QR is a happy middleground. It feels competitive with F-Zero in terms of pace, but has some more technical tracks that feel more remiscent of WipEout.\n\nGameplay is well paced and deep enough to keep players engaged for a while, without being overly complicated to deter new players. There are plenty of game modes that keep the game varied and interesting. Track variety is still expanding at the time of writting. With over 10 tracks, each of which with a forward and reverse variant, the game is already ahead of most WipEout titles.\nControl-wise the Racers feel a bit stiff. Other AG Racers tend to have more ice-like vehicle handling but here the vehicles behave like they were superglued to the road. Hopefully this is something that Game Art Studio will address in the future.\nIt's also interesting to note that this games Airbrakes cause the vehicles to rapidly decelerate, which is rare for this sort of game.\n\nRacer variety is disappointing. The vehicles are divided by tier, and they plan to have 10 tiers in the finished game, which should be cool. Unfortunately, there are only 3 vehicles per tier to choose from, which just isn't enough variety. Race grids quickly become samey and boring. Compared to any other racing game, 3 Racers is a tiny selection.\n\nKeyboard controls are impossible to use, so I strongly recommend using a controller. The Controller configuration is excellent and as a former WipEout player, I found them instantly recognisable.\n\nVisually the game is very nice. Nothing amazing, but you'd be hard pressed to complain. When you're flying past scenery at 1,000Km/H or more it doesn't really matter.","February 23, 2015","true","44.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dopebear/recommended/317440/","Dopebear","「Dropb∆re」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dopebear/","127 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDecent in concept in general except for some flaws.\n\nBosses rubber band hard. You hit everything and not miss a single boost and eventually get ~3 seconds ahead of them? Haha don't worry, they'll be right up your back-side any second now to smash you from 100% to 0% armour in no time with their overpowered and limitless weapons.\n\nThe free/basic weapons every ship has are nigh-useless and a waste of time and distraction. Should limit all weapons to pick-ups only.Destroying pickups should replenish some of your armour--as far as I've seen there isn't any way to replenish your armour aside from being destroyed.\n\nHard to recommend this game, it really is. It's still in early access but these games rarely fly off well over time. I really want a futuristic racer (anti-grav), I really do. But taking a game like this seriously only slaps your face.\n\nTo the devs; play and take note of the WipEout series. The closer to this you'll be, the better.\n\nUpdate: 10/11/2014\n\nStill no way to replenish armour--again, unless I'm somehow missing something.\n\nAirbreaks are still pointless if you do more than just tap it. If you ever hold it in you'll do much more harm than good.\n\nAI racers seem to never airbreak and seem to turn around every corner at full speed while players need to perfect the track in their mind and muscle-memory to ever come close. High-turn tracks are nigh-impossible to come first place in.\n\nThe game seems more and more to be a achieve first-place in the first 10 seconds of the race and maintain it or you'll never get it. So many times I get first place very quickly and hold it with no competition at all. Not a single thing hits me or comes close. Here I am at first place with the second racer ~5 seconds behind with all the other racers fighting eachother and keeping eachother back while I'm boosting ahead and hitting every boost.\n\nThere's no come-back mechanic at all. Because once first place has first place and gets a couple second advantage, it's over. Second, third and so on keep fightning and smashing eachother to just keep first place in first place.Not a single weapon/pick-up helps this at all. There are just a handful of close-quarter weapons.\n\nUpgrades for your craft are too few and far inbetween. Especially since each tier has their own set of gear/unlocks. The system should be in points and you get points after every race you complete and you pick what you want to level up. Want more speed? Upgrade your engines. Want a stronger hull? Upgrade your hull. So on and so on. Not this random, rare drops that don't even seem to change much to begin with. By the time you finish a tier you have a few unlocks where some things are still stock-standard.\n\nThe basic/free weapons that every ship has all the time are awful and very distracting. Again, these really should be removed. They do very little damage and if you ever plan on hitting something, you'll be focusing mostly on aiming and shooting rather than racing. These are a really bad idea and I struggle to think of any good idea (let alone concept) as to why people would this this is a good idea, then add it in and then actually keep it in. It'd baffle me if anybody actually likes these.\n\nThe vehicles release a constant black smoke when they're low in hull/armour which constantly fills out ~90% of the track with black smoke. Makes it impossible to properly race if you're anywhere behind them since the smoke trail is very long and lasts a long time. Covers most of the width of your average track.\n\nThere's no minimap either which is another con.\n\nConclusion: Game is still very frustrating and painful to play. It isn't a casual game and seems as if the devs don't want for it to be. This just makes the game extremely more annoying to take seriously at all. So, game still sucks at this date. Game is riddled with cons with very few pros. Don't buy it.\n\nThere was some content patch recently. Didn't seem to do much but add some content (ie ships and tracks) I've noticed the main menu mid-race actually pauses now. Prior the race would still go on.\n\nAlso nice that the shills of the game keep thumbing this down with their alt accounts (yeah I know who you are)\n\nThis makes me want to plug my PS3 back in and play the only good anti-grav racer: WipEout.\n\nDo note: I'll be deleting and resubmitting this review since a particular friend of the dev kept spamming the same negative comment to this game review for over a week while making an alt account every day just to thumb my review down. This kind of attitude is sickly and this is all I can do about it.\n\nSaid person is monitoring and policing all reviews and forum posts about this game and can not take a single hint of negativity for this game. A shame yet another game is riddled with devs and friends of devs that can't take critcism at all. This has never brought anything good in the long run. Only cancerous people.\n\nEDIT: Grammar","November 10, 2014","false","2.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Though the engine is stable, nice-looking, and generally very functional, there is little depth or challenge to the movement physics, leaving even casual fans I've introduced the game to playing dull, easy races. Though I certainly applaud the developers for trying something new, the addition of heat tracking, a permanent rapid-fire weapon, and the ability to pick up and store three weapons instead the traditional one adds little to the game as they are currently implemented, instead cluttering what has proven to be a very focused and effective formula in other series.\n\nMy experience playing a number of Wipeout and F-Zero games has colored my opinion, without question, but the fact of the matter is GameArt Studio are making a game in a subgenre that has produced some of the best racing games ever created, and that's hard to live up to, no matter who you are. Unfortunately, the current state of the game, though technically solid, lacks a focused enough design to make an impression, not only in the hovercraft-racing subgenre, but the racing genre as a whole. I would be more than willing to give future builds a second chance if the design moves toward expanding unexplored elements of the genre, instead of the current design, which seems little more than "What was done before, but with more stuff tacked on."","October 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","4"

But execution (like always) is where is really resides. I mean I could love a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics game with awesome execution much more than a poorly executed fancy graphics game (which is this).\n\nIt's a futuristic racer/shooter. Kind of like Crash Team Racing or Mario Kart. Here's the pros & cons:\n\n+ Nicely designed futuristic setting on levels (seriously)\n+ Nicely and DEEPLY designed vehicle customization that is consistent with the futuristic theme. What I mean is, your vehicle has multiple parts that affect your racing;\n\n1) Engine: How fast you will go\n2) Booster: How good is your situational turbo (press for extra speed)\n3) Weapons: How much damage do they inflict\n4) Cooler: All of that ♥♥♥♥ above creates heat. Gotta cool it all down.\n5) Energy: All of that ♥♥♥♥ above consume energy. Your energy depot size\n6) Armor: How many hits you will take before you explode\n7) There is more that I can't remember right now.\n\n^ See all of that, you don't see in every race game. Nice execution there.\n\n+ Diverse weapons types: They are fun to use, I'll give em that.\n+ Diverse vehicle types AND the vehicle manufacturers. I mean they might have just created 3 vehicles and released the damn game. No, there is like 15 vehicles.\n+ Sound effects and menu music is nice. Didn't like the race music.\n+ Diverse race types (elimination, destroy target, destroy all, race, timed, head2head, etc.)\n\nOK... cons:\n\n- THERE IS NO TUTORIAL. Come on. Do I really need to check the damn options screen? The very first time I load the game? Really? To see what button does what in the game? Seriously who does that? I'll tell you who. ME (because I'm a perfectionist maniac) BUT HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO USE THOSE BUTTONS? I may know what the shooting button is. But wtf am I shooting at? What weapon does what? WTF is a booster? When and how am I gonna utilize it for best performance? WTF is going on in general? Serious flaw, no tutorial.\n\n- Uh, opponents are really fast? I mean, maybe I'm doing it wrong (cos I'm still at the exploration period) but as soon as the race starts, everyone except me, vanishes into the horizon with incredible speed. And I'm left at the back, holding my ♥♥♥♥ in my hand and pushing the accelerator and the booster and hoping that I'll catch up with them before the race ends. Seriously I haven't been able to win a single race since I started playing. Maybe I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. My best position was 3, and I was pushing it AND I was extremely lucky too.\n\n- Um, gay music. The race music I mean. The menu was nice but the race music is really bad.\n\nI am going to be able to give this game a sad 6/10. Could have been executed much much better, because the idea and the theme is great. I love racer/shooters, there aren't many good ones around. Well I think you might be better off downloading Crash Team Racing from a PSX iso site, and playing it with your controller. Because this ♥♥♥♥ is hard.","October 28, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

But damn, it gets fast.\n\nGame currently has 7 tiers of racecrafts (each faster than the previous)\n\nIt has all the classic modes you can imagine, death match, classic race, time attack and it also has a boost race which gets insanely fast.\n\nThe new batch of circuits and game modes is great but some suffer from significant FPS drops in modern systems that should be able to handle this game without a problem, once you go tier 5 and up, the pace completely changes, circuits are 3 times bigger and have a lot of loops and corkscrews, different paths and obstacles to avoid.\n\nTier 7 reaches the 1800 km/h without boosting.\n\nNew game modes include a thread the needle checkpoint race, a deathmatch variant with objectives, a package pickup race (whoever picks up more wins) and new varied boss battles.\n\nWARNING: GAME IS CURRENTLY BROKEN AND DEVS DON'T SEEM TO CARE AND MOVED ONTO OTHER PROJECTS.","October 20, 2014","false","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
