"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110425861/recommended/321490/","76561198110425861","DRUSUFFA","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110425861/","52 products in account","I recommend this game even though it will take me quite some time to conquer the control physics.  This game is not for amatuers..... I have some real life riding experience and know that I cant just expect to jump on a 1000cc race bike on some track and expect to be instantly good at it.  This game requires experience and knowledge of bike control ie keeping the bike stable using weight transfer via correct braking and acceleration techniques.  You can be an absolute gun at car racing games but do not think this will make you instantly good at this game, the only skills transferrred here are knowledge of racing line; controlling your vehicle is much more complex here.  The difficulty in mastering bike control is as with all racing games not being able to feel the virtual traction but on top of that you are unable to feel the virtual weight transfer making it a constant learning experience corner to corner.  If you have some track experience on motorcycles or extensive road biking you will be able to adapt your skills/knowledge in this game but as I have found\nstill may struggle to ajust to virtual physics: THIS WILL TAKE TIME TO CONQUER!!!\n\nLOVE the burnout dynamics ;D  If your the kinda racer who gets frustrated stack after stack, take a breath, get back on the bike and let roar with some AWSOME smokin' of the back wheel letting loose into some stompin "wheelies" and finish up mastering the "Stoppy" for some side fun.  Adds more thrill to sometimes frustrating "neck-break" racing.\n\nI congratulate the dev team for the bike control physics; NAILED IT!!! Possibly as close as you will get without actually real world biking.\n\nTo those who have given a negative review for reasons such as control........ READ ABOVE and understand this game requires EXTENSIVE BIKE knowledge, maybe sit for a real world learners permit to help understand bike control.\nFor anyone with real world biking experience this will be a blast and give you an avenue for letting loose riding like you never should on the open roads unless you have a death wish of course.\nConstant practice in this game may even help for real world riding giving that you can open the throttle all the way without the risk of death or wrecking your beloved road beast, ultimately getting a feel for high speed track control.  All without needing a track permit and a billion bucks to afford the costs of racing.\n\nThis game is for anyone who is a bike enthusiast and wants a more life like gaming experience.... Riding in this game is not at all like jumping on the many bikes of GTA or SAINTS ROW........\nFor anyone who just loves racing games, give this game time.... practice, practice, stack and more practice.  I definately will be..... saves stacking in the real world :D\n\nSOME TIPS:\n\n* Change views,  Ive found that the on bike first person view is more forgiving for cornering control.....\n\n* REMOVE majority of riding assists, really get full control of the bike,  also doing burnouts is heaps better :p\n\n* Use of both brakes is important for getting the correct shift in weight transfer as is the weight transfer on stick (JOYSTICK)\n\n* XBOX controller recommended for the analogue acceleration and braking..... Could not imagine attempting with the digital touch of the keyboard\n\n* Ride MANUAL, who in the real world races with an AUTOMATIC!!! If you want full control this is a must...\n\n* YOU ARE NOT VALENTINO ROSSI, dont expect to win every race..... be persistant with racing and accept track position if you stack, get back on the bike an finish the race.  Winning will come with practice... (I really need to follow my own advice here, Stack, restart race, stack, gain good position, stack, F***, restart race)","November 28, 2014","true","8.1"," 59 of 77 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","59","77","0","0"

In garage graphics pre 1990!!! very bad, track and bike detail 14years old. Very glad i went for this instead of thr full game, i was so looking forward to a new bike sim, the reviews for the 2013 game was also bad so i missed\nit.  Downloaded the demo for this game but it never worked, i think if it did they would never get any sales.\nGive it up Milestone compress it for the Android market or other hand held and dont try this again.","December 27, 2014","false","0.5"," 16 of 43 people (37%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","37","16","43","3","1"
