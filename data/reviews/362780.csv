"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GT3x24x7/recommended/362780/","GT3x24x7","GeeTee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GT3x24x7/","312 products in account","Ok let's get it straight, right up front - this is an early 2011 game, not 2015 like it says on the Steam store page. It came out before Euro Truck Simulator 2 and was the last of SCS Software's "18 Wheels of Steel" series.\n\nThe second thing to straighten out is the price. The game is still sold by the publisher[www.extremetrucker2.com] for $9.99, and you can also find it cheaper on a number of competing game services[www.cheapshark.com]. For that reason alone, you might consider avoiding the Steam version unless you have a good reason to spend the extra $$$.\n\nThirdly, this is not, and doesn't pretend to be, a simulator. There's no company management, no truck ownership, no in-depth parts system or truck customisation, no job market, no drivers to hire - almost none of the sim/management aspects that are usually part of an SCS trucking game. The physics are reasonable, if a little dated, and notably the game runs a little faster than reality to provide a sense of speed (there are ways to turn this down ;).\n\nRather, the game is all about the challenge - pitting your driving skills and quick wits against the elements of harsh weather, rough and unpredictable terrain, pressing deadlines and the occasional kamikaze tuk-tuk. Jobs are chosen from a list and you are teleported to the departure point and sat in the driver's seat with your next load all hooked up. It's a game of quick jobs, though I don't see that as a bad thing per se.\n\nNonetheless, I found it to be quite enjoyable. There's plenty of variety offered by the game's five locations - South Australia, Bangladesh, Yungas Road, Montana and the Tuktoyaktuk Ice Road - plus you get to drive a wide range of trucks from small pantecs to six-trailer behemoths, and the loads themselves are also varied, interesting and even outrageous.\n\nThe quick job structure makes it a game that's very easy to jump into and run one or two jobs, then hop out and do something else for a time. With no career to tend to, it's very much a pick-up-and-play title.\n\nSure, the physics model is dated, and the graphics too, but not so much that they're jarring, and that simplicity means it runs very nicely on a modern rig. I also did not encounter any serious bugs, crashes or glitches throughout the 30 hours it took to complete the game.\n\nThe game is good, as long as you know what you're getting for your money. If you played it back in the day like I did, then definitely pick it up for the nostalgia value. If you're coming to the game for the first time and like the idea of a job-based, challenge-based pick-up-and-play trucking game, then go for it! If you're looking for a more fully featured trucksim however, skip this and consider Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator instead.","March 21","true","30.3"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","2"

Heck no. Maybe if it were 5.00 or free, and even then your better off playing with a yoyo or staring at the ceiling. I thought, oh this was released in 2015 it must be better than the first one. Nope. Only thing different is different maps and locations, no better graphics, no better vehicles, and definitely not better controls. what a rip off. Worst 360 controller interface I have ever experienced, and based on that I can't imagine what just a keyboard is like. You looking for something similar to the TV show and driving around on skinny roads with death defying drops? Well look elsewhere because every road is a solid 2 lanes and you can take the whole game at the top speed without breaking a sweat. Theres even guard rales on every road!!! Get euro truck simulator if you are looking for something decent, do not get ripped off with this unless for some reason you can't get ANY other game on steam. This has the quality of a 90's era game and that is an insult to 90's era games.","June 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","32","61","8","1"
