However, I can only recommend it to people who have already played those games, really love the art style of Heroes of Might and Magic 2, and enjoy the gameplay of the original King's Bounty and Heroes 1 and 2. This game is like the original King's Bounty ported into the Heroes 2 engine. If that sounds good to you, then this game is worth it. But keep in mind that it doesn't have any of the improved features and gameplay of the later Heroes games or the new King's Bounty games.\n\nFor people who haven't played the games that inspired this one or are new to turn based strategy games, play the Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty games first. They're a bit more expensive but they go on sale often and even at the normal price, they're worth their value.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap\n-Lovely art style very reminiscent of Heroes 2.\n-Wide variety of spells, creatures, and artifacts.\n-Easy to learn.\n-Addictive gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-Bugs and occasional crashes.\n-Not a lot of resolution settings.\n-No manual of any kind.\n-Interface is somewhat clunky.\n-No mini-map or world map. This becomes quite frustrating after you've explored a good chunk of the world.\n-While there are a lot of creatures, many of them are very similar and only differ in small statistical ways.\n-The difficulty can skyrocket if you move too slowly, get lost, or backtrack too much.\n-Lacks a lot of the features and gameplay improvements of Heroes games after 2 and the new King's Bounty games. And I'm talking about simple things like a wait option in combat.","August 12, 2015","false","7.3"," 75 of 101 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","75","101","3","16"

It doesn't interfere with the gameplay but it does detract from any immersion.\n-Sometimes lacks intuitive controls and tooltips, like using the space bar to skip a turn or hovering over a button to see what it does.","August 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","37","52","2","3"

This could be achieved by placing a certain amount of lootable resources on one part of the game, which are then used to get through battles - some players needing less and some needing more of them... or then by adding something else entirely.\n\nProgress is impossible if you explore or backtrack "too much".. or honestly, even if you just fight all the battles as the enemies start to overwhelm you in no time. Too bad you might notice this too late when you've already spent a good while on a playthrough.\n\nI'll be trying it again after some updates.","August 12, 2015","false","4.5"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","30","44","0","1"

Its a kings bounty-like. If that makes any sense and in that same sense its also completely the wrong build for what they are doing.\n\nThe developer argues that the game is "Hardcore" but hardcore also means this game is frustrating to a point where you can actually cause yourself to be put into a fail state in the game within the first hour of playing and have to go back to a prior save.\n\nThe game isnt fun and thats the biggest problem. It isn't fun. It works, everything operates everything works as it should (I guess. The developer says it does and I dont find it amusing) but this is the problem. The developer keeps saying "Oh its suppose to be hardcore! Its suppose to be challenging!" Its not. Its just frustrating to play.\n\nExample:\nYour character does gain any meaningful troops until unlocking a part of the map that has better troops. You must complete a quest to get money on a daily basis. When you do this you can afford the troops and then slay more enemies. In the game you can pick up treasure chests and gold, you can put the chests into either XP or gold. Not knowing you should actually pick the gold for a majority of the times in the early game you can render yourself too broke to buy new troops. If you wait to build the money all the troops on the map multiply and make it impossible to ever kill them because the stashes where monsters spawn from dont multiply so you have to wait and buy them weekly which isnt enough time thus putting you into a fail state and you've already lost the game.\n\nThis game isnt fun and that is the bottom line. Its just frustrating to play.\n\nIf you want to play HoMM or Kings Bounty they are available on steam and just put the money into those or go to GoG and get them there. The amount of replayability you can get from HoMM 3 and Kings Bounty is endless. This game I just feel cheated from enjoying anything.\n\nThe Developer is amazingly full of themselves as well on the forums so if you want to roll your eyes until your retinas detach just read the board.\n\nEdit: Note to the developers I still dislike this game even after the fixes. It just isnt fun, its tedious.","August 12, 2015","false","5.5"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","36","56","3","2"

Some buggyness with movement and quests, but nothing that probably won't be fixed easily and soon.\n\nYou play a knight who has been captured and then escapes, beginning a long quest growing an army of peasants and militia, elves and dwarves, pixies and hydras all beautifully depicted in a classic style with their own sound effects. This game could have come out 20 years ago and it'd have been one of my favourites. It kinda did already with King's Bounty.\n\nI have played up to the beginning of the second chapter.\n\nPro\n- Nostalgic graphics\n- Cheap price\n- Easy to understand and play\n\nNeutral (some people might like or dislike)\n- Despite simplicity, steep learning curve\n- Some potentially game-breaking secret monsters\n- Needs more wandering enemies and randomised compositions of enemies.

Good Games should be replicated.\n\nNow that’s out of the way...\nA Review is in Order.\nI've actually managed to beat the game.\n^ That doesn't sound like much, but holy hell is it hard.\n(But they added things for players to use to essentially cheat)\nPPS - Thanks for Adding those. Made re-runs easier.\n\n__________________________________\n__________________________________\nThe Bad:\n***\nThe game is buggy as all crap, crashes all the time, numerous problems.\nThat being said the Dev/s are actually working to fix it...\n(Most have been fixed)\n***\nNPC Monsters around the world get too strong too quickly, so if you explore your going to have a bad time later.\n***\nReplay-ability drowns itself.\nSee, the problem is that the map never changes...\n...this makes your next run faster and more efficient picking and choosing what you want.\nHowever this also means nothing really changes. Once you've worked out a killer strategy, you'll never deviate from it.\nBut I must say to lighten this negative point; I did restart the game 5 times to keep playing through\n- Learning from each time I restarted.\nSo it does have some replay-Ability, just not a lot of it.\n***\nNo Tutorials (Explore the UI yourself to work everything out)\nTook me two runs through this game before I realized that I could cast spells. (Perhaps its just me?)\nAKA\nSteep learning curve.\n***\nLack of Innovation, it’s all been done before.\nBut it’s taken the good that It could and it’s trying to remake itself with all the good stuff.\n***\nHero movement can be a bit wonky, if you accidently click and try click elsewhere to go in a different direction it feels like a 80-20% swing that it will actually stop moving so you can change the pathing.\n***\nLack of Options... you literally can't put this game into windowed mode with any ease.\nIts a very basic options screen.\n***\nCan't name saved games, hard to work out which save you want to load up some times.\n***\nBacktracking / Exploring is punished, creatures across the ENTIRE MAP get stronger the longer the game progresses...\nSo while it won’t affect you immediately it kicks the gears up later in the game.

Before Combat - Start of Turn Etc.\nAuto-Save is brilliantly set up.\n***\nCrapload of Main Story quests AND Side Quests.\n***\nCombat is solid, very few bugs inside combat.\n***\nVariety of monsters you can have is insane. It has easily 100+ different monsters in the world. All of which you can recruit in some way or form.\nOrcs, Humans, Elves, Undead, Misc, Etc.\n***\nVery challenging, this game will be no cake walk even on the easy difficulty.\n***\nLarge freaken map... Like seriously its huge.\n***\nDev's are actually willing to help you if you try talk to them... (Go Figure?!).\nThey're constantly spoiling walkthroughs / secret locations.\n***\nThe Art style is nostalgic, it’s not fancy smancy graphics its old school art (Retro) and it simply works.\nThis game looks amazing in its own style.\n(Even though it’s supposed to be ((Royal Bounty HD)) -? <--- Lol What... What HD??!)\nPerhaps revamped would be a more appropriate word.\n***\nFun and Interesting Story.\n***\nMultiple Endings.\n\n__________________________________\n__________________________________\nExtra Cliff Notes:\nIt's a $5 Game, for this price tag it’s more than worth its value.\nAnyone who tells you to refund this game...  is simply is a cheapskate.\nFor $5 you are almost assured to get your time and fun out of this game.\n(Assuming you actually ENJOY Turn Based Games)\n\nDo NOT go into this game expecting ANOTHER GAME.\nThis game IS NOT titled:\n- Might and Magic 2 HD\nOr\n- Kings Bounty HD\nThe main argument people are lodging at this game is that its not these games...\nThis is an absolutely stupid argument.\n(Nearly 80% of the Negative reviews are using this argument as the core argument they are putting forth)\n(^ Of the day I made this review)\n\n\n__________________________________\n__________________________________\nMy PERSONAL Views.\nI actually quite enjoyed my time with this game.\nIts $5 and I managed over 10 hours in it, so its doing something right. I rarely get 10 hours from $20 games.\nI ran around and tried to full clear everything.\nBut I’m well aware of a ton of things I've missed, just don't know how to get to them -.-\nAlso Necromancers Ring <-- How do I get Necromancy? WTF?!\n\nHowever as many people have noted, The NPC armies around the world need to increase at a far lower rate.\nThey get stupidly powerful - stupidly quickly.\nThe player is supposed to be the unstoppable force, not the NPC's around the world.\n\nI went into this game not knowing what Royal Bounty was and I had no prior bias in any direction.\nIt was $5 and I picked it up, cause why not? - $5.\n\nAll this said, I still would rate this game at a 7 / 10.\nFun with lots of potential.\nAs more things get balanced and fixed I can see this game becoming truly amazing.\n\n- Wolvie\nRemember Kiddies Dare2Game.","August 20, 2015","true","12.8"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","16","24","4","0"

A lot of the negative opinions about this game are from people who have played many of the games that this one is supposed to be based upon (Kings Bounty, Heroes of M&M).  I've never really played either of those games, so I was able to come to it with a fresh perspective, and I happen to enjoy it.  "It's supposed to be based off of "x", but it's not exactly the same.  Thumbs down!"  Who cares!  Enjoy and respect this game for what it is.\n\nThe advent of the "easy" mode is a huge plus, as it allows you to get a few playthroughs in to explore the world, and figure out which quests you need to tackle and in what order.  This seems like a game that would be very difficult to beat on the first play through, due to the increase in enemy armies over the passage of time.  With that said, it only adds to the value of the game, as you'll get in more play time to hone your strategy and approach to each play through until you know exactly where to go, and the best ways to get there and what units (and treasures) to pick up along the way.\n\nA lot of the strategy required in this game falls outside of battle.  Do you spend the few extra turns to go get the those treasure chests guarded by those tough monsters?  Or skip them, and complete that quest that's been waiting for you to complete it?  Or take the time to do both, but in which order?\n\nI'm enjoying the game right now, and feel like I'll get many more hours of enjoyment as I delve deeper into the world, and work on better paths to complete the quests.  At first, I didn't like the idea of feeling "rushed" to complete certain quests, but I'm beginning to like the idea of doing several play throughs to "perfect" my path.\n\nI find myself wanting to restart a lot of the RPGs I play, because after getting a feel for them, I see how I could do the beginning levels more efficiently.  In quite a few of those RPGs though, I experience what I like to call "restart remorse", in that I spend so much time on my first play through, that to restart to get "a more perfect party", and it tends to bother me a bit when I do finally restart.\n\nIn Royal Bounty (though not a traditional RPG per say), you are rewarded when you restart, as you have more knowledge that ends up benefitting you tremendously when you do begin a new game.\n\nThis is game is well worth it's $5 price tag, and lends value for the price.  Give it a try, and enjoy it for what it is.","August 16, 2015","true","11.0"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

Why am I saying this? Well there are elements taken from here and there, such as the time (days, weeks, months) system, the recruitment system, and stuff like that.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, here's a point by point review on the game:\n\nArt 7/10The art style of the game is something that you will either love or might not really be fond of. A little trick I personally applied was downscaling my screen options to something like 1280x720, and everything became much neater, bigger, and overall better.\n\nGameplay 6/10The gameplay mimics those of the previously mentioned game titles, but falls short in some aspects, such as not allowing the player to move a unit and with the remaining action points, attack. This is a bit of a let down, since in King's Bounty, kitting is such and important ability to use.\n\nSound 5/10Here's where the game really feels a bit unpolished. The sound seems generic, the music is unimpressive... It's definitely a department which needs a bit of work.\n\nConclusionIs it worth it? For it's cheap price tag, I would say it's worth a shot, especially if you're into this game genre. The developers keep updating the game every couple of weeks so these issues might get a deserved improvement. Something worth pointing out is that I feel the game is best suited for a smartphone device rather than a PC (As far as I'm aware, the game has support for most mobile devices).\n\nOverall a nice game, with room for improvement.","October 3, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

Although the game does have a strange amount of addictivness to the game, it is sometimes beyond a challenge, at times the game be so fustrating and annoying. The game doesn't do very well to balance the game with fun and challneging gameplay. I did find the game fun here and there, but the game is more of a challenge than many gamers really want. I understand that this game is suppose to be difficult, but in my opinion the game is too difficult. The gameplay itself is a real challenge, so I would only really suggest this game is you are into really difficult games. The game doesn't really focus much upon the story of the game, making this game almost all about the difficult gameplay. Another small feature that seems to be missing in this type of game is a mini map or overworld, this would save a lot of backtracking that is wasted in the game that you are required to do.\n\nThe graphics of the game are based upon the the original King's Bounty & Heroes 1 and 2, from what I have seen from the other gameplay the graphics really do well to represent those other 2 games in the series. In my opion, I love these type of retro graphics, brings back a nostalgia feeling to the game that you don't really get with other retro games.\n\nPros+ Cheap price\n+ A nice retro art style\n+ Steam Achievements\n+ Addictive gameplay\n\nCons- Hasn't got many features and gameplay improvements\n- Interface is clunky\n- No mini-map or overworld map\n\nResult / Final thoughtsThis is a difficulty game, that lacks a few basic features that the previous games used to have. Although the gameplay is fun and somewhat addictive, the difficulty will overcome that and take most of the fun out of the game altogether which is what the real downfall of this game is unfortunatly. On the other hand, the game does a terrific job on handling the retro art style of the game which I will definatly give them credit for. But unfortunatly all in all I cannot recommend this game.\n\nRating: 5.5/10","March 28","false","2.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","0"

Sadly, each continent is less interesting than the last.\n\nFINAL REVIEW : What a waste to program a whole game (units, AI, buildings etc.) and then rushes the map design. I recommand playing the first continent until the boss fight and then uninstall.\n\nHere conme a detailed review of each continent. Devs, please keep improving the game, it does have potential. Just find a good map maker.\n\nForestria : 8/10\nLot of quests and stuff to do, open ended continent. combats are hard and interesting. Nice boss fight. The best boss fight of the game.\n\nRockland : 6/10.\nAlready more boring and linear, you basically just fight your way down the long road. Some quests at the end  are unnecessarily tedious. back and forth and back and forth...\nSince I didn´t finish the paladin quest before clearing Rockland, I had to do some extra back and forth from forestria, I think about 3 weeks - a month of in-game time travel each way.\n\nTundria. 4/10.\nYou lose all your army and get a ghost. At first its seems a good idea, starting over with a few troops instead of bulldozing your way through. The first battle are indeed interesting, as you much watch your first few ghosts so they dont get killed before growing to big stacks. After that it get super easy and boring very fast.  Every units killed by a ghost become a ghost. Fighting against 4000 sprites? You get out of the battle with 4000 FREE extra ghosts. ALL the dwellings on ALL continents CANT mach the population growht of even a single battle. Not to mention the cost.\nYou have no choice but using the ghosts during all of Tundria.\n\nDesertia. 2/10.\nYou go back and recover you Forestria army, upgrade your troops and teleport to Desertia. You quickly realize the only way to win ALL the fights are again.. the ghosts and only the ghosts. There are a lot of Ghosts dwelling here, and NO alternative. No lvl 6 or 7 creature dwelling.\nI faced groups of 100 000 elementals, 5000 demi gods, 40000 trolls etc. and ended the continent with over 300 000 Ghosts. No other army would have worked. Sure, a mass shooter army + mass slow and blind + a few suicide stack of 1 genies could have slowly grinded its way through all the non-shooter stacks. But there was a lot of stack of 50000 lvl4 shooter or 5000 lvl 7 shooter that only the ghosts could have taken down.\n\nDadhab. 0/10\nAt the end of desertia, you dont even get a big boss batle. All your troops are taken away, as well as all your stats, and you end the game by doing some uninteresting back and forth that dont invole any combat. It wall all for nothing.\nYou get to try to find the open path in a maze. Sure, everybody loved to hide open paths with mountains in the H3 or H2 game editor. But being able to do something does not mean it should be done. After that, I would love to tell that you got back all your troops and stats for an epic and difficult boss battle. But no.\nYou stay weak, even though there are no more reason for it, but you do get about 3000 dragons that annihilate the undead boss army in a few turns even though the ennemy heroes does have like 100 attack 100 def.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW, while i was halfway through Rockland.\nGreat game for Heroes of Might and Magic veterans.  Have you ever found yourself loading up some Heroes II or III maps even after all these years? This is much better.\n\nThe game has not crashed once on me. I only encountered one little bug so far. (One of the two group of archer that you are given at the start could not join my army - I had splitted the peasants).\n\nThe map is big. I love that you can zoom out as far as you want. Nice music too.\n\nLove the pixel graphic. Always thought that this genre was well suited to it.\nSince I started playing like a week ago the game was updated twice. Now I can stop the movement midway after issuing a move order. The AI is smarter. Please keep up polishing the game!\n\nSome requests/suggestions to the developers:\n- Please unlock hard difficulty from the start. And please, please, don’t freak out over people complaining that the game is hard. Instead, take pride on it.\nLook at Vorgarr the Viking. This game is so popular because it is a very hard and very unforgiving remake of a classic.\nThere are many options for people looking for a casual ride. King´s bounty and Heroes VI are frequently on sale.\n\n- I would love a bigger combat grid.\n\n- It is annoying that some dwellings don’t accumulate creatures. This artificially limits the variety of creatures you can realistically recruit in your army.  Please only keep the good things from Heroes 2 & 3, not the bad.\n\n- Please add others class. Knight was probably the most boring class in H2, even though I their creatures are great. Every “fight” against peasants seems like a waste without necromancy.\n\n- Ranged units seems OP. Especially with master Archery +50%. Especially since you can recruit a lot of good ranged units from the start (14 archers from the kings, elves, Tartar horse archers, Monks).\nBut no fast melee tills the 10 cavalry that you cannot replenish.\nNo fast flyer until the sorceress. I don´t count the lvl 1 units, they are really only good as cannon fodder. Even the sprite, at least till hard mode unlocks the wait command to allow strike and return move.\nPerhaps a bit more variety would be better.  I don’t know if it is random?

When I came back with an adequate supply, I was met with a force twice as strong as the one I'd seen previously.\n\nDeveloper continues to comment on user reviews and comments that the game is "hardcore" seemingly obvlivious to the fact that a good game challenges you by putting you against challenging and thought-inducing situations, not by simply throwing lots of enemies at you.

While I got a sense of nostalgic playing this game (who didn’t love HOMAM 2), there is a big issue - this combination doesn’t quite work.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is how linear it is and how little replayability it has.\n\nLooking at it from an RPG site: Currently you only have one character to choose from. While skills can be gained on level up (with some degree of random), the skills are not balanced and you will find out quickly which are must have skills and which are junk skills (to the point of spamming load/save to ensure you get what you want).\n\nYou’ll be spamming load heaps of times as you adventure around the map, as you have no idea if the critters you are about to fight will be a walk in the park or annihilate you on the first turn (NOTE: I think this has been addressed in the latest patch).\n\nLittle to no replayability – the game becomes quite linear later on – do one quest before you can finish the next. The units will become available to you in the same order. The spells you get will always be unlocked in the same order. This means you’ll always play the game the same way. Also due to the difficulty of the game (see the next point) there are only a handful of strategies (I can think of 2, so I’m being honest) that work, so you can’t really deviate your playstyle if you actually want to finish this game.\n\nThe game is hard. While difficulty levels have been introduced by the latest patch (yet to test). Monster/critter stacks grow with time. I won’t go into detail as to why this isn’t a good idea, as pretty much every other review touches upon it. But it does mean if you don’t play optimally, you can get suck and will need to restart. It also means its best to race through the game as quick as possible - kind of a contradiction in an RPG.\n\n","August 15, 2015","false","7.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Great or terrible, I'll give a game a fair spin. That being said, I don't understand what was going through the developer's mind when they created this game.\n\nRoyal Bounty honestly feels like a Heros of Might and Magic 2 senario that we've been duped into paying 5 bucks for. This game uses the same or extremely similar engine and you control one hero. While this engine marginally works for an explorative rpg, it was really designed to be resource management and tile strategy. This becomes apparent as the leveling up of your hero does practically nil. On top of that, the units do not level up. So fighting in a way only atrophies your army. Unless you are playing perfect (not just great) even minor losses will stack up.\n\nThe Ai is ok but nothing incredible. The fights are won or lost right off the bat. It's practically all about who has the bigger army. I suppose you could carry rogues with you the entire game and just scout what the fights are before hand. Fun. Alternatively, you can just mindlessly wonder your hero around for days, months, years just letting him passively collect income. You will earn approximately one unit a turn/day. Then your army will be able to storm through a couple fights before getting chiseled down and needing to repeat the cycle. I say this because the fights carelessly and randomly alternate between maybe half a dozen peons to literally hundreds of enemies comparable to your few elite soldiers.\n\nThe still screen artwork is actually really nice, as is the card artwork. The first introductory jailbreak scenario works. It is only maybe 15 minutes and one fight long, but this is the format the rest of the game should have followed by railroading the player and providing armies rather than making you brute force the system. I don't know if the story progresses into something memorable as I only have five hours of game time logged. It's pretty forgettable as of yet. Another huge test of your patience is the movement of your hero. He will stop REPEATEDLY. You will click for him to move and this will queue up movement footprints. Then you need to order him to move again by clicking again or pressing space. The problem with this movement check is the hero will stop again midmovement for day changes or text pop-ups. Sometimes he will stop for no reason at all. When you click again for him to move there is a long pause and you will not know if the computer is processing the move or if you will be waiting for eternity for the character to move. Repeat this process one million times.\n\nSo only go for this game if you want a really campy walk through a Heros 2 scenario.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI put a great deal more time into this game since my initial review. I don't know that the game works perfectly as an open campain, but the developers have been putting big things in the works. After some grinding I was able to get a pretty serious playthrough of this game, albeit hammering a pretty serious exploit.\n\nIt still stands that I love the artwork. The controls are a pinch clunky. I hope they chisel an inventive game out of this old style engine.","August 13, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
