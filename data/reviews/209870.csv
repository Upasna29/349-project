If you don't have the patience to read a full review, I will narrow it down for you: the PC version of Blacklight has been abandoned by the developers, no update whatsoever, the bussiness model was ruined, the community came apart, there is seemingly no reason for you to play this game if you are new to it.\n\nFirst let's talk about the bussiness model. Blacklight was appraised for their renting system which was really well made, in fact one of the great things about the old busineess model is that it allowed one day rental. Which was a thing that Blacklight did very well, in fact TotalBscuit was pretty impressed by it in a first impressions video. The fact that you could play two rounds of Blacklight and get a good gun was a pretty good deal, and it was appealing to the casual player. Now this has changed, one day rental is gone. This meant a pretty big deal to casual gamers, because that meant that they had to grind for certain weapon parts and premades. In the past, with 200 in-game points, you could buy a decent gun or a gun part for one day. This was all fine and good, but now you can only rent gun parts for three days, and gun premades for 7 days, which will cost you a lot more time and points. I love Blacklight, but even to me, the change of the bussiness model was a pretty big hit, having to play at least three or four games just to get my hands on a tiny side-grade gun part was not worth it in my book. Many people liked the idea of premade weapons, because Blacklight has a huge level of weapon customisation, and premades gave you a fully decked out rifle for very little points, and that was a good equalizer especially for new players who were pinned against level 40 players with access to the gun parts they desire. A newbie could just play a game or two, buy a premade and stand a very good chance against skilled players or even players who have invested money into the game. Now, there was something else that changed the bussiness model, and that is the weekly rotation system. Each week, a certain weapon receiver and hero character is available for free. This is a pretty good deal, not only it allows you to experiment with weapons and heroes, before buying them, but hero characters are very good and they have a good set of gear, which is pretty good for new players, but these hero characters cover a certain area of expertise: you have a tanky hero with a light machine gun, you got a stealthy hero with an SMG, and these don't really suit new players. The good thing is that they could make for a good alternative when you're new and you don't like the default gear, which is actually very good.\n\nNow that we're done with the business model, let's talk about the items in the game. Most items are very well balanced, there is a wide variety of weapons and parts to chose from. But the probelm is that there hasn't been any sort of new content for the past year or so. When Blacklight celebrated a year of open beta, we had new maps, new guns, new parts, a zombie mode (which is pretty fun and challangeing), and all sorts of cool stuff. For the two year anniversary we got an XP event. That's it. The lack of new content is what drove a lot of pro players away from this game. Now, some people consider some items to be overpowered, or that some aspects of the game are pay to win, but that is not true. The game is nicely ballanced, the stuff considered overpowered is only better than average. The starter items are very good and reliable. The basic, starter assault rifle is still regarded as one of the best weapons in the game simply because of how well it performs overall. You can play this game without investing any money but it won't be very rewarding. Getting permanent items and weapons with game points is a huge pain and it takes a lot of time, and if you get bored easily, don't even bother playing this game. The developers pretty much abandoned the PC version long ago, and now all their focus is on the PS4 version of Blacklight, so you can expect no update for PC for a long time.\n\nSo far we've concluded that the bussiness model is kinda broken, the developers lost interest in this game and nobody has heard of any updates since forever. The progression isnt't rewarding, items are pretty hard to aquire. You must be thinking that there has to be a saving grace for this game, anything that makes it worth your time and effort. Maybe the community is nice? Maybe there are nice people you can play with? Wrong... The community has started falling apart a long time ago. Good players and nice people sarted losing interest in this game very quickly. Now there are very few good players left in this game. There is only  handfull of them out there, but they're there. You will encounter a bunch of annyoing stereotypes. There are newbies who don't know the game at all and accuse people of hacking, swear, pester, don't play the objective, that sort of stuff. There is the average player who does his best, gets a few kills, helps the team pretty well. And there's the die hard fan who is very good at the game and smply refuses to move on. As for real hackers, I can honestly tell you that in all the 412 or so hours that I have accumulated in this game, I have only seen two hackers. Two. So, you can take my word for it that hackers are an incredibly rare sight, but if you do see one, please message me. As for a small piece of advce if you are a player who likes being a part of the community, I suggest playing on any server and just interact with the people there. You will find a friendly person eventually.\n\nNow, Blacklight is a game I continue to love despite of all the problems it has. I've had some great moments with it and I still hope that someday it will be back to its old glory. To sum it up, if you're new to this game, do not waste your time with it and do not even think about wasting your money on it. Unless you really like this game, there is no reason for you to play. Especially if you're a casual player. If you're playing like two to three hours from time to time, when you have a few hours for yourself in your busy life, the experience is not going to be rewarding. Not to mention that if you want to be able to build your dream weapon, you will have to make it to at least level 30, which is not an easy task. If you're hoping to maybe make friends in this game and have a good time overall, don't even bother. The community is very bad right now. But if you like being insulted for no reason, be my guest and play the game.\n\nThank you for your time, and I hope you take this review into consideration before wasting your time with Blacklight. Have a good day, and please excuse any mistakes as I am not a native English speaker.","August 3, 2014","false","481.8"," 1,083 of 1,216 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","083","1","14","51"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealmassiveshady/recommended/209870/","therealmassiveshady","Eza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealmassiveshady/","115 products in account","Edit 6th April 2015: New developer announced, no changes set in stone yet. Hopefully will be seeing new content soon!\n\nEdit 7th Nov. 2014: So according to the other review (which is currently the highest rated review) there have been no content updates in over a year. Sad really, this game was awesome. I wish it had gotten as big as something like Planetside 2. Probably wouldn't reccomend the game in it's current state. Still looking for a fps? Buy CS:GO. Awesome competitive scene, great gameplay, and it's dirt cheap too (goes down to like 4 bucks on sale). Enjoy the review if you still want to read it :P\n\nBefore I get into it I'll just note I have around 250 hrs on BLR (not 80ish), since I played it before it came onto steam.\n\nBlacklight Retribution (BLR) is a very unique Free to Play (F2P) First Person Shooter. It has some unique mechanics that make it a different experience to games like Call of Duty or other F2P games like Crossfire and Soldier Front 2. I believe that Blacklight Retribution is the BEST F2P FPS currently on the market, but that doesn't mean that it has certain things that hold it back. I'll to a little Pros and Cons list of the game for easy comparison:\n\nPros:\n-BLR has extremely fun gameplay and even though it has its own unique mechanics with the Depots on the maps and of course the HRV (legalised wallhack) that every player has it is very easy for the new player to pick up and learn.\n-Although the term 'Legalised Wallhack' might seem a little off-putting for a lot of new players, the game is actually balanced very well, not only in terms of the HRV, but all weapons and armour also.\n-Australian servers :)\n-NOT PAY TO WIN. Don't listen to people who say this game is pay to win. IT ISN'T. You can get Real-Money currency and use it to bypass the level lock on items, but these same items are available to players for a reasonable amount of in-game currency once they reach the required level. Now, people might still have the argument of 'Higher level gear is better', but since in the previous point i stated that the whole game is balanced, then it doesn't really matter. :)\n-GP (currency made by playing matches and getting daily achievements, etc) is made very quickly and therefore permanently buying weapons, attachments and gear is quite fast. This is a very important point for me because going for long periods of time in games without unlocking new gear is a big turn off :)\n-BLR has a good community. People are helpful and nice, and yeah, you'll run into an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here and there but I don't really see too many of them.\n-Dedicated lobbies for low level players. Hate being a new player and going into games with Max Rank players that have a lot of experience and are very good? Fear no more, lobbies that are set to only take characters levels 1-10 exist so that you can settle into the game and get some experience before facing the big guns :P\n-There are a whole bunch of things that I'll list briefly here that are also pros: Fun gameplay, FoV Slider (yayyy!!!), huge range of attachments and gear, a lot of build possibilities - make your character truly unique, ZEN (Real-money currency) has arguably good value for what you get with it.\n\nCons:\n-LACK OF CONTENT UPDATES. Wow, this is such a big problem. Because of real-life things going on for me this year I didn't end up playing BLR for 3-4 months straight. When I finally jumped on the game recently I was expecting a big patch... NOPE. Nothing. You look at games like PlanetSide 2, which I had the same situation with and there was a frikkin 9gb patch for PS2. 9gb is a bit ridiculous to me but you know... at least the game is actually getting new content...\n\nI know there are more cons to this game but I can't think of them right now... sorry :P\n\nWell I hope this review helped, I am not sure if you can edit these reviews after posting them. If you can, I might update the cons section once I remember some things about the game :)\n\nSee you on the battlefield :)","November 25, 2013","true","83.3"," 234 of 274 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","234","274","0","0"

Just remember the game for how fun it was and don't look at what it turned into now.\nThe Parity patch, meant to reinvigorate the game, changed a lot of things - and not to a positive side. Seems like new dev team didn't really get why some things were there in the first place. Unlimited stamina bar straight up breaks one of the game's balance points between speed and toughness. The biggest thing are the weapons. They've reworked recoil system, so now it's barely in the game - sniping from across a full map like Evac with a sub-machine gun with x6 scope is a totally viable strategy now. My favorite weapon, my hand-crafted child of a machine gun feels like a stranger to me now.\nRemade design of the menu is just obnoxious, and less functional (though looks more in the moders fashion of large icons, like it's on a tablet or something) and just gets in the way. And the premade weapons are gone, so you can't easily try some of the new ideas, though you can rent parts for just a day again.\nAnd with all that, the game is less populated than I've ever seen it, the only game mode you can reliably play is TD and sometimes DOM and SD. But in that small group the community is barely existing. All the awesome people I use to know by nicknames in Blacklight are gone. And those who came don't even talk  to you, or make one lame joke as they win.\ntl; dr - Blacklight: Retribution you knew is gone. This is just a mediocre game, that feels like COD with BR's name on it.\nEven my old clan didn't exist anymore.","October 2, 2015","false","199.9"," 212 of 259 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","212","259","15","0"

Yet now sufficient time has passed to pass judgment, and the verdict is a solid "pass".\n\nOverall, many of the fundamental aspects of BLR are still there, and they're still solid. If you're a new player, you may even find the experience somewhat novel and enjoyable. For the purposes of this review, however, I won't be delving into that.\n\nThe first and most major gripe returning players will note is the absolute lack of recoil. I never used a submachine gun in my years of playing, because I favored a more versatile weapon for medium to long range fighting. Now the sub is my primary because with non-existent recoil I can outrange just about anyone while hitting at a far faster rate using a max-damage build (the only build that makes sense for any weapon now).\n\nStamina as a mechanic has been completely removed, leaving some builds inbalanced as a result.\n\nThe UI is (still) clunky and unintuitive.\n\nIf you don't enjoy straight TDM (I don't), there are very few server options to choose from (STILL no siege), and no more custom servers if you happened to favor those (though admittedly I didn't).\n\nI'm willing to keep an open mind, and will change this review if/when it deserves it, but other than the server dropping issues being resolved, I haven't seen any changes I've felt helped the game in any substantive way.","January 7, 2015","false","477.0"," 260 of 328 people (79%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","79","260","328","20","11"

Then you took those beautiful testicles, that gave me so many hours of enjoyment, and you've thrown them into a wood chipper. Whatever came out the other end, you've swept/mopped up and ran it through the wood chipper again. Now I'm left with this sterilized, characterless, blank excuse of a corpse of a game, that tries so hard to pretend that it still has its balls, but in the back of its mind, and in its player's minds, knows that its balls are nothing more than a vapor in the wind, alive only in our collective memory.\n\nrip in pepperoni and spaghetti, never forghetti, Blacklight: Retribution's testicles. May you ride eternal in the battlefields of Valhalla\n\nSome people asked me to actually tell them what I hate about the game now, so here goes:\n\nI posted this review around the same time that the developers of this game updated it with a parity patch that paired the PC version with the PS4 version. Everyone expected it to change the game for the better, but instead, it completely overhauled it so that it was basically a console game, with smoothed textures, controls not optimized for PC, hackers running wild with no control, and no premium servers (Premium servers were the reason why almost everyone played the game. In a premium server, someone monthly rents a server that they get to change the stats of. Basically, you could make a server pistol only, one shot one kill, unlimited stamina, headshot only, etc. Anyone could play on these servers for free, and some servers were really awesome. Like unlimited stamina, sniper rifle only, headshot only..). In normal servers, everyone had too much health, were limited by stamina, if a hacker entered the server, no admin could kick him (something you could do in a premium server), and you were forced to use the in game HRV, which is an ability that you get to use that allows you to see through walls. You couldn't possibly sneak up on somebody, or surprise them around a tight corner. This was also a main reason why people played premium servers, because you could disable HRV.\n\nNow we're forced to use these in game wallhacks, have limited stamina, play with hackers constantly, and NO SNIPER RIFLE ONLY SERVERS, WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE I KNEW PLAYED THE GAME. Oh yeah, and before the update, if you bought an attachment for your weapon, it was unlocked for all of your weapons. Now, you have to buy that attachment for each of your weapons individually. This makes getting the same attachment for all of your weapons SUPER difficult, and very time consuming. The way out of working very hard for the things you want is to pay real money.. So yeah, they also made the game into a pay to win.\n\nIn short\n\nPros:\n\nI can't think of any\n\n\nCons:\n\nForced to use HRV\n\nNow it's pay to win\n\nNo customizable servers, the reason why everyone played the game\n\nPS4 graphics, and unoptimized for PC interface and controls\n\n\n\n\nJust buy Call of Duty Black Ops II. It's almost the same game, but better in every aspect. (Not as good as the old, pre-update Blacklight Retribution that I loved so much, but it's pretty dang close to it).","October 21, 2015","false","479.4"," 534 of 712 people (75%) found this review helpful 519 people found this review funny","75","534","712","519","37"

Blacklight:Retribution was better in every regard, adding a beautiful true arcadic feel to it. Many loved the game because of this, and so did I.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPositives\nIt's extremely easy to grasp. Press V whenever you feel paranoid or lost, and then point and shoot. Simple, easy, and fun.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNegatives\nBut honestly, that's all positivity that I can say about this game. Around a year and a half ago Zombie Studios added poor  update after poor update, adding insanely overpowered gear and creating a Metagame (Which destroyed customisation, the thing which the game was praised for).\n\nWhenever there was poor balancing, ZOMBIE studios pointed the finger at PWE and basically said that it was all their fault. A few months later, Zombie goes bankrupt (Thank god), and the game was left to rot in it's ugly state for a long while.\n\nThe servers began to literally rot, the Australian Servers completely crashing beyond repair. It was pretty much playing a Game verison of a Ghost-Town. A bunch of brilliant ideas that were ruined by poor game design and choices by immature developers who did not take their game seriously in anyway shape or form.\n\nThis is when the game basically died.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRevival\nA few developers and some community members forged a new Team called Hardsuit Labs, and they immediately began work on refining the game.\n\nThey did a decent job, I've gotta admit. They changed almost everything, sounds, movement, gun-play, melee, grenades, depots, ammo, options, customisation, EVERYTHING. Everything except for the poor balancing.\n\nThere's still insanely overpowered weapons such as the LMG, which has zero recoil and high damage across a seemingly infinite range. There's plenty of weapons and accessories which can insta-kill you.\n\nHardsuit Labs also did a very bad move which wasn't well received from the majority of their fanbase. They decided to completely get rid of the Australian Servers, booting away a few hundred players because their connections just can't handle the distance of playing on the other-side of the world.\n\nI'm not sure if they said anything about this, and even then, they will say it is a PWE issue.\n\nThat brings me to the big booboo.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Customer Service\nCustomer Service is an actually really easy thing to master and help out with. After the large update done to BLR by Harduit Labs, a few accounts got completely destroyed. My Main account got wiped off of the world-wide servers, it's gone completely. And I spent around 100 dollars because I couldn't be bothered grinding for XP.\n\nMy secondary account had a lot of missing items, and it was a F2P account except for Camoes and Emblems which don't affect gameplay in any way aside from appearance. At first I emailed PWE, they told me they will check into it. They then sent me off to Hardsuit Labs, providing an email address for support.\n\nThe following email I got from Hardsuit Labs was basically saying that since the damage has already been done, they don't see much point in repairing it when they have other things to do. This was in response to my missing comestics on my F2P: 4444\n\nI thought that was reasonable, it wasn't too big of a deal, so I gave them a few months. 4 to be exact... And no update, no word from them. I sent email after email to them, resulting in complete silence.\n\nAnd so I've come to the conclusion... What did the massive update change about the game and it's developers?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnswer\nSound.\n\nSound as in their quality is Sound, basic.\n\nBut also Sound as in these new devs are a lot more public about things, compared to Zombie which were like toddlers.\n\nAs for Sound about the game, the Sound-Design. Wowie, the Sounds in this game are amazing. Guns feel and sound like they are futuristic and powerful, which they mostly are.\n\n\nI apologise if this is a poor review, but my experiences with this game have been poor.","October 6, 2015","false","637.4"," 131 of 153 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","131","153","5","8"

Meaning glass, massive, class etc. are all banned. This feature cannot be turned off.\n-PS4 UI:\nWhile it may look fancy, it really isn't designed for mouse and keyboard, and feels inferior in every way to the old UI.\n-Server Problems:\nEveryone I have spoken to can only get onto one server, and it's LMS. To add to that, Quickjoin doesn't work\n-F*cking Spawns:\nPeople have always complained about spawns in this game, and the devs claimed they would fix these problems with the update, but this, evidently, didn't happen. The spawns are somehow worse, meaning you will almost immediately be spawnkilled. On top of this, in LMS (the only gamemode I've played so far) there is a... bug which causes players to spawn inside each other.\n-Sound Rework\nI guess the devs may have wanted to make the guns sound more "future"? Unfortunately, they failed at this and the guns now sound like fisher price toys, all the way down to the low quality audio.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I LOVED this game before the update, but with the only positives being 4 bad maps and a weapon (admittedly it is incredibly fun to use) I see no way of reccommending this game. I am honestly appalled at what has happened to Blacklight: Retribution.\n\nIt's a NO from me (until they fix at least 3 of my listed problems).","August 4, 2015","false","271.1"," 160 of 195 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","160","195","8","5"

There's no overall setting to change all of them, but the game supports up to 1080p and will allow for multiple monitor support. VSync, Dynamic Shadows, Static/Dynamic Decals, Dynamic Lighting, Post-Processing MLAA, Depth of Field, and DX11 Tessellation are just some of the many options you can choose from when coming into the game.\n\nIf you have a potato computer build set with you, Blacklight Retribution will be able to accommodate. Now, that said.. I will not be able to guarantee a budget/travelling laptop build to play the game, but given that you know what the INI values should be, you can edit the game's files to be even worse than the proposed amount from the game.\n**\nAs far as Aesthetics go, a lot of the maps seem to have been based on the desolate ruins that became of Balik. The maps range from improverished barren in small villages to commercial intersections in the city, to massive military bases with mechanical death machines. In contrast to the abstract design of the cars in town, the police vehicles give off a lasting impression of what became of this place.\n\nThe sounds between interacting with your gun, moving around, and dancing on your enemy's dead body is one of the more satisfactory parts of the game in my opinion. Regardless of the gun that you have, each one of them sounds powerful with an open muzzle. Some of them silenced do give off that pew pew feel, but it can easily be justified when carrying a weapon almost the same length as your character model's height.\n\nGAMEPLAY90% OF THE GAME'S CONTENT IS BASED ON CUSTOMIZING YOUR WEAPON AND YOUR CHARACTER. It's definitely worth a try customizing some things, because you won't know what awesome new build you can create. I myself can tell you this reliably as most of my YouTube videos consist of making random builds and trying them out. If on the off chance however you're not up to customizing weapons and you just want to jump into the game, that is perfectly fine too.\n\nWEAPON & CHARACTER STATS ACTUALLY MATTER. If you have played a game like Alliance of Valiant Arms or Call of Duty where attachments don't exactly give you an edge in the game, this is NOT one of those games. Some attachments may seem miniscule in changes like recoil, but they definitely affect the end result. I can equip myself a Combat Rifle with Incendiary Rounds and an Infrared Scope that behaves like a Battle Rifle in the game.\n\nHITBOX CHANGES WITH YOUR HEALTH BUILD. Yes, Your health build depends on that hitbox. If that didn't stop you, there are taunts, titles, and numerous voices you can choose your character to have. For what they plan to add on, the combinations you can achieve through this game is truly unsurpassable. If you're the leader at the end of your game, you can do a frickin' Pelvic Thrust just to spite your enemies!\n\n90% OF YOUR DEATHS ARE FROM LEGIT WALLHAX. I don't think I need to explain the "Temporary Wallhex" that the rest of these reviewers may have done, but they all know that despite being a "Game-breaking" item, it definitely accounts to pretty much 90% of all the deaths we have, aside from sheer derping. If you're still wondering whether the game is actually fun, I think you should let the hours played do the talking. It's a really fun game for those willing to put some time into it.\n\nModes : DM, TDM, KC, KOTH, CTF, S&D, HORDE, ELIMINATION, LAST MAN STANDING, ESCORT, ZONES\n\nBUISNESS MODELTHIS GAME WILL GIVE YOUR WALLET A LOT OF LEEWAY. You won't need to spend $1000 let alone $100 to get everything you want. Perfect World as a premium service already gives out so many things for free, it'd be eye-opening to see how much money they would earn if they didn't put this much effort to keep this game as free as possible. To keep the amount of time spent to get a new type of gun into perspective, there will be times where you just spend One Match (10 mins) to get a new receiver. Other times it will take you five matches (1 Hour).\n\nThere's NO REPAIR SYSTEM, by the way. Everything that you purchase permanently will not break or rust at a certain point and disappear. The only items that will are ones that explicitly say "7Days" or "30Days", and even then you can choose to activate those weapons or keep them on the rainy day that you want to try it out. Great feeling to not have to care over having to maintain your weapon.\n\nTHERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO GET FREE ITEMS. It's gone to the point where a lot of the community in the Perfect World Forums are super-entitled to receive stuff for playing for "X" number of years. I've been playing since the release on Steam, and I think I can say that there's a lot of bologna going on over there. For what people get for free over here, it's really just armor / weapon skins.\n\nUNLOCKING EXTRA CONTENT PERMANENTLY IS A ONE-TIME INVESTMENT OF $5. What I mean by this is that you are still able to access the content everyone else has, but you will not be able to purchase everything permanently using GP. Some items that are restricted behind this paywall are extra receivers that you can customize along with gear items like the Tactical Ice Axe or the Personal Holo Decoy\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTSBlacklight Retribution is an excellent game. People have put in over a thousand hours and claimed to not recommend it. Whether they actually enjoy it or hate it, the hours of play should give an indication over whether they actually like or dislike the game. This game took many steps outward to really make a name for itself especially within the Free-To-Play community.\n\nOut of all of the Free-To-Play FPS Games, I still would have to place this as number one after the past 3 years. If you managed your way through my review, I would love to hear your opinion in-game!\n\nCURRENT SITUATION AS OF 10/12/15Blacklight Retribution has been updated with the Icestorm update as mentioned before. Hardsuit Labs is currently working on the game to be ported over to the PS4 and making things are going smoothly. With that said however, the gameplay has definitely changed where for the time being, most weapons do not have recoil.\n\nThe recoil change was not an originally intended choice that the developers. It brought a lot of backlash toward the developers as it simplified the game, and they are planning to bring it back within a somewhat timely fashion.","January 27, 2015","true","591.4"," 118 of 139 people (85%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","85","118","139","17","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tbonebiggins/recommended/209870/","tbonebiggins","T-Bone Biggins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tbonebiggins/","383 products in account","Update #2: Game is still ♥♥♥♥. Nothing was fixed. It was all lies. The devs are POS's who should be shut down for all the crap they tried pulling with this parity patch. And the constant lie being spread by a dev in the forums how 'just a few vets are unhappy but we can't please everyone' is total BS. ALMOST ALL VETS ARE UNHAPPY YOU TWITS. Game balance was almost 100% proper pre-parity, but even now months after they promised fixes and released a few patches the balanced is ruined. Tox-SMG sniping still wins the day, aiming for the legs nets more kills than aiming for the head. And the new netcode is taken straight from the book of how not to code an online FPS, still, months after release. We had tighter hitboxes and latency before. HSL is cashing in on you, do not let it happen due to nostaligia because the Blacklight:R that we all loved is 100% dead and deleted from existence.\n\nUpdate #1: Second patch hit to fix all the problems made from parity patch. Guess what, still SMG tox snipers. Still 200dmg BAR's. HAR is weaker than ever, higher ROF guns are buffed massively in comparison to pre-parity balance. I gave up. HSL had a second chance and completely dropped it. All they did was fix it so you can actually select which server to join via mouse and added back recoil, but there is no balance to the weapons in this game. Netcode is also still terrible, shots not connecting just going through a person sitting still and making a bullet hole in the wall behind with the target untouched. Just too much. Instead of deleting the PC version of BL:R and replacing it with the PS4 version HSL would have been better served just taking BL:R off the market, what we have now is a complete sham. And idiots are still blowing the HSL devs in the forums saying good job when everyone in server agrees 9 to 1 that this game is worse than pre-parity.\n\nOriginal Review:\nParity updated deleted the PC version of the game and they uploaded the much worse PS4 version in it's place. Many things are broken and people want to give the devs a chance. I've played since beta for hundreds of hours outside of Steam and loved the prior PC version, we just wanted the new items and maps on our game. Nope, Zombie Studios dissolved, some of the same team members made HSL and copy-pasted their crappy console version of the game onto PC. It's not even a good attempt at a console port, the GUI is broken in several ways. Bugs abound, had an enemy hardsuit glitch into a wall and unable to take damage, but this happened after it lag-warped everywhere. Lag is worse in this version or at least the lag compensation is worse. Many things do not work as intended like the glitchy server browser still choosing server top of list no matter which one you click. They also increased the F2P grind by now not unlocking parts for all guns, but instead making you unlock the same part for each of the 17 type of guns individually costing much more overall. There has been a price drop but it's still more than 3x the cost of the original system of buying a part and using it on all receivers. But the new level requirements help prevent people from trying new parts and equipment, it's just insane. Even as a 'Prime Member' which costs $5 to new players you have to be such a high level to unlock some things like the riot shield that it's just insane, even old level 50 players will take a while to reach the new higher levels. Most of the time I'd give the devs a chance to fix this, but these are most of the same old devs formed into a new studio and they are still working with PWE so because of PWE don't expect much without having to pay in some way.\n\nSo far it appears to be a fresh cash grab at the expense of the community, a few minor improvements were done but it's still nothing close to how good the original was. Do not get me wrong, the original had a few problems but they could have been fixed with much less effort than the giant wall of problems we have now. Some people are jumping to the defense of the devs but they mostly seem like people new to the game. I have not chatted with an older player yet in-game that says this is an improvement, and I've played a good share a matches in this new version. Forums are overall hostile, official forums lock down threads of disapproval in a Chucklefish/Phil Fish style manner but the dev on the Steam forums seems more concerned about the community. But the actions taken so far by the move overall, we will see how things play out in a few months. Will update accordingly.","August 4, 2015","false","28.2"," 194 of 257 people (75%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","75","194","257","16","10"

If I wrote this review a year ago I would have said it was the best F2P shooter on Steam, because at one point it honestly was! It looked beautiful, had a sleek, digital UI and HUD with a nice team of devs. Items were pretty balanced and it wasn't pay-to-win, with money only letting you buy weapons that you can earn instantly anyways, similar to League of Legends with RP-vs-IP on champions, for those of you who are familiar with League.\n\nNow? The original studio was closed down/bought out and replaced with a new one that, in an effort to move it to the PS4 and be 'modern' (I think?), has ruined the once-great game.\nThe weapons seem very imbalanced now, you are forced to have an account with their new system and log-in to play with that instead, and worst of all, the unique and sci-fi inspired UI that garnered a lot of love has been replaced with an abyssmally disgusting and now fairly confusing pseudo-UI that looks more akin to an iPhone game or a novice Lua coder's attempt to make a custom HUD for a GMod gamemode.\n\nI am saddened to say that after 3 years of playing this game on and off, I no longer recommend it.","November 2, 2015","false","33.9"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","63","72","3","3"

It used to be decent.\n\nIf you want to know how it was before, imagine an F2P CoD done right - or at least more or less right, and put into a sci-fi setting, plus some more in the way of choice added to make it less bland.\n\nNow,  it's just ♥♥♥♥.\n\nLet's start with the GUI and HUD. It used to change depending on your monitor, it is now fixed in 16:9 (everything looks weirdly centered on a 5:4 monitor). The GUI itself has obviously been designed for a controller, is hard and slow to navigate and just overall ♥♥♥♥ing awful. It's laid out in a way that is both confusing and hard to read, and even if one can get used to this after a while... the player list (also known as that thing what happens when you press the TAB key) doesn't show the player's ping towards the server (host?). This brings us straight to the netcode, which seems to have gotten worse. What was previously  bearable has now become so bad I lack the words to describe it.\n\nThe weapons, which previously were a very CoD4-like affair, with at least some recoil and decent sounds to make playing the game fun, are now about NERF-gun level. Not in terms of damage, but in terms of how they sound (NERF guns) and how much recoil they have (none). When getting hit by a weapon, when previously you could at least tell you were getting hit, you know cannot. In any way, really. You just die, and that's all the warning you get. And when you do die, the time to respawn has also gotten significantly longer, now being at 10s to the previous 6s (if I'm recalling that correctly, anyway).\n\nNow, they did one good thing, and it is literally the only thing they did well in this latest big update: they finally started allowing players to rent weapons for a day for a small amount of gold points (the earned in-game currency). However, they had taken it out before for no good reason, so they don't really deserve any praise for that.\n\nIn short, this game is boring as ♥♥♥♥, will annoy you with it's menus and HUD, and then put the last nail in it's coffin by presenting you with some of the most awful gunplay I have ever seen.","August 2, 2015","false","126.1"," 106 of 147 people (72%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","72","106","147","10","0"

I will update the review once I have spent some time in the current version. Also, read my note at the end about the Steam DLC and ingame purchases.***\n\nA Call-of-Duty-ish, loadout-based, first-person-shooter with a massive range of weapon and equipment customization. Players are equipped with a "HRV" hud that runs on a meter and is activated to see through walls to track allies and enemies. You can earn a sort of in-match currency or resource that can be used to purchase heavy weapons, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers, RPGs, and even nano-swords (think Metal Gear's High-Frequency Blade). This resource can even be used to call in mechanized exosuits called "hardsuits" that dominate the battlefield with a high volume of firepower and their heavy armor gives added protection.\n\nThe game, for the most part, is not pay-to-win. Most weapons are equally balanced and are all viable. The standard assault rifle that everyone gets is one of the better weapons in the game. The only pay-to-win is that you can use real money to unlock weapons, gear, and gun parts faster. Also, there's the Heavy Assault Rifle, which is OP, but even with real money I don't think you can buy it permanently. Real money is mostly used for cosmetics or bonuses, such as advanced XP / in-game money rates.\n\nThe game has plenty of gamemodes to choose from and it feels fair to play. It's also very visually pleasing, as well as being easy on your system. As long as you have a decent computer, you should be able to run it just fine.\n\nOn the Zombie Co-op: It feels fun and is pretty challenging. Unlike other games that have PvP Zombies versus Survivors, this is a PvE survival mode where the players face waves of unique NPC's and bots as a team. I don't remember much about it other than you will run out of ammo a lot unless you keep picking up the weapons the zombie soldiers drop, or you have one of the more powerful melee weapons / nano sword things.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 8.5 / 10. It's fairly solid, but sometimes it just feels a little... less than optimal? Hard to explain, but sometimes you feel like it could do more than what it currently is doing, if that makes any sense. Maybe that's because it's a free-to-play game.\n\n***One thing to note: I would not purchase any of the Steam DLC packs or purchase anything in-game really, at least for a while. There have been reports of things not working and people losing their money in general. And honestly, you don't really need them, the game's fine as it is without you paying anything.***","October 16, 2014","true","18.7"," 60 of 77 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","60","77","7","0"

The gameplay along with the content presented in this game will have you at the edge of your seat as you engage in combat along with various players from across the world (and bots sometimes) in several large maps for you to bludgeon, snipe, dismember and kill.\n\nThe content is pretty vast in Blacklight Retribution. You have various heroes to choose from, but as a new player, you simply start with a custom hero to play. Additional heroes have significant pros and cons and they require Game Points or ZENs (a.k.a spend real money for ZEN, the in-game money). The same goes to the weapons, as you start out with a pretty formidable weapon, the Assault Rifle. While you can customize your weapons (which will incur more Game Points or ZENs), you can spend less by buying premade weapons (the only con is that you can't customize premade weapons). While depot loadouts for new users are simply enough to get by, players with enough Game Points or ZEN can purchase better depot loadouts to increase their chance of killing other players. Because acquiring certain elements in this game requires you to be in a specific level and having enough Game Points (which, I swear to Haruhi-ism, you can't get enough Game Points for every single thing you want to buy in Blacklight) means that you are forced to screw your wallet to get the stuff you need. Oh, and did I mention the DLCs in Steam are cheaper than buying seperate in the Blacklight Store? Seriously. I spent $100 on this game so far just to get the stuff I want. You're better off buying the DLCs from Steam, and even that isn't cheap to begin with. And they don't offer much. The upside to this game is that they now offer Weekly Specials, where they let free users try a specific weapon for a week and decrease the price of said weapon to about half or more, and they change the Weekly Special weapons every week. This also applies to heroes as well, so free gamers can still enjoy at least some premium items for free.\n\nThe gameplay, to be honest, is like playing Battlefield 2142 with Battlefield 3 graphics. It's simply addicting, stunning and... oh it just feels great to play this game. The map choices aren't bad. Some are big, some are small, some are just plain offensive (especially HeloDeck, where you are likely to get spawn-camped and killed). Overall, the graphics and the gameplay make up for the its' Pay-To-Win element (which is disgusting, and it might disgust gamers out there who despise Pay-To-Win games).\n\nWhat do I have a say in this game? If you don't care about getting the weapons, the heroes and the loadouts to get the upperhand and if you're skillful enough, this game will please you with its gameplay and graphics. However, if you're not a fan of Pay-To-Win games, be warned as this game will do whatever it takes to screw your wallet clean.","January 25, 2014","true","28.3"," 89 of 128 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","89","128","0","0"

Blacklight: Retribution brings a whole heap of creative, balanced and exciting content to the FPS genre. With continuous community content and updates, Blacklight excels at presenting the sci-fi futuristic shooter-theme with detailed graphics, creative killing, massive customization, the mostly balanced P2W system and the satisfaction of putting a bullet or hammer into your rival's helmet. The only problems I have with this game are the trade system, how the game runs and the diminishing community. Overall, this game is my second favourite game of all time.

But once you are in, you do get enjoyment out of it. But more importantly its the people you meet there aswell. Sad to see it dwindling away like a fading star, although there is still die hard followers of the game that won't stop playing it ever. The shooting game play is very fast paced. For best results to win in team matches, working as a team is important. The starting default gear isn't too bad, weapons included, i have known to deal quite some damage with default gear. There are different game modes in this game but out of all of them melee was my favorite. Not suitable for starting players but very fast paced and action packed to where the real key to this mode is in skill and not the gear. I have to say that  Blacklight was one my all time favorite free fps games that i have come across in a while. Mostly because of the people i met there. If you choose to play this game, play to meet other individuals, play to have fun. You may need to grind it out for the gear you may want, thats how I did it mostly. Above all,  treat players with respect and you will earn their's.","February 14, 2015","true","045.9"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","42","54","3","0"

But..!\n\nBlacklight: Retribution, to me, is a GREAT PVP shooter.  It has some great interesting mechanics, and the gunplay feels pretty alright.  Nice animations, graphics, etc.  It all just works.  There's several gamemodes, ranging from CTF, to generic all-out deathmatch, and even a cooperative gamemode in which you fight off "zombies."  With any mode you play, at the end of the match, you gain in-game currency and XP, and with level-ups and even some match achievements, you get free items to use to your leisure.\n\nBut.. like all F2P PVP shooters, there's always something wrong.  More like somethings.\n\nWhat BL:R gets wrong is a lot of the more grind-y elements.  Customizing your gear and appearance is TOUGH.  Like, really tough.  Many of the items in-game are priced high for the attainable currency, and they implement a cheap-shot system:\n\nInstead of "buy item once, keep forever" deal with in-game currency, you can buy for a TIME-LIMIT.  Now, it isn't the worst thing; you can still do the "buy once, it's yours" deal with the in-game currency, but doing that is MUCH more expensive than just getting it for a few days, or hours.\n\nMany skins are outright locked out from usage if you don't pay big, and there game even has ~some~ P2W elements, but not by much.  Like CS:GO, you can pick dropped weapons from people who died, friendly or not, and use them yourself until you, also, die.  So you can try out/use weapons with parts/skins/special medallions that you don't have.  I guess it evens out the ability to buy your way to stardom.\n\nDeveloper support is GONE from this title, seemingly.  Zombie has yet to do updates to existing features, and some things in the console version are absent from the PC, last I read.  Additionally, modes like the cooperative only feature a single level, and nothing else was developed for it.\n\nNo modding scene, period, so don't expect new levels any time soon.  The community sort of lives on, but not by a whole lot, so you might have a hard time getting into a good game of it.\n\nThe anti-cheat isn't great (since I remember running into a loooot of hackers), some minute netcode issues (since I often found myself running into lagspikes on seemingly official servers), and a bad problem with free, new-user accessibility makes this tough to chew on.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the game when I was still playing it, it was good.  Like, REALLY good.  I don't know how different it is now, I should PROBABLY check, but judging from what turned me off prior... I don't see myself in a rush to re-install.\n\nThe thumbs-down is probably my first, but if you do want a good F2P PVP shooter to entertain you for a while, this definitely works.  Don't expect anything past a resounding "well, that was neat, time to go back to my other games."  You might get more mileage out of it, but I know I didn't.","November 7, 2015","false","35.8"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

You can look around on YouTube or the PWE forum to get help on building equipment setup that suits your playstyle. In-game lots of the people are fun to chat with and they are also great at battle.

Yes they brought in many new players, made the community so much more alive, adding new maps and also improving the UI and the AI bots. But, they removed some of the most crucial mechanics of the game that made blacklight such a competitive shooter in the first place. Gun stats do not even matter anymore! They completely ruined all the precise recoil and spread stats, making the game EXTREMELY easy to play now. All the weapons are not balance and some being way too overpowered without the recoil or spread to compensate for the high damage values. It took the devs more than a year just to bring everything from the ps4 version to the pc (It was the only update in around a year and a half to two). That is what made the game so difficult to master in the first place. Before this, it actually took skills to excell at the game and every kill felt well earned. Players had to recognize the recoil pattern which is completely different on every weapon and also consider the hip and aim spread while firing. Adding on, being the game was released three years back, it still does not provide dedicated servers in the asian region even though a good fraction of the fan base are of the asian region.","October 9, 2015","false","428.9"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","33","42","4","0"

People that say this are usually the people that use short range guns and spray hoping they can run off with a kill. I personally noticed a big difference in medium range accuracy when using different builds.\n\nArmor\nYou can really build your armor any way you want.\nA speed demon build to try and dodge bullets, a tank build to trade better with enemies or maybe a medium build consisting of both speed and health. Anything works.\n\nGear\nFor gear you have little choice when it comes to actual useful gear.\nYou start off with a knife and a frag grenade. The knife is useless and you only get 1 grenade.\nYou can fix this by buying a better melee weapon, some better grenades or even buy resistance items which reduce the damage you take by certain ammo types.\n\nHardsuits?\nA big part of the game are hardsuits, big mech suits that take tons of damage and go on massive killing sprees.\nI'm joking. Hardsuits are almost completely useless if you know how to properly kill one. Even a default flamethrower can prove lethal to a hardsuit if you can get behind it. There is no good reason to buy hardsuits except if the entire enemy team consists of beginners.\n\nConclusion\nThe game is still very enjoyable, the servers aren't empty like everyone claims and the community is actually really nice.\nIf you're starting out and don't know what the hell you're doing, just ask someone in chat. There will occasionally be someone poking fun at you for being inexperienced but I can assure you that the experienced players will gladly help.\n\nNow you can take a deep breath, stop staring at steam reviews and give the game a shot yourself.","February 19","true","136.7"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","44","62","11","4"

As it stands now? I can not for the life of me recommend it, Here is why.\n1 The hit registry about a year ago was really good you pointed at their head & it actually hit their head, The hit registry was almost always spot on.\n\n1 Hit registry as it stands today? Hit marker after hit marker after hit marker.... Your shots are no longer spot on & half the time they don't even register on the enemies side.\n\n2 Connection issues about a year ago was really good most of the players you played with maybe had at the most a 90ms ping, Connection all around was pretty balanced you didn't have many issues with players being a few seconds ahead in terms of connection & you didn't have that many people from other countries trying to play wioth americans.\n\n2 Connection issues as it stands today? Serious lag compensation all around, Players joining from russia connecting to american servers lagging the living crap out of other players giving the non american players the advantage. The average ping now in days for player matches is around 150ms.\n\n3 Recoil about a year ago Was really good there wasn't to much recoil, But there was also just enough recoil to prevent weapons from being over powered. There wasn't really any sway on the sniper rifles either it was pretty well balanced if you knew how to customize your rifle properly.\n\n3 Recoil about as it is today? Recoil shot way up rifles now sway way to much back & forth even when you burst fire the recoil is just crazy. The sniper rifles now have to "Hold their breath to steady" the rifle which is absolutely dumb. Even if you customize your rifle properly your sniper rifle still sways like crazy & has a hell of a lot of recoil.\n\nFinal point I'll make, After this game started supporting consoles the PC side kinda lost its support the developers have practically left us PC gamers in the dust. After they began supporting the PS4 the game started have more & more issues with connection & cheaters. The game just isn't the same anymore & I find it sad how the developers have just left their PC side in the dust.","April 8, 2015","false","37.5"," 88 of 138 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","88","138","12","8"

The price scaling runs about like this, 1 Weapon Accessory that costs about 395 GP (InGame Earned Currency) to rent, usually the rent scale is 3 days to 7 days, however to own it permanently, it's going to cost you about 3750 GP for ONE accessory, to put this in perspective you earn ABOUT ~200 GP per match (Start to End), that means you're going to be playing about 19 matches just to get one. single. item.

Finally, HSL removed the blacklight prime, a license that allowed only the ppl that had to pay $5 upfront before he/she could buy any ingame items using gp (ingame currency that u got from playing)\nBefore that, the parity patch was pretty trashy-all we got as beta players were cosmetics (nice hat without stats) , a title and blacklight prime. Since newbies couldn't buy items to protect themselves from toxic ammo without paying in real cash, all the veterans (vets) had to do was join the team with most vets and they would almost certainly win if they used toxic ammo and explosives the new guys nvr could get their hands on. Toxic ammo does little direct dmg but can continue to down whittle ur health even after the bullets stop hitting u and also, it reduces ur max health so u couldn't heal back to full health even with the supply depot. Heal injectors could help to prevent one from dying but unfortunately, its a gp item.\n\nPlus, the level restriction prevented players from getting the guns or gear they wanted unless they've been playing for quite a while.\n\nAfter the christmas patch however There was no team balance either, not before and not now. Apparently there is a system to arrange for players to be in differing teams depending on their stats (to pit the vets against themselves and so on) but if the teams were even numbered, there is nothing to prevent the players from switching teams.\nStill no spawn protection as before. U could spawn into a mob of enemies or proximity mines (as usual).\n\nAs for the mechanics:\nWhat  BLR promotes as gameplay is rather infuriating, camping and gangbanging. There is no mechanics to promote fighting as individuals. Going as a team is good, switching players to take frontline dmg helps as health regen will help to heal u back to half health and the moment u get a kill, u can recover to max health at a supply depot. However, there is no piercing ammo to counter this.\nCustomisation is fixed before starting a round, if u wanted to change primaries, u would need a diffenrent customised slot for 10k gp as well as the weapon itself. The problem being, u couldn't change gear that way. If ur armor or is too slow or has too low hp for the playstyle that suits u, u would only have 30s to customise before the next round. There's no preset armor build to accompany the weapon sets. 1 armor set would be used for an entire match even if u change wep sets.\n\nVariety is lacking ever since the parity patch kicked in. No longer are the weapon tags (which boost stats by a little) free. No shock, no explosive nor magnum ammo. The only missions you get now are daily kills, daily wins and weekly dmg dealt (apart from headshot kills for the title). The only free skin for looking good is the daylight skin. U can no longer get the golden skin from the headshot kills achievement. U could no longer purchase the fox + cat helm and leveling only awards u with titles (at lvl 30 and above). If anything, I wished COD had the hrv (x-ray vision) and not this game. At least COD doesn't crash every few days, has ppl playing and has less absurd features like chat censorship.  Or frequent crashing. Still looking for the day where I'll change this review to a good one but if u were me, u'll get impatient too after a few yrs.","January 2","false","114.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","11","11","3","0"

Please restrain from blaming it on people's superior gear. The weird thing about that, is that you're wrong AND right to blame the gear. The truth is, the starter gear is bad purely because of the fact it doesn't focus on anything. You're not as a disadvantage with your gear, you just don't have any clear advantage. The point of this game is to allow you to customize your armor and guns to what you want, and customizing it how you want hurts other stats.\n\nOnto the game itself.\nFrom the customization, to the music, to the general theme, BL:R is a truly unique game. It's a solid fast paced FPS, that has plenty of things that separate it from others. Everyone can wallhack, everyone has sweet looking helmets, and everyone is slightly different in some way due to the customization.\n\nFirst impressions can be harsh, but just try your best to rent everything you want, and make the money back by using it. You will quickly find something that'll make you want to play more. And once you find that, you should have no trouble gaining the in game currency to buy permanent stuff. Blacklight without a doubt feels like just another low budget F2P game, but it had a lot of heart put into it. It's tons of fun if you just have the right mindset.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games, and debatably my favorite shooter. The patch was rough yes, but the new devs are working to fix the things they've broken. In the end, the things people are complaining about are meaningless. They're big deals in one way or another, but that shouldn't stop people from enjoying what it has to offer. My game runs fine, I shoot people in the same way I always have, I enjoy the new maps, and customize my stuff the way I always have. They also recently added a permanent double GP booster. Given for free for previously existing accounts. But you can always buy it, though it isn't necessary.\n\nTake my review however you want, I just figured the review section could finally use some kind words.","January 9","true","508.7"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","24","35","0","0"

Maybe the balancing or the overhaul update.\n\nMyself, I played the game before 2013 and I enjoyed it until an update came that told me about a server error that I tried to fix somehow. Unfortunely, I had no solutions and went uninstalling the game.\n\nBut I revisited the game in 2016 and found out that the UI and other stuff has changed. Whilst visiting the game, I received few "extra items" for free, because I played the game back on 2013 with stuff like permanent 2x GP bonus, etc. I really didn't care that much, but once I joined to a random server, the gameplay was neat. I didn't notice a change about it and thus it's still the same (I guess).\n\nNo problems so far with the game, except there is one and there are experienced players on public servers with a level from 20 to 60. Most of those players have a decent armor and gear, while myself, I had the default equipment on. Still I managed to beat them 5 times a row which I call it luck.\nI see that the servers have also a level restriction that allows new people to join servers to fight against other new people which I find this a good idea, yet there aren't too many players who's playing the game therefor there are ~10 EU servers around. Anyways, I care this problem less than the people giving negative ratings on this game.\n\nTowards my point, I am enjoying this game and I don't meant harm towards other people who put a negative review on the game. Basically, it's my opinion about it.\n\nA quick edit:\n\nAfter I posted this review, I read some threads on the discussion tab and there were many complains about the game which most of them I find are true. The most common one is that the game has changed from F2P to P2W and the update (which was called the "Parity" Patch) has caused all of it. Many people have been upset about it due to losing items because they were inactive or didn't read the FAQ page and it is quite troubling considering that the game was very fine before the patch.\n\nNow I see the issue about the game having a lot of negative reviews. I understand them and honestly say that the "Parity" update was a let-off to many people, but some were given items in return when they played the game before the patch. Therefor, some of them were happy while some of them were upset about it.\n\nAfter a while, my friend who never played BLR before, said to me that he can't play very well and instantly dies by an experienced player quite often as well as telling me how everybody have the same taunt while he and I had not. For this experience, I thought I could explain to him about it, but he decided to not play further because the game was too unfair to him due to massive "tryharders" and overpriced items. I cannot help him other than to tell him to stick to the game which he had lost interest by now. I often felt sorry to him since he spent hours installing the game. Found out that new people can only rent items for one day and cannot buy items permanently because he had not the "title" that I own\n\nWell, so far, I would have given the game a mixed rating between a thumbs up and a thumbs down. Those who wants to play, think about it.","April 25","true","99.5"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","27","41","2","3"

I liked to send guns and tokens to my friends. But because of this, I don't know a damn way to do so.\n\n- Removal of custom premium match: Seriously, what was more fun than having an admin rights on your own or on your friend's server, and having bots to play with when there wasn't enough players in your server.\n\n- The guns have no recoil whatsoever: Nice, I do like to shoot a sniper at 1 kilometer distance.

Dont get me wrong the Publishers (PWE) are at fault aswell. The game got stale and boring. I learned every corner of the map and knew everything to heart. It came to the point where I could guess what my oponents' weapons' stats (which actually was a nice advantage) because I knew everything! A game should not be neglected that much to the point where you could even guess the stats of weapons that aren't even your own! It was fun back in the day but after this recent update (which actually RUINED the game) I was fed up. Everything about the game even the older maps made me so angry about how the game ended up. I loved this game and to see the game slowly dying because the developers (and publishers) don't know how update the game without actually changing and taking the little things that made this game unique. Now this game is utter garbage and might as well get taken off the steam store considering they have something called arc, they simply dont need steam anymore. If I could get my money back I would and go spend it on a more deserving game but I can't. What's done is done and I probably wont ever install it again unless I'm sure there are people working on it who actually care and aren't lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Time to take my angry wallet, computer space, and broken heart elsewhere.","November 13, 2015","false","357.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The weapons are extremely customizable, with options to swap out bodies, muzzles, etc.\nAs far as I can tell, the microtransaction part is implemented in a fair way, earning you ingame GP to spend on stuff you want to buy. Additionally, the option to rent guns for a set amount of time, really levels out the playing field, enabling me to score top 3 spots, topping players that were 15+ levels in front.\nThe ability to enable time-limited X-ray vision, giving you the opportunity to localize enemies, provides for dynamic, quick paced gameplay, with little or no possiblity to camp it out. Having glanced at the beta, this appeared at first to be a possible game-breaker, but thankfully this is not the case.\nThis game seems extremely well thought out. It's got different loadouts, a range of auxiliry packs you can carry with you, a myriad of game modes, customizable character items, killstreak rewards, etc.\nLast but not least, the ability to call in a mech that you can operate, adds to the overall enjoyment. This element had me worried as well, but turns out to be equally well balanced, as it lacks the X-ray vision, is restricted in its movements across the map and has limited movement speed, boostable for a short period of time.\nAs an avid, long time gamer, I have to confess this game has impressed me a lot.\nI would like to end this short review by tipping my hat to the devs for creating this hugely enjoyable game, and highly recommending it to everybody looking for a original, futuristic first person shooter, that distinguishes itself from the pack.","February 9, 2014","true","10.5"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

Aside from that, the same goes for attachments and other items such as armors. It's disappointing and in a sense greedy.\n\nAlong with that, the games doesn't feel like it used to with the classic UI it had before, none of this 'Sub-menu' bull that it's trying to pull now. Along with that, every time you hover over an icon, it makes a rather loud and annoying select sound like smashing a head against an empty tin drum.\n\nThe gameplay isn't much better than before -no new maps or game modes from what I saw, same people camping or using over powered weapons in CQC maps, it does get old after a while. It's not good anymore, it's more of a heaping mess of what Call of Duty Advanced Warfare is than what it used to be.","May 14","false","42.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

While there is still much about it to be enjoyed, the sweeping changes to the core game and pricing model, and lack of changes to old problems, only alienate existing and former players, and ultimately create a more cold, cynical product.\n\nFast-paced, featuring deep customisation but slow, expensive and heavily-gated player progress, low-skill and poorly-balanced gunplay, a heavy focus on microtransactions, Blacklight feels like a very modern, triple A shooter, and it's to the loss of anybody who likes customisation, varied gameplay and skill in their competitive FPS.","August 8, 2015","false","321.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

For the Aussie players like myself, the AU servers have been shut down indefinitely as well.\n\nPerhaps we'll see some kind of resurgence under the new dev team in which case I'll change my review to reflect this but until then I feel this game is well past it's glory days and not worth picking up seriously.","March 30, 2015","false","423.8"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

I commend BLR for not falling into the 'Pay 2 Win' category with every gun I've seen so far being well balanced. I was disappointed to see the community is quite small now, but my guess is this mostly because the devs don't even update this game anymore. Given how polished it already was however, it's not as big a deal as some people make it out to be. The wide variety of gadgets and customised weapons you can obtain keep the gameplay interesting and sets it aside from other fps games. At the end of the day this game is free to play and you should definitely try it out.\n\n[EDIT]\nA few months ago now BLR changed hands to a different company. This new business decided they would completely change the game and well, I wanted to cry after I saw what they'd done.\nI haven't touched this game for a long time now despite it used to being my favourite game of all time. Basically they ♥♥♥♥ed up all the gun balancing, removed maps and now it plays like a completely different fps. I'd do anything to get the old game back. Even considering asking them for the old game files and server files if they still have it so I could get a private old version of the game happening. That would be very far fetched though.

It's like they took a huge step backwards with the new devs.\n\nI had a lot of hours put into this game and with the new update, they restored my character, leaving my levels but stripping me of 90% of my gear with no reimbursment what so ever. I am not mad, just not willing to go back and earn it all again not because of the time it would take but because it's not fun now. I used to make new accounts just to play it all over unlocking the free items they would give you but even that's gone.

Really, I thought it was incredible how a game so well polished and innovative for the genre could be free. - I returned now a couple of years later and tried it out to finally be able to play it full on graphics and really see this game in the best possible way. - I logged in only to discover that you have to be certain levels to even achieve new weapons. And of course the attachments too should have a level requirement. - Other than that, I quick joined to find a match, I kept on finding the same match over and over again. (I tried to switch after the game ended, due to ridicioulos team matching....) I found the same match every time, when I tried to manually join another match, well!.. I was blessed with lonelyness. Noone was in the server, and I had to quick join to join a match, which of course turned out to be the one that I already left 4 times by then.\n\nFor some reason the game have taken a turn towards the worst, not only limiting the players to grind with a dull (yet alright) weapon for so long to achieve acces to trying the sniping aspect of the game. Yet on top of that, they promote their real cash-system without level requirements, too much, pushing it into your face.\n\nThis game have been left to die..

I found myself annoyed by this because I really hate games that do this.\n\nthe game at its core is fun although I do find that every gun kills very quickly and if you have slower internet speeds then this problem will surface quite often for you.\n\nthe game play is crazy and face paced and introduces the ability to see through walls and many other abilitys that most triple A shooters dispise having. while playing this game you have no mini map so when you play you will have to use your wall see through ability to judge where the enemies are. Reflexes are needed to be sharp while playing this game.\n\nMy final score for this game is 7.2/10\n\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","23.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

Definitely worth checking out if you're into FPS games. The HRV (built in wallhack) is a brilliant twist to the game which gives it a lot more speed and a whole new set of things to worry about when you're running around on the map.\n\nThe weapons are customisable from stock to barrel and muzzle, scope to magazine size. You can trade off accuracy for an easier to control weapon, or a higher damage bullet. Or you can try and have a very accurate weapon but you have to learn the recoil patterns in order to properly control it. Your character and the armour you wear are also selectable which means that this game gives its players the ability to sacrifice HP for higher run speed or vice-versa. You can also equip a ton of different camos and paint your weapons using some of the camos provided. Lots of rare camos exist as well, they come around once a year at certain points. The trade/in game mail system no longer exists as of the "parity patch" so trading is no longer an option to obtain rare things.\n\nThe cons of the game would be the microtransactions related to the camos and emotes. HOWEVER you should keep in mind that a non paying player can have everything that a paying player has except for the aesthetic parts of the game (camos, taunts etc.).\n\nThe game is in no way Pay To Win. Whoever says that, has no idea what they are talking about.\n\nUnfortunately the game has certain overkill weapons and items that annoy most people who are in it for the FPS experience and the challenge of defeating another good player. Some people will use the Hardsuits (which are being used as a selling point of the game which to me makes no sense, they should be taken OUT of the game) which are large mechanical suits that you can use to obliterate people in front of you. In public lobbies its kind of a mess sometimes and people who use hardsuits or swarms (anti personnel rocket launcher) can easily take the win.\n\nHowever when you play against long time players, there is a sort of unspoken code most people abide by, so certain weapons and items will not be used during those matches.\n\nIn short, the game is very good, its not very newbie friendly, it has a nasty learning curve BUT its very fun and engaging to play once youve gotten the hang of it.\n\nA small thing to note is that the community can be very toxic, we have some 30 year old man-children (egoistical and narcisistical people) playing the game. Some people get over attached to the game, and become very agressive if they lose. Try not to mind this, the game in itself is brilliant and should you play with a group of friends, the sky is the limit!\n\nSince the "parity patch" the recoil has been severly reduced so this might be appealing to new coming players however its not something we're very happy about as long time players. Word is recoil is coming back at some point.","August 29, 2015","true","922.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","8"

The clunky controls, negative acceleration problems, and crash issues make this a definite no from me. I love the ideas in this game, but they were just put out so poorly, there's no excuse.\n\nAnd now with the garbage route Zombie's taking of no one-day rentals, people who pay have a much larger advantage. In terms of the skill ceiling, this game isn't as low as more generic FPS titles; however, not as high as a self-market "competitive FPS" should be. People looking for something balanced, skill-based, and with better controls should look elsewhere.\n\nTL;DR: It's pretty f**king fun, and it's an amazing time killer, but it's innovative ideas are wasted behind a curtain of payments; and if you really like it, I don't think putting money into this potentially amazing game is a bad idea!","May 24, 2014","false","110.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Built on Unreal Engine 3 utilizing nice DX11 effects that while making it so that the game will run on pretty much any computer at nice settings while maintaining an excellent frame rate. Gameplay is focused on powerful weapons that require skill to use by not overpowering any of the guns but having each one of them built for a different play style. A big deal with this game is the fact that there is no minimap in the game but instead you can utilize this ability given to you that allows you to see where ever enemy is in the area with heat signatures through walls but you must use this carefully because you can't shoot while you are using this and it has to recharge. The sound in this game is well done and if you have nice headphones, I am pretty sure you should be able to hear footsteps fairly well and be able to pinpoint their location from that. The playerbase in this game is still strong at the time of writing and is becoming more skilled every day. The updates for the game are strong and frequent but may take up a fair bit of your time to complete due to their size but this isn't really a surprise for an online game. Customizing your character and your gun is a lot of fun in this game and I felt it was really well done. The amount of options available for weapons is great and it isn't like they cost too much to rent a great gun. While in game cash and XP don't come as fast as it may come in other games similar to this, I felt they came at a reasonable pace that never felt truly unfair. This game has gunplay that feels like a mix of Counter Strike Source and Call Of Duty 4 which for some is a really interesting mix but this isn't for everyone. It is free so feel free to try it out if you would like.\n\nOn a side note: I was also able to try the PS4 version of this game and I can't say I recommend it in its current state. The game, for PS4, is still in beta but it has a lot of issues that it needs to fix. One big issue I had with it was the fact that the game often required too precise aim for a controller. The game still felt like it was being built for a PC. There were also some frame rate stutters from time to time that can irritate if in the middle of combat but graphically it was nice. I can't complain too much for it being a free to play game but I just really wish it was as good on PS4 as it was on PC.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games and is looking for something new.\n\n82/100","July 14, 2012","true","27.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

The game was abandoned roughly a year ago, or more but I can't remember. A huge patch would revive this game but it will probably be too little too late. Australian servers were removed a while back. Oceanic players will probably have better connections playing Blacklight Retribution Asia, or soon to come out Blacklight Retribution Russia. This game offers so much customisation possibilities and has everything to cater for different play styles. I recommend it to burn off time. If you don't like it, it's good for uninstalling.\n\n8/10 (used to be 92/100 on steam)\n\nLong Review:\n\nOh boy do I love this game. Blacklight: Retribution (BLR) is a first person shooter set in a dystopian future not too far away with a steampunk feel. There's not much storyline but it's based of its predecessor, Blacklight: Tango Down. The world was ravaged by a virus that turned people into the infected (SIVs) released by political extremists called the “Order” and the only people left to stop them are hired mercenaries (you). BLR is currently being published by Perfect World Entertainment (PWE) while content is being published by Zombie Studios. BLR PS4 is published and produced by Zombie Studios.\n\nI started the game a while ago. I got pub stomped all day every day for the first 20 or so levels because BL:R was my second "legit" PC FPS game that wasn't full of potatoes. Now as a level 50 life's easy. A lot of new players call BLR pay2win. Well, it's far from it. It is severely play2win in my opinion. Heck, the starter assault rifle is deemed the best weapon in the game due to its versatility BUT to fully customise it to your liking will take time and effort (a long grind). Alternatively, you can rent parts and new guns (receivers). Each time you level up a level pack is awarded to you which includes all the unlockable items for that level for 3 days. The game offers a wide variety of guns with their specific niches but the assault rifle in doubtfully the most used due to its versatility.  Yeah, all the starter stuff is pretty damn good and all you need really (almost).\n\nGameplay wise BLR, it’s pretty solid. The game features a hyper reality visor (HRV) which is basically legitimate wall hacks. For a short period of time every once in a while you can see through walls and pinpoint enemies on the map. For this reason, there is no mini-map but this mechanic ensures that gameplay is always fast paced. Camping can be quite difficult in this game.  The recoil in this game is honestly not that bad and the spread is in a random cone around your cross hair. For that reason “professional” players like to use static crosshairs. Concerning the grenade throwing mechanics, they feel wimpy and I don’t like it but it’s probably just me. You will hate corners if you want to turn them hugging the wall because you will get stuck and die a lot. Elevators can glitch out sometimes letting you jump super high, off the map, in the map and such.\n\nThere are many maps that are small (Helodeck) to medium (Dropzone) to large (Vortex). All in all there are roughly 18 maps and 9 gamemodes. 2 gamemodes are restricted to specific maps and I’ll talk about those soon. Basically you have the traditional, bread and butter gamemodes of every (most)  FPS;  death match, team death match, king of the hill, capture the flag, Search and destroy, and onslaught (PvE, zombies, the map Centre only). Concerning search search and destroy, the bomb has hrv cloak which basically masks a person’s netwar signature from HRV. Basically they cannot be seen on HRV. The other game modes include domination, netwar and siege. Domination is when you hack nodes (these box thingies) to capture them and gain points. Other teams can take/retake nodes captured by the opponents by hacking them but there is a firewall (time frame) which stops the node from being retaken after capture. netwar is a mix of capture the flag and domination. Siege is where you transport a scorpion tank through a specific path towards the enemy’s base. Players can pilot the tank which has a minigun that can tear through enemies like hot butter through a knife. There are checkpoints in which the team escorting the tank have to hack panels t lower barriers in order for the tank to proceed.\n\nIn BLR you can pretty much customised everything you want including the HUD using a third party application. You can customise your armour to suit you play style. You can be a tank or a fragile but extremely fast agent. You can customise every part of your gun and there are 23 different types of guns with their own niches. There are over 20 parts for each part of a gun you want to customise (except magazines, there’s like 5-15 options). There are billions of weapon combinations possible in BLR. You can choose your specific gear such as grenades, tomahawks, explosive resistance patches and such along with your tactical gear such as heal injectors, revive injectors and barricades.\nConnections wise there are only servers located in the US East and West along with European servers. Australian servers were removed a while back. Blacklight Retribution Asia is an alternative but it has a different publisher. Lag is a major problem for all players.\n\nContent wise, this game used to be amazing. It was probably the best free to play game out there and with a bit more love could of gave the AAA titles a run for their money. Sadly, it was abandoned a while ago with the Onslaught patch being the latest patch. There has been speak of content coming soon™ but then again, it’s always apparently coming soon™.\n\nTo conclude this review I would like to say this game has everything to cater for all different play styles. There is plenty of variety to choose from and everything that you could possibly want to customise is customisable. You can earn everything with in game money but speed things up by using real money. A couple of years ago this game was really promising but with the termination of the AU servers, may players said their farewells at the game’s “funeral”. Contradicting the fact that many people left, the game’s player base has risen by 15% in the past 30 days. This review probably isn’t structured properly and is missing out some important things but I hope it gives you an insight to a wonderful game (well, at least it used to be). I still play this game passionately and you can add me in game :)\n\n8/10 (used to be 92/100 on steam.\nIf I were to revive this game 2 years ago, I would give it 10/10.\n\nIGN: VirusAlpha (US) I am an Australian player so my ping is terrible.","November 25, 2014","true","565.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnCable/recommended/209870/","CapnCable","Lagurcrs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnCable/","64 products in account","I advise you have your wallet ready if you want to play this game.\n\nWhile many players say that you don't need to pay to do good in this game, there's still many ways to get an advantage over other players, all which involve throwing your wallet at the screen.  If you want to access a better weapon early, or perhaps a modification for said weapon, bust out your wallet, and you're set.  If you want something nice without paying, be prepared to play hours on end, just for one thing.  You can buy special taunts, too, to scream how much you payed in the enemy's face.  Wallet: Retribution can be played for free, but you'll likely have the disadvantage.\n\nNow, onto the gamepl- *gets spawnkilled*\n\nBad Spawn: Retribution can annoy any player with it's terrible spawn system.  In team matches, the spawns aren't so bad, and you'll usually get a chance to leave where you spawned.  However, joining team matches is hard, because in this game, six players in a twelve player server is a full server.  In a deathmatch, or free-for-all, as you might know from other games, the spawns are about as bad as the weapon balance between everything and the submachine gun.  Bad spawn scenarios include spawning in front of somebody, spawning in front of a turret, spawning in the same place that a "spawn camper" has had their sights aimed down for the past five minutes, and even spawning in the same line of fire that just killed you.  Bad spawns will cost you the match, and it normally does.\n\nAs for the weapons and equipment, prepare for a garbage excuse of balance.\n\nFirst things first, submachine guns and elemental ammo win the game.  Turrets carry somebody to the top of the scoreboard, and hardsuits can only be killed by other hardsuits or a depot weapon, unless your team actually works together.  Most random matches don't see a lot of teamwork.  I've seen deathmatches where first place was leading by thirty kills, because they placed a turret in a spawn location.  Hardsuit: Retribution is unbalanced in a lot of scenarios.\n\nNow, the servers.\n\nThe servers that actually have more than three people playing in them are always full, have a ping limit, or have half the server capacity and are somehow full.  The ping limit is the absolute worst idea that's ever been thought of in a shooter.  If your ping reaches the limit listed by the server, you get kicked.  Not all servers have this, and the ones that do usually say so.  However, some that have a ping limit don't state that they have one, so prepare for a random kick if you don't live next to the servers.  Also, servers that aren't at full player capacity will often tell you that they're full, and a refresh will show you that the server cannot count.  Having six of twelve players in the server isn't full.\n\nWhile I've only stated bad things about the game, there are good aspects.\n\n-Certain armors or helmets give stat boosts, but are done in the right way, as the boost is only a miniscule amount.\n-While most maps have bad spawns, the map design itself is nice, and there's various environments.\n-A mode to train with bots is included in the game, which is nice for players who prefer this.\n-Most items that can be bought with premium currency can also be bought with the in-game currency that you get by simply playing.\n-When the spawns work and the team balance is existent, the game is really enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you've played other shooters, and are looking for a better experience.  If you're only looking for something to pass the time, this game isn't bad, but there's better options.  It's still worth giving a try, since it's free.  And take my word for it, don't pay for this game.  Buy a better shooter with that money.","July 3, 2014","false","14.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","8"

At this point the game gets really interesting since the diversity in what you can kill and what can kill you is totally dependant on what kind of character you create. Or you could just create a stealth-tank character and go massacre people with it, disregarding everything else. ._.

It's not pay2win but it's rather grindy (then again every FPS is grindy) but in a good way, I suppose?\nYou essentially grind for GP and hope you win for a chance to try out the pre-mades or save up more for permanents. Graphics are awesome, Deus Ex-esque, and has a slight punk-Tron look as well. The guns sound amazing (especially the LMG, I love hearing that thing go off), the customization for weaponry is so in-depth and the stats tell you exactly what it's going to do. Not on a 1 - 10 scale or how low, medium, or high the damage is, and the original soundtrack is dubsteppy to some extent, though quite catchy.\n\nSadly though, we're talking about a game published by Perfect World here. These guys aren't worth the trouble of paying Zen for. They used to be a decent company, but now they just don't care about their games nor the community and have moved on to greener pastures.\n\nGive it a whirl.

The game is very good, with snappy fast-paced shooting that feels tight and authorative, with good game-pacing allowed by the HRV -- Essentially every player has a wallhack, and nobody is ever terribly isolated from all the action because of that.\n\nThere are no cheap a**ba*tard snipers camping in corners and waiting for a perfect headshot because anyone can spot them with the HRV. The game is good, original, and pioneering. It makes for a fun and rewarding experience, and apart from my own personal temper problems, I've very much enjoyed playing it! 8/10, would recommend!","December 15, 2013","true","67.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While there aren't a CoD ton of maps, they're unique, varied, and the game modes keep them from being droll paths.\n\nPay to win?: This is the most well balanced free FPS in terms of the p2w players. A first timer with 20mil ZEN still wont beat any month long player. The only items that are real money only are cosmetic, all equipment can bought with in game money or cash.\n\nCommunity: From what I see on the US servers, there's a fair amount of players, but a good amount of noobs and jerks. I hear EU is a smaller but tighter community. You get out of the community what you put in. Be friendly and mature in chat and on the forums and you'll be more likely to hear of offers, events, even people giving items away! (Just never beg, like, don't be gross, k?)\n\nBugs: There are some. I've only run into minor ones, rarely, and they've all been 'known bugs'.

I think this is actually a decent FPS with some interesting mechanics, such as the battle suits and visor system. The game play is very fast paced, and unfortnately for you--the cash content is not just flash as it mostly is with their other games. My experience suggests that the top players in most rounds have dropped some cash on the game. You can still have fun, but if your ego needs the win to enjoy the game, just get used to the idea that you may need to pony up. Just be careful because PWE has some security issues, and I don't entirely trust them. I would never buy anything through them directly because of things that have happened in the past with them either not noticing a major hack or at least not notifying the public for quite some time. Just saying. Game is fun for some free diversion but not much staying power without cash--and that's really just for bragging rights and ego trips.","March 13, 2014","true","29.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Call of Duty, while initially impressive, wanted too much out of the relationship and wasn't willing to change. Battlefield was better, but took up too much space in the apartment and generally didn't give much back out of the deal. But Blacklight Retribution is different. It likes me for me and dammit if I don't love it for it.\n\nThats enough of that dumb analogy.\n\nBlacklight Retribution is a online only Free-To-Play FPS with startling creativity. The story goes that in the near future there is a special forces team called Blacklight (hence the name of the game) that goes around saving the day with the most high tech gear that money just wishes that it could buy. The setting for the game offers a lot of really cool possibilities for it's weapon set up and that adds a lot of appeal for me in this game. Its the only FPS that suggested to me that Shurikens with the power to taze someone was a good idea and I'll be damned if it isn't!\n\nSpeaking of the weapons, the game allows you to make your own. This is no "here's and gun player, and look! You can put a shiny new scope on it, BUT NOTHING ELSE!" that some games say, but the near future setting allows for this really cool thing that says the weapons of the modern world we live in are obsolite, so now there are new ones and these babies are open to suggestion. There are literally hundreds of possibilities for your gun's muzzle, barrel, stock, ammunition, scope...god thats a mouthful. Do the math, there are hundreds of ways to loadout the gun you start the game with!\n\nOn top of weapons there are also a lot of options for your character in general. Theres dozens of different types of kit, depot items (killstreaks, for those CoD inclined), armor/uniform options and so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much more. Theres a fair amount of game modes with their own creative twist on them (wanna cap that point, well you better be able to hack Sonny Jim) and on top of this frosting covered bakery item of awesomeness, its free and has an active community. Whats not to love, steam users? I ask you, whats not to love?!\n\nThe few downsides to this are as follows. Due to the setting I was expecting more creativity out of the game types, but it mostly sticks to the old tried and true game modes with the only exceptions really being "Netwar" a larger version of a Domination game, and "Seige" where you escort a large tank. There is also a mode called, "Onslaught", but its generally kinda boring. That mob of infected-type people charging with varying degrees of ferocity while you run in a set of pants that needs changing... gets old after awhile. This doesn't really draw back from anything, so what the hell am I complaining about. As usual, the community is also a mixed bag of nuts and it just depends on if you're alergic or not. Some people are generally helpful and some are just downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but thats to come the territory of being a Multiplayer game.\n\nIn my opinion, its a real shame that FPS games like this that show some real creativity and just generally something different are overshadowed by the big, budget welding games that are the representatives of the gaming community. These representatives make games that while they may be fun for a bit, fall more and more into the SSDD or gaming, while games like Blacklight Retribution are just trying to get an inch. If you want the most out of your FPS game playing time, get this game. You will not regret it.\n\n8.5/10","December 23, 2013","true","198.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

So here I am, Steam Community.\n\n\nFirst, some negative reviews state the game is "unbalanced".\n\nI've acquired a position in the Top 3 of the endgame scoreboard many times with the basic assault rifle and handgun, therefore there is no way the game is "unbalanced", you just have to know what you're doing.\n\nNext, the weapon prices.\n\nIt only takes two good matches TOPS to rent a pre-made weapon that you can improve your score with.\n\nOf course the receivers (The AK, M4, etc.) will be expensive with your game points, the game will not SPOON FEED you, thus providing a challenge and goal. And they provide you an option to use real-world currency as an alternative that will also help them keep the servers running and such.\n\n"Repetitive" reviews.\n\nThe game is by no means "repetitive", there's plenty of gamemodes with additional maps in the near-future as well as a DLC. And we have zombies (Onslaught), it is definitely a twist.\n\nOther.\n\nI haven't seen any reviews on it, but the graphics are brilliant, especially for a Free to Play and the game runs smoothly.\n\nBasically, this game is by no means a "pay2win", it's perfectly balanced but requires some time and effort, it's not for the casual.\n\nGood hunting agents,\n~ NotASheriff","February 25, 2014","true","30.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","5"

The community seems to be even worse that the one of CS:GO which is quite an achievement. This hermetic group take no criticism whatsoever and responds to everything they dislike with insults. The game itself looks quite bad. Textures are low res and fuzzy, gunplay is disappointing with almost no recoil and extreme accuracy even while shooting from the hip. The fact that as a new player you are starting with inferior guns and the only way to upgrade is to grind or pay real money doesn't help it either. As a fan of everything that's cyberpunk I'm deeply disappointed with this game. Having to create an account to play, having to pay $ or grind for upgrades, epic dubstep after every round, cancerous community, casual game play, all of that left me with unpleasant aftertaste and bad breath.","August 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

There have been quite a few bugs over the last couple of months which is to be expected of renewed development in a game which basically stood still for an extended amount of time, that said I have seen people giving the game unnecessary bad press because it isnt what they were expecting it to be after the patch.\n\nThe old version of the game worked no one can deny that but it also had its flaws, like most games do. In this case it is important to understand that even if the game may have its flaws at this given point in time, the developers aren't sitting idly by but rather spending their time working and improving the game.\n\nBlacklight Retribution used to be a great Sci-fi FPS, some people may not realize it, but it still is.

Then it got resurrected and is now the most badass FPS ever.\n\nNEW REVIEW:\nSo quite a long time ago, Zombie Studios, BL:R's original creators, got paid off to deliberately do absolutely nothing with the PC port of BL:R (keep in mind, the PC is where this game started in the first place), meaning no updates, no development, nothing for the PC. Instead, they got paid to focus entirely on the PlayStation 4 port. Everyone who caught wind of this was devastated, myself included. I even remember some parts that were new being REMOVED FROM THE GAME, like the game was being "deupdated," influencing people to play on the inferior PS4. They even added insult to injury by making the things you could buy with ingame cash ridiculously expensive and hard to come by. What used to be a simple grab after playing one match became a monotonous quest of completing 7 matches to get a simple scope for your Assault Rifle.\nThen the game went silent, and the playerbase began to drop.\nTHEN SUDDENLY FROM THE DARK ASHES OF THE  PAY TO WIN ABYSS COME ZOMBIE STUDIO'S VETERAN DEVELOPERS UNDER THE NEW NAME OF "HARDSUIT" TO RESURRECT THIS HELL OF A GAME AND GIVE IT THE ATTENTION IT MOST CERTAINLY DESERVES!\nNot only is Hardsuit adding content back into the PC port, but they're also doing something they call "Content Pairity," which is basically another word for Cross Platform Support, meaning PC players AND PS4 players can play together. Much of the game has been reworked, gun parts rebalanced, better design, etc. While there are some things you can only buy with real cash (the Polaris helmet, for example) and some people might call it Pay to Win, I disagree; for one, these developers deserve all the cash they can get for bringing this masterpiece back, and honestly, you get what you pay for, and it's not really expensive. At this point, the game is about skill (and wallhacking), so those stat changes aren't going to change much.\nIf you were a veteran player and was disappointed by Zombie's decision to do what they did, your hopes and dreams have been fulfilled and the game has redeemed itself to be something absolutely amazing.\nPlay it...\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nThis has got to be one of the greatest FPS games that I have ever played\n+ Futuristic style\n+ Very well designed maps\n+ Customization of your player and your weapons\n+ Cool game mechanic (it's wall hacking, but it's not!)\n+ Nice graphics and shading\n+ Some nice gamemodes\n+ Guns feel smooth\n+ It's free\n- According to a few reviews, there are many (known) bugs that the developers can't be bothered to fix\n- Developers who don't care (listed above)\n- OnSlaught gamemode doesn't have much effort put into it (it may have been removed)\n- Practice AI seems broken (May have been fixed.  Otherwise it's experimental)\n- Pay-To-Win\n- Probably a few more that I'm forgeting to mention\n\nI would recommend this just so that you people can try it out.  Honestly, it is a very fun game (and you can customize a lot of stuff, which was a pretty big selling point for me) and I would play it some more if I had the time, but I wouldn't spend money on this (especially if the devs don't do anything useful with it).","June 29, 2014","true","94.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While Retribution is a PvP FPS, it does offer high quality graphics and immersive combat and player personalization. It also now comes with a Co-op game mode where you and three other teammates hold off against a hoarde of zombie-like creatures.\n\nEDIT:\nWith the new update and handover of Blacklight from Zombie Studios to Hardsuit Labs, the future looks everbright with BLR. While this game is always a work-in-progress, Blacklight Retribution provides you with an exciting experience and nonstop action... unless the servers go down.\n\nI've sunk my life into this game and in turn, it has shown me inspiration towards my career; not as a gamer but as an aspiring developer.

YET)\n\nAlso if you like Cyberpunk, Gundams, FPS, SAO's Gun Gale Online, Neon Genesis Evangelion and integrated wallhax, this game is for you.\n\nNOTE:\nDespite this game is a F2P, it is in no way a P2W... but just bring wads of cash anyways.

Almost every build is relevant in a way, and there are no pay to win elements, everything gameplay-relevant can be obtained via in-game currency (slightly grindy).\n\nUnfortunately, being a F2P title, one would expect frequent updates and additional content, which isnt the case for a very long time now. Yes, there are new maps from time to time, most of them are just recycled from Zombie's previous title and are too far inbetween. Another problem new players may face is a strong veteran presence with really high skill ceiling (which was partially diminished in last few weeks with steady stream of new players).\n\nWhen you get through these (mostly) service-related difficulties, you can expect a very tightly controlled, competitive and engaging FPS, where every your mistake is punished and you will never have a reason to blame anything else. (Also "Siege" game mode is a jewel!)\n\nDefinitely try it.","June 23, 2014","true","572.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

November 2015: A patch has just been released to fix stability issues and some other stuff. Hope is rising again.\n\nA good game. I really loved it. The servers were always up (ok, hitreg wasn't working fluently, it rarely does in FPS multiplayer games though) and although it took some time to unlock items the system was fair and rewarding und the weapons were overall balanced.\nUntil, that is, Parity (a large update, the first one in years, came along). Parity was basically an unfinished update, with balance problems and nerfing recall to the point of non existance (almost). Private servers got removed and you can sprint indefinitely. Servers were down (or glitched, games just wouldn't start properly) way more frequently and latency was overall worse.\nBut it was ok, as the new devs seemed to be more active. Seemed. They promised regular updates. About monthly. There has been one noticable update since the Parity in August, which reintroduced some recoil. But so far nothing else.\nWell, except unstable servers. Hitreg worse then ever. Higher pings (way higher). and as of now, missions down for a week. And the servers down again.\nI still have hope for this game. Follow it and look for updates. Maybe all is not lost.","November 13, 2015","false","232.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No matter how fun the game is i cant give it thumbs up if its plagued with bugs.\n\nLong time ago back in beta i played this game on my first computer.  It had a giant memory leak so i couldnt play it for more than 10 minutes at a time.   That system had 8 gigs of ram.\n\nIt has been 2 years since i last played the game and what do you know... the memory leak bug is still present.  My current system is has an i7-4790k 24gb ram and gtx980.\n\nAs far as the actual game play.  It's fun because there's so much customization available.  You can change tons of things on your weapon and everything makes a difference in the way the weapon actually functions.  Same with the gear.  But again, no matter how fun the gameplay is, if you cant actually play then what's the point?\n\nThanks for reading.","March 20","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's right not P2W!\nBlacklight incorperates a system called "zen" and "cp" for purchasing weapon parts, gear ect. you can purchase all of the gear and weapons with CP by earning it through playing earning achievements while zen is bought with money. You can "rent" a gun part or gear item for 1 day, 7days and perm. What I've found the best way to do is to rent your items for the day (or  week depending on your play habits) and play a bunch of games, by the time it runs out you can probably just perm purchase it. You also get to try parts and gear for free when you level up! They also have a free weakly weapon reciever (gun bases like sniper rifle, LMG ect.) and a free hero (pre-made charecter set up with gear and weapons)!\nThis games is awesome and I'll playing it for a very long time.\n","October 7, 2014","true","99.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has great quality on textures and models and the effects also look great, the whole game is kept in a dark cyber version of modern urban enviroments. This might not be for everyone a good thing I personally however very much enjoyed the style of the game. The only thing that bugged me was the character models, they were good quality wise but just didn't float my boat.\n\nMaps and Gameplay: The maps look great just like everything in this game, however I have found that while the design wasn't directly bad it didn't flow too well.  The gunplay itself is good though even if it lacks recoil. The spawn rotation made it too easy to get spawn killed by a random guy on the other team that might not even be such a great player, this is made even easier through the "legal-wallhack" as some call it. It might seem unfair but since it is something everybody has available it is not in any way unbalanced. Unless you are playing on helodeck which is a small map with only three spawn points you should be fine though. One thing I particulary liked about the amount of customazition that can be done on guns and loadouts. Many options are offered for many guns.\n\nSound: The audio of this game is rather good however lacks interesting music(eg for the title screen) and oly has one dubstep-ish soundtrack.\n\nOptions: Oh my, the options menu is probably the best I have seen. It offers an extreme amount and detail in options\n\nFinance Model: In Blacklight: Retribution you have the ability to buy guns(and equipment) or rent them. This can be done via in-game or real world money. I don't want to get to deep into the matter what I can say is that you can gain pretty much everything through playing the game but while your 1st gun is fairly strong, opponents that  have put money into the game(and I mean alot, the guns are expensive) will have a slight advantage.\n\nConclusion: A very competent shooter, Blacklight: Retribution is a game for people that want to obsess over a game. If you are planning to drop-in and -out every once in a while then you should stay away from this game since the gifts you get for leveing up and renting guns both becomes completely worthless.\n\nP.S. The game has some technical issues but once you get to play it it's actually fun.","July 1, 2014","true","18.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sukaretto/recommended/209870/","Sukaretto","Utsukimi Jerry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sukaretto/","194 products in account","This Review is based on the post Parity Patch 2015.\n\nI've been playing this game when it was still a new and niche game. I spent hours and hours on the game because it was that addicting. The gameplay was fast paced and really good. Until when Zombie Studio decided to shift their focus to the PS4 version leaving the PC version with no updates for 1 year.\n\nNow with the Parity Patch 2015 the game is basically alive again. Slowly coming back to its former glory. Does it live up to its name now?\n\nGameplay : There are many things that have changed in the patch. Recoil is basically non-existant (To be changed IIRC) but it is still very easy to aim and shoot. The only thing that differs is the spread which does exist. Stamina was removed but instead replaced with unlimited sprinting which is nice. The game turns into fast paced cat and mouse game. Time To Kill is still very high since the game pretty much cranked it up to 11 thanks to the previously mentioned stuff.\n\nCustomisation : It feels awkward. As the interface is basically following the PS4 version of the game. I assume that the developers will change this in later updates but as of now it is very awkward. Having to go to separate menus just to change the receiver, muzzle, barrel and everything is cumbersome. Previously everything was on the same page and not having to press escape and click on another box for the correspondant customisation. Due to post parity patch inventory no longer exists and some stuff that was on the previous version went missing but it's fine. The pricing is waay better than before and since the game is following an unlock system because of no inventory it feels more streamlined.\n\nGraphics : It's a hit and miss at the moment. The game looks the same for the most part but buggy at best. Textures popping at wrong times causing hitching while playing. It'll be fixed in the future updates.\n\nMenu : Buggy mess but it works. Quick join works as intended but the browser is broken. Sometimes being able to join a server sometimes the browser just decides to pick a random server even though I clicked on the one that I want to play is annoying. This needs fixing asap. Oh and not to mention the hillarious 32 player servers ( I really wish they add this as a proper game mode) being in the game.\n\nFinal thoughts : Should you play this game? Yes. It is clear that the devs actually give a damn about the PC version again unlike another free to play shooter (I'm looking at you Loadout) and they are willing to spend time just to make sure that both sides of gaming is happy. The game will overwhelm you at first but give it few matches a try and you may just enjoy the game.","August 5, 2015","true","212.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

You might notice I have a number of hours on this game. This brings me to the first thing I do not like about this game. After you download the game, You do not get to play it, You have to wait for another download.. that is where my hours came from.. Now onto the game. When I first got into the game I was impressed, Seemed pretty good for A F2P, the graphics are nice, And there is not much wrong with the controls. But, After playing for awhile. I realised what A mistake It was to give this game a chance. The online community is rude.. Do not care about the other players experience. e.g. I spawned in got headshot before I could pull out my gun.. This game is very much Pay to win.. They try to hide it with the fact you can earn the guns, attachments and player customisation etc... Thats all good. But they absolutly screwed that by making all the higher leveled or Payed for guns completely OVERPOWERED!! And I do not say this lightly.. I would get into a gun fight with another player, I get the upper hand and shoot him first. He turns around and 1 shot later im dead and he walks away fine.. This completely destroys the gunplay. Sure there are alot of customisation options and you can make your gun all flashy.. Why not play TF2? "Oh but thats not modern or Realistic..." you might say.. First off this game is not realistic in anyway if your reading to find that out. And At least with TF2 you can enjoy yourself and there is a friendly community. unlike in BlackLight where I get called "Gay" Because I asked why I was dieing so easily. Your better off paying for Battlefield or cod.. Also the maps are pretty bad. And the mech's are nothing to talk about. They can be taken down by a soilder. I do not recommend this game to any friends.. And I would like to note I did play this for a couple of hours on about 7-8 servers.. So I don't think it was bad luck. If you think it is "FUN" To die constantly and listen to 6yo kids who can't save enough money to buy a good game and rather but flashy attachments yell at you.. Go Ahead and download this game, But if your a normal person. Just buy a good game... That is my review. Hope it helps.","February 8, 2014","false","24.9"," 28 of 54 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","28","54","0","12"

I really do. I loved the first game: tango down. And despite it flaws it was my fix for anxbox arcade game! So when I heard about retribution and it being an F2P I immdetiantly jumped on the fanboy hype train straight to mediocrity! Now the gunplay, as is: is very fun and solid. The "legal wallhack" as I like to call it keeps games fast and moving. But everything else is just god awful! Every single design choice zombie makes looks like they're taking it up the ♥♥♥ by their publisher rather than sticking out and doing what they want. People say the game isn't pay to win but it's damn close to it. It takes ages to unlock anything permanently so it encourages you waste 12 bucks just to waste it on 2 permanent weapons! And the balance is a lot like league of legends if you think about it: once they add something new, it's almost always op. There's no excuse to give this game a break for it being a free to play when games like dota 2 are out there and doing much better. The only redeeming quality to this is the uber customization options for your weapons and for the most part all weapon parts are side-grade (thank god) the game looks and run great and the combat feels very similar to cod's (in the good way and not the brown mushy crap kind of way) and lastly... ♥♥♥♥ING DUBSTEPS WUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUB!!! No, but seriously the soundtrack is pretty good and general level design is top notch and I find myself favouring most of the levels rather than ripping my hair out... I give the game a 5.5 A good attempt at a F2P but Zombie really ougtha try better next time, get a new publisher or go full indie... I can't recommend this game for personal reasons but I can understand why others would love this game.","December 2, 2013","false","97.0"," 84 of 165 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","84","165","0","8"

Over 800 of these hours are on my brothers steam account, before you question the 300+ it shows here.  I know the game inside and out and have loved it and hated it throughout my experience playing.  That said, in an attempt to keep this game going steady and not having it fade out within another year, as so many other games have once people starting doing nothing but complaining on the review pages, I implore that new gamers try this great game.  And I mean give it an honest go.  You wont be overly good at it within 10 or 30 hrs of playing compared to all the other veterans playing it now, but you will get there if you enjoy it, and Im sure so many of you will.\nIt has a few downsides, such as a server problem, which though it is taking a while, they still say is in the works to getting resolved. However, worst case senario, a match will end and the game will lose connection.  Just rejoin or find another game.  You will still get everything you earned from that game.\nNo, acheivements dont really work.  But, as most if not all acheivments, they do nothing for the game.  They are just meaningless tokens to show your friends what you've spent your time doing.  The game is great without them.\nThere are, very occasional in my experience, hackers, but ALL games have them and youll never fully be rid of them.  This game has suprisingly few and if you legitimately find one, report and votekick them and the issue is resolved for you.\nThose aside, ignore every other bad post out here threatening your time with this game.  They have very little ground to stand on.  I saw someone write a review saying they were banned for being too good.  I have been reported many times for being good, but never banned.  They can tell by the coding if you've been hacking or not.  So I question that persons honesty.  Were they really just good?  Or perhaps they weren't even banned.  Maybe something else happened, I don't know, but thats the first I've ever heard of something like that.\nAs for the game being dead?  It is NOT dead, but it has a small playerbase of die hards.  You can always find a game though, even if you have to wait in spectate mode for a moment and play with familiar people.  The games customer service and update progress is lacking.  But that is to be expected from PWE games and especially ones older than two years.\nIm sure there is a bunch more I could say that is great about this game, but I want to leave it for You to discover, like the incredible customization features and smooth gameplay (though you may have to turn your graphics down if you have an older computer like I do), great graphics and much better net code than BF4 if anyone experienced that travesty.  Though that one isnt saying much.  :P\nAlso, Ignore anyone who says this is pay to win.  That is complete nonsense.  They do not understand the meaning of the words.  Aside from camo, there is nothing you can buy in this game for real money that you cannot earn by playing.  Even with all the gear in the game, it will not make you a better player.  Stock armour and the stock assault rifle are some of the best,  most well rounded gear in the game.  If you can't do well with them, gear will not help you.  And for those who say, "but what about the heroes?" (which are premade characters basically), I assure them, everyone has its weaknesses and none of them are customizable, so they don't provide any advantage to a properly made custom character, or even stock for the most part.  But they are flashy looking. :P  I call them beefed up camos.\nLastly.  The only seriously OP weapons in the game (and dont get me wrong, the assault rifle is definately great) is the swarm, and the tomahawk (if your good with it).  You can cook grenades to be as effective as a tomahawk though.  The swarm is just plain silly.  If yousee or hear it, just run away if you can. lol  Once they get the shots off, the'll need another 1000 combat points to get another one out of the depot, so unless they are great players, or were very effective at using the last swarm, spamming swarms is restricted to two or three per person. at the end of a round.  Most people dont even use them in fear of being called a noob. lol\nI hope the time I've taken here will convince any doubters still on the fence, to try this game and help bring some of the community we had back.  This is an awesome game that deserves so much better.  I don't want to see it die out and I want the company to see it's still worth supporting.  If they dont want to support it, they better make another one that sticks to its roots, because I'll be driving down there and knocking on their door with a "save blacklight petition" to shove in their faces. lol\nHave fun gaming and thanks for reading.  Take care all.  <3\n\nS.","July 1, 2014","true","090.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's get into  the juicy stuff. The overall game is great no majer issues, you can get stuck on some models on the maps that aren't completely flat, such as the bombs. Which are in almost every map. Gameplay is fast paced, there's almost no "awkward silence" type gameplay where you can't see anybody and they can't see you. The gamemodes are pretty generic, TDM, DM, CTF, Zombies (onslaught mode), KOTH, stuff like that. The customization is practically LIMITLESS, everything about your gun you can change, and your character too, sadly, it sort of forces you to buy alot of the customization items instead of unlocking them, but i've put maybe 20 bucks into the game and i'm happy. Overall, i seriously recommend you try this simply because it's free and if you don't like it, you can uninstall it and never have to worry about it again.

I know I haven't really played much, but from what I can see, the devs are willing to take a chance unlike so many other FPS game devs out there. They show this by using, essentially, a wall hack.. There is a charge and you can't use your weapon but this helps make a very interesting game mechanic. This actually allows for strategy instead of run and gun because then you will just die because everyone sees you like a glaring error like a 9 in binary. The gunplay in this game is very satisfying. The guns actually feel like guns and the graphics are very nice.\n\nThe distinct future war torn setting gives it a very moody atmosphere and the art style is very pleasing to the eye. The graphics on this game are very nice, but I have to tone them down for a better fps so I can do better.\n\nOne annoying thing is the inventory system. If you've just downloaded Blacklight and you have no idea what you're doing, it can be very difficult to find out how to customize your loadout. I saw that I had got an smg and a combat rifle when i first logged in and I had no idea how to equip it. However, when it comes to competitive play, it's not going to be as good as casual because the people have played for soo long that they know exactly how to use the HRV (Hyper Reality Visor A.K.A the wall hack) so it's just a matter of who peeks the corner first. However this a very well built game that deserves more credit than many other fps games out there like Medal of Honour and Call of Duty. All in all, I give it an 8.8/10\n\nm8 that's gr8 i r8 8/8 gd b8 but that's my f8 ;)","May 17, 2014","true","61.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Gameplay modes are fairly typical for an online shooter, but where it really shines is in the controls. The gunplay feels smooth and polished, and almost every gun is unique and fun to play with.\nCharacters and weapons are customizable with options that can be purchased using in-game currency. You can opt to pay and unlock things sooner, or unlock them over time as you play, but unlike most games that use this model it never really feels like a disadvantage.\nAll weapons, down to the very first you get, are good for something and quite usable.

Over 800 of these hours are on my brothers steam account, before you question the 300+ it shows here.  I know the game inside and out and have loved it and hated it throughout my experience playing.  That said, in an attempt to keep this game going steady and not having it fade out within another year, as so many other games have once people starting doing nothing but complaining on the review pages, I implore that new gamers try this great game.  And I mean give it an honest go.  You wont be overly good at it within 10 or 30 hrs of playing compared to all the other veterans playing it now, but you will get there if you enjoy it, and Im sure so many of you will.\nIt has a few downsides, such as a server problem, which though it is taking a while, they still say is in the works to getting resolved. However, worst case senario, a match will end and the game will lose connection.  Just rejoin or find another game.  You will still get everything you earned from that game.\nNo, acheivements dont really work.  But, as most if not all acheivments, they do nothing for the game.  They are just meaningless tokens to show your friends what you've spent your time doing.  The game is great without them.\nThere are, very occasional in my experience, hackers, but ALL games have them and youll never fully be rid of them.  This game has suprisingly few and if you legitimately find one, report and votekick them and the issue is resolved for you.\nThose aside, ignore every other bad post out here threatening your time with this game.  They have very little ground to stand on.  I saw someone write a review saying they were banned for being too good.  I have been reported many times for being good, but never banned.  They can tell by the coding if you've been hacking or not.  So I question that persons honesty.  Were they really just good?  Or perhaps they weren't even banned.  Maybe something else happened, I don't know, but thats the first I've ever heard of something like that.\nAs for the game being dead?  It is NOT dead, but it has a small playerbase of die hards.  You can always find a game though, even if you have to wait in spectate mode for a moment and play with familiar people.  The games customer service and update progress is lacking.  But that is to be expected from PWE games and especially ones older than two years.\nIm sure there is a bunch more I could say that is great about this game, but I want to leave it for You to discover, like the incredible customization features and smooth gameplay (though you may have to turn your graphics down if you have an older computer like I do), great graphics and much better net code than BF4 if anyone experienced that travesty.  Though that one isnt saying much.  :P\nAlso, Ignore anyone who says this is pay to win.  That is complete nonsense.  They do not understand the meaning of the words.  Aside from camo, there is nothing you can buy in this game for real money that you cannot earn by playing.  Even with all the gear in the game, it will not make you a better player.  Stock armour and the stock assault rifle are some of the best,  most well rounded gear in the game.  If you can't do well with them, gear will not help you.  And for those who say, "but what about the heroes?" (which are premade characters basically), I assure them, everyone has its weaknesses and none of them are customizable, so they don't provide any advantage to a properly made custom character, or even stock for the most part.  But they are flashy looking. :P  I call them beefed up camos.\nLastly.  The only seriously OP weapons in the game (and dont get me wrong, the assault rifle is definately great) is the swarm, and the tomahawk (if your good with it).  You can cook grenades to be as effective as a tomahawk though.  The swarm is just plain silly.  If yousee or hear it, just run away if you can. lol  Once they get the shots off, the'll need another 1000 combat points to get another one out of the depot, so unless they are great players, or were very effective at using the last swarm, spamming swarms is restricted to two or three per person. at the end of a round.  Most people dont even use them in fear of being called a noob. lol\nI hope the time I've taken here will convince any doubters still on the fence, to try this game and help bring some of the community we had back.  This is an awesome game that deserves so much better.  I don't want to see it die out and I want the company to see it's still worth supporting.  If they dont want to support it, they better make another one that sticks to its roots, because I'll be driving down there and knocking on their door with a "save blacklight petition" to shove in their faces. lol\nHave fun gaming and thanks for reading.  Take care all.  <3\n\nS.","July 1, 2014","true","090.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's get into  the juicy stuff. The overall game is great no majer issues, you can get stuck on some models on the maps that aren't completely flat, such as the bombs. Which are in almost every map. Gameplay is fast paced, there's almost no "awkward silence" type gameplay where you can't see anybody and they can't see you. The gamemodes are pretty generic, TDM, DM, CTF, Zombies (onslaught mode), KOTH, stuff like that. The customization is practically LIMITLESS, everything about your gun you can change, and your character too, sadly, it sort of forces you to buy alot of the customization items instead of unlocking them, but i've put maybe 20 bucks into the game and i'm happy. Overall, i seriously recommend you try this simply because it's free and if you don't like it, you can uninstall it and never have to worry about it again.

Gameplay modes are fairly typical for an online shooter, but where it really shines is in the controls. The gunplay feels smooth and polished, and almost every gun is unique and fun to play with.\nCharacters and weapons are customizable with options that can be purchased using in-game currency. You can opt to pay and unlock things sooner, or unlock them over time as you play, but unlike most games that use this model it never really feels like a disadvantage.\nAll weapons, down to the very first you get, are good for something and quite usable.

Let's start with content. In-game content is constantly being updated and released. There are also numerous events held by the community, ranging from double-exp events to weekly free item unlocks. With the addition of in-game achievements, it now gives the player goals throughtout matches to attain. The second thing I'd like to talk about is actual gameplay. With the HRV, camping is no longer an issue (Though you can turn it off for custom matches). The HRV also speeds up the gameplay. Knowing where everyone is, relatively, helps to more accurately elminate players without the drawn out process of looking for everyone. Weapons have their own special feel and every mod you add to them will affect this feel. Customization is huge in Blacklight as well. From your player to your gun; from your taunts (my favorite ;D) to your emblem- The world is yours. The system of unlocking things per level is fair as well as pricing on in-game items. THIS GAME IS NOT PAY-TO-WIN. Everything that is unlocked can be bought with GP as well as Zen (micro transactions). All in all; Blacklight: Retribution has captured my attention for two years now and I hope it gets even better into the future.\n\nGameplay: 9\nGraphics: 9\nContent: 9\n\nOverall: 9/10","May 14, 2014","true","337.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first Blacklight amounted to, more or less, Call of Duty in the future.  Retribution has built up much more than that, with not just with really slick visuals that scale well from the low to the high end, but also UNIQUE gameplay mechanics, extensive and MEANINGFUL customization of both your character and weapons, tight handling, and, of course, the price tag.\n\nThis is one of the highest-quality free games out there, and no, it is not pay-to-win. Even though equipment can be bought with cash, every piece has a statistical tradeoff. The default equipment is the base from which everything else is built and is the most general/versatile. Everything gameplay-changing can be obtained at a reasonable in-game credit price and you can try out equipment for a day at the price of a couple games' worth of credits to see if you want it.

The character customisation is awesome too, with lots of gear to choose from. The highlight of the game is the HRV (Hyper Reality Visor) system which allows you to essentially see through the maps environment, spotting allies, enemies and other objectives, which really mixes up the overall gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes lots of freedom to customise every aspect of their character, or any FPS lover in general.","June 22, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The HRV system adds a whole new level of difficulty to the standard FPS game, and if you don't like HRV, you can try out hardcore mode with no HRV. The newest patch being  Onslaught, has been great. The Co-Op mode has brought a new life to my want to play the game. Graphics are great when PWE actaully patches the game right. The patch just after Onslaught somehow allowed me to play with medium settings instead of low settings all the time. I give this game a good 4/5 stars.

It totally kicks Call of Duty's ♥♥♥ by a huge margin; The graphic quality, the level of customization, and unique features makes this game amazing. The only drawback are microtransaction; but even without paying for anything in the game you could get really far and well, as long as you're patient and skilled in FPS shooters. The new update really helps; it makes gaining GP (the points that buys/rents you weapons and gun mods) so much faster and easier. If you cant afford a gun, but have a lot of time to play, rent one! Then you could stack up enough GPs to actually buy it!:) Honestly, this game is very underrated because its a freemium; don't let that fool you though, this game rocks.\n\nGraphic quality: 9 out of 10 (Pretty good for an FPS shooter)\nCommunity: 8.5 out of 10 (Not many annoying people here; though some people make it pay-to-win)\nGameplay/Fun: 9 out of 10 (Takes a while to be bored; so many ways to play it.

This is an extremely fast paced and competitive first person shooter. While the game boasts realistic graphics, a harsuit and a built in wall hack, none of these are extremely game breaking or significant. When it comes down to it, this is Call of Duty Black Ops 2 done right. The core gameplay is constantly entertaning and while updates are not exactly frequent, you won't mind it too much when you're destroying face.\n\nAnd it is absolutely free. While this has been acclaimed as a pay-to-win game, this isn't necessarily the case. Some of the in-game missions give you up to 2000 GP for simply running around. When you level up (which does not take long) you recieve a temporary bundle of equipment so you can test out new equipment. I recently made a new account and I have since been topping the boards with only the beginner Assualt Rifle. Not to mention, the weekly hero and weapon have been extremely in my advancement to level 10.\n\nHappy hunting agents!~","February 4, 2014","true","122.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll start by saying that the starting equipment is at the very center of average, which if you think about it, is a huge benefit due to versatility, the best of all worlds all rolled into your initial character, consider your first matches as practice, as you earn the in-game currency, (Which is given to you at a reasonable rate) You'll figure out the way YOU want to play, and you'll be able to tailor your gun and your armor to either make you move faster or take an extra hit while you're in the fray. There are so many minute variations in every single piece of equipment that your character can only end up being you. and the way you want to play.\nIf all that isn't enough the game looks gorgeous and is well optimized, even your old laptop can run this if you lower the settings.

Most of the guns and gun parts are side grades with the dafault AR being the best gun in the game but it will still be annoying to die from cheese weapons like the prox mine, shurikens and exploding tomahawk. If you have not played it yet you may want to try it, the game is still fun just don't expect anything you don't like to ever be fixed.","December 31, 2012","true","771.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GA2F/recommended/209870/","GA2F","gamesare2fun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GA2F/","193 products in account","Ok. So, i like this game. A lot. to put into reference, it blends to good parts of a lot of games. It feels a little like GR: Phantoms, has a mech like titanfall, has gun system out of loadout, etc. Now, it is a bit grindy, but i still havn't  felt any pressure to spend any real money on the game. And - with the default guns (and my trusty knife) i got top three a couple times (was 4th in squad most of the time) and MVP once (only been playing a few hours, mind you) against enemies of higher level (and scoring high than my own teamates who were higher level). Oh, and the kicker - you can see enemies through walls at any time - like the oracle ability out of phantoms, BUT it lasts for about a second and a half, you cant shoot during it, and it has a 5 or so second cooldown. What this means is, you spawn, know where to run to get action instead of boringly hunting for people, see someone, kill someone (piece of advice, pistol is much more lethal up close that an assault rifle, if you're in effective range, swap, the enemy probably wont, and you can hipfire them to death by emptying the mag in their lungs, and the basic assault rifle does almost nothing if you dont hit head, so, what i do is spray w/ rifle hipfire as i run up to them, then swap to pistol and finish them off, or punch them if they charge too.) then after killing them, you frantically sprint for some cubby hole to use as cover, hit the visor key, and spin quickly to see where the nearest enemy is all the while hoping that he isnt looking at you too. This game is incredibly skill based, not gearbased, just the last game i played (what inspired me to write this) was an event where i rounded a corner, and was staring down 3 level 8s (im level 3, remember) i panic-shot the first one and got his head - the other two took like a quarter of a second to react to my being behind them,  and as they spun around i swapped to pistol, spayed the next one down, started shooting the last one, and just as he was about to kill me (on like 5 health) he got about a step too close, and i punched him in the face. it felt amazing. Of course there was a guy behind me i didnt notice until i started to run for a cubbyhole who killed me like immediately after the experience, but i felt happy that i managed to kill three people who were over double my level with far better equipment.\n\nSo... with the story out of the way.... Time for the cons.\n\nSights are almost entirely useless, i won most engagments because i hipfired and the enemy took time to aim in - hipfire is accurate enough, and sights block too much of your view.\n\nIt. Is. Grindy. Im a few hours in, cant afford to buy a single thing. Got a few gifts because every level up gives you a couple gun mods - yea - but the game uses a gear "renting" system, where its cheap to rent for a day, little pricy for a week, and a fortune to buy permanently. Now, again, this is annoying, but it is skill based, the only reason to get a new gun is to look cool XD\n\nI run the game with almost max settings, on a solid 90fps, except on two maps. on these two maps, i get random stutters where the fps drops to about 2 for all of 3 seconds and then jumps back up - on these maps it happens any time i use my visor (to put it on or take it off when it runs out, so using it effectively immobilizes me twice on those maps) meaning i dont use the visor, and am at a disadvantage to the enemy team. I still managed to stay in the top half of my squad like this, as its the skill the matters more than the gear, but it was annoying and you develope the habit of flipping the visor on after every kill picked up pretty quickly, so all of a sudden having to make sure you don't is a bit odd. (now i know what it must feel like to use wallhacks in other games and the get banned and have to use an alt account)\n\noccaisonally at the end of a match, ill lose connection to the lobby. nothing more than a minor annoyance as i can join a new one in about half a second, and its at the end of the match so its not like im missing anything, but again, minor annoyance.\n\n\n\n\nSo, look, its free. What've you got to lose? give the game 3 matches, if you dont enjoy any of those three.... Try one more. I actually hated it until my fourth match, i felt the visor was cheap, etc. It was on the 4th when i was just about to quit that i started having fun and got hooked.","May 30, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Christian_Christian/recommended/209870/","Christian_Christian","( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Christian_Christian/","62 products in account","This is a very well built game that has unfortunately fallen under the radar. I know I haven't really played much, but from what I can see, the devs are willing to take a chance unlike so many other FPS game devs out there. They show this by using, essentially, a wall hack.. There is a charge and you can't use your weapon but this helps make a very interesting game mechanic. This actually allows for strategy instead of run and gun because then you will just die because everyone sees you like a glaring error like a 9 in binary. The gunplay in this game is very satisfying. The guns actually feel like guns and the graphics are very nice.\n\nThe distinct future war torn setting gives it a very moody atmosphere and the art style is very pleasing to the eye. The graphics on this game are very nice, but I have to tone them down for a better fps so I can do better.\n\nOne annoying thing is the inventory system. If you've just downloaded Blacklight and you have no idea what you're doing, it can be very difficult to find out how to customize your loadout. I saw that I had got an smg and a combat rifle when i first logged in and I had no idea how to equip it. However, when it comes to competitive play, it's not going to be as good as casual because the people have played for soo long that they know exactly how to use the HRV (Hyper Reality Visor A.K.A the wall hack) so it's just a matter of who peeks the corner first. However this a very well built game that deserves more credit than many other fps games out there like Medal of Honour and Call of Duty. All in all, I give it an 8.8/10\n\nm8 that's gr8 i r8 8/8 gd b8 but that's my f8 ;)","May 17, 2014","true","61.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The game already feels old once you play it more than one time. Buying items is also frustrating since you're using in-game currency to RENT (yes, RENT) items temporary. This makes the game difficult to play, and yet frustrating because you also have to deal with players who know their ♥♥♥♥, and have at least blew $50.00 just to get the gear that they want. As a noob who is curious into the first-person shooter genre, you wouldn't want to buy this game until you familarize with most first-person shooters. As an expert, you'll do wonders to this game. Like I said, the gameplay of this game is fun and you can play with bots if you need to practice, however, you won't gain any experience or gold for doing practice rounds.\n\nSo in order to get experience and gold to "RENT" better items, you have to play within the server, and it's not a good place to be in if you've just started. Players will beat you with their better gear, and makes this game frustrating to play. It's sort of like a pay-to-win game. You'll die multiple times to people who bought $150.00 worth of gear. This is not fair, and the game should implemet items like those of Team Fortress 2 where the weapons have better abilities, but won't give the player a higher advantage. Or, there should be an actual in-game currency where you can BUY stuff using the little gold you earned after losing a lot of battles to people who used money. In other words, this game is not fun if you don't have money.\n","August 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still a good game and very fair to F2P players but the skill gap for a beginner to experienced will seem very daunting. It may seem that there are a bunch of people hacking but a good amount of active players are just that good. Most of the guns and gun parts are side grades with the dafault AR being the best gun in the game but it will still be annoying to die from cheese weapons like the prox mine, shurikens and exploding tomahawk. If you have not played it yet you may want to try it, the game is still fun just don't expect anything you don't like to ever be fixed.","December 31, 2012","true","771.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It can run pretty well on lower end computers and can run with awesome graphics on better computers. This game is one the PS4 as well, and it just got out of beta and has its fair share of bugs and issues. For the most part though, this is one of my favorite games of all time. There are tons of game-modes such as team death mach and king of the hill but my favorite part is the amount that you can edit your guns. For example: You choose from a selection of at least 30 in each section. Sections: Muzzle, Barrel, Stock, Magazine, Scope, Weapon Tag, and weapon camo's.\n\nAnd BTW, this game is free to play, but its not pay to win. You can easily make your way high up the leaderboards without taking cash from your wallet. Just give the game a try. It's Free!\n\nI highly reccomend this game!!\n\nIngame Name: ChocolateHoe\n\n-Love, Patchez","July 15, 2014","true","207.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played BLR way back in Beta and loved it! However the F2P model then didn't make any sense to me and CS:GO had came out shortly after, So I had kind of dropped BLR all the way. Finally picked it back up earlier in 2016, revived my old account and wiped the dust off. I must say that BLR has come a long way since Beta. Even after the Parity Patch it still stands out as an FPS. New game modes, decently healthy server population, and a very good and genuine community that you wont find anywhere else in any other FPS. Best of all, it's FREE TO PLAY! So jump on and have a ball with legit wall hacks. (HRV) You can do a hefty amount of grinding to save GP to purchase items and weapons permanently, OR you could drop $20 into this game and already make a good amount of things permanent. Honestly, I feel this game could be worth even $40 with the amount of options and customisation you get. PLUS the best thing is, it supports this game and keeps it alive for F2Pers and Payers alike. Amazing game that'll keep you addicted to customisation as well as having a ball when you get dropped into a match. Absolutely recommend it regardless of what others are saying about the Parity Patch.\n\nTL;DR?\nDisregard what other reviews are saying and just download this game for yourselves. Form your OWN opinion on it. It's free to play. C'mon you aren't losing anything besides a few GB off of your hard drive.. In that case if you hate it, uninstall it. It's that simple. Form your own opinions and check this game out today. That's all I can really say guys.","March 28","true","127.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example: if you are a newbie, you are gonna be throwed in with better players (they have 22 lvl, 26 lvl) and they all bought weapons with money. As a veteran of CS:GO, recoil is important in shooting mechanic, but this is just CoD level, no recoil at all! You just go around the map and kill everybody without aiming down your sights, because it doesn't do much. This game yells: GRINDING. This is one of those games, in which you can buy a gun for a day for a small price, BUT if you want to buy it PERMANENTLY, you have to GRIND, or pay some premium coin sh*t to get it. For one permanent weapon you need to pay 8000 GP. After a match (I play deathmatch, because it's where I get the most GP) you'll get 10-50, 80-120 if you are a winner, or atleast you did good. You have to constantly grind, and grind.\n\nTL;DR\nGame is fun, P2W is strong with this one, if you are bored, play this game or if you like grinding.

I cant say that this game is good... you might be looking at my hours on my steam but thats just the hours I've played the steam version (I downloaded the ark version) I have close to 1500 hours into the game and every single moment of it was a new memory. I made tons of friends in the game with each a different personality. I even made myself sorta known in the game. This game was one of the best games I've ever played in my life (Multiplayer wise). No matter how much I want to recommend this game, I simply cant... all the bugs they promised to fix, they didnt. I've played this game for almost 2 years and not one bug was fixed. And this new Parity Patch they applied was simply just added more bugs into the game. No new content either besides some usless nades and a Bow. And me I was apart of the melee community that was made into this game. Before patch me and tons of other BLR melee finatics would go onto the custom melee servers and fight to the death with just melee items. But this new, "Patch" simply just removed all of it. and Now all of the melee clans that was in the game all simply died out. FAng, Pyro, Lynx(<<Bae Clan <3) all dead. You might say its a bit selfish to leave the game just becuase of no melee servers but thats not the only reason.

You need to save up for forever to buy something and even if its a scope it costs about 3000 GP or you can buy it with zen which has you pay for with real money. Guns are much more same with suits but this can be looked at a pro if you like a challenge.\n\nThat is about it, enjoy the game guys :)","July 27, 2013","true","323.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tons of grinding and hours upon hours is required to be atleast comparable with other veteran players. Once you have had around 20-30 hours into the game it becomes quite easy to grasp on as now you should be able to match most players out there. Graphics is top notch for a free to play game, and the gameplay is smooth and addictive. This game's model of free to play is considerable, as you are able to buy most of the guns and customizations without shelling out real money. But it requires a lot of in game currency in order to do so, and if you dont have the twitch shooting skill of a 12 years old on Spring break, youre gonna have a hard time getting along with the game.","May 11, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The HRV system is innovative and all which eliminated the use of maps in the game, however, UI maps were there for a reason. While using the HRV though, it made you vulnerable to attacks as the person you are seeing through it is coming around the corner which decreases your reaction time to engagement. In addition to the game's issues, there is a lack of new content maps, no new gear,no new weapons, no new armor,no new mechs... nothing. The player community is also lacking, you pretty much hit 'Quick Join' and you find yourself playing a game mode with all the players currently online... want to play team deathmatch or Kill Confirmed? Nope, sorry... you will find yourself in an empty lobby in one of those game modes. Aside from the negatives, the game has nice aesthetics, great customization features, and freaking MECHS!

If you looking for a fast paced shoot-em-up, this is your game. Make sure you bring friends though as getting through the first levels is easy but later leves it gets increasinly hard and, without friends, quite long.\n\nIf you're playing on Official Servers, there is a mode, which, to some users will seem reckless, called HRV, which is just a time limited wall hack. There are ways to hid yourself from this 'hack' but as with most other things in the game, have to be renewed constantly.\n\nAlthough you can call this game "Pay to Win", everything in this game which affects the outcome of any match can be bought using the in game currency that is earned by playing matches. Opposite of levels, you will earn little at first forcing you to constantly repurchase stuff, but after a while you will be earning so much you won't know what to do with all of it.  Another point to make is that, using Zen or the real money currency, you can perm (make permanent) more things than the in-game currency.\n\nThis game seems to be an excellent fast-paced FPS with an active community, low levels of hackers in private servers, and a great game to play to blow off some steam. (heh, you see what I did there?)\n\nAlso, as an addenendum, ownership of the game has transfered to Hardsuit Labs, and a large update is coming soon!","February 20, 2015","true","756.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But once you put all the right peices together, it feels amazing, although it may take awhile to unlock all the parts. The only thing that real money can buy, is boosters to help gain what you can get for FREE faster, apparel type stuff, or boxes which you open and get a random prize.\n\nAs a CS:GO player, I dislike how inaccurate the first shot is on the guns, but you can get it pretty damn close if you sacrifice all your damage, making it so you can be a headshot master.\n\nReasons to go back to this game since its first launch:\n\n-They also recently changed it so you can PERMANENTLY buy ammo mods, so you no longer have to rent ammo. (which was kinda a p2w thing back in the day)\n-They added quite a few new maps\n-They added about twice as many levels to the leveling system, which means more unlockables.\n-The cost of Weapon parts was signifigantly decreased, 1000GP a part, so you can get a permanent weapon peice after about 3 - 4 games.\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you make an extremely accurate, low damage gun, and can pull off headshots on jumping/moving targets, you can wreck all the call of duty kids.","September 8, 2015","true","160.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The second issue is alot more specific to a particular game mode, the one which Blacklight is most famous for, Onslaught. In this game mode (which i find very good as it allowed the players to not only combat with one type of zombie, but a variety) there are some zombies at the end of each round who, at their spawn point, stay still until killed regarless of the players position on the map, whether it be on the other side, or standing directly infront. This issue is minor, but it is an issue none the less. Finnaly, there is another flaw that i find with the game which involves the servers. After playing a while on a particular server, on a particular game ending ( usually after playing for a while ) the server, before you go to the cut scene of you standing on the right side of the screen and you see all the xp and gp you earned that match, the game will close down, saying "The connection to the server has been lost" after this message, you are re-directed to the servers list where the server that you were playing on still shows players in it, as if you were the only one that lost connection ( mind you that you get all the xp and gp after the match, however the awards such as chance packs you don't redeem unless you go to the main menue, where you will then recieve the awards in the usual fashion ) However, once you re-join that server you find no-one else to be in the server - everyone lost connection simultaneously. Although this happens at the end of a particular round, this happens regardless and is very distruptive to a game and annoying for the players who find a server that they like to be full, only for everyone to lose connection andthe server to be empty untill someone else joins.\n\nTo summarise, Blacklight:Retribution is a great game, but Zombie Studios still need to address the issues stated abve so as to make this game work to it's full potential, making the game more popular and thus Zombie Studios will be happy because they will generate a higher income from this game and so will the consumers as they will have higher quality content to enjoy.\n\nZombie Studios, please take the afformentioned issues to heart so this game may thrive.\n\nRegards,\nMichael Laden","December 21, 2014","true","233.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BUT, I was wrong then, this game is so much fun and it was SO MUCH FUN that i couldn't buy some money to that game. The gameplay is awesome, the graphics are awesome, just everything is awesome about this game. Only LITTLE thing is wrong in this : Most of the helmets suits and other ♥♥♥♥ are for real money.

Exploding Tomahawks, Proximity Mines, Stun Shurikens, etc.)\n- Zombie devs no longer give a ♥♥♥♥ about the PC version.

The game already feels old once you play it more than one time. Buying items is also frustrating since you're using in-game currency to RENT (yes, RENT) items temporary. This makes the game difficult to play, and yet frustrating because you also have to deal with players who know their ♥♥♥♥, and have at least blew $50.00 just to get the gear that they want. As a noob who is curious into the first-person shooter genre, you wouldn't want to buy this game until you familarize with most first-person shooters. As an expert, you'll do wonders to this game. Like I said, the gameplay of this game is fun and you can play with bots if you need to practice, however, you won't gain any experience or gold for doing practice rounds.\n\nSo in order to get experience and gold to "RENT" better items, you have to play within the server, and it's not a good place to be in if you've just started. Players will beat you with their better gear, and makes this game frustrating to play. It's sort of like a pay-to-win game. You'll die multiple times to people who bought $150.00 worth of gear. This is not fair, and the game should implemet items like those of Team Fortress 2 where the weapons have better abilities, but won't give the player a higher advantage. Or, there should be an actual in-game currency where you can BUY stuff using the little gold you earned after losing a lot of battles to people who used money. In other words, this game is not fun if you don't have money.\n","August 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many items in the store can be bought with real money but also with the in game currency (GP) which makes the game not a pay to win game. kind of like the League of Legends store. There aren't a vast amount of selection of guns but what shines is the customization of them. There are so many possible outcomes of guns that you can do to suit your preference.  Armor is also customizable to your liking in terms of health, running speed, etc. Leveling and getting currency may seem slow at first but comparing them to other shooters that involve the same type of buy/upgrade weps, it's about the same. Also, camping doesn't exist in this game =D\n\ni give this game 10/10.

The HRV also prevents you from shooting or doing anything except for moving when it's active and there is a short startup and cool down animation.\n\n-Friendly Community\npeople are nice. not noob mean and they wont bash you for no apparent reason. but with all community, there are a few exceptional jackholes who are out to ♥♥♥♥ you off. just ignore those few and its gonna be fine.\n\n\nCons:\n-Bugs after parity patch.\nwe were all very happy about the patch bringing in new content. but we arent expecting all the bus that came along with it. Onslaught didnt always work, private servers are never up previously, and the lack of a global chat killed the community involvment.\n\n-individual gun parts\ngun parts used to be universal. if u bought a part for gun A, and gun B is also compatible, you can use it on gun B too.\nnow you gotta buy the same parts TWICE if you wanna use it on gun B. and that sucks.\n\n-improper recoil after the patch.\nfirst time in my entire life i was able to build a full damage LMG and can still shoot in a straight line while spraying. I didnt believe what others said about the new recoil at frist, until i tried it out myself. it was funny tho.\n\n\nOverall, this game WAS fun. the new content that the parity patch bought in killed the game event more. it wasnt what we were expecting, it gave us hope only to cheat us on it. and it came too late. alot of good and skillful players have left the game and now I guess its finally my turn. the game is still able to give you a few good hours of fun, but only if you already have friends playing on it. this game had potential to be more, and Hardsuit Labs kinda threw that potential away.","December 10, 2015","true","790.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it just got worse and worse.\nIt wasn't pay to win at first. The weapons were fairly balanced. The sci-fi theme was nice and fine the way it was.\nFor some reason, that all changed. And the 'community' there is hopeless.\n\nThis game isn't the worst of the worst, it just scrapes across as 'Okay'.

It adds stuff most shooters don't have. Enemy team closing in on your buddy? No matter, raise your hand to your head and you can see  every single enemys position! Although, you have a time limit for how long you can see where your enemys are, before you have to recharge it. It really makes it a fair game for almost everyone, despite the fact that most of the guns are very, very, VERY expensive and require a lot of grinding. It is not a game for the impatient, if you can not handle playing for a couple of days on end grinding to get your guns, then I don't recommend it for you. I do however, recommend it to patient people/grinders. Anyway, thats just my opinion on it, if you don't like it, or if you do like it, then whatever!

The HRV system is innovative and all which eliminated the use of maps in the game, however, UI maps were there for a reason. While using the HRV though, it made you vulnerable to attacks as the person you are seeing through it is coming around the corner which decreases your reaction time to engagement. In addition to the game's issues, there is a lack of new content maps, no new gear,no new weapons, no new armor,no new mechs... nothing. The player community is also lacking, you pretty much hit 'Quick Join' and you find yourself playing a game mode with all the players currently online... want to play team deathmatch or Kill Confirmed? Nope, sorry... you will find yourself in an empty lobby in one of those game modes. Aside from the negatives, the game has nice aesthetics, great customization features, and freaking MECHS!

The gameplay and graphics are extremely refined, the maps and gametypes are all interesting and it has better production value overall than some bigger profile games.  The biggest downside is the god awful interface for managing items and getting new ones.  There are tabs and sliders everywhere with no rhyme or reason.  The other aspect of the interface is "buying" items and weapons in game because they tend to only last for a few days and then have to be discarded and builds remade.  It's not a dealbreaker level of an issue, but it does add annoyance to a game that has a lot going for it.","July 1, 2014","true","81.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tons of grinding and hours upon hours is required to be atleast comparable with other veteran players. Once you have had around 20-30 hours into the game it becomes quite easy to grasp on as now you should be able to match most players out there. Graphics is top notch for a free to play game, and the gameplay is smooth and addictive. This game's model of free to play is considerable, as you are able to buy most of the guns and customizations without shelling out real money. But it requires a lot of in game currency in order to do so, and if you dont have the twitch shooting skill of a 12 years old on Spring break, youre gonna have a hard time getting along with the game.","May 11, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was always held back by Perfect World, but with the rise of its most recent update bringing it up to speed with the PS4 and russian versions, it seems like it has finally caught up with its potential.\n\nThe only issue for me, as an OCE player, is the lack of servers for the area, which were there in the beginning but later removed. I hope for them to come back, but in the meantime there's local servers, which are a new feature from the last time I played. It's a free game that is certainly worth a try, and  has brought me many hours of fun (and with the update bringing me back to the game, hopefully many more).","July 29, 2015","true","264.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The biggest downside is the god awful interface for managing items and getting new ones.  There are tabs and sliders everywhere with no rhyme or reason.  The other aspect of the interface is "buying" items and weapons in game because they tend to only last for a few days and then have to be discarded and builds remade.

Many items in the store can be bought with real money but also with the in game currency (GP) which makes the game not a pay to win game. kind of like the League of Legends store. There aren't a vast amount of selection of guns but what shines is the customization of them. There are so many possible outcomes of guns that you can do to suit your preference.  Armor is also customizable to your liking in terms of health, running speed, etc. Leveling and getting currency may seem slow at first but comparing them to other shooters that involve the same type of buy/upgrade weps, it's about the same.

The developers have pretty much left this game out to rot and die. The game used to be pretty active and the free to play actually worked well and wasn't heavily pay to win. Boy, has that changed. You can have the fortune of getting into a match only to be killed by someone who's level 8 but has an Anti-Materiel rifle and is using incendiary ammo or some special ammo with attachments that would normally take a bit of work to get. Used to have 1 to 7 day rent periods for weapons and attachments, etc. Now the least is 3 days and sometimes guns will have a minimum rent of 5 or 7 days, this makes it to where, in my opinion, it's better to just wait a little longer and actually buy the gun. It's a shame that this has been left behind. Overall, the game might still be enjoyable to people who have been playing longer, but if you're new, don't expect to get into this game unless you're comfortable with spending a good amount of money to say the least.\n\n6.5/10 If the devs ever update and support this game again I'll change my review, but I don't see that happening.","December 15, 2014","false","71.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I cant say that this game is good... you might be looking at my hours on my steam but thats just the hours I've played the steam version (I downloaded the ark version) I have close to 1500 hours into the game and every single moment of it was a new memory. I made tons of friends in the game with each a different personality. I even made myself sorta known in the game. This game was one of the best games I've ever played in my life (Multiplayer wise). No matter how much I want to recommend this game, I simply cant... all the bugs they promised to fix, they didnt. I've played this game for almost 2 years and not one bug was fixed. And this new Parity Patch they applied was simply just added more bugs into the game. No new content either besides some usless nades and a Bow. And me I was apart of the melee community that was made into this game. Before patch me and tons of other BLR melee finatics would go onto the custom melee servers and fight to the death with just melee items. But this new, "Patch" simply just removed all of it. and Now all of the melee clans that was in the game all simply died out. FAng, Pyro, Lynx(<<Bae Clan <3) all dead. You might say its a bit selfish to leave the game just becuase of no melee servers but thats not the only reason. I could go on with a whole 5 paragraph essay on why this game isnt what it used to be but there are tons of reviews for that. -RCRedPanda","April 22, 2015","false","837.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

For example: if you are a newbie, you are gonna be throwed in with better players (they have 22 lvl, 26 lvl) and they all bought weapons with money. As a veteran of CS:GO, recoil is important in shooting mechanic, but this is just CoD level, no recoil at all! You just go around the map and kill everybody without aiming down your sights, because it doesn't do much. This game yells: GRINDING. This is one of those games, in which you can buy a gun for a day for a small price, BUT if you want to buy it PERMANENTLY, you have to GRIND, or pay some premium coin sh*t to get it. For one permanent weapon you need to pay 8000 GP. After a match (I play deathmatch, because it's where I get the most GP) you'll get 10-50, 80-120 if you are a winner, or atleast you did good. You have to constantly grind, and grind.\n\nTL;DR\nGame is fun, P2W is strong with this one, if you are bored, play this game or if you like grinding. It is kind of addicting, but I wouldn't spend alot of time, because there are alot F2P games, that are far better than this one. 7/10 not more.","March 23","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I've played BLR way back in Beta and loved it! However the F2P model then didn't make any sense to me and CS:GO had came out shortly after, So I had kind of dropped BLR all the way. Finally picked it back up earlier in 2016, revived my old account and wiped the dust off. I must say that BLR has come a long way since Beta. Even after the Parity Patch it still stands out as an FPS. New game modes, decently healthy server population, and a very good and genuine community that you wont find anywhere else in any other FPS. Best of all, it's FREE TO PLAY! So jump on and have a ball with legit wall hacks. (HRV) You can do a hefty amount of grinding to save GP to purchase items and weapons permanently, OR you could drop $20 into this game and already make a good amount of things permanent. Honestly, I feel this game could be worth even $40 with the amount of options and customisation you get. PLUS the best thing is, it supports this game and keeps it alive for F2Pers and Payers alike. Amazing game that'll keep you addicted to customisation as well as having a ball when you get dropped into a match. Absolutely recommend it regardless of what others are saying about the Parity Patch.\n\nTL;DR?\nDisregard what other reviews are saying and just download this game for yourselves. Form your OWN opinion on it. It's free to play. C'mon you aren't losing anything besides a few GB off of your hard drive.. In that case if you hate it, uninstall it. It's that simple. Form your own opinions and check this game out today. That's all I can really say guys.","March 28","true","127.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The HRV also prevents you from shooting or doing anything except for moving when it's active and there is a short startup and cool down animation.\n\n-Friendly Community\npeople are nice. not noob mean and they wont bash you for no apparent reason. but with all community, there are a few exceptional jackholes who are out to ♥♥♥♥ you off. just ignore those few and its gonna be fine.\n\n\nCons:\n-Bugs after parity patch.\nwe were all very happy about the patch bringing in new content. but we arent expecting all the bus that came along with it. Onslaught didnt always work, private servers are never up previously, and the lack of a global chat killed the community involvment.\n\n-individual gun parts\ngun parts used to be universal. if u bought a part for gun A, and gun B is also compatible, you can use it on gun B too.\nnow you gotta buy the same parts TWICE if you wanna use it on gun B. and that sucks.\n\n-improper recoil after the patch.\nfirst time in my entire life i was able to build a full damage LMG and can still shoot in a straight line while spraying. I didnt believe what others said about the new recoil at frist, until i tried it out myself. it was funny tho.\n\n\nOverall, this game WAS fun. the new content that the parity patch bought in killed the game event more. it wasnt what we were expecting, it gave us hope only to cheat us on it. and it came too late. alot of good and skillful players have left the game and now I guess its finally my turn. the game is still able to give you a few good hours of fun, but only if you already have friends playing on it. this game had potential to be more, and Hardsuit Labs kinda threw that potential away.","December 10, 2015","true","790.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well now Im starting to get annoyed by it. While the pararity patch gave us the features that the ps4 port had which was one of the things I complained about, it also comes with some...dissapointing features. Now every weapon is op just  some are more op than others (especially the smg, default ar, and the bfr) not to mention on the stream the devs gave away a bunch of these rare volk helmets which not only are they common now but now 30% of the community look like furries, same goes with the white night skin that was given from a later code. Oh and lets not forget the amount of GORE clan members who use the op bs toxic ammo like sissies.\n\nBut the biggest offense of all is this new thing called blacklight prime. Basically it lets you perm items and to be able to buy certain items as well. Not to mention you have to buy it with real money while everyone who played before the pararity patch got prime automatically the newbies arent so lucky...while it only costs 5 dollars the game has essencially became p2w. While I have rented everything for 1 day so far for all my items I have including armor and wep builds I still think that this is the dumbest f*cking thing I have heard from in a video game. Whoever came up with this idea should get fired to be honest.\n\nOther than that the game is fine but the annoying players who use toxic ammo and those who constantly own me kinda ruin it for me though updates should come and hopefully this will get fixed. If so I might update this review If I feel like it [ps I'll still play this game but atm its a love-hate relationship]\n\n\n\n\nOld reveiw: Let me quickly get this out of the way, I love this game, but what is keeping me from recommending it is the lag; and it is awful (at least to me). But I have comcast and lots of people hate comcast so that may be the cause. But Ive heard that quite a few amount of people have been lagging as well. Also this game is not dead, hardsuit labs; the devs of the game have talked about an update on the pc port, not to mention the ps4 version has more features (for example it has the gamemode kill confirmed while the pc port does not [yet]) and by the time Im writing this the devs are giving the ps4 port more attention. Sorry if you are not experiencing lag and you might be saying "this guy is stoopid his internet is crap thats all" this could just be caused by my crappy internet and not to mention this is my first review\n\nIf this gets fixed and If the pc port gets more attention again then I will reccomend it (if I dont procrastinate)\n[BTW it is not ptw]\n(yea I know I played this for more than 30 hours but Like I said I love this game)\n\nEdit:just realized that kill confirmed is on pc too.","March 21, 2015","false","212.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Tonnes of fun, highly recommend it to all.\n\nTwo things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off were the removal of the AU servers which made the game a lot harder and the customization area for weapon and armour changing is a pain.","February 10, 2014","true","410.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
