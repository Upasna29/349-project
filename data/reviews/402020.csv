This game has it in spades. Other qualities would include the pace and building of tension, the story itself, and the fear factor. The Park does them all very well, especially in the second half of the game where a progression device is used to masterfully build tension, fear and general unease.\n\nMany reviewers, even some of the popular professional reviewers, state that they finished the game (or "beat" the game) in an hour or two. It took me almost 4 hours to read everything, get all the achievements, and experience it the way it was likely intended. Without spoiling anything, the second half of the game has readables that change as you progress. This device is what helps to build the tension, reveal clues in the story, and heighten the sense of horror. So I can imagine that many players didn't give the items a second (or even third or fourth) look after reading them the first time, if at all. I suppose it is possible to finish the game in under two hours IF they ran the entire game and didn't bother to check all interactive items. But doing so would rob you of the actual game experience. This is not a game to "beat", but a game to experience. Those of the tl;dr generation, or of the mindset to beat a game as fast as possible and "win" will likely not enjoy or appreciate The Park. Instead, it is rather like a short story from one of the early collections of Stephen King, or The Bachman Books. Perhaps even a PG-13 version of Clive Barker's Imajica or The Books of Blood ("We're all books of blood... wherever we're opened, we're red.") So if you were the type of fourth grader who preferred Koontz over Blume, The Shining over Superfudge, you will probably enjoy this.\n\nThat being said, the price point of 12.99 is too steep for a game that is less than four hours long. This puts the hourly rate between 3 and 6 dollars an hour, far too much. The appropriate price would be 4.99US. A dollar an hour is generally as high as I am willing to go for any game, and for that, it better be good.\n\nI do hope that Funcom decides to make more vignettes like this, set in The Secret World style, or even a full length feature for single player. The fact that it's Multi-Player Only is all that is keeping me from playing The Secret World.\n\nIn summary, The Park is a great experience for true psych horror fans, but wait for it to go on sale at least 75-80% off.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=565882318","December 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 263 of 303 people (87%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","87","263","303","19","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/recommended/402020/","littlequillybunny","♫Quilly Shiba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/","4306 products in account","Overview:The Park is what I call an "experience" game, kind of like an interactive movie, and is very story heavy. It took me about 2 hours to complete, including starting a new game to grab an achievement I'd missed at the beginning of the game. It is a horror game, but if you're looking for something with more replayability, this game doesn't really provide unless you just really liked the story or environment and wanted to play again.\n\nWorth it for an "experience", but if you're looking or a horror game with more interactive elements such as stealth and combat, you could probably get something else great at the same price instead.\n\nThoughts, story wise:Very simply put, you play as a mother looking for her child in an amusement park. However, things aren't what they seem on the surface, as the park turns nightmare-ish, and you're not sure if you're in the present time, or in reality. I would say that the game starts to pick up around the third ride or so, as you start finding notes that hint at the park's past. As the game progresses, you also start to find out secrets and mysteries of your own past, and of your relationship with family and son.\n\nPros/cons:\nI felt that the game, while very slow in the beginning, really picked up in the second half. The ending left me pondering, the story made me debate and sympathize with some more heavy subject matter the game brought up. The characters are very human, and possibly even people that you could meet and see around in real life, and putting myself in her shoes was definitely a wild and dark roller-coaster ride (no pun intended).\n\nI feel that that some aspects could be improved, for example the pacing in the beginning, or perhaps fleshing out the story a bit more. I knew enough to piece together things in my mind, and definitely don't mind ambiguity and intrigue, but some parts were definitely not really linked together. (Perhaps there was some reference to The Secret World that I didn't get, but I played TSW for some time and there was no info that I really understood to patch up those missing links. If you have info, please don't hesitate to let me know!)\n\nThoughts, gameplay wise:The game is in first person perspective, and you can toggle running or walking. The menu has enough graphics options including field of view (important to me!). Mostly you try to follow your son's voice, and there are cutscenes triggered at each location, that convey story and atmosphere. The initial locations are more cutscene oriented, but in the second half, especially in a good part of the game, you have more interactivity. I found that this suited the game to convey this story - it's not survival and there's no combat.\n\nOne big thing I hope that can be improved, is the size of writing on the notes you pick up throughout the game. The writing is unproportionally small so may be really difficult to read on smaller screens.\n\nEnding remarks:I got the game at launch, which was $7.55 Canadian $. For an "experience" game, I felt it was worth it, like how I would pay $10+ for a movie at the theatre. The story was good and I felt I got what I was looking for, psychologically.\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~","November 5, 2015","true","4.0"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","84","94","0","6"

For only $10 I guess I can see it's appeal maybe for the seasonal interest?\n\nHowever the plot becomes obvious within about the first 15 minutes, and no there isn't any twist by that far you have probably figured out almost the entire plot.\nThe gameplay is about an hour long, maybe 10-20 minutes longer if you intentionally go as slow as possible to collect and read every note page.\n\nHalf of it is on rails, as in you literally just sit and watch, the other half is just following a path and reading papers you find, that is it, there is no gameplay beyond that.\n\nHowever what really makes me say this game isn't worth it wasn't all that. I actually think for only $10 it still has enough intrigue, and provided enough of a very short thrill that maybe it could have been a 6/10 game rather than a 4/10 or less type game.  They should have more developed and used these creepy beings, and tried to create something you can get excited about- because that never happened for me. When you finally feel the game might be getting to it's highest peak (which would be the minimum requirements of any other decent title), it just ends. It cuts short without delivering what you probably bought the game hoping for.\n\nAll in all this is about as a scary as say, something goosebumps related, but it was intended for adults with an adult theme; which might have been fine had it been excuted properly.\n\nHowever it is halloween, so if you want to give it a go and literally don't care about spending $10 for one hour of medicore entertainment, then go for it, it is not the worst game you could play, and it does have a few legitimately creepy moments. I only just barely don't recommend it simply because it could have just been a tiny bit longer to give them the time and room to actually deliver on their suspense, or to flush out the rides, or something more in depth to add some actual gameplay element of some kind.\n\n(Ps: Since I know people looking at reviews love to look at playtime, I stopped to actually read every single letter I could find in detail, and doubled back in some areas, and finished in about an hour and 10 minutes, the other 10 wasn't game time.\nAlso if your game crashes a few times on start up, it seems to just go away for the rest of the play session when you get it up and running, at least I hope- it stopped after a few start up crashes for me anyways)","October 27, 2015","false","1.2"," 603 of 872 people (69%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","69","603","872","24","39"

The place is filled dark corners, creepy faces and eerie notes. The game is similar to Dear Esther and Gone Home in the sense that there is no action or combat. It's simply a story-telling game.\n\nThe notes you find shed some light on some events that might have happened in the park. As you play through the game, you uncover more of the interesting story. Luckily, the voice acting is good, because there's quiet a lot of it. Your character will talk to herself when she sees certain objects, or describe a memory when you walk somewhere. It's interesting to listen to it all because it's nicely written.\n\nApart from having basic interaction with stuff like notes, you can also right click to call out to your son, which will also give a visual representation of where you can go next incase you are feeling a bit lost.\n\nThe environment itself is pretty spooky. Plastic faces of mascots, and a few shadowy figures. There are jumpscares, but they're didn't manage to annoy me like most games do. The game isn't filled with them, and they only really happen because you're on edge from other stuff.\n\nKeep in mind, the game can be beaten in around 2 hours if you fully explore and read everything, so it is a short experience, however I found it an enjoyable one. Overall, a well sculpted game with good story telling!","October 27, 2015","true","4.3"," 233 of 341 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","233","341","15","11"

The game playthrough is roughly equal to watching a movie, not at all difficult. So if you are looking for a quick playthrough this is the game for you. As for the story, if you are a fan of suspense/horror then the game really doesn't have anything plot wise that is new. BUT, the environment and detail they put into the park is fantastic.

As such, this game tackles some pretty heavy/unpleasant themes, and may cause emotional distress for some.\n\nIntroductionAfter her son Callum runs into ‘Atlantic Island Park’ after hours, Lorraine must venture her way through the chilling macabre amusement park to find him.\nThe heavily narrated ‘game’ is more aptly considered a story or an experience; there is no combat or action involved, and very few interactions available.\nThe Park has mastered psychological horror perfectly, not relying on cheap jump scares or excessive gore, yet still managing to scare the player witless. The dark and disturbing scenery adds to the unnerving atmosphere of the game, and makes it easy to become fully engrossed in the story and the character you are following.\n\nStoryLorraine first appears as the average mother, speaking of her worries and struggles as a parent. Venturing further into the park, and further into Lorraine’s thoughts, you realise that she is far from average. As you follow Lorraine’s journey, you begin to question the validity on what she is experiencing. Her paranoia and obvious mental instability are further emphasised as the game progresses, most evident towards the end of the game, with clues about her past shown in cutscenes throughout.\nThere is a clever parallel to a children’s fairy tale evident in the game. Similarities are shown through Lorraine’s stories (if you really pay attention), and hints are present throughout.\n\nGameplayAs this is more of a walking simulator, there really isn’t much to the game in terms of difficulty/challenge/gameplay. Essentially all you are able to do is walk/run, and interact with a few objects (usually notes or similar). You are also able to ride the few attractions in the game.\nBecause the game is more of a short narrative, there is no real replay value to it, and it takes roughly 1-2 hours to complete the entire game.\n\nVoice ActingThe Voice acting in this game is tremendous. The most chilling and unsettling part about this game isn’t the jump scares, the gruesome scenes you read about in the notes or the creepy park mascot, Chad, seemingly stalking you throughout the game. It’s the perfectly illustrated story, the emotion behind every word told by Lorraine, portrayed by Fryda Wolff. You can feel the struggles Lorraine is experiencing, the dread in her voice as she recalls past events. What makes this game go from good to great, is Fryda’s portrayal of Lorraine.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics are fairly standard. There’s nothing over the top spectacular in this department, but it is still a pleasant viewing experience.\n\nOverall VerdictThe Park is an immersive psychological horror experience, definitely worth getting if you like the genre. The storyline is compelling, and it’s definitely a game that will stick with you.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10","November 29, 2015","true","2.1"," 53 of 67 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","53","67","4","7"

Many people who have played TSW will recognize that this is the exact same amusement park they get to play around in after leaving Kingsmouth, albiet the TSW version is rundown and abandoned. If you didn't notice it was the same amusement park, perhaps it's time to delve into the lovecraftian themed mmo again.\n\nThe Park is a walking simulator game with psychological horror elements, however, the game also is very story driven and focuses on exploration of the environment as well.\n\nYou are Lorraine, a young single mother, who has taken her brat... I mean child... to the Atlantic Park, and just as you are getting ready to leave, find out that your childs favorite teddybear is lost. Like any good parent, you go to the information to see if it is in the lost and found bin (instead of being like any NORMAL parent who buys another one for the brat), and as you're talking with the information staff you find that your son has run into the the amusement park.\n\nConveniently, the park is starting to close for the day, and the friendly staff member who knows you on a first name basis lets you back into the park to catch your son. As you enter the park, the lights magically change from afternoon to the witching hour and your brat has run so far ahead that it is impossible to catch up with him.. that and the fact you spend your time leisurely riding each ride you come across instead of actually trying to find him.\n\nThe deeper you get into The Park, and the more you explore, the higher the fear is, and the more you realize that there is something dark, unwelcoming, and unloving about the park.\n\nThe good\nThis game has alot of good going for it, almost enough to make you overlook the fact that it is a Funcom game.... almost..\n\n+ Graphics are absolutely goregous and run smoothly, character model faces however, use the same engine as TSW, which for me was lackluster.\n+ Sound effects are not loud and overpowering\n+ Superb voice acting for Lorraine. You can hear the fear in her voice at times, as well as the anger later on in the game.\n+ Easy achievements for those who care about those things.\n+ Very atmospheric and immersive given the genre and length of game.\n+ Player Character is very relatable, isnt a super hero.\n\nThe Ugly - Right away I crashed. A great reminder that this game was indeed, a Funcom game.\n- Length of game was rather short, and the first half of the game felt a bit forced to me... another great reminder that this is a Funcom game.\n- Lack of ability to jump or traverse uneven terrain. This really irks me, because for a game that wants you to explore, you're limited to JUST the park paths.\n- Game not overly scary. For a psychological horror game I was expecting more... well... psychological horror.. and in fact I only had three moments where I was genuinely creeped out before the last twenty minutes of the game.\n-I did not actually care for the ending. I wont go into details why, but for me, it was just underwhelming.\n- About 80% of the notes, letters, and other clues were mostly unreadable to the normal eye. I had to get really close to the screen to make out the clues. (Thanks SuperDean for reminding me of this!)\n\nThe Conclusion\nThe Park in all intents and purposes, is a successful walking sim game, and works as a psychological horror game. It is executed fairly well, despite some flaws and personal issues with it. It delivers some genuinely creepy moments and can be played in one sitting. However, the game does not offer much replay value, other than to be used as a part of halloween game week/day once a year. I bought this at the pre-order price, and for that price, I feel it was well worth that discounted price. Even if I had paid the full price for the game ($12.99 USD) I feel it would have been worth it.\n\nDefinately recommended for those who enjoyed The Secret World, or who like games like this and don't want to pay the regular price for Among The sleep.","October 31, 2015","true","3.0"," 60 of 79 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","60","79","4","7"

If you despise the idea of a walking simulator, you can stop reading right now. Because that is what you do. There is very little interaction. Instead the narrative is the strong element of this game. You constantly discover new pieces of the story and try to find out what is going on. I won't say more (everything would be a spoiler).\n\nAll I can say is that the game gets darker and more intense with every minute. The horror element is not too bad (yes, there are a few jumpscares). And the finale is really nice. I can't say I completely understood what happened in the end (it's a bit open to interpretation). But it left me thinking about the different possibilities, and I spent 20 more minutes in the forum to find out what others think happened. I think this is a good sign, right?\n\nSo yeah, I liked it. You just have to ask yourself, are you willing to pay 10 bucks for 90 minutes of entertainment. I am completely fine with the length of this game. But I know many people will not be. So if you are interested, but think 10€ (13€ once the release discount expires) is too much, maybe wait for a 50% sale.","October 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 78 of 112 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","78","112","3","0"

You are a mother who has "lost" her child, and you enter into an eerie park to look for him. You start off by taking a ride on a few attractions - the Tunnel of Tales, where you hear the story of Hansel and Gratel, with one twist in the end. Then there's the Ferris Wheel, a spinning ride and the Roller Coaster, before culminating in the House of Horrors.\n\nIn between you read notes and letters, and there will be some strange occurrences and possibly jump scares.\n\nI would say that the atmosphere of the game is great. I really liked how we can "ride" the rides. Nothing particularly out of the world, but well done regardless. There are some themes and monologues about motherhood as well.\n\nThere are no puzzles to solve really, nor are there any other major traditional gameplay elements. You can use the right mouse button to call out for your son, and also to find objects of interest, but I didn't think it was an essential mechanic at all.\n\nOverall, I thought the game was pretty decent. Spot on atmosphere in particular. The graphics are fine as well.\n\nThe only big issue I had was that the ending was just too drawn out. You keep replaying that same segment like 5 or 6 times. Could have been done more briskly that. Aside from that, the optimization seems to be a tad lacking. Had to cap the game at 30fps to get a smooth framerate.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say I liked it more than Gone Home. The setting is interesting. The horror is pretty fair as well I'd say. It's not an essential game for sure, but if this kind of a genre floats your boat, then surely give The Park a go.","October 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 132 of 212 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","132","212","7","10"

First if you are a TSW (mmorpg) player or ex player and second as someone with absolutely no connection to it.\n\nAs a TSW player:\nYou buy this game to support Funcom, expand your tsw lore knowledge and enjoy one of the more iconic locations from the game in detail.\nOr to be more honest to get the chipmunk outfit and a ridiculously overpowered P2W talismans that you cant get any other way (which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tbh)\n\nNon TSW player:\nWhat you have here is 1 maybe 2h walking simulator. There is virtually no interaction to speak of.\n-Graphics are good enough.\n-Story is where i would say you will most likely find enjoyment if you like dark psychological horror themes, just dont have high expectations. I did not find it scary, and most scare attempts were made using very obvious and predictable techniques. This resulted in game not feeling creepy or even suspensful.\n-Performance is not really optimal and some rigs might have issues.\n-Do not rely on calling out Callum for direction he is a troll, use the maps.\n-God damn sprint is slow\n-Near end of game you will be going through the same room and stairs over and over, this is not a bug just annoying as hell.\n\nOverall:\nWould i suggest buying the game at 13 euros. Hell no !    Wait for a deep discount, 4 euros or so at most , unless ofc you need the items for TSW pvp , then well do you really have a choice.\n\n\nComing as a 3y old TSW player i dare say it is not up to standard.\nQuality of TSW storytelling and atmosphere upon the games release and first few issues was among the best ever in gaming and certainly in any mmo. Sadly after a rough start the main storyteller and designer Ragnar Tørnquist left and game never really recovered from it.

If you have yet to dive into The Secret World, now that the monthly paywall has been removed, I would highly suggest you do so as still to this day The Secret World remains one of the most unique MMO's I have ever experienced definitely breaking from the standard MMO tropes seen in most MMO's today and it's a game that offers something genuinely unique and exciting that is well worth discovering. Having said that I suppose the first question that might pop into your head is does a person need to have an intimate knowledge of The Secret World to appreciate The Park. Well...yes and no.\n\nAs a stand alone adventure for a gamer with no immediate knowledge of The Secret World there is still much to enjoy here but as a player who has dedicated hundreds of hours to the MMO, occasionally diving back in now and then - to put it bluntly - The Park is a treat. Players of The Secret World will immediately recognize the Atlantic Island Theme Park that is situated in the Savage Coast zone, which this time gets to take center stage. In The Secret World it's a dark and foreboding place to visit and not somewhere you would genuinely want to find yourself lost let alone looking for a missing child which is how the story to The Park opens.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543251039\nTaking on the role of a mother, Lorraine, whose child has recently gone missing in The Park your task at the onset is to find and locate the boy. The Park is a a game that is clearly heavily influenced by previous games of this nature such as Gone Home, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Dear Esther. It is a solely narrative focused game as you walk around the dilapidated park, a park that was closed down due to some dubious on-goings in the past, uncovering clues in the form of letters, books, newspaper articles and reports that further the story along. There is no inventory so you won't be bothered with collecting things nor will you be required to solve any sort of puzzle along the way. If you go into The Park expecting anything more you will be setting yourself up for disappointment. If like me, you enjoy a good and twisted, and in this games case slightly demented, psychological horror short story that drip feeds you in the beginning before unraveling at a clip as you near completion then yes it's possible this game may be for you. Did I mention that things go bat-♥♥♥♥ crazy towards the end. No! Well prepare yourself for some pretty intense sequences that earn the game its mature rating. If you are the kind of person that is easily disturbed then I would advise you approach this one with caution as some of the elements the story touches on like mental illness might strike a chord.\n\nWithout giving too much away I found this story of unrequited love, depression, mental illness and psychosis to be fairly effective and the game does get genuinely harrowing towards the end with just the right amount of jump scares to root it firmly in the realm of horror. One thing that deserves a special mention is the audio design which in a horror game is one of the elements that are  tantamount towards it success. The Park delivers and effective soundscape to go along with the twisted visuals. It will definitely raise the hairs on the back of your neck and for the most part have you constantly looking over your shoulder. Graphically the game looks great although its quite hardware intensive and on my laptop I had to downgrade from 1080p to 900 in order to get a stable 30fps. Granted my system is nearing four years of age now so I suspect that modern cards and machines will have no problem running the game at a full 60fps.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543012198\nThe Park had me enthralled from beginning to end even when I kind of deduced which direction the story was headed fairly early on in. That didn't stop me from wanting to continue exploring The Park (which is an absolute chilling delight as you get to enjoy most of the dilapidated rides the park has to offer) and seeing how the game would fully resolve itself was definitely a driving factor. I was even genuinely shocked by the games denouncement. I also loved how FunCom added little visual treats that will be instantly recognizable to any one who has had the pleasure of delving deeply into The Secret World. If FunCom plans on pushing out more of these single player stories based around the MMO; I for one will be delighted. While some may balk at the price for what is essentially a 2 hr experience, if the experience is going to be this fully charged and thrilling then you can count me in. You can most definitely count me in!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 96 of 165 people (58%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","58","96","165","11","15"

It's full of frights, general creepiness, intriguing lore and the frenetic search for a lost loved one all woven into an effectively told AND experienced dark tale.\n\nGraphics: 8/9 - The graphics are well done overall. Nice details, shadows/lighting, especially in the world around you. In comparison to other games on the market, I'd have to say it's an 8. The character models feel/look odd at times.\nBut in comparison to it's parent TSW, it's definitely a 9. It is awesome to see the "historical" versions/interpretations of a familiar sight in the TSW world.\n\nSound: 8 - The audio/bgm is appropriate, quietly brooding and dark. The voiceover work is well done and the voice actor cast for Lorraine was compelling and appropriately cast (the voice fits the game character).\n\nGameplay: 7/8 - It's simple and basic enough to make it non-obtrusive and keep the immersion intact. (which can be a double-edged sword) My only complaint isn't about the gameplay mechanics, or the length of the game, it's about the fact that I could not change my key or controller bindings. It's a subtle thing, but important for some folks that might have handicaps or are very preferential when it comes to keys (I'm VERY left-handed and prefer to use my numeric keypad for most things when using kb/m combinations). Also, it would've been nice to have a Zoom in/out feature for the lore items (notes, pamphlets, etc.) that you can pick up or interact with. Some of those fonts were just hard to read on my 52" TV and my 27" LED monitor.\n\nStory: 9 - It was a well-told, immersively dark tale worthy of the TSW universe. I have no complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride (figuratively and literally.. since there are some in the game. hehe)\n\nValue: 9 - This is MY personal opinion. The amount of money paid for the amount/duration of entertainment I experienced made it worth it. Some people don't like the length of play time. Alot of those folks are A->B people, the kinds of people that don't stop to enjoy the world around them, to look through and embrace the lore presented. There's nothing wrong with it. I'm not one to judge. But neither should you. You are the ones that miss out, though, when you "don't stop to smell the roses". I enjoyed myself. It was worth the price tag. Like a good horror movie at the theatre.\n\nOverall Score: 8","October 27, 2015","true","4.1"," 60 of 105 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","60","105","2","3"

In my opinion the ending didn't pay off as well as I think the developers were hoping it would, and it would of been nice to see it handled a little better with (again) better musical backing to try and really increase the tension and atmosphere. I'm sure some people would be happy with the current music arrangement though, it's a matter of personal choice I guess. It works pretty well.\n\nThe level design is pretty good and the effects are clever, there are also elements that add more to the backstory if you're interested in that. The story in general I think can be explored quite deeply, the ending has quite a twist which is somewhat predictable I guess, but well done anyway.\n\nWhy did I refund the game? Well to put it simply there was no replayability and I completed it in a very short amount of time. If there was a New Game + kind of option so you could play the game again but with a slightly different story, or even mod tools to create your own short horror experience then it would  be a truly great game, but for me it was a little lacking in content. Still happy to give it a good review though as it was a fun experience while it lasted.","January 14","true","1.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/402020/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?"The Park" is a very short narrative horror game (approx 2 hours' gameplay) set in a spookily derelict theme park.  You are seeking your son who ran ahead of you and has vanished out of sight.  As you search for him, you'll start to unravel the history of the park as well as begin to experience more of the horrors within both the park and yourself.  It's a game that probably merits the unfortunate tag "walking simulator" but in a positive way.  It doesn't feel laboured.  It plays equally well with gamepad and keyboard/mouse.  The story is dark and mysterious as it unfolds.\n\nIs it any good?It's VERY atmospheric.  If you like the idea of wandering around a small, desolate theme park in the dark, and to perhaps experience some of the rides as the story is narrated, this is a game you'll enjoy.  The horror elements are really well done, with a few small jump scares but no cheap tricks.  What was especially pleasant was to find my character had arms and legs, full reflection in mirrors and a shadow that occasionally made me jump when cast against a wall (bigger devs please take note - it was very nice not to be a disembodied head)!  The gamepad controls were very simple too.  A joy to play and, while sadly very short, a rich and dark experience as a psychological mystery unfolds, leaving you to ponder what on earth it all meant, and what your part in the story might have been.  The graphics, once inside the park, are tremendous, giving an EthanCarter-like vibe to the game.\n\nAnything not to like?I had a couple of glitches in trying to get it to run properly but a restart resolved it (my gamepad refused to be recognised at first).  The game is very short indeed, but I suspect it's meant merely to be a teaser game for Funcom's "The Secret World" (an MMORPG with free 7-day trial).  There isn't a concrete conclusion to the ending - which I imagine is deliberate, leading you to wonder who and what (can't say more because spoilers, but the story IS good).  There seemed to be a few loose ends where some things weren't explained, but again, that might have been artistic license rather than fault.\n\nIs it worth it?Personally, I think it's a wee bit short for the price, but the experience is worth it (if you played the equally excellent "Homesick" also on Steam, it's a similar sort of experience - different tale obviously).  On balance, I'm glad I bought it but the replay value (as with all games of this genre) is probably not that great.  I expect I will play it again at some point just like I'd watch a good movie again, but there won't be any variation in gameplay.","November 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

But with this they also made each of the ride areas bigger and you can jump on any of the rides. One of the rides that was given an improvement over the mmo was the swan ride which has become much more creepy and not just a pit.\n\nThe dynamic voice that is bound to right click on your mouse is interesting but I seemed to have been using it much more then they planned as the same lines kept getting repeated over and over and only factored in where I was in relation to the story and not in relation to were I was in the park.\n\nThis also detoured me from exploring,  I was always trying to follow a voice which I never saw the boy and always felt like I should move on instead of looking at a piece of paper or jumping on a ride in order to find the child whom never appeared.\n\nIt would of been nice if he showed up more and became like a ghost when I tried to grab him.. leaving the note or me jumping on a ride when trying to grab this illusion and I feel it would of fit the story well if they did that and would of been the type of hand holding which would of encouraged me to fully experience everything that was there instead of feeling conflicted about looking at something vs following a voice.\n\nCrashes and Framedrops: There seems to be a crash at the start of the game when you adjust the brightness, reloading after setting seems to make this crash go away. Frames were all over the place sometimes really high sometimes really low and so it was somewhat jarring throughout the game. Only major crash I had was towards the very end but at that point you already knew were the story was going.","October 29, 2015","true","1.1"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","24","39","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/402020/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1596 products in account","The Park is a psychological horror game that is set in the same universe as The Secret World, the latter of which I have never played; thus I'm unsure of any correlation between the two. After playing The Park, I can say that the game can be thoroughly enjoyed without having any knowledge whatsoever of The Secret World. While the developer and publisher, Funcom, have not brought us a plethora of releases, they are known for their quality work. The Park is their first true adventure into the genre of horror, and they take the leap very well.\n\nYou play as Lorraine, a mother who has gone back to the Atlantic Island Park to retrieve her son Callum's teddy bear. As you head to the information booth to see if Mr. Bear has been spotted, Callum takes off into the park and it's up to you to chase him down. It doesn't take long for things to take a disturbing twist, as a bright sunny day turns into a dark night where shadows are cast long and the rising mist is at its thickest. Your first of many rides will be taken through the Tunnel of Tales, where you ride in a swan boat and listen to the story of Hansel and Gretel; while this part is quite calm, the game quickly escalates into a full-on escapade of psychological terror driven by both narrative and visuals.\n\nThe dark secrets that Lorraine has lurking inside of her go from bad, to awful, to nightmarish as you progress through the story. Take special care to pick up and read any notes and documentation that you may come across, as these help fill in the blanks and enhance the story. The good thing about these notes is that they're never out of the way, and you will be hard pressed to miss any; they're always laid well within the beaten path. The Park itself is extremely linear, and as such there is no way for you to get lost. Even if you somehow cannot manage to find where to go next, you are able to press B (on an Xbox controller) to "shout" for Callum, and the game will then highlight your next point of interest.\n\nThe scenery is as creepy and disturbing as the story itself, and the further that you delve into both the more ghoulish it all becomes. During the latter part of the game, there is a very obvious ode-to-Silent Hills PT that is just astronomical. If The Park had implemented this sort of progression throughout the entire game, I feel as though it could've been even better than it already is; especially given the background and history of Lorraine. On the other hand, it's great that this title has its own unique spins to it, and the addition of actually being able to get on some of the amusement park rides is the icing on the cake.\n\nWithout a doubt, The Park is one of the better horror games to come out in the last couple of years; despite its short longevity of about two hours. The price is steep for a game with such a small amount of play time, with no replayability once its finishes, but the quality of the content is high. Even though the experience comes with many relied upon jumpscares, there is enough atmosphere, ambiance, and overall chilling backstory to push passed the cheapness of them. Highly recommended, especially on sale, I would not advise paying more than $10 CAD for this title, though it is a must play at some point, for all fans of the horror genre.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 2","true","2.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/recommended/402020/","Allahweh","Allahweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/","299 products in account","“The Park” was released on October 27, 2015 by Funcom Games. It is a powerful, narrative-driven psychological horror experience that may be disturbing to some. A review copy of this game was provided directly from Funcom’s Public Relations team.\n\nI remember when The Secret World launched back in 2012 and reading about all the new features the game had to offer. In many ways, the game itself was an experiment at doing something different – at creating a modern-themed MMORPG filled with horror aspects and an open-ended character progression system. The very fact that the game had a strong horror atmosphere to it alone made it different, and despite not having played it much after its launch, I can say I did enjoy what I saw. With this in mind, it’s no wonder that The Park would be something that also shakes the genre up a bit for us.\n\nThe Park is set in the early-1980s on the fictional Solomon Island and starts us off with a single mother named Loraine running inside Atlantic Island Park after it closes to chase her son, Callum, who ran in because he left his teddy bear somewhere within. Things start out bright and chipper enough, and even Lorraine’s mood supports this, but on the journey up the escalator that leads into the park, things take a rather dark turn quickly.\n\nYes, this is a horror game, but no, it doesn’t rely strictly on cheap jump-scares. In fact, at no point in the game are you ever in any sort of immediate danger. The game builds up its tense atmosphere as you go by providing you with an unsettling narrative, dark and foreboding environments, strange situations, and a few creepy encounters that will leave you on the edge of your seat as you go. The game encourages you to explore and take everything in, find notes and documents that provide you with the backstory on the amusement park, and enjoy (or dread) it all at your own pace.\n\nThe overall experience is short, yet powerful. Loraine is a character that you can identify with an commensurate with, and perhaps this fact is rather darker than we’d like to admit about ourselves. As Loraine chases after Callum and rides the various rides, a narrative is unraveled that leaves us wondering what’s really going on. Is this all some strange journey deep into her subconscious in order to deal with some unfathomably-terrible event in her (and Callum’s) past? Is what we see around us meant to be taken quite literally? Or is the truth somewhere between both of these ideas? One thing’s for sure, though: Loraine’s mental state changes as she progresses deeper into the amusement park itself, and this is evidenced by her voice and reactions as she goes. Players can call to Callum as they explore, and at first, both she and Callum seem rather cheerful. Later, though, she becomes more frantic, even angry, and it seems like Callum doesn’t even want to be found.\n\nWhile playing The Secret World isn’t required to enjoy this game, reading up on its lore and some of its recent tie-in events is a big plus. While The Park provides additional insight into the world of the MMO in regards to the amusement park itself, the MMO may help you further understand the character of Nathaniel Winters, the reason for the park’s creation (which is discussed in notes found in this game), the presence of a supernatural entity known as The Bogeyman, and explains who the man seen at the beginning (and end) of this game is. Further, understanding the lore of Atlantic Island Park will help formulate ideas on what really happened here, and why the atmosphere transitions from late-afternoon at an operational amusement park to nighttime in a run-down horror fest.\n\nIn a future post, I'll go into some spoiler-filled details as to what I really think happened in the game, but for now, I'll only suggest that you take a look at it for yourself.\n\nThe game isn't cheap on Steam. Currently, as of this review, it sells for $12.99 and may only take you an hour or two to get through. But, don't look at it as a game to run through so much as an experience to enjoy (like a movie). That may help justify the cost even more.\n\nUltimately, I highly enjoyed The Park and I think it's a dark adventure that any fans of a psychological horror nature should play. It's fun while it lasts, it's trippy in places, and in the end it leaves you thinking and wanting to know even more. In my opinion, that's the mark of a true success.\n\n"The Park" is a dark, deep, and narrative psychological horror that really hits home. It's short-lived, but it leaves a strong impact and leaves you wanting to know more and questioning everything that you experienced while playing it. It's a fantastic tie-in to "The Secret World," but easy to enjoy all on its own.\n\nOn a scale of 0 to 10, with 5 representing an "average" score, this game gets:\n\n----------------------------------\nVERY GOOD...... 8.5 out of 10\n----------------------------------","November 13, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Under any other circumstances, avoid this title. There is little actual gameplay; it's basically an interactive movie. Unfortunately it lacks everything one would expect from a movie. The plot is predictable and one-dimensional, the characters are cut from tired archetypes, and the climax is incredibly underwhelming. Forty-five minutes of droll dialogue, a couple cheap jump scares, and a repetitive finale sequence left me with a bitter aftertaste and little else.","November 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

About the same length as a feature film but more involving (and cheaper), I was gripped from the start. Make no mistake though, this is more story than game. Don't expect a test of skill and reactions, but do expect a test of your nerves.\n\nThe main character Lorraine is believably flawed, with much of the exposition being delivered from her remembrances as you explore. It's hard not to be sympathetic as you discover more about her life as she talks. You're guided through your journey by a simple mechanic - right click the mouse and Lorraine will call out for her lost son, giving you audio and visual cues on where to go or what to examine next, with her calls becoming more frantic and scared as the story goes on. You're led to go on several of the titular theme park's attractions, each giving its own unsettling experience.\n\nThe game comes bundled with a trial of The Secret World, the free to play MMO in the universe of which the story is set, and some costume items and high level gear to use in that game once you're there. You don't need to know The Secret World to enjoy the story, but those who have played will notice the references dotted throughout The Park.\n\nIf you're looking for a chilling story that will leave your heart in your throat, then The Park is for you. If you're looking for something with more longevity and replay value, then this isn't going to satisfy. But for such a small price tag, this is a good buy for horror fans looking for a pretty unique if short experience.","October 29, 2015","true","25.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Then her son runs off into The Park and Lorraine, the mother and protagonist, run after him.\nThis is the point where the excrements hits the fan and you are all of the sudden in an old abandoned amusement park with a life of its own, but what a spectacular amusement park it is.\n\n\nI was expecting the game to be creepy and keep me on edge at all times. Funcom has attempted to achieve that by using jump scares and a rich athmosphere, both visually and audibly. And the increasingly creepy story they wish to tell in this game just adds to the tension. For my part, the experience was horror and my ticker reached max rate at some points in the game.\nHowever, I found that there were moments of sheer dullness in the game and although it picked up towards the end, they did not end on a "horror"-climax which the game built up to. Instead they had a cinematic ending which was, more or less, lit up and was not notably exciting.\n\nThe story element of this game, written by a team of award winning story tellers, is very much playing on strings of the Bonkers-guitar and they want to tell the tale of a very twisted woman. I feel the story line is good, albeit perhaps somewhat thin, but as you progress you get an insight of what's going on inside Lorraine head.\n\nThe game play is fairly straight forward and the game rail roads you all the way through the game.\nYou enter the park. You get on some rides. Along the the way you are narrated by Lorraines inner voice and you find clues, such as reports and notes, providing explanations and feeding you story. And finally you reach the final "attraction" which tries to tie it all together.\nThere is no "mini games", puzzles, etc - just a story unfolding as you progress through the game.\n\nConclusionI think anyone who cares more about the journey, rather than the destination, and who allows him- or herself to be scared and drawn into the game will enjoy The Park.\nSo I would recommend it for those certain individuals.\n\nWatch my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68QLPIwJ9xw\nWatch my Let's Play of The Park here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebC5ah1HwWY&list=PLKC1mMQjT7arfJyGAIC8f0ZD-uM6LNzgP&index=1\nWatch a compilation of me being scared in this game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VemHtG7yHYY","November 8, 2015","true","4.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","2"

Despite not being as recognized as is Bioware for story-telling, Funcom excels like no other developer in that category.  Their games tell the best stories.\n\nThe Park is a great short story that unfolds before the player from a first-person perspective.  The story will have more meaning to players of Funcom's MMO The Secret World, but the story stands on its own.  Familiarity with TSW's lore is not required to enjoy The Park's story, but there are numerous references that TSW players will likely enjoy.\n\nI would not hesitate to reccomend this game to a friend.  But that reccomendation would have this accompanying caveat - be aware that this is a very short video game.  The length worked well for the story and the pricing was appropriate for the entertainment value.  But as most video games are much longer, it's worth mentioning the short length of The Park so that doesn't become one the playthrough's surprises (those surprises, by the way, work surprisingly well).\n\nBottom line, this is a good game and a must-buy for any fan of horror stories.\n","October 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The game boasts on the cover (or steam page) as a "Psychological horror experience" dealing with "with subject matter that might prove emotionally distressing to some. Player discretion is advised. “But that really isn't the case.  The Park tries to paint Lorraine as a down on her luck single mother dealing with drug and unresolved issues between her father and her son Callum but ultimately falls flat on its face. You simply have no incentive to care about Lorraine’s plight at all because she really has no story other than 'depressed single mom who might hate her kid'.\n\nThe thing that I enjoyed about the park immensely was its atmosphere and sense of exploration. Wandering from one ride to the next and taking in the scenery and music of The Park. Funcom really nailed the entire 'creepy amusement park' aesthetic and it was a unique experience. The Park can be finished in about an hour and in about 2 if you take your time to see everything The Park has to offer.

It's short, indeed, but I think the length is just right: you can take your time and complete it in a single sitting of 2 hours and so it does not overstay its welcome.\n\nI liked the the eerie atmosphere, the choice of a female lead, and the deep, meaningful story about her difficult life with her son - in fact a game focusing on just that and the psychological elements, entirely leaving out the supernatural would have felt a lot more powerful to me. The game looks beautiful and can give you chills at times; the cheap scares are fortunately kept to a minimum.\n\nI didn't like how much the writers are in love with their own setting to the detriment of the player trying to enjoy their story. This game is set in the same world as the MMO The Secret World and as far as I can understand contains plenty of references, winks, nudges and Easter eggs to people in the know. The rest of us, I think, are left with an incomplete picture and are kept in the dark about the forces at work in The Park. This might be why the ending felt so confusing and more than a little lackluster to me.

As you get there, things become dark and twisted and your son wanders away. You call him back, but he doesn't respond, so you have to go find him yourself. Things start to become weirder and weirder, as you uncover the secrets of the park and, more importantly, your character's twisted mind.\nWill you find your son and safely escape the park? Or will you become involved in a much darker experience?\n\nPros:    The Atmosphere | The developer placed great emphasis on the atmosphere and their hard work is definitely shown when playing the game. Although it's a horror game, it doesn't work on scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of you with jumpscares, but rather offers frightening excitement, if that is a term. Sure, there are a few jumpscares, but this is not what The Park aims for.\nThe Graphics | Combined with the overall atmosphere, the way this amusement park looks and the way it feels you get an amazing experience. Throw in some well-placed fog, rusty Ferris wheel, creepy looking mascot and you get a whole collection of things that make this game play great. Check out the screenshots, as they are actually showing the real situation of this game's appearance (some of them could even make a great desktop background!).\nThe Story | As explained above, you are a mother of a son who gets lost in this park, but while searching for him, you as a player discover a pretty background of their story, including poor mental condition, depression, death and others. I really got dragged into this story and I felt sorry for both of them. This doesn't happen often to me, so I can safely assume that the writer did a really good job.\nThe Soundtrack | Every horror game needs a good soundtrack, so this one has one, too! It's some kind of mysterious music, but it raises tension when things are about to go downhill. If you are a person who gets easily scared, you can at some occasions use this to at least slightly prepare for the scary moment.\nAchievements | You get those for every ride or discovery in the park, which is great, because it gives you the sense of progress and shows you how far you are into the game.\nBonus Items | This game is happening in the universe of Funcom's other game, The Secret World, so you get some in-game items for that game. I don't play it myself, but I guess it's good for some people.\nCons:    Game's Performance | This game has very high system requirements, which could be a problem for a lot of people. You would expect that this game would run just fine if you meet the "recommended" requirements, but it doesn't. I have twice as much RAM and an i7 processor, but this game can't even reach 30 FPS if ran on ultra/high quality. Some people with much better computers are complaining that they can't reach 60 FPS on any quality. I am used to playing on low, as I had a really bad computer before, but I know this will bother a lot of people and it really shouldn't be a thing.\nLength | This game should take you about 90 minutes to complete, maybe even less, if you are not that kind of person who would pay close attention to everything a game has to offer. I mean, the gameplay is great and all, but I was still kind of disappointed. It's true, however, that you might want to repeat the whole game, in case you missed some achievements.\nLanguages | This game only supports English for now, so the developer should at least encourage fan translations for subtitles (for example, on Transifex).\nIssues With Resolution | So, I have a 1280x1024 monitor. When I was choosing between different options starting with 1280x???, nothing would change. 1280x720, 1280x786, 1280x1024 ... they were all the same. However, when I took a screenshot, Steam only detected the middle part of my monitor, as I left my resolution setting on 720.\nOS Support | Or specifically, the lack of it. You cannot play this game on MacOS or Linux. I did hear some rumours of the developer having this planned, so I'll remove it when support gets added.\nThe final verdict:I can only give this game a big thumbs-up. I simply loved the atmosphere and I appreciated that small quantity of jumpscares, as they are (in my opinion) a bit overused. This game is very atmospheric, which is, in my opinion, an excuse for it's shortnes. The developers put a lot of hard work in this game and it would not be easy for them to maintain that tension and uneasiness for longer than 90 minutes.\nI played this game in one sitting and I really enjoyed it. I'm not too sure about the price, but it's definitely worth taking a look at, if you have the money.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Your son, Callum, tells you he can’t find Mr. Bear, so you head back into the park, and thus begins your adventure.\n\nThe Park is a first-person exploration game. You can add walking simulator on top of that, if you like. As Lorraine, you travel to several different areas of the park, all within a few minutes of each other. You’ll go on a (creepy) tunnel of love ride, a (creepy) rollercoaster and, of course, (creepy) bumper cars. Along the way, you’ll find notes, which help tell the backstory of the park, several items to examine, see things that aren’t there.\n\nFuncom wasn’t lying when they said that The Park would be a short experience. If you choose not to explore every nook and cranny, and not read all the notes, you can easily complete it in half an hour. I completed it in 45 minutes, and that was with reading every document I came across and examined everything I was able to. (Don’t let my time played fool you; the rest of the time played is letting the game idle to unlock the cards, and a quick replay to get screenshots and video for my achievement guide.)\n\nWhile a quick experience, it’s a good experience. They’ve done an excellent job with the creepiness factor. If you’ve been around horror games (or any horror medium, for that) long enough, you likely won’t be disturbed or otherwise “scared” of what the game has to offer. The story is entertaining, and really paints a portrait of Lorraine as, well, you’ll find out soon enough.\n\nProsAtmosphere. The Park is very atmospheric. The amusement park itself is dark and foreboding, rides and equipment are run down and rusty. Some of the ending sequences are very well done, and evoke a feeling of P.T. On that note, there’s also a Silent Hills-esque feeling that I had when wandering around.\n\nTSW tie-in. If you’ve played The Secret World long enough, you’ll get a few references. Considering The Park is a spin-off of TSW, that’s to be expected. There’s nothing major, but they’re fun little “oh, that’s interesting” moments.\n\nActing. For the most part, Lorraine is voiced quite well. Most of her dialog seems natural, and doesn’t feel forced. The further into the story you progress, she sounds more and more desperate and afraid when you use the shout mechanic.\n\nEnvironmental graphics. The world looks nice. The rusty ferris wheel enshrouded in fog, the rollercoaster that feels like it’s going to fall apart, the statues of Chad the mascot spread throughout the park, everything looks well detailed.\n\nFew jump scares. There are a few jump scares, only a few. They are well placed, don’t seem forced, and they don’t ruin the immersion too much.\n\nConsCharacter graphics. Lorraine, Callum and the very limited number of other people you meet do not look good. At all. They are passable, but they look like they belong in a game that hasn’t come out this decade.\n\nShout mechanic. Right-clicking has Lorraine call out for Callum, in a variety of ways. Callum, Callum where you are? Callum, it’s time to go home now! Callum, stay where you are! As the story progresses, it’s interesting to see how her dialog and voice change, but overall, the mechanic is pretty useless. When you use it, it puts a sort of retracting blur effect on items of interest, such as notes. But, considering that the game lacks any puzzles, and everything is presented to you in plain view, it seems out of place.\n\nVery short game. I debated putting this as a con or not. Funcom specifically stated it would be a very short experience, so there should be no excuse for buying the game and being surprised at how quickly you’ll get through it. It’s a good experience in the short amount of time, but if you’re looking for something to last longer than what your coffee stays hot for, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nConclusionThe Park is a fantastic experience. It’s short, but contains a great deal of story telling and immersion. It’s interesting to see what happens, and to find out what’s actually going on. It’s atmospherically horror, with only a few jump scares, and will certainly entertain you for its duration. At its low price, I consider it good value for money, but as always, your mileage may vary.\n\nBuy, Wait for Sale, Don’t Buy?Buy. Definitely a buy. If you're into non-gory and psychological horror, you won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you’re looking to get all the achievements in The Park, they can all be earned in one playthrough, and the majority of them are story related and can’t be missed. Should you need help getting the few that can be skipped, feel free to check out my achievement guide in Steam’s guides section.","October 27, 2015","true","2.9"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","25","43","0","0"

The atmosphere was spot on, and provided just enough teasing to keep pushing you on throughout, without relying on constant jump-scares.  Not once did I wish to stop playing or take a break.  I was intrigued, and I wanted to experience what was going on.  So, if you're afraid of a "walking simulator" and that it'd bore you, don't.\n\nIf you see any complaints on story, you won't see it from me.  People these days seem to expect a novel or epic level conclusion, but for the size of the game, that'd either leave it rushed or leave too many holes.  Instead, it's as it should be, the level of conclusion you'd expect out of a short story.  That's what this game is, a short story.  Expect and take it as such.\n\nDownside?  Of course.  Replayability is limited, as there are no choices or puzzles to make.  Those who will get the most use of this game are those who are already fans of The Secret World, as it fills in more detail into a fan-favorite location.  However, that's not much of a downside, and just more of a bonus.  Though, as a longtime TSW player, I can't easily see if anything is unanswered due to all the little tie-ins that were added in the background.","October 27, 2015","true","3.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

I wished for more extras, like... more interactive huts to inspect, with jumpscares when you look through the window of them, or the mirrors in the horror house, I expected someone to stand behind me. Or the part on the rollercoaster, with the hospital scenes. They were pretty awesome, but still you could've confused the players by doing a stop and let them creep around the hospital for getting more informations about the story and what happened there or something like that! There are so much ideas you could use...\n\nFinal words: I am disspointed. Like I said, there's so damn much not used potential, it's really upsetting...

You are a mother whose son has run inside the Atlantic Island Park past closing time. Things seem fine at the beginning but quickly turn dark. What was once a park full of laughter and fun quickly becomes a carnival of nightmares, and your child is lost inside. You will need to face the horros of this evil amusement park to save your child, all the while discovering the history of this twisted offering to childhood imagination. Who built the park? Why have their been so many deaths during its run? And what happened to the children that have disappeared?\n\nThe Park is a beautifully done story experience. Enough jumpscares to get your heart racing while enough psychological horror to make you go "WTF". It will run you about 2 hours, maybe more if you want all of the achievements to unlock the game's full history, which for $10 isn't bad. The graphics were flawless, sound was superb, the spookiness of the music often making me want to put down my headphones and turn my head around the screen. The controls are bare, there is no map, and there aren't any enemies per-se, but you won't need them when your mind is the ultimate enemy. All in all it's a great game and I'd recommended it to anyone who likes narrative games,anyone who's a fan of The Secret World, or someone who wants to take a break from action-heavy games like Call of Duty and just have a nice stroll through an amusement park.","October 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

But there is no follow through. You look for your son in a dark theme park that feels scary and every so often you are interupted by some story your protagonist feels the need to share. Not to say the story is bad, it just doesn't support the game - at least not until you reach the end and it all kinda wraps up.\nThis story telling the game does, negates the whole effect of the dark atmosphere. And soon you will grow complacent in the game. Maybe a jump scare or 2 will startle you, but it never quite feels scary anymore. Quite a shame really.\n\nSo in the end; don't buy this game if you are looking for a scary or haunting experience. Don't buy it for the story either. Truly the only reason to recommend this game, is if you are fairly new to horror games and want an easy ride.","May 29","false","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Already I am at odds with the game, as adventure implies exploration, or a puzzle element, and horror implies the need for survival against something that is trying to kill you. The actual exploration in this game is limited to looking for your child, which is the whole point of the game, and there are no puzzles that you have to solve in order to continue. As to horror, the gameplay did nothing to add a feeling of doom, or threat to the character, out side of the story. There is no gameplay, no stealth, no challenge as to how to progress to the next zone, only the need to keep walking and get there. If anything, I would classify this game as a walking simulator with a spooky mentality.\n\nThe strongest element is the story, with an immersive environment and a captivating, emotional lead character that draws you into the story. You are pulled into this dark, haunted, confusing theme park as you look for your child. One thing that takes away from the story is that you have to get on the various theme park rides; not because you think your child is on them, or because it is part of the story, but more because you feel you have to in order to collect some lore, and because the developers want you to experience the ride.\n\nThe game is short (1-2 hours long) for price they are asking, I feel it needs more than just a really good story. I am conflicted about this game; the story was really good, but the gameplay was atrocious, with little interaction and no adventure element, or choice. For the story, I would recommend you watching a 'Let's Play' from a player you enjoy.\n\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 1, 2015","false","1.4"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

You can finish it within about an hour and a half. I will say however what I did and did not like about the game.\n\nLikes:\n- there was a few jump scares that took me by surprise, which was nice\n- there was nice visual scare stimulation and some via audio\n- graphics weren't the worst, but were pretty decent\n- voices for characters were decent\n\nDislikes:\n- the game was short, which leaves you feeling like something is unfinished after you're done\n- I felt like game could have been dragged out a lot more\n- the ending was sort of sudden and kind of lame\n- some of the notes were extreamly difficult to read, in which most I just passed over since I couldn't read\n\nOver all, it was a decent game. Would I play it again? No. Why? Because its not one of those types games you play again and again. The shortness of the game leaves something to be wanted but it might still be worth a play through. However, which ten bucks for a game isn't much, this one should not be.","October 29, 2015","false","2.1"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

I knew it was not a game, but an interactive movie.  Still, I was hoping for a little more interaction.  It is a true walking simulator.  It is very much like Dear Esther.

Everything else is pretty dull and the story isn't compelling at all.  It isn't quite as cheesy as Among the Sleep, and it looks better, but it doesn't even have that level of interaction.

If you're not comfortable spending full price for that then wait for a sale.

I love these atmospheric short simulator games. The Park uses the Unreal Engine 4 so it not only looks great but runs great as well. When you first enter the park it is somewhat eerie, but peaceful and relaxing at the same time. As you get deeper into the park and further into the story it becomes more intense and eventually quite terrifying. Excessive jumpscares in games like these are not necessary to make the game scary, and this is exactly what I love about The Park. If your buying this game, however, dont expect any replay value as the story is only a little over an hour long. For $10 this game was worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/recommended/402020/","MrRokuro-san","Mr. Businessman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/","330 products in account","At a first glance, The Park looks like your classic first person horror game that happens to take place in a creepy, abandoned and decrepit amusement park. But it crescendos much more than that.\n\nYou play as Lorraine, a single mother who's lost her son, Callum, after visiting the Atlantic Island amusement park.\nUpon exiting the park just as closing time arrives, Callum tells her that he misplaced his teddy bear and storms into the amusement park to find it. With darkness quickly approaching and her son missing and ignoring her commands, Lorraine has to enter the park to find him, while strange things slowly begin to occur in the once friendly location.\n\nThe story is a bit hit and miss, starting out weak but improving near the end of the game. As you explores the park at night and rides its various innocent yet menacing rides, the plot develops through Lorraine's monologue, which reveal her history and search for answers, and documents that are strewn about the park that reveal its dark past. Funcom have made no secret of the influence from games like Gone Home and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the comparisons come almost instantly as you begin walking around the troubled theme park.\n\nIt's also more involved than your average title, as you can ride the rides in the park (a Ferris wheel, rollercoaster, and the like), and look around at your surroundings while doing so. Controls are at a minimum with the ability to move and interact with any items, but I have to say I liked the inclusion of a run mechanic. It makes sense in this context – you’re in freaky hellscape of a park trying to find your son, after all – but it means that moving between sections doesn’t feel like a chore. The Park also uses call mechanic with the right mouse button that not only helps guide you to your next objective, but works brilliantly in the context of the game. Hearing Lorraine call out to Callum with increasing worry and panic is expertly done, as are the responses the player gets. It was these responses along with the swirling visual markers that ensured I knew where I was supposed to be going, although it wasn’t fool proof. There were a few moments where I had to wander around before I was able to get back on the right path, but I didn’t find it too frustrating or time-consuming, thankfully. There's also a decent amount of lore-building involved, and not just because of the Lovecraftian themes that are intertwined with the Funcom-verse. I actually enjoyed reading about various incidents at the park, and how they involve the cast although I did have an issue with some of the the scattered pages and documents you can find off the beaten path, detailing some of the game’s backstory. It seems unfortunate that some of them are nearly unreadable, as the font on these are tiny and blurry. A clearer font, zoom button or a subtitle option would have been an alternative, but as the game lacks it, unless you strain your eyes to read, you’ll be missing out on some of the backstory that ties it to Funcom’s other game, The Secret World.\n\nThe strongest part however is the end of the game, which is both fantastic and unfortunate, as it’s such a strong and beautifully creepy finish that is way more terrifying compared to the rest of the experience. If only the game’s setting and story would have more like the last part of the game, it would have been a much more horrifying game.\nOverall, The Park is a well crafted narrative-driven adventure game, but there really is no reason to return once you’ve left The Park unless you want to get those missable achievements or analyse the letters and items again to figure out more of the backstory. However, if you want something a little different this Halloween, play this with the headphones on and the lights off.","October 27, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

So to be completely clear, I have been playing The Secret World since launch, and bought three copies of this game within 10 minutes of it's availability. So this review is not exactly coming from an unbiased perspective.\n\nTo start with the mechanics, it was nice and simple. Movement plus three buttons. The right-mouse-click to call for Callum worked well both as a story device and a mechanic to point you to things, however I did feel that it was a little hard to know if you'd missed something sometimes. I would occassionally find myself using it several times, just to make sure I hadn't missed anything. The only other thing I would say about this is that the scraps of paper found in the game were very hard to read. I had to move to about half distance away from my monitor to have any chance of reading it at all.\n\nMoving onto the world. If Funcom proved one thing with The Secret World (they proved lots more than one thing), then it is that they can make a beautiful world to play in. With three years and a different game engine, the awesomeness has only gotten better. I was playing with max graphics settings, and it was really awesome. It wasn't just the visuals though. The audio environment created by Simon Poole was brilliant. I regularly found myself spinning around to look for something I thought was creeping up behind me. I knew that there was nothing there, but I thought there was enough to look. AKA: Brilliant. I remember seeing one instance of a spark passing through a solid wall, but beyond that, I felt it was flawless.\n\nLastly, the story. I don't want to say too much here, because spoilers. However, I finished the games with several questions. On the most over-arching scale, I found myself questioning which parts were the dark reality of the park, and which were Lorraine's 'reality'. To be clear, I think this is a good thing. I'm also not sure of the whole story of Steve, but I suspect that's because I missed something, though it does also get looked at in The Secret World.\n\nOverall, I loved the game. I had no problem with the story, way less than no problem with the world, and only a couple of issues the mechanics. I will be playing again, no question asked. Would totally recommend this for others.","October 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Makinsanity/recommended/402020/","Makinsanity","Helping Hoof","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Makinsanity/","637 products in account","An entirely linear "interactive" story by Funcom which has some mild scare bits, a story that leaves you with a bad aftertaste in your mouth, and a whole lot of issues in terms of gameplay.\n\n- The XBox Controller's B button won't allow you to "back" out of menus. Nor does the "back" button.\n- The "headthrobbing" quickly gets on one's nerves.\n- The player character narrates the story from time to time - turning off running while she talks. This is really obnoxious since the game is essentially a walking simulator. You advance the story by going from one park ride to another and there's a lot of ground to cover in between them.\n- Talking about running; you can't run until you get to the point where the game tells you what key to use to run. Forget trying it before that point as that particular key is not "active" until that point.\n- Interaction hovertext is glitchy and may appear in random positions and half out of the screen while you pass by an item, or appear in the center of the screen when you're nowhere near the item.\n- Especially in the rollercoaster part of the level there are some longer texts which only flash by and are impossible to read as a result. Even when playing the game twice.\n- The game is so linear it could have been "on rails" if not for the part where you're searching for badly hidden interactive objects along the road. They even go so far as to put you in the middle of a round area, and then put the bogeyman on the road so you can only go around it in one direction.\n- On lower resolutions, the scraps of paper you find are impossible to read. On a laptop with a resolution of 1366x768 I could not read the letters on the papers I found even with my nose pressed against the screen! Really a big oversight.\n- Areas shut off from being revisited once you exit them, the game literally demanding the player to push forward to the next area, up until you've found everything you need for the story to progress to the House of Horrors, when all of the park is suddenly open and accessible for no apparent reason.\n- The in-game lore is a little "out there" for people who have not played The Secret World and understand the players at work there. There's barely any information for people to piece that story together properly, except for a lot of mentioning of places found on Solomon Island, something the player would have no attachment to one way or another if they have not played The Secret World.\n- Apparently the spoken "Don't let them take me" is supposed to be "Don't take me" according to the subtitles.\n- I guessed at "the big reveal" about ten minutes into the game and only had it confirmed in the last FMV of the game.\n- Did I mention the game is really short? We're talking less than 2 hours playtime here.\n\nI'm happy to obtain the special items for my TSW account, so I at least have something for my troubles, but there's no replay value here besides trying to complete the achievement list if you missed anything on your first go.\n\nI really wish Funcom had put some more effort into making the game more engaging. This could have been so much better, considering the park's background story. Instead they put the focus on something entirely unrelated and used the park as a backdrop. Such a shame.\n\nLastly, just so I'm not a complete negative Nancy; there were a few good things about the game;\n+ The atmosphere is great. It's what was to be expected; dark places, wind howling, the occasional sound that makes you wonder if you really heard it.\n+ The chipmunk is sufficiently creepy and pops up in places you least expect him to be in. He's not overused, but the amount of his appearances are just right for the length of the game.\n+ The rides are decently thought out even if it's clear they're separate instances. It's not as seamless as I would have liked, but it's barely a bother considering the limited amount of games which have good carnival rides in them.\n+ The role of the bogeyman when it concerns the rides was a nice touch.\n+ The house of horrors had just the right amount of creep to it, although I had expected some more events when interacting with things like the faucet or some of the doors.\n+ For players of The Secret World, there was a nice amount of additional lore to gather.\n\nStill; I do not recommend this game in this state. This was not the right place to have a story about post-natal depression. It would have been better served following the trail of death from the park's opening to its inevitable closing, and go in deeper on the cause for the supernatural events that took place there.","October 27, 2015","false","4.7"," 40 of 75 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","40","75","0","0"

I sort of guessed it before I even purchased the game, but I wanted to go along for the *ride*. My only other problem with the game would be the price tag. I thought it was cool that it played like a movie and was the price of a movie in theaters, but in the end - I think $5 would suit it better.\n\nWhat I will say about this game though is I haven't played a more unsettling game in a long time.

Originally started as a Funcom tech demo, it's important to know going into it that it's only maybe 90min or so long and is essestially you just going through scripted motions.\n\nThat said, Funcom is always good at layering the mood on nicely and while I found the first half of the story to be slow and a bit "by the numbers" it picks up nicely in the second half. The first half also presented me with a few stuttering frame-rates at points as well, but this too disappeared after the half-way point.\n\nI am a player of The Secret World for full disclosure so I may have gone into this with a bit more foreknowledge on The Park, and recognized some things in-game that people that don't play the MMO will not know, but I don't think you need to be at all familiar with TSW lore to enjoy it. Though the ending will make a bit less sense...\n\nI'd give it a 7.5/10. Worth the $10.

But I already knew that. What surprised me was the last act of the game when it turned into PT.  I was very pleasantly surprised and probably the most creeped out by that turn of events.\n\nI recommend picking up everything you can find.  Notes, photos, articles, the like as that is where the background to the strange going ons of the park is found.  Especially in the last part, a few times, trust me.\n\nIt stands on its own but if you have played The Secret World you will notice people, places, and events referenced from there like familar old ghostly friends. I'm one of those who had so it made it fun to get mentions to certain motels and diners that feature in TSW. However if you are going in blind it shouldn't be to spoilerific if you want to play TSW after and there is enough background that you will get the jist of the park even if you don't.\n\nThis is one of those games that it helps to put yourself into the shoes of the character. Hearing her heartfelt pleas especially when she is scared is tragic.  Hearing her "other side" or the less sweet motherly side is down right disturbing.  I also liked the themes and dark undertones to the game.  And if you just happen to want to ride the rides of a scary amusement park than this is definetly up your alley.\n\nIt took me about as long as I thought it would but I HATE missing things so gameplay of the individual will very.  Mine was about 3 hours but if your running through and missing alot it could easily be less than 1 or 2 hours. Or a quicker reader than I am.\n\nAs to FPS my computer isn't the best so off with the antialiasing and V-snce and a lower setting of screen settings and the lag I get was ignorable at worse and forgettable at best. But that's just my computer and BAD graphics card.\n\nMoral of the review: A good game to play when it's dark outside, MUHAHAHAHA.","October 27, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawlkill/recommended/402020/","crawlkill","crawlkill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawlkill/","711 products in account","in July 2012, FunCom released an MMO called The Secret World. set in the modern day with an occult/conspiracy/horror theme, it'd turn out to be the best-written MMO and one of the best-written and best-acted games of all time. with a strong setting and stronger characters, TSW was primed for popularity among an unfortunately small subset of MMO players: those who wanted to really care about the setting they were in.\n\none of the areas you'd encounter within a few hours of your picking up the game was the park. it was one of the earliest serious puzzle areas of the game, but beyond that, it was a terrifying environment, both in terms of how it looked and the threats that roamed around it. the Park in TSW was one of the great pieces of level design of all time--comparable to and maybe better than the haunted house in Bloodlines.\n\nenter The Park. The Park is set in TSW's Park, redesigned for a first-person narrative game. there are no challenges in The Park: it's a walkthrough game, just a story being told. it does, however, start with one of the best mechanics I've ever seen in a horror game: right at the outset, you get the ability to shout to find your next objective. giving the player the option to scream and give away their position in a horror game is one of the best ideas I've ever seen. control your own nightmare; make yourserlf feel exposed.\n\nThe Park itself (stop reading now if you don't want any inkling of the story) is about a normal person (not a TSW-style chosen of Gaia...at first) wandering the haunted park in search of her son. the plot unfolds through one-page journal entries you find and monologues from the main character. early on in the 90-120 minute experience, it comes clear that the story is really about being a mother, being a single parent, and the stresses and resentments that develop therewith. I won't explicitly spoil how it all works out, but for the TSW fans out there, know that the last scene is a wonderful TSW cameo.\n\nin the end, The Park works. to someone unfamiliar with TSW, it might feel like an Amnesia-esque horror game, minus any threats; to someone who does know TSW, the hooks to Kingsmouth and the TSW setting in general will probably be the most interesting bits. it's short, it's cheap, and it'll either intrigue you about an MMO you should try or excite you about an MMO you have tried. what's to lose?","October 27, 2015","true","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I don't hate them, I'm just too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to play them myself.  But for The Park, I grew some balls and sat down in the dark for a good scare.\n\nI'm also going to admit that I'm cheap.  Normally, I regret pretty much anything I spend money on.  However, I definitely do not regret this game.\n\nThe atmosphere was the BEST part of this game.  I scare easily, and there were some jumpscares that got me of course, but it wasn't just that.  The game wasn't particularly scary; I've seen worse.  It was extremely unsettling.  It took the time to get under your skin and stick with you.  That, in my opinion, is MUCH more effective than any jumpscare.  I felt on edge even after the game ended for a while afterwards.\n\nThe voice acting was surprisingly great.  I didn't run into any glitches.  Like I said, I was completely immersed in the atmosphere of the park.  The story was surprisingly good; a lot of it left me thinking.  I ended up recommending the game to some friends just so I could have other people to discuss the story of the game with.  Overall, I find that The Park was worth my money.

The haters claim they're not really games if for example you can't die, if there's no or limited interaction or puzzles, or if the game is short. But games comes in all shapes & sizes. If they're distributed on gaming platforms, we may as well call them games, and then put a fitting sub category to it. I mean I don't consider all films films just because they were shot on film, some are actually pure garbage, but hey.\nI enjoyed this little game for it's story & atmosphere, which resonated strongly with me. But it won't with everyone. I still think it is an unusual story & themes seldom touched upon baked into a classic haunted house type of frame. I applaud the makers for being so brave, & I think stories like this needs to be told more.That is it's strong point. For me, this combined with the setting, designs which is very Tim Burton-esque, excellent sound design & focus on psycholocial horror more than cheap jump scares makes it worth while.\nI have not played "The Secret World" which takes place in the same universe as this game, but doing so apparently enhances the story somewhat. They're still both completely self contained though.\n\nOn to the negative aspects then:\n1.) It is overpriced for what it is. But the developers are totally upfront with both estimated length & price, which leaves it up for consumers to decide if it's worth it or not and if they wanna support it.\nI've never understood the objection to short games myself. But the amount of work, or lack thereof, behind a game I can understand objection to. If someone slaps together a game of 1 hour without any innovations applied to mechanics, designs, storytelling etc, and made with only allready existing say music, textures and so on, then yeah, it should be really cheap or free.\nBut would you like something to drag on just to fill out time, or have it condensed & paced properly? To me the answer is clear. And how do we put a price on an experience, short or long? I know some who thought "Alien: Isolation" got too long, good game as it is. For many it may have been even better if shortened somewhat.\n2.) There's also no replay value, except if you want possibly missed achievements. It took me 2 hours to complete, with pauses to fix with recording software, make tea, toilet breaks etc. and I missed 2 achievements.\n3.) The story/twist isn't too hard to figure out, even early on, but the road to the revelation is still worth traveling in my opinion.\n4.) It's also extremely dark, in more ways than one, but I mean literary so dark that I missed some scares. I doubt that was the intention so you may be advised to make the setting slightly brighter than you think when first presented with the brightness slider at the beginning.\nYou're also give a flashlight at one point, and I thought I could actually equip it. But you can't and it's auto selected for a certain section. This was unclear to me, but no major issue.\nSome complained about not being active in a certain cutscene. But I think the point of the game is to observe a reveal of a mental breakdown and a realisation sort of, and to emulate the feeling of not being in control is great. That can be how it feels, you'e out of control, you can't stop yourself, just as at times you're frozen with fear and can't move. We may complain about people being idiots watching from the distance, but do we know how it is to be that person in that situation? This is what games can force us to do better than possibly any other media: Experience and see from other perspectives.\nAlso the complaints I've read about boring bits/fillers between the rides/scares, I'd call that build up in this case. Though for some it's probably boring, just like Kubricks "The Shining" is boring for some.\n\nImportant stories in games can be told with smart cues, like SPOILER FOR AMONG THE SLEEP! "Among the Sleep" being about the horrors for a toddler living with an alcoholic single parent. The clues among other things being the revelance of empty bottles that start appearing more and more frequently throughout levels that if knocked over will aggrevate the monster. SPOILER END! ”The Park” does the same with some early monolouges. This is what elevates some games beyond their mere base.\nMany have pointed out similarities in visual design with "The Babadook", the excellent horror film by Jennifer Kent, but they share similiar subject matters as well.\nHorror games has gone from simply being subjected to horrors from others or circumstances around you (basically playing the victim in a horror movie) to incorporate deep psychological meaning (such as with "Silent Hill 2", experiencing the manifested horrors of your own guilt) to even getting to feel the horrors of being or realising that you are "the bad guy".

From the creators of The Secret World (TSW), which you don't have to play to enjoy The Park, however if you do you play TSW you will get just that bit more out of it.

For me i would've appriciated if Funcom stated this on the game as i can see from other point of view that the story is lacking, which is the case due to not playing The Secret World.\n\nDon't expect a ton jump scares when playing this game, you won't get them.\n\nDon't assume what's happening and what you're actually doing within the game is what it seems, too many reviews state that everything is straight forward, it's not. For a little assistance with this, one of the first lines in the game is as follows "I believe your son just ran into the park, let me unlock the gate for you so that you can go in" I'll leave you to ponder what the issue with that is and it's the beginning of the uncertainty.\n\n","October 28, 2015","true","2.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The narrative is reletively cohesive instead of a disjointed mess of pretentious nonsense and there are even a few things in the environment to interact with. The game is actually horror instead of putting on a facade of horror so the revelation about how SUPER INCLUSIVE AND PROGRESSIVE the developers are can be called a plot twist.\n\nThat being said, "a step up" still leaves much to be desired in this 'genre.'

It's a first person experience game much like Dear Esther and Gone Home or even the Stanley Parable. The game uses a lot of flavor text that the player can find that adds to the background story of the park. This adds to the horror elements which are well done with plenty of scares throughout.\n\nThat being said the level of interactivity you have with the world is fairly limited although calling out to your son makes for an interesting mechanic. Admittedly, I myself didn't use this mechanic for about the last half of the game as frequently as I did at first. The length was only a con in my opinion due to it leaving me wanting more and curious about The Secret World.\n\nI recommend this title to anyone who enjoys an immersive, eerie, paranormal story with a good number of scares.","October 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You start off thinking it's going to be a horror game where you unravel the mystery of what's going on at the park via notes and incident reports.  So at first glance it seems to be a story about how the proprietor of the park purchased the land from a man who commited great atrocites.  The idea being that the park was going to try to be something positive in what would have been a very negative zone.  As you progress through the park and read various documents you learn that there have been various deaths throughout the years starting way back when it was under construction and still occuring even after the park opened it's doors.\nYou learn that the proprieter actually had an ulterior motive for setting up the park and wasn't as altruistic as he first seemed.  Eventually the park gets shut down by health inspectors and the proprietor retreates to the horror house where his machine was.\n\nbut around the third act the game decides to forget all that and switch gears to become about the protagonist and her mindset, trying for a twist that you would have already saw coming from a mile away if you payed the slightest attention to her dialogue.\n\nAll i'm going to say as much as I liked the game the last bit of it was the weakest.  I really wish they stuck it out with the regular horror aspect and had us confront whatever was controlling the park.\n\nEnd spoilers.\n\nother than that though.  It's a real neat tie-in game to an mmo. that knows how to build atmospere and give a general sense of unease even though there are times you can tell when there is going to be a jumpscare well before it happens.","October 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

While I absolutely loved the game, calling it a game is a little misleading. While you control Lorraine and have mild interactions with the world it's definetely more akin to a walking simulator with a great back story. And while the story is great, it does run short. The quote from Funcom is between 1-2 hours and we beat it in about 80 mins so they're pretty spot on. Some people may gripe about the price compared to the amount of time but seeing as a movie ticket costs $12 then it's not a huge deal(Especially since a ton of site have this on sale already)\n\nThose points aside we were completely transfixed with the story and the setting. The game looks rock solid, the voice acting from Lorraine was amazing and the story left me wanting more.

They had created this visually fantastic area filled with mystery and intrigue.  All I could think about when running that series of quests is that I wanted a better, more in depth look at the park, and this game delivers the content I was looking for.\n\nIf you have not played through the story in The Secret World, much of this game will seem linear and boring.  It expands on what we learn and gives us another taste of the darkness that stood out in my first playthrough.  As TSW is broken up into sections and areas, you have to leave that section to further advance your character.  Having a short reprise, for me at least, was a nice throwback.  If they make more games like this, based on the other sections of the game, I will probably buy them as well.\n\nI honestly think this is a good start in a new direction for FunCom, and that more of these games, with larger and further developed storylines will be worth the playtime.\n\nI feel like they made this game for me.

We see the history through the protagonists eyes. Lorraine lost her son a the amusement park and starts searching after him. In the coming sequences we see odd things, experience paranormal things and the context is puzzling. The last scene is surely the climax of the whole story, Lorraines story.\n\nAs I see it she was not only depressed but seems to have a traumatic story. Just think, early attachment problems, a mother who rejects her and accusing her for having abandoned her by running away with the father. Then father is gone and her relatives dont want to share the insurance amount with her. There she stands alone before she meets a man and happiness is back in her life. But not for so long. The man dies and she becomes a single mother with a low-paId job. She also had post-partum depression for which she also was hospitalized and medicated for. I interpret the park as the conscious level and the grottos and the stairs in the last part as the sub-consciuos levels. As she walk through the rooms several times she relives the trauma again and again. Slowly the repressed memories comes to a consciuos level but she actively tries to repress them. The final scene where she stabs her son seems to me to be a try to get rid of the alien part of the self. I think that her son is in custody and that Lorraine seems to be psychotic.\n\nOverall I liked the game as mentioned earlier. There are some cons though. Gameplay is a little bad mechanised and there should have been icons popping up when reading a note and alike. Walking is too slow and I finished the game by running. The game is a little too short and could have been longer.\n\nI recommend this game for those who fancy psycology and ambient soundtrack.","October 28, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

So to those who expect anything else, you only have yourself to blame.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, the atmosphere is immersive as it blends a perfect mix of visuals and audio to keep you tense and constantly pressing the right mouse button. The game itself is short but that is not neccessarily a terrible thing, games do not need to be long they only need to be entertaining and padding them out with repetitive game play often only takes away from the experience.\nIf you are new to horror, this may not be a bad choice, the game is very easy to get into and easier to get lost in.\n\nEdit: I am seeing a lot of reviews complaining about the game being a narrative driven game. I am not sure why because the game, the trailer, the developers all said it is a narrative driven game. People had the same complaints about Gone Home and the Vanishing of Ethan Carter but you never hear people complain about about any other game like this "It didn't say it was twin-stick shooter" or "it didn't say it was a third person shooter", so why should a game have to apologize for what it is?\nIf you don't like narrative driven games, don't buy them.","October 27, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The storyline reminds me of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, except without the survival aspect of it.\nThis game feels like a horror version of The Stanley Parable.\nGraphically, I'm operating on a Macbook Pro, intel i5 processor with an Intel HD graphics card and it was really laggy for me, EVEN after I lowered the details to their lowest levels.\nIt wasn't brutally slow, but playable.\nThe level of detail in this game is simply put, breathtaking. I love the lore that this game has to offer. Also, the jump scares are totally worth it.\nI would reccomend this game to anyone looking for an adventure game but without the time dedication that most have nowadays.\nReplayability wise, I'm under the notion that this game does have multiple endings, but only because of the achievements the game offers.\nThumbs up!","October 27, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I haven't been frightened or unnerved in quite a while but this game had an effect on me. The Park has a genuinely creepy vibe and manages to maintain its atmosphere for the duration of the game. Be warned, however, that the subject matter is very disturbing especially as the pieces of the story come together and the player realizes what has actually happened.\n\nMy first play through was over 2 hours long and I did not meet all of the Steam achievements, so I will definitely play again at least a few more times. The story is good enough that you will be compelled to play in the future, so there is good value to be had in the $10 - $13 price tag. The Secret World bonuses included with The Park make this purchase especially worthwhile for those with characters in the MMO or who are willing to try it out.","October 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It's really short, I finished in about 90 minutes but apparently missed a few things since I missed a few achievements. I would describe it as more "disturbing" than "scary"; there's a lot here that has to do with depression and how it affects people even without supernatural events adding to it. So don't go in expecting lots of gore or jump-scares (though there are a few of those).

Giving you a glimpse into madness itself using the whimsy and charm of an amusement park from hell. You will guide a young mother as she searches for her son Callum. Along the way you begin to unravel the mystery of the park and learn more about Lorraine. While I enjoyed the game cinematically, there are times the game takes your out of the action and lets you just watch. Which is fine but I never felt like I was in any real danger. For the most part The Park does rely on jump scares to get you. There are moments of intensity and dread but low on the actual scare factor.(Atleast for me) As for the story of The Park, to really understand it or enjoy it is a matter of interpretation and plenty of reading. Scraps of paper and notes are strewn about the game and give you a glimpse into the backstory of the world. By the end though you are still left with more questions then answers. I think this was done purposefully though. Something that buyers should beware is that the game does have some glitches. The game crashed once on initial start up and I had to restart after Callum got scared of escalators and prevented me from moving further. Despite these minor hiccups, I did really enjoy the somber story of The Park. The ending is quite shocking and leaves you with your mouth open. The only gripe I have is that certain pieces of backstory are connected to another game. Which I haven't played. The connected stories are rather loose and doesn't necessarily prevent you from enjoying The Park but those looking to really dig into the lore and story will need to venture further onto message boards and wikis. In all it is a well defined story and had me intrigued to the very last minute.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/gGkw71VOEhA\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","November 1, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I strongly disagree. The developers made it clear from the trailer just a few weeks ago it would be short and focus on the story, rather than the length of the game. Everyone should check the length of a game before buying it if they're unsure of it's quality. It took 1½ hours for me to complete it and it was a perfect length, I'd say. The price is acceptable and is similar to Gone Home and Dear Esther. Two games that are also pretty short and very good.\n\nThe story was incredibly well written and it really got to me. I won't spoil it for you but it was told in a very beautiful, yet scary way. If you interact with all optional things and read as many papers as you can find, you are in for a treat.

I mostly grabbed this because I am a fan of The Secret World MMO, and this game is set within that universe. I appreciated the deeper insight into the the park and its denizens.\n\nThis is less of a game than an interactive short story... and by interactive, you're really just picking things up and examining them. There is no combat or puzzle solving or any other aspects of a traditional computer game that you may be expecting.\n\nThat aside, it was fairly creepy... especially with headphones on so you can hear the nuances of the sound effects. It would have been much creepier in the dark, but the sun was still up when I decided to try it out.\n\nThe only bad things I have to say about it are that it is short (finished it in less than 2 hours) and towards the end, there are elements that repeat over and over. While I know that is there to elicit a psychological effect, I started to get bored of the repetitiveness of it. I also felt the ending was a bit lackluster, but fitting. With the buildup, I guess I was expecting something more dramatic. I was also hoping for more paranormal elements, given the tie in with The Secret World.\n\nAnyway, for the price, this game is worth playing if you're a fan of the psychological horror genre, or you're a fan or player of The Secret World MMO.

Is this actually a game?\nIf you, like me, consider that an interactive software needs some sort of obstacles, adversity, or problem solving to be considered a game, then no, it is not a game. The Park won't ask you to solve any puzzle, nor will it ever hide from you the means to progress, and there is no conditions for failure.\n\n2. Is it an enjoyable experience?\nFor me, it was.\n\n3. What are the game's strengths?\nWhile the story of this game is not the most original (especially if you are already familiar with Salomon Island), it still keeps you interested, and wanting to discover more as you go. Another strength is in the game's ambiance, carefully and successfully crafted mainly through carefully used sound effects and lighting.\n\n4. Any blatant flaw?\nA few technical flaws, most notably during the first quarter of the game, can be a little bit distracting. I experienced stuttering during the first part, and noticed what I would call a lack of polish during the same part. Thankfully, once I walked into the actual park, I did not notice any of that anymore.\n\n5. Is it worth the price?\nIf your personal equation is based on a "time versus money" reasoning, then no, clearly not. The average time needed to beat The Park is well under two hours, and it has little to none replayability. However, that time is well spent, so if you don't mind paying 10 bucks for an hour or two of entertainment, go for it. And you can always wait for a sale.\n\n6. Should I buy it because of the items for The Secret World?\nWho does not like power... and chipmunks?","October 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Now, let's break this down.\n\nThe game follows a depressed mother looking for her lost child in a really creepy amusement park named Atlantic something. Moving on, the game soon takes a turn for the worst when the sky darkens and you wander around with this woman talking to you, telling the most tragic (but very well written) story about her life, her contradicting views on Callum, her son, and some conversation between her and a skinny, well dressed Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas (if you don't know what I'm talking about please re-evaluate your entire life). The game seems to follow the story of Hansel and Gretel (follow the path and when you see the swan boat ride, ride it to get an achievement and a man retelling the story). References to the tale are mentioned here and there.\n\nIf you've played Outlast before (which I reccomend HIGHLY if you haven't), then you know what jumpscare and gore horror is. This is not that. I'm not saying there's not blood and bodies in this game, but the numbers, compared to Outlast, are few; however, this game is scary, but more psychologically.\n\nPros:\n-fantastic story\n-creepy atmosphere\n-sp00ky soundtrack\n\nCons:\nThe only con I have about this game is that it's really short. You can finish it within an hour, which sucked because I really got into the story.\n\n8.5/10\n\nHasta la vista, baby\n\n-Citrus","October 27, 2015","true","1.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The Park is rather linear in that regard, so there is little exploring of hidden places, but plenty of exploring of scenes, especially in the later parts.\n\nThere are a lot, and I mean a lot, of allusions to The Secret World, most of which are not pertienent to the story here, but a nice little touch for Secret Warriors. Beware, if you haven't finished New England in TSW there may be slight spoilers here, depending on how much you pick up and can draw the right conclusions.\n\nThe atmosphere can be nothing short of terrifying if you're able to immerse yourself. There is some excellent sound design helping this and some of the scenery and set pieces are sufficiently creepy, even if the're not really innovative. The old standbys (creepy dolls, flocks of birds, etc.) work for a reason.\n\nI don't want to go into story, since in my opinion it's mostly a matter of personal taste if you like a story or not, but let it be said, as mentioned before, that it fits very well within the universe of The Secret World, not only because of atmosphere and "shout outs", but also because of theme.\n\nIn the end, I recommend The Park with the caveats mentioned in my review.

(See the cons list for the flip side of this.)\nThe creepy feeling of mental instability without just relying on jump scares to cause the player to question the environment.\nInteresting visual effects.\nCONS:\nYour journey into insanity is abruptly interrupted two or three times (in this under an hour game) just when you think your character is on the brink with normal toned dialogue. It just sucks you right out of the mood. A short example: Wildly tripping out on drugs and seeing things, passing out, and then waking up and having a fairly casual conversation in narrative mode as if nothing just happened.\nIf you watched the trailer, you know about 20% of the potentially scary content of the game.\nVery, very short game. Maybe 50 minutes. Almost no real replay-ability. (FYI. You have to idle the game for an extra 2 1/2 hours just to get the trading card.)\nA fairly abrupt ending leaves you feeling fairly unsatisfied.\n\nIn short, this is an entertaining story of a woman with mental issues walking toward insanity trying to find her wildly disobedient son. I think me saying anything more would spoil it.\n\nVerdict:\nFor a discounted price (-50% off, or about $6) this is worth checking out, even if painfully short and a bit flawed regarding the smoothness of its narration and timing of dialogue.\n\n7 out of 10","October 28, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

In terms of what you actually do as a player your only options are to shout out for the protagonists son and to toggle between run and walk. The primary interactive elements come in the form of interactable documents within the world which you can choose to examine on discovery as well as a few rides which you may choose to ride upon or not.\n\nHowever what the game lacks for in terms of direct gameplay it makes up for in atomosphere. The developer clearly was hoping to capture the creepy factor of an abandoned amusement park, in this they have largely been successful. The game is not overly reliant upon jump scares and rather focuses on the pyschological horror of a protagonist who clearly has deep seated mental issues.\n\nThe storytelling is excellent, going in I expected the plot to be fairly straight forward as Lorraine (The player character) became increasing panicked to get her son back. Without spoiling anything I can say that she is a far more complex character and the plot goes to some very dark places.\n\nOverrall the game is an excellent horror experience with quality voice acting, writing and world building. However it lacks much interactivity and is decidedly short. The side information found through documents is also likely to be less interesting to those who aren't invested in the wider The Secret World universe.","October 27, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I found myself lowering the sensitivity and simply taking my time through the environments, looking everywhich direction.\n\nSound 9/10, despite a repetitious spamming of the "call-out" button, every line of VO never went stale. Very engaging how the lines would change as you would progress.

Not your typical "horror" genre game. Do yourself a favour, shut off the lights, slap in some earphones and enjoy the ride.\n\nDoes it warrant the $10? Yes if you're willing to invest an hour or two solely into this game, diving into it with no disturbances.\nNo if you're expecting a cheap thrill and want to play this game in parts.

Let me begin by saying while I'm not exactly the most steel-balled human being on this earth, I'm not a regular at Weenie Hut Jrs either.\n\nAt a glance (low settings, laptops are for idiots, read: me) graphics are looking really good, even on the lowest setting. I peeked over at ultra now and then and there wasn't a HUGE visible difference, but it's all looking really good. My only big wtf moment so far was the protagonist's mom pants.\n\nScare factor sets in pretty early. If static, whispered voices, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kids are pros in your gaming experience, congratulations, this game is for you. If you don't hate children, you probably will about ten minutes in.\n\nBonus vague commentary: Well, I've definitely never heard this version of Hansel and Gretel before.\n\nGreat graphics, horrifying atmosphere, the dialogue can be a little poetic and out of place at first but after awhile you're kind of going '/oh/' with realization. As far as jump scares go there aren't many, and while the hand-writing on a few notes could use clearing up (or at least a clearer version on sidebar maybe?) it definitely sets the mood. Obviously disregard that last bit if there is a setting somewhere for that, I might just be an idiot.\n\nPlease note I haven't actually finished the game, but I went into this entirely blind and I'm pretty pleased so far. I'm about 80% in (I think) and am ready to ♥♥♥♥ punch any amusement park mascot for the rest of my life.\n\n8/10 so far. On the fear scale I'd rate it about a 'never visit an amusement park ever again' with a little of 'being a parent is the worst thing you can wish on anyone'.","November 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am going to RECOMMEND this game with some conditions.   If you get it on sale, or if you just want to support Funcom then it is recommended.   It is well put together.   It is extremely short, and it is very much on rails.   I don't think the decisions I made in the game really had much of a game factor.   It is more like playing a twisted movie (and yes it is twisted) where your actions determine when the movie progresses to the next part.\n\nAs a developer myself this felt very much like a nifty tech demo for the Unreal Engine, almost like Funcom was messing with it to learn all the ins and outs and see where they could push it.\n\nI am a big fan of The Secret World, and this does feel like something out of that game though this Atlantic Island Park is laid out a lot different than the area in The Secret World.   This area is much bigger.\n\nI completed this so fast I am still waiting on the third card to drop.   I actually finished it in about and hour to an hour and a half.   It is far too short in my mind, and it didn't feel like a game as much as an interactive movie, where reaching certain points is like clicking the button to advance to the next scene.\n\nYou do get some cool items for your Secret World account for buying this so that does make it worth something too.\n\nOverall... I'll give it a YES, but be warned it is VERY short.   It may be the shortest game I personally have ever played.","November 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Regret paying 8 bucks, but still wasn't completely disgusted by what I found.\n\n\nFew notes, story is told entirely to quickly. You know the end 5 mins in if you are quick thinking, 15 if you are normal, and 30 if you're ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. At first it seems original, but the main character feels stale and was easy for me to hate 20 mins in, and her personalilty is basically told in the parts everyone hated in Metroid other M. This lead to me attempting to try and put this 'mother' in dangerous situations, but even when the enemies are around you either can't touch them or they wont touch you. This breaks any form of suspence and makes the game laughable. I missed the first big scare in the octopus ride because it simply was quick and hard to see with the camera locked. Also Alvin from the chipmunks stalks you a little, but is as dangerous as a real life squirel and is a joke when you yell at him the first encounter for the rest of the game.\nGood things are the atmosphere is great, as well as character design and graphics. It is the most pleasant walking sim I have played.\nStill its a ♥♥♥♥ing walking sim all the same, padded with forced walking naration, and a silent hill pt clone for 1/5-6 the game. Its too predictable, and wastes using all oppertunities to try and give a sense of dread and alreatness of the player. You know nothing will happen to you especially after the hooked hand dude just pushes you infinately making it fun to walk at his ♥♥♥. You have no opposition. Plus its hard to be afraid when the women you play cries out in fear for you. I was not really afraid of anything, jumped 3 times, 2 of which were the cutouts in the Haunted House, being the first one happening off screen, and the secound being around a corner.\nStill, I hope devs make a new game, it looks great and has a nice feel, but it was like watchig a shark in a fish tank, impressive, but lacking the stress it has if you were in the tank as well. And then it dies after you finally get it home.\nAnd higher a writer to do your story telling. Y'all ♥♥♥♥ing suck at it XD.\nSo if devs actually read this, the next game like this needs:\n*owl like camera, save situations like the rollercoaster(better yet, punish/reward those brave or foolish enough to stare/look at monsters)\n*make monster intimadating or keep them out of reach (hook hand was a joke when he pushed me 26 times)\n*better longer story, hold off forshadowing events\n*multiple endings (drive away punishes you with scary cut scene, ending where story isn't explained, true ending, etc.)\n*more dark and light requirements (flashlight essential, darker enviroment.)\n*more pills :P\n*allow running at all times, make something force you onwards or it effects end(monsters chase you, cut scenes if they grab you, black out in net area with way back blocked off, works as a event counter where it lowers sanity effecting ends)\n*more monster sounds, less peaceful music\n*no monolouges\nHope these devs make a bigger game like this one.","February 7","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, it was a psychological thrill ride from start to finish; many reviews you'll see claim the game can be finished in an hour, or even half an hour if you rush and don't attempt to unravel the mystery. That's part of the fun, though; I played the game with my boyfriend at my side, and we both watched on as the story of the regretful mother began to unfold. The scenery is well-designed and eerie, the voice acting is especially disconcerting at times, and everything about the game came together so nicely to tell the story.

Jump scares were minimal and it was really the overall atmosphere that made this game scary.  There were things i thought didn't match up, and i was wondering why.  Then i got to the end and it all made sense.  The scenery is tense, the music and tones are extremely appropriate, and the screen effects were a very nice touch and captured the feeling of fear extremely well.  This game deals with issues that are rarely and almost taboo to even touch on but its approached in such a gradual way (even for such a short game) that i felt for the main character.

Though it can be very scary at times, I just don't the fact that they say it is very focused on storytelling, which it was not. I only got a little bit out of the story and expected everything to wrap up at the end, but it doesn't. What's the dark secret of the park they want you to discover? I don't know. I just didn't get it.\n\nThe game's mechanics are pretty simple. You walk, you find notes, you read them, you continue walking. You can call for your son (whose name was so weird I can't seem to remember it) by right clicking, and I thought that was a pretty neat idea. But...\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS.\n\nIn the end it's pointless because you kill him by stabbing him with a halloweenpumpkin carving knife in the head? I don't know.\n\nThis game is VERY obviously inspired by Five nights at Freddy's. I mean you can't get any closer. There's something that's basically like the bit of '87, but here it's a guy who worked there and they had to wear mascot suits (SOUND FAMILIAR?) who killed a bunch of teenagers  for no real reason in 1979. I guess they were also going for something similar to FNaF where people speculate and theorise about it and the other incidents mentioned in newspapers and notes you find in the game, but really, they're just too vague and not too interesting. There was something going on about a guy who needs energy for a machine that makes eternal life possible or something like that, but they never really explained that. There was also a note by someone saying his old school friend who was working in the park as one of those mascots got really weird and wanted to be called chad (the name of the mascot) from then on and never wanted to get out of the suit. Now, this is a really interesting idea. But it REALLY doesn't work. Guess why? It's never mentioned again. EVER.\n\n\n--SPOILERS OVER--\n\nIn the end, The Park is one of those games you play once, get kind of scared, and then never play again except for a let's play or to try harder to get the story this time.\n\n6/10","October 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XperiencedTV/recommended/402020/","XperiencedTV","Xperienced","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XperiencedTV/","134 products in account","We got our hands on Funcom’s new psychological horror game The Park to see how a game that cites Gone Home and Dear Esther as inspirations. Personally, I thought there was also quite a large Silent Hill 2 influence in there as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2GmK-kq58A\n\nThe whole game takes place in an amusement park on the premise that your son, Callum, has lost his teddy bear. While you head over to talk to the guy behind the counter, you hear Callum (at least we assume it’s Callum) running behind you and into the park. This begins your journey into the park and into insanity.\n\nAs we mentioned, you’re a mother to a small boy (Lorraine) and you have to look for Callum by calling out his name (which provides some clues and also some responses from him) and riding on the rides in the park. There’s not really much you can do while you’re on the rides, but we would suggest looking around as much as you can. This is where you end up seeing things and where the sound design comes into its own, but more on that later.\n\nThere isn’t really any other mechanics apart from that. It’s more of a psychological experience / experiment rather than a game. But sometimes it’s better that way without having to solve puzzles to progress the storyline. It’s what made Slender one of the biggest horror game franchises in the past.\n\nGraphically we were getting around 30 fps on average, but that improved later in the game to 60. It may have been something running in the background. It looks pretty nice and the park seems quite well designed for a horror setting. The pristine look soon vanishing for an abandoned look once you get to the top of the entrance. The game requires a level of darkness to really appreciate, but at times it can be a bit tricky to see if you use their recommended settings. The game doesn’t have much in the way of characters, but every now and again you might view Lorraine (the protagonist) in a 3rd person view or Chad The Chipmunk with his evil looking red eyes.\n\nChad, it seems, is one of those park mascots that you normally get in large amusement parks to entertain the guests. It soom becomes apparent, however, that not everything is right with Chad. Someone has scrawled a poem on his statue and your first encounter with him leaves you feeling incredibly uneasy. There’s more to the Chad story, but we don’t want to give away any spoilers here.\n\nThe sound design in The Park really work well to create the atmosphere of an abandoned amusement park and the way sounds come and go as you walk around or ride the rides can make you pretty tense. The banging and splashing on the swan ride really made me feel uneasy. The voice acting isn’t too bad and is fairly believable as Lorraine becomes ever increasingly frantic in her hunt for Callum. There are times when your ability to call out is removed, but that’s generally only on the rides.\n\nIt’s nice to have a horror game that isn’t all about jump scares. Yes, there are one or two in the game, but they’re not the be-all-end-all of things. The fear comes from that sense of thinking something is going to happen soon. Is there something hiding behind that rock? Will that teddy bear suddenly move?… WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! NOPE! NOPE! NOPE! If played properly with the lights low and headphones on with the volume up, this game can (and probably will) put the willies up you. It gets even more sinister as you learn about the park itself and Chad… Damn you, Chad… The ice-sculpting chipmunk…\n\nThe game is only a short one. Its story it told in the space of one to two hours and is a great late-night romp for anyone looking for something a bit different to what’s currently going around. As an added bonus, if you also play Funcom’s The Secret World, this game will unlock some special items in that game for you (imagine running around as a giant killer chipmunk… You’re welcome).\n\nOverall, it’s well worth a look and one that should do well for Halloween. If you do play The Secret World, then it’s a no brainer to get this one. Otherwise, you can still grab this, turn out the lights, turn up the volume and have yourself a scary evening.","October 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I intentionally say experience instead of game, because that's what it was to me; it was an interactive movie. The quality of writing and voice acting is, as expected from a The Secret World tie-in, top notch, and the visuals are very good too. The pace at the beginning is a bit on the slower side, but it more than makes up for it halfway through the experience, and at the end, you're fully focused on what unfolds. Would I recommend this game/experience to others? Of course I would! It's well worth the 10€, and if you're an existing The Secret World player (or new for that matter, a trial is offered within The Park), you get some nice in-game bonuses (cosmetics and gear) to claim.","October 29, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The exposure is a fun experience that I'm glad I had, especially in the halloween season, and I'd gladly recommend it to anyone.  There's a mastery of atmosphere here, especially in the final area, that latches onto something deep inside the primal fear and scratches at it.  Madness.   Death.   Sicknesses of the heart and mind that grow more frightening the more you think about them, and this game makes you think about them.\n\nThat said...for those who've played The Secret World, it's a special blend of nostalgia that's like having an old nightmare that used to be recurrent as a child.  Atlantic Park is a fairly involved quest hub in the second area of the MMO, but you only get to see it after everything has completely fallen apart.\nGlimpses into the park in in it's glory days in "The Park" are a kind of chilling wonderful, and the voice acting and storytelling serve as a canny guide, but vets of TSW pick up on many more details (such as references to the local academy and the "Brooklyn crowd" in notes), and for those of us who have seen what horrors Winter's plan eventually brings to the park and the surrounding island, there is a very real sense of "hopeless hope" that maybe somehow the future we know is coming will not come.\n\nIf you like this game, Join us in The Secret World, where you'll get so many more creepy stories.\nIf you're already a vet of TSW...buy this game.    Crack open a Bingo! Cola, and see how messed up Solomon Island already was before the bomb went off in Tokyo.","October 28, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Which is hopefully never.\n\nI would say the Park is like an interactive movie--playtime is about the length of one, you can't die, and there's no quicktime or combat. You explore a horrifying amusement park while trying to find your child, and witness everything fall apart in something more immersive than a movie would be. If you prefer challenging content this probably won't be your cup of tea, but if you like a terrifying atmosphere and a dark horror story, I highly recommend checking it out.\n\nThis game deals with depression (and how terribly it was handled in the 80s), and a pretty dark side of parenthood. There are also a few bright flashes on the rollercoaster, though nowhere near as bad as the trailer--they seemed pretty well spaced out, as I recall. Do exercise caution if any of these might be harmful or upsetting.\n\nThe Park is tied in with the MMO The Secret World--it takes place in a location that exists in TSW and drops a few names, but in no way does it require having played TSW first. It's perfectly self-contained, and you won't lose any of the horror if you only play the Park. However, I do recommend at least taking advantage of the one-week trial this game gives you, because TSW has similarly strong story and atmosphere and the majority can be played solo if you so choose. It'll also give you reason to re-play the Park after you finish Solomon Island, to see what extra context you recognize.\n\nAll in all, the Park is high on atmosphere, with a few jump scares and a lot of psychological horror that gets steadily heavier as you near the end.\n\nQ̖̣͖͔͍̭u͎̮͖̼̗̝͍͢a͟c̭̪̘k҉̖ ̠͈̤̲q̣̣̜̺̝͟ṷ̸̙̯̣ḁ̳̣͘ͅc͙͈k̲͔̺̖̲ ̸̘͚̟͖̰̹q̙͎͉̤̳̯ͅu̬̭̥ac̳̟͟k͕̪͔ ̹̬͕̭͖q̞͙̖̬̬u̪̗̬͙a͉̖̙͖͈̥͙c̫͚̭͍͢ḱ̦.̦","October 29, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I usually don't get vocal when I play even horror games, and this one has had me yelping, "THAT WAS NOT OK, GAME!!" more than once. The atmosphere is fabulous, which doesn't surprise me from Funcom if you want the truth. Story has me engaged and I love that Lorraine is not who you would expect for a mom-looking-for-child character. I want to know more about her rather than just writing her off as someone I've seen before in a game. I'm liking the art as well, it's a very darkly pretty game.\n\nVery few jumpscares compared to many recent horror games, the few I've run into fit perfectly. If you're holding off thinking this is a Five Nights at Freddy's thing, you don't have to worry. (Could have told you that already, but with actualy gameplay I can confirm. ^^)\n\nWhile I am already a huge fan of The Secret World, I'd say you don't have to have played to enjoy this game.

There aren't a lot of jump scares, or monsters, or danger. The parts that I'd say are frightening are very few -- though they definitely get the adrenaline flowing -- and it's not even possible to die or "lose."\n\nWhat makes The Park so unnerving is not the bit where you're lost in a haunted amusement built to harvest the souls of the innocent. No, it's learning about Lorraine and her struggles as a mother. I don't want to give too much away, but this game is far more intimate and emotional than you'd expect from a horror game. It's over very quickly, but it's worth every penny.\n\nThe Park is also a spin-off of The Secret World, another brilliant game I can't recommend enough, but you don't need to have played TSW to understand or appreciate The Park. The references to TSW are many but subtle, and The Park works fine as a standalone.

That's not a complaint, that's just re-stating what the developers said all along, since I've seen many people complaining about it.  And for those complaining about the cost, think of the it as the price of admission to a movie.  It lasts about as long as a long movie, and tells a good story that you get to participate in, which some people do in the theaters; but in this case, you are supposed to.\n\nI really enjoyed the game.  I took it slow and participated in the ambiance.  That's what makes this an engrossing game.  I am slightly biased, as the sinister carnival scenario is my favorite theme (which is why I really like the amusement park area in Secret World).\n\nIf you are looking for a fast paced game, skip this one.  It is intentionally slow paced.  It is linear, but that is necessary to make sure the story unfolds as it should, and doesn't detract from the game; it didn't feel forced to me.\n\nI liked the fact that it was psychological horror, and not just full of jump scares (there were almost no jump scares, but I'm not telling where the couple that are there are located...).\n\nI did like the ending as it was, to me, somewhat ambiguous, leaving a lot of room to think about the game and the journey there instead of having things spoon fed to me.\n\nIt's a lovely homage to Lovecraft, which is also another of my favorites.  There was obvious influence from Silent Hill; again one of my favorites.  So all in all a nice mixup of goodness.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that Lorraine's wrists really creep me out; the model bends all wrong.  :)\n\nI would like to see more stories presented this way.  No guns or fights; just good story telling.\n\nKudos to Funcom for stepping outside the mold.\n\nIt is definitely worth taking a trip through.","October 28, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While I approached the game as a vet of The Secret World (MMORPG from which the game is based), I have to wonder whether someone who hasn't played the MMO would have the same appreciation.\n\nAll things considered, I think I've seen worse games for the same pricetag or for more. With hundreds of early access titles charging double for an experience that may never be complete, I think a concise thriller like The Park was well worth the money spent.","October 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Gets it right. It's first and foremost a twisted and disturbing story. A haunting tale befit any campfire story telling time. It is dressed up in well done art design, and a fantastic nightmarish setting of an evil mysterious theme park at night. The game goes beyond the sharp textures and high poly models to incorporate reflections, shadows, and intense surreal moments to draw you into the nightmare. What I loved the most is the audio work followed by the pacing, that heightens this short game to a much broader level. Each hour is fantastic, and the build up to the end is superb and not to be missed.\n\nWhat I loved\n- The audio work\n- The outstanding pacing, slow at first, heavy on the clues, the fast paced blurs and intesified scares leading to a mind blowing conclusion\n- Art design\n- Mr. Hat\n- They killed Freddy Faz Bear in a van? WTF\n\nWhat I didnt like\n- It's short. Even if three hours is packed to the rim with details and thrills.

It took me 90 minutes to finish the game, yet my playing time was reset to 0. I had to turn on the game for five minutes to be able to write a review. If you're asking yourself if I did finish it - you get 12 out of 14 achievments when you get the BEE end (you'll see what I mean).\n\n***\n\nRelying heavily on The Secret World lore which I consider to be the most interesting one in world of MMORPGs (just my opinion, no need to prove me wrong), The Park is short and sweet narrative experience. Feeling more like an interactive movie than a game, The Park lets you play a role of young mother searching for her son lost in a local theme park. As the time passes, you'll soon realize something sinister is out there, but the real question is: where's the sinister at - around or inside of you?\n\nGaming mechanics are pretty simple and the experience is basically a linear ride (no pun intended) reminding me a lot of rail shooter mechanics (although you can walk). That could prove to be a fatal decision in other games, but The Park tends to let you soak up the gloomy atmosphere and enjoy the little horror details. A wonderful and traumatic story is being told not only through words, but also through colors and sounds.\n\nIf you're too old to be trick or treating (is that even possible?) or you're simply sick of annual Halloween marathons, do yourself a favor - get The Park, turn off the lights, put on your headphones and turn it up.\n\nRide of (for) your life!\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","October 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

The text is too small to be read properly and I seriously didn't bother with most of them (you just HAVE to read the ones with Chad the Chipmunk though -- creepy as ♥♥♥♥). Maybe the creators wanted to go for an authentic feel, which I'm all for! But if you as creators could 1.) Enlarge the text or 2.) First show the authentic papers and with a second click show the text with normal "read-friendly" letters. Square-Enixs "Life Is Strange" did this perfectly. Maybe you could check out som videos of it?

Even though it only took under two hours to finish, for $10 I enjoyed it more than most horror films I pay about the same to see in a theater.\n\nFor the first 20 minutes I found it mediocre. Some things didn't make much sense, required some suspension of disbelief, and at a few points I was at a loss as to where to go. It soon picked up, throwing in a few jump sacres (some cliche, some really well done) and a constantly increasing tension and creepiness. By the end I was on the edge of my seat, engulfed in the story.\n\nThe soundtrack and effects did a great job of making the key points of the game really stand out. The visuals were decent, though clearly limited by art budget in places. (C'mon, guys! The haunted house is filled with stationary cardboard cut-outs instead of at least mannequins?)\n\nAnd as a technical note, I had to put my graphics settings on Low to make the game playable. I'm not sure why, as I haven't had that issue with any other modern games.\n\nBut by the end, the attention to detail and the clever storytelling overcame the game's flaws.

But I am skipping ahead.\n\nThe Park is a Game by Funcom, the minds behind The Secret World and it plays in the Amusement Park from the same game. If you are solid in TSW Lore, skip this next paragraph if not this might help\n\nAn old man decided to harness the magic power of Solomon Island, he did so by constructing a park and using it as a Magic Circuit. However, Usually those kinds of things never go well, and it so happens that the Magic very much tainted the Park. And so during construction and while the park was running terrible accidents and way too much death happened - Until the Player Character comes along and finishes/fixes what the old man once started.\n\nThis game happens before that happens.\n\nThe Park is one of those experiences you want to be over and you want that to be soon. In a good way. The game can be finished in about 2 hours and leads you through something I never really considered to be scars - a deserted Amusement Park at Night. (Given we are in ♥♥♥♥ed Up Land, but yes.)\nThe Game opens with a message telling you that it "might play around with control and Audio settings" - just to f**k with you and yes, controls feel a bit sluggish at times, especially towards the end.\n\nthe Story is conveyed through the Main character, a mother whose son ran off into the Park to look for his lost teddy bear, talking to herself and occasionally when you Press X To Jason. You will also find reports, Letters and newspaper clippings, but thats not the norm here.\nthe Atmosphere is just creepy. the park is very small but still manages to creep the living ♥♥♥♥ out of me at times. when you step into the rides you'll find that the game does not play with the usual Horror Game Frights, but more relateable ones. Losing your kid in a Park, going 60+ on a Ferris Wheel. The fact that you can only look around on those... Really gives you an increased feeling of helplessness\n\nAudio - there is almost no music, save for a few notes around some rides and soundwise I didnt pick much up either, However onething providing mild discomfort was that at times whey would play a Bassy sound.\n\nOverall the game is (very) short for its price, but an Experience to be had. It also extends on one of the major points in the first area of TSW.\n\nHonestly tho, this game left me with a lot more Questions than answers.

It's the video-game equivalent of "The Shining" except without all the sweetness and light. It's spooky, it's got some good scares, and it's a compelling horror story. I've heard it panned as "a walking simulator" and that's a fair complaint - BUT it's not meant to be a FPS, quick-time-event, combat game. It's a story-game - where you explore your environment, interact with objects, and learn what really happened that fateful day at Atlantic Island Park. This game is absolutely best experienced in a dark room with headphones on.  The sound and voice acting are phenomenal.","October 27, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It took me 90 minutes to finish the game, yet my playing time was reset to 0. I had to turn on the game for five minutes to be able to write a review. If you're asking yourself if I did finish it - you get 12 out of 14 achievments when you get the BEE end (you'll see what I mean).\n\n***\n\nRelying heavily on The Secret World lore which I consider to be the most interesting one in world of MMORPGs (just my opinion, no need to prove me wrong), The Park is short and sweet narrative experience. Feeling more like an interactive movie than a game, The Park lets you play a role of young mother searching for her son lost in a local theme park. As the time passes, you'll soon realize something sinister is out there, but the real question is: where's the sinister at - around or inside of you?\n\nGaming mechanics are pretty simple and the experience is basically a linear ride (no pun intended) reminding me a lot of rail shooter mechanics (although you can walk). That could prove to be a fatal decision in other games, but The Park tends to let you soak up the gloomy atmosphere and enjoy the little horror details. A wonderful and traumatic story is being told not only through words, but also through colors and sounds.\n\nIf you're too old to be trick or treating (is that even possible?) or you're simply sick of annual Halloween marathons, do yourself a favor - get The Park, turn off the lights, put on your headphones and turn it up.\n\nRide of (for) your life!\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","October 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Gameplay was very predictable, not much really happened.  I did like the atmosphere, but for a horror game it was just not scary at all! It was more a walking simulator.\n\nOnly a little suspense, and it became pretty clear early in game that nothing would happen.  The sounds did not actually do anything. they were just background sounds. Actually, apart from 1 or 2  jump scares, nothing actually happened.\n\nI liked the idea of the way to use the voice as a guidance instead of an arrow or something, but it has not worked out well. (And actually turned out to be pretty useless). Also the story has some logical flaws.  It looks and feels just like a quick moneymaker. Could have been much more. Very disappointed.  Since i took it slow and read and reread all book covers and letters (Which is actually is the only thing what makes the game slightly interesting) , I am probably too late for a refund.  I did not expect it to be THIS short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/402020/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","IntroductionThe Park… an interesting, although generic, title. One that you might not necessarily link to an amusement park (unless you already took a look at the screenshots). What we all want to know, however, is this: is it a walk in the park or is there more than meets the eye here?\n\nGameplayWhen I say ‘walk in the park’ I mean that quite literally actually. It’s a semi-interactive game but all you do is basically walk. It’s what people call a ‘walking simulator’ these days, and for good reason. There’s usually not much to do in games like this and they’re dependent on the story being told. Anyway, you walk along a set path (you can branch off into a different direction, but that’s it) while the story is being told by monologues and objects found in the game world and, of course, scripted events. These objects are usually found in the form of documents and books and can sometimes be interacted with, but it’s all very limited. Players of Gone Home will know what to expect. Usually the written material lies hidden in plain sight and sometimes it requires a tiny bit of exploring, but even without exploring you should understand the story without too many problems. Besides reading you will also be able to get on the rides. In fact, the rides are the biggest part of the story.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543079035\nSince the game is quite short (one to two hours) I can’t really go into the story as much as I would like. In fact, I can’t go anything it all without spoiling something. Just saying something short could spoil (a part of) the experience and it wouldn’t be fun for (potential) players, as well as the developer who put (a lot of) time, money and effort into it. If you eventually decide to play this game and you finished and enjoyed it within two hours of playtime then do yourself a favor and don’t try to request a refund. It would be quite insulting to the developer and good art should be appreciated.\n\nThe atmosphere is grim and tense and overall the look of the game is dark and moody. It fits the story very well. There are some good scares, but thankfully it’s kept to a minimum to maximize the effect. If that makes any sense at all.\n\nPerformance is all over the place and there are some visual glitches. While fine tuning the graphics (i.e. setting everything to Ultra) my entire screen became very blurry. The only way to fix it was to set the graphics settings to Auto. But then the framerate kept going up and down. Unfortunately, it was the only way to get decent visuals so I eventually decided to just play it that way. For game a short as this one I expected solid performance so it’s quite disappointing to see that it hasn’t been optimized properly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543079094\nAudio & VisualsThe audio design is magnificent: the ambient music is good and the voice acting is nothing short of amazing. The sound effects, while reasonably limited, are solid and help immerse you into the story. One of the best parts of the game.\n\nAs you may have seen already the visuals are also quite pretty. All of the models have good detail and okay-ish/decent textures, but since the atmosphere is already quite dark most people won’t notice or simply won’t care. In the end it’s nothing groundbreaking and that’s why it’s such a shame that the game can’t manage to keep a steady 60FPS.\n\nLength/Replay ValueThe Park is a short one to two hour experience. It’s linear, but there’s a lot of information (written and spoken) implemented and therefore you might want to play it a second time. I doubt you’ll come to back it after that, though. There’s really not much else to do.\n\nConclusionWhile The Park might not be the best walking simulator out there it does a good job at trying to tell an emotional and thrilling, at times even intense, story. It succeeds mostly, but still has some flaws.\nIt might not be everyone’s cup of tea due to the lack of interactivity but if you can look past that (and the horrible performance) then there’s a good game to be found here, with some great storytelling.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=543079061\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Moody and dark atmosphere with pretty visuals\n+ Immerse and interesting story\n+ Sound design is just excellent\n\nMixed:\n+/- It has a short length, which I personally don’t consider a con, but it definitely could’ve been a little longer\n\nCons:\n- Feels a bit like an experiment\n- Hardly any replay value\n- Performance is all over the place/Very unoptimized\n- Can feel very passive at times\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 7.7 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

The jump scares was predictable and very cheap. The character chad was way to hyped with the aid of the clues in the game and the store picture. I think chad was shown a total of 3 times in person. The main antagonist was also not really shown as much. The atmosphere was creepy enough, they just failed to follow up. I really enjoyed the story. It kinda felt like shutter island or inception.  the game gives you clues about the story of the park aswell as the story of the character you play. Im not sure if what i think is right, but I think the park is just an illusion or an imagniation. To avoid major spoilers i will not go tell anything more that that.\n\nBy giving out such clues about what's really going on makes the gameplay a bit better.

It starts with what some may consider a slow burn as it builds up the story, but the horror atmosphere just continued to increase until it was nearly unplayable for me (a great thing in a horror game).  There are a number of jump scares once you get at least half way through, most of them exceedingly well done.  What this does is put you constantly on edge, wondering what are they going to do to me next?\n\nThe story is quite interesting and takes a dark turn pretty quickly.  It's told to you by the narrator (the playable character) and also by notices and notes that you find.  If you are paying attention, it builds a good sense of mystery which also keeps you on your toes.  The game ends with what seems a P.T. inspired segment that had me in a near panic.\n\nThe only negative thing I would say about this game is that the letters were hard to read on my laptop.  Other than that, it was one of the best horror experiences I have had on PC.  If you don't mind the short playing time (1.3 hours for me) and love horror like I do, I definitely recommend getting this.","October 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You don’t die here, you’re never in any real danger and there are no “run or die” moments. All those achievements only require curiosity, not skill. The experience is more disturbing than scary, as your character looks like a normal person at first, and as the game progresses, you slowly learn that she has major issues.\n\nJust look at the screenshots and ask yourself if you’d like to walk around that kind of environment, while hearing a woman talking about her life and seeing something scary or disturbing here and there. That’s all there is to it. I recommend it because I believe it satisfies a small niche of players, of which I’m part of.","February 15","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It starts off simple enough, but soon starts down a dark path.  While I didn't find it particularly scary, <goosebumps level?> it still has its interesting moments fear wise.  To get the full effect you need to read everything, as the scattered notes are elements to the story to let you know whats going on.\n\nThe voice acting also adds a lot, you can hear the fear in Lorraine's voice build as you progress.\n\nIts a pretty good psychological horror for those into it, as you are never really in any kind of actual danger.  It runs sort of like an interactive movie, while you are free to roam wherever you want, there is more reading and 'rail riding' in following the story.

When you ride the rides it is just that you are riding a ride you may look around and some creepy things might happen, but it is a passive viewing mode.

But this isn't The Secret World.  You don't get any guns, knives, or books to protect you.  And what lies in the dark will look into you.\n\nLorraine and her son Callum live in the in no way sleepy town of Kingsmouth, New England.  No matter how much they try to leave, they just can't bring themselves to part from The Park, where Lorraine met Donald, the father of Callum.  Unfortuately misfortune struck, and it's left Lorraine and Callum in dire straits.  As a nice afternoon of forgetfulness they go to The Park.  But Callum lost his toy, and so she decides to go inquire.  Unfortunately, Callum's rambunctiousness causes him to escape the car and enter into The Park as the sun sets.  Given permission by the park entrance staff, Lorraine enters The Park to look for her son, and this is where you begin your walk through the park.\n\nI found the game to be very moody, very creepy, and quite intriguing.  The game does build on to the lore of The Secret World, but this game is definitely put together a lot better than the Secret World version of the park, and the park is pretty darn big.  The game is short, but if you're a fan of The Secret World then this is definite a must have.

The atmosphere was on point, some jumpscares did get me (I admit a few times I had to pause the game to recover), whereas there were a few towards the end of the game that felt slightly cliched, no spoilers though.\nAlthough this is essentially a walking simulator, I felt immersed and loved some of the horror mechanics introduced that weren't just trying to say boo!  Little touches which add to the suspense, things moving very slowly, noticing something out the corner of your eye.  Its small things like this which make the game much more interesting.\nI was drawn in by the story, which is quite controversial, but I'll say no more.\nOne small issue I had was the drop in frame rate at the beginning of the game, which took away from the immersion.  Had to drop down to high settings which seemed to fix the issue, but felt that it shouldn't have had a problem running on ultra.\nOne thing which I think is important in horror games is the audio, again adding to the atmosphere, the devs got this right.  All the little sounds you hear, the whispering, the protagonists desperation in her voice to find her son, and her reminiscing, all added to the immersion.  Best played with headphones so you can hear everything going on around you.\nOverall, I would recommend this game when on sale.  I completed the game in 80 minutes.  While it's all about quality and not quantity, some may be disappointed with the content for the price, but if you are after something that's got scares, and an explorative experience, this is great.","April 22","true","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Much in the vein of Sylvio, The Park offers a bleak, desperate slow burn where you slowly explore your surroundings and deal with the mysteries at hand.  There's even less combat than Sylvio and despite The Park's slant towards a nail-gnawing walking simulator the game's formula works and have a way of digging its way under your skin thanks to some frightening flashback sequences, the main character's emotional breakdown and the fact that the deeper you go into the game the more helpless you feel.\n\nThe premise is simple.  Mother Lorraine and her son Callum are about to head for home after a long day at the park but Callum left his teddy bear inside.  Despite Lorraine's rocky emotional past with her son she agrees to be the hero and find the boy's missing bear.  Within instants of being let back in the park to begin your search, it's obvious that evil forces trap you inside and soon Lorraine is on a journey filled with taunting phantoms, malfunctional amusement park rides, narrow escapes, suspenseful chases and all sorts of danger.  The game plays out like a point n' click adventure with the player tasked with tracking down the son by exploring all of the park's lucid areas, reading notes that reveal the park's history as well as the darkness in Lorraine's past.  Though you can't die and none of the puzzles are extremely difficult, you'll find the grim atmosphere begins suffocating the senses like a blanket of despair.  The establishment's supernatural denizens will play constant tricks on you, proving that your presence is unwanted.\n\nThis game's got great atmosphere with rich graphics creating breathtaking environments, rich backgrounds, lush use of light and shadow and a design aesthetic that gives even The Park's rickety, rustic rides each a personality of their own.  Not only do the graphics create a noticeable feel of decay and isolation but the sound delivers as well with haunting drones, the sudden rumble of ressurected machinery, appropriately evil dialogue from the demons and Lorraine's mental/verbal battle with herself where she reveals some particularly disturbing revelations about motherhood.  This is the purest definition of a psychological horror game as it borrows influences from film including the works of David Lynch, Jacob's Ladder, The Machinist, Session 9, Tourist Trap, Funhouse and perhaps John Carpenter.  The experience really comes together in the dark on a good set of headphones.\n\nAs for gameplay, things aren't too deep and there's not alot of actions to perform but they all make sense in the context of this cinematic gaming experience.  You can run, walk, collect/read documents, pick up an item or two, use a flashlight, ride the park's rides and interact with switches/levers and do whatever it takes to progress.  Sometimes time will violently warp between past, present and sheer madness, maintaining an aura of a creeping unknown dogging you until the game's very end.  The story held me in for the long haul and a late game sequence inside of a funhouse gets increasingly hopeless as it progresses.\n\nThough Steam can certainly cough up a few titles disguised as horror that end up being nothing more than incomplete garbage, The Park managed to captivate my attention from the beginning until the very end.  It took me roughly 4 hours to beat the game with all achievements and searching high and low for every single note to read and piece of the story.  Depending on how thorough you are it could take as little as 2 hrs to finish the game in a single sitting.  If anything, the game could have been longer because it really does grab you once you get into it but I got it on discount and was very pleased with my purchase.\n\nPros:\n\n-Entrancing story well told through notes, collectibles, flashbacks and character monologue/dialogue.\n-Excellent setting makes for intense feelings of isolation.\n-Well-designed areas and nicely detailed graphics.\n-Hair-rising sound design.\n-Unfolds like an interactive movie with cool ride sequences.\n-Some truly spooky sequences and set pieces.\n-Fairly open set-up letting you progress somewhat how you want.\n\nCons:\n\n-Pretty short even if you're an achievement hunter.\n-Not alot of challenge.\n-Minimal puzzle solving.\n-Really only incentives to play through once (unless you really liked the story, which I did\n\nOverall:  8/10\n\nDespite the short length and some of The Park's flaws, the story was engrossing and the game was hard to put down once I got started.  It's not a typical horror game and wants to deliver a few righteous blows to the player's psyche before all I said and done.  This probably isn't an adventure for everybody but those that enjoy a twisty plot, pitch black atmosphere and a sense of mystery with their adventuring should really enjoy Funcom's admirable efforts!","April 27","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The story, while somewhat predictable, is decent and the dialogue well-written. Unfortunately, numerous setbacks keep The Park from being something I'd recommend. If you're looking for a horror-type experience, I think you'll find Outlast or even Slender: The Arrival to be better.\n\nMy initial experience with the game was less than positive. It took numerous crashes and several Ctrl+Alt+Dels before I managed to get past the main menu and start the game. As far as the game itself goes, there was definitely some things to like. I thought the right-click to shout for your son was a nice feature. The atmosphere is overall well done, but unfortunately short-lived. The game is easily less than two hours long. If you examine everything you might be able to stretch it out to just over two hours.\n\nThe gameplay itself could have severely benefited from more depth. I understand that this is supposed to be a story and not gameplay driven experience, but the term "walking simulator" absolutely applies here. I would have liked to see some puzzle-solving elements, or even just ability to toggle the flashlight would have added something. Better yet, since this is not a gameplay driven experience, instead offer more areas to explore rather than the linear path the player is forced to follow. As for the fear factor, anybody with any tolerance for horror games will be left unmoved.\n\nThe Park is not terrible, and it definitely makes for a decent experience, but it does not justify it's price of $12.99 at the time of writing. I picked it up on sale for $10.00, and I still feel as though that was too much. I think for a 1.5 hour game such as this, one that has no replay value whatsoever, $5.00 would be a more appropriate price.","October 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","23","47","0","0"

That includes a few minutes to go back and pick up the last 3 achievements that I missed. How is it, you ask? It's okay. It's a creepy setting, there's a few parts that made me flinch a bit. The story is laid out pretty well and the environment tells it alright. But if you haven't figured out the entire plot by the halfway point at the latest, I feel very sorry for you. The "twist" was blatantly obvious to me after the first ride and the details about it became almost painful pretty quickly.\n\nI have never played The Secret World (the game that this game is pretty much created to promote), so I can't say for certain, but I feel like if I had played TSW, I would have found this game much less appealing. Having no knowledge of Atlantic Island Park or its history at least gave me a lot to explore and learn.\n\nI was intrigued by the concept of losing a kid in a creepy, haunted amusement park with waning sanity. Unfortunately, it becomes pretty apparent that your character is entirely unrelatable and unlikable and thus impossible to sympathize with and therefore an immersion breaker. The longer I played, the more I thought that that kid was better off lost in a haunted park than with that awful mother.\n\nThe most jarring part of the game was the first, I guess... "jump scare" or whatever it would be called. And the one that followed was incredibly predictable because of the first and pretty laughable.\n\n6/10\nAtmosphere is good. Story is predictable. Nothing really "scary," just a bit startling occasionally. Obvious Lovecraft inspiration. Notes that should read like a freaked out park goer read more like a badly written H.P. Lovecraft story (maybe on par with one of Lovecraft's childhood stories). Sort, short, short.\n\nIt's worth it for 10 bucks. Maybe the full price of 13 bucks, too. If you want something to do with an hour or two of your life, there's worse and more expensive ways to spend it. Remember, though: this game was pretty much made for the purpose of promoting The Secret World. It's pretty much an advertisement that you pay $10 to experience. I'm satisfied, but I can certainly see a lot of people walking away disatisfied.","October 28, 2015","false","2.9"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","1"

I'm sorry to put it the worst way possible but I went into playing this game with a positive mind due to a blogger saying good things about this. I was so happy to buy it and launch it up today for me to just be dragged out over a short and boring story. The scares that was put into this game was so easy to tell when it was gonna happen. The only thing that was good was the creepiness you only got from going through the park(this does not include the house) but even still you had to run a long way to get somewhere and if there was a story spot or they did this weird motionblur of your character getting scared you where unable to run.

But after playing the entire game and thinking about it, I've decided that I didn't really enjoy my experience. At least not for the price they are asking for.\n\nNow going into it I knew the game was only 1-2 hours in length. That was fine with me, I was willing to give it a shot. Is the $10 ($10.77 CDN) asking price I paid a bit much? Yeah it probably is, but if this game gave me a good scare fair enough. But it didn't. At best in the hour it took me to play the enitre game I was startled maybe 3 times. And that was it, not true terror or fear. A simple jump scare that caused half a second of being startled. It didn't cripple me to a point I had issues advancing further.\n\nDoes the game have anything going for it? Sure. It looks pretty nice. The entre amusement park has a very creepy vibe. Honestly I would have loved to seen this exact map in this game for something bigger. Since it was built to create real fear in it's players. The general atmosphere is great. But they failed to build on it beyond that. It becomes wasted effort in the long wrong. Couple that with the very short length and asking price and I just can't give this a positive rating. Maybe if they cut the price in half it might get a pass but at it's current price it's not worth it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6EmvO76iIEI","October 28, 2015","false","1.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Would have been less if I didn't look in every nook and cranny.\n\nBecame super annoyed at the narrative on multiple occasions, main character came off as pouty and self absorbed.  Narrative literally went from "The warmth of our love" to "HE OWES ME EVERYTHING" within minutes, almost seconds.  Could not become attached or even empathetic.  Mixture of annoyance and irritation caused me not to be very frightened or react properly to jump scares.\n\nGraphical glitches, especially through the mirrors, were distracting.

First time in the scene when your rollercoaster hit the kid in a comical manner.  The second when the antagonist blocked an exit with his body and yelled "GO BACK THE OTHER WAY".  You could make him repeat this forever by just constantly ramming into him.\n\nThe second to last game plot would have been ground breaking if I didn't already experience it in P.T.\n\nAnd to finish it off with an ending I was able to see from a mile away.\n\nThis was a Gone Home clone with some jump scares.

I really liked the atmosphere, and the story, for the most part, was top-notch. The environments were good, if not empty. If you want a spooky walking simulator you could do worse. (but also way better for the money.)\n\nThe biggest failure of this game, unfortunately, is that its not much of a stand-alone game. From what I've read is that a huge amount of content reguarding this games story is in FunCom's MMORPG The Secret World If you haven't played it apparently you miss out on a good chunk of content. This includes the ending of the game where players of the MMORPG are given a definitive answer than those of us who have not. This is a big failure in game design. This could however EASILY be remedied by adding more discoverable content in the game, which I hope will be in a future update.\n\nWhile there are some parts that you can easily omit, for the majority of the game is linear. You will constantly go from one place to another and not find anything, especially towards the middle part of the game. The hope of giving us a typical amusement park with an open world would have been charming, but this game fails to do so. Unfortunately that unlike adding more discoverable content, cannot be added in a later update.\n\nIf Funcom revamps the notes/items to discover in the game in order to give us non-The-Secret-World players more closure, I may change my mind. But as it sits and empty abandoned theme park feels like a playable demo ment to advertise the companies MMORPG or give its fans content more suited for DLC.","October 31, 2015","false","1.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The setting is great and the overall atmosphere is terrific but, as a game with a goal and challenges for the character to face, this fails.  It barely registers as an interactive movie, at best, with controls thrown in to call it a game.  You, as the player have no choices, except which of the non-story pieces you care to interact with (all optional and do nothing), so whatever tension you may feel in the first few introductory scenes quickly abates to questioning why they would intentionally choose to make every possible movement in the game ridiculuously slow.  The overall experience I believe took about an hour to consume and I was being generous with my attentions, excluding the finale, I'm pretty sure, if you discount time for forced cutscenes and mandatory walking, you've got about 20 minutes of actual player-movement based gameplay, which was disappointing.  Also, the finale is so abrupt, without any chance to interact, even if a lie, a button-time event that at least feigned player control of the scene would have made it that much more involved.  As it were, I felt completely disembodied from the character, the scene and generally just watched as the game ended so, so soon after I just started playing.  The game has all the properties to be great but falls short on so many levels and while I believe it was worked on by a team, it feels like a hobbyist project that was rushed to completion.  I did attempt a replay and managed to confirm all my original disappointments while trying to find anything I might have missed, but the "stay on the narrow" path design ensured I didn't miss anything on the first pass, so the second was attrociously boring.","November 1, 2015","false","3.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

No option for text overlay seems to exist, so I'm stuck squinting at tiny newspaper clippings before giving up.

The bigest thing is that it takes about an hour and a half to complete the game. However the ACTUAL game is probably only 30 minutes long.\nThis is because when you go to almost any point of interest in the game, the game takes the controls away from you and goes on auto-pilot to deliver mediocre "scares" and sub par narration. Never before have I played a game that made me put the controller down for so long.\nIt also has a run button that is removed EVERY time that the player character starts narrating(which is a LOT).\nThe game also likes to mess with your screen Amnesia style. Causing pulsating blurs and worping effects when your supposed to be scared. Alls this does is tell me that the game is begging and assuming me to be scared. When in reality it's actually just annoying and forces your character to walk instead of run, slowing the game down even more.\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe game is about as subtle as a sledgehamer to the groin. Right off from the begginng of the game(The Parking Lot) I had guessed the plot of the game.\n[SPOILTER ALERT]\nBy the parking lot I figured the lady was crazy, by the escalator I figured she killed her kid\n[END OF SPOILTER]\n\nAlso there's no clear and present danger to be scared of. I get that is psychological horror, but still that's just stretching the meaning of the word horror. I wasn't scared once during this game. Every jump scare I saw coming, and every possible danger I knew wasn't dangerous because the game took away my controls and went into auto-pilot.\n\nEven the big antagonist I wasn't scared of, I actually would run towards this "threat" instead of away from it. In fact I thought the antagonist was the best part of the game and wished I saw more of it.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nThe game is not scary, it's not fun to play, I even question calling it a game since most of it just auto-pilot.\nThe game is WAY too short for it's price tag 1 1/2 hours maybe 1/2 an hour if you remove auto-pilot and times when you're forced to walk instead of run.\nI suspect that this game is nothing more that an advert for Secret World and for players of Secret World to buy this game to see a piece of their MMO in better graphics and of course for the exclusive items you get from buying The Park.\n\nNeedless to say I do not recommend this game. I have no idea why it has a "Mostly Positive" rating on Steam at the time of this review. I suspect that it's just Secret World fan boys freaking out, but this "game" isn't worth your time or money.","October 31, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Causing pulsating blurs and worping effects when your supposed to be scared. Alls this does is tell me that the game is begging and assuming me to be scared. When in reality it's actually just annoying and forces your character to walk instead of run, slowing the game down even more.\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe game is about as subtle as a sledgehamer to the groin. Right off from the begginng of the game(The Parking Lot) I had guessed the plot of the game.\n[SPOILTER ALERT]\nBy the parking lot I figured the lady was crazy, by the escalator I figured she killed her kid\n[END OF SPOILTER]\n\nAlso there's no clear and present danger to be scared of. I get that is psychological horror, but still that's just stretching the meaning of the word horror. I wasn't scared once during this game. Every jump scare I saw coming, and every possible danger I knew wasn't dangerous because the game took away my controls and went into auto-pilot.\n\nEven the big antagonist I wasn't scared of, I actually would run towards this "threat" instead of away from it. In fact I thought the antagonist was the best part of the game and wished I saw more of it.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nThe game is not scary, it's not fun to play, I even question calling it a game since most of it just auto-pilot.\nThe game is WAY too short for it's price tag 1 1/2 hours maybe 1/2 an hour if you remove auto-pilot and times when you're forced to walk instead of run.\nI suspect that this game is nothing more that an advert for Secret World and for players of Secret World to buy this game to see a piece of their MMO in better graphics and of course for the exclusive items you get from buying The Park.\n\nNeedless to say I do not recommend this game. I have no idea why it has a "Mostly Positive" rating on Steam at the time of this review. I suspect that it's just Secret World fan boys freaking out, but this "game" isn't worth your time or money.","October 31, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

It was not scary.

I was barely even creeped out by the storyline because I had it figured out 10 minutes into playing.\n\nParts of the game just looked like they had been lifted from other titles.  One part was just P.T in a different environment.  It's a shame because the premise of the game had real potential.  I also encountered some real frame drops in places like it was rendering in the map, my machine can run The Witcher 3 on high settings so it is not on my end, at times it really took away from the soliloquies because there would be stuttering mid speech.\nIt said the game was short, but paying £7 for 90 mins is not worth the money in my eyes.\n","November 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

After Dear Esther, this subgenre gained a lot of popularity, but also a lot of criticism that “it’s not a real game” because there’s usually no real danger for the main character or no way to get stuck. Beside the story, another major attribute of this approach is the atmosphere, and it’s exactly what the Funcom studio made the most of with The Park.\n\nLike a large number of horror movies, this adventure starts in a seemingly cheerful manner – playing as Loraine, you took your son Calum to the amusement park. Colorful, cheerful place where you can have a great time? Oh no, no way, because as soon as you step through the park gates, the true menacing face of this place is revealed, wrapped up in darkness and shadows within which nightmares lurk.\n\nThe Park is a game that only had enough ‘strength’ for one run. Not only because of the awkwardly written scenario or the lack of mystery and suspense throughout the run, but also because you’ll get to see everything there is to the game during its short duration. This is another adventure where the player is mostly a passive observer, with not enough interesting ideas that made me want to explore the universe it’s set in.\n\nFull review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/11/the-park/","March 1","false","2.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game is both engagaing and immersive in a way many adventure style games never quite pull off. The sounds of the game are the true gem of the title, with each area of the park pushing ones nervesfurther to the edge with its terrific use of auditory ambience. I often found myself frantically looking around for sources that I never found. It all builds an atmosphere of dread while providing a disturbing kind of soundtrack to the tale unfolding around you. Though short, it's a great game, that remains true to it's source material.\n\nMy honest opinion is that it's totally worth 10/10\n\nAs a side note for those who have played The Secret World:\n\nThe story unfolding in this tale provides depth to one of the most interesting areas on Solomon Island. It will feel familiar and disturbingly alien to those who have ventured into the park before, leaving you with some new questions. The added depth given by the story even provides further insight into discoveries made in the MMO.","May 8","true","1.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I mean it was a great game and my friends thought so too. Just so you know I played the game and streamed it over Steam so my friends could watch me play, now for the game itself it's good and ties in well with The Secret World but as a horror game it seemed a little lacking.\n\nYou have the usual good stuff like the graphical options, field of view and audio sliders. There not perfect but neither are they amazing there just kinda somewhat decent. The game runs smooth as well, didn't have a problem with that on my computer and it looks really nice for what it is. The game also runs well with a controller and keyboard and mouse. The story lore wise is probably the best thing especially if you are a fan of The Secret World, she talks to herself, you can read notes laying around about the history, local speakers speaking out stories etc and just view the awesome recreation of the park. The sound effects are good like her voice is really nice to listen too and the atmosphere sounds just right in every mood. You also get to ride on all the rides there, pretty cool stuff. There aren't much cutscenes, I think there was about 3-4 but there done well, short but well. Now one thing I can say about the horror part of this game is that it really knows how to ♥♥♥♥ with your head.\n\nNow the bad... as much as I liked the game there was a bunch of problems first off it's super easy to walk past important notes or zones, it's just really annoying having to back track when the game is you know a walking adventure game. There wasn't enough "HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THAT GOT ME" moments. The keys are not rebindable, not that I think it matters too much because all you do is walk and click a button to shout. My least favorite part of the game had to be the ending I was expecting more of a WOAH, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥... that actually happened. Even though I got a nice ending that me and my mates could sit there thinking about and somewhat enjoyed but still I wanted more from it... I just didn't get enough. Now not that it bugs me at all but the game is 2 hours long personally I got my moneys worth, though this might be a deal breaker for others.\n\nOverall I think it's a great game for fans of The Secret World but if your thinking of getting this and you really don't know anything about the lore wait for a sale because there's a high chance that you're gonna be disappointed!","October 31, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I really did. But I can't. I feel so ripped off by this it's unbelievable. I feel like I've been tricked into paying for a demo of a full game where I only get to play the first level. I've played this game for three hours and I've already completed it. The atmosphere is very 2d and at no time did I feel threatened or genuinely scared. Jump scares are predictable and there is really nothing to do in this game. Pages and diaries that you can discover allude to deep secrets, both of the environment and the characters, and leads you to believe that you will eventually uncover those secrets and solve the mystery of the park.\n\nYou won't.\n\nYou'll stroll through an empty park, ride a swan, ride an octopus, ride a ferris wheel, have a conversation with Jack Skellington, laugh at a handful of jumpscares (two of which you knew were coming), walk through the same room five or six times and finally be utterly disappointed when you realise that the game has ended when you thought it was just beginning.\n\nIn the interest of not being entirely negative (honest), I will say that the voice acting and the graphics were both very nice, with the voice acting of the main character being escpecially convincing. This, however, doesn't warrant buying this game.\n\nIf this was a full length game with something other than jumpscares, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it, but because of it's boring content and short length, I warn you against buying this game, lest The Park make you it's next victim...","October 29, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Personally that did not bother me (I considered it a plus actually because it allowed me to play through the entire game in one session with my limited time) - I prefer a good (short) experience over something that drags on just for the sake of reaching a certain amount of "game time" while stealing my time.\nThe Park will last about as long as watching a movie so if you consider that "too short" for the price asked then better wait for a (larger) discount but don't hold it against the game - I certainly don't regret spending 10€ on the experience.\n\nI wish the story would have cleared up a bit more because it sort of leaves you wondering about what really happened.\nIt wasn't until I had finished the game that I found out it is somewhat tied in with "The Secret World" which I have never played so I might have missed parts of the story due to that.\nEven though it was short it was still dragging in parts a bit (like the swan ride or some of the scattered text messages) but for the most part it was enjoyable and looked/sounded great.\n\nGame performance was alright (i5-3570k @ 4x4ghz, GTX 670, 16GB ram) - played at 1920x1200 (adaptive sync), "High" settings with 2x MSAA for the most part but switched to "Ultra" in the House of Horrors because the low res mirror reflections offered at "High" were just not nice to look at.\nIt might have dropped to ~30 fps at times but for large parts it felt 60/60 or close enough and when it dropped below that it did not harm the experience much.\nI noticed no bugs/errors in my playthrough.\n\nIf you enjoy games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Dear Esther or Homesick you will probably like The Park.\nHowever I have to admit that I prefer any of these mentioned games because they all left a more lasting impression on me.","November 2, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Personally that did not bother me (I considered it a plus actually because it allowed me to play through the entire game in one session with my limited time) - I prefer a good (short) experience over something that drags on just for the sake of reaching a certain amount of "game time" while stealing my time.\nThe Park will last about as long as watching a movie so if you consider that "too short" for the price asked then better wait for a (larger) discount but don't hold it against the game - I certainly don't regret spending 10€ on the experience.\n\nI wish the story would have cleared up a bit more because it sort of leaves you wondering about what really happened.\nIt wasn't until I had finished the game that I found out it is somewhat tied in with "The Secret World" which I have never played so I might have missed parts of the story due to that.\nEven though it was short it was still dragging in parts a bit (like the swan ride or some of the scattered text messages) but for the most part it was enjoyable and looked/sounded great.\n\nGame performance was alright (i5-3570k @ 4x4ghz, GTX 670, 16GB ram) - played at 1920x1200 (adaptive sync), "High" settings with 2x MSAA for the most part but switched to "Ultra" in the House of Horrors because the low res mirror reflections offered at "High" were just not nice to look at.\nIt might have dropped to ~30 fps at times but for large parts it felt 60/60 or close enough and when it dropped below that it did not harm the experience much.\nI noticed no bugs/errors in my playthrough.\n\nIf you enjoy games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Dear Esther or Homesick you will probably like The Park.\nHowever I have to admit that I prefer any of these mentioned games because they all left a more lasting impression on me.","November 2, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I mean it was a great game and my friends thought so too. Just so you know I played the game and streamed it over Steam so my friends could watch me play, now for the game itself it's good and ties in well with The Secret World but as a horror game it seemed a little lacking.\n\nYou have the usual good stuff like the graphical options, field of view and audio sliders. There not perfect but neither are they amazing there just kinda somewhat decent. The game runs smooth as well, didn't have a problem with that on my computer and it looks really nice for what it is. The game also runs well with a controller and keyboard and mouse. The story lore wise is probably the best thing especially if you are a fan of The Secret World, she talks to herself, you can read notes laying around about the history, local speakers speaking out stories etc and just view the awesome recreation of the park. The sound effects are good like her voice is really nice to listen too and the atmosphere sounds just right in every mood. You also get to ride on all the rides there, pretty cool stuff. There aren't much cutscenes, I think there was about 3-4 but there done well, short but well. Now one thing I can say about the horror part of this game is that it really knows how to ♥♥♥♥ with your head.\n\nNow the bad... as much as I liked the game there was a bunch of problems first off it's super easy to walk past important notes or zones, it's just really annoying having to back track when the game is you know a walking adventure game. There wasn't enough "HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THAT GOT ME" moments. The keys are not rebindable, not that I think it matters too much because all you do is walk and click a button to shout. My least favorite part of the game had to be the ending I was expecting more of a WOAH, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥... that actually happened. Even though I got a nice ending that me and my mates could sit there thinking about and somewhat enjoyed but still I wanted more from it... I just didn't get enough. Now not that it bugs me at all but the game is 2 hours long personally I got my moneys worth, though this might be a deal breaker for others.\n\nOverall I think it's a great game for fans of The Secret World but if your thinking of getting this and you really don't know anything about the lore wait for a sale because there's a high chance that you're gonna be disappointed!","October 31, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I really did. But I can't. I feel so ripped off by this it's unbelievable. I feel like I've been tricked into paying for a demo of a full game where I only get to play the first level. I've played this game for three hours and I've already completed it. The atmosphere is very 2d and at no time did I feel threatened or genuinely scared. Jump scares are predictable and there is really nothing to do in this game. Pages and diaries that you can discover allude to deep secrets, both of the environment and the characters, and leads you to believe that you will eventually uncover those secrets and solve the mystery of the park.\n\nYou won't.\n\nYou'll stroll through an empty park, ride a swan, ride an octopus, ride a ferris wheel, have a conversation with Jack Skellington, laugh at a handful of jumpscares (two of which you knew were coming), walk through the same room five or six times and finally be utterly disappointed when you realise that the game has ended when you thought it was just beginning.\n\nIn the interest of not being entirely negative (honest), I will say that the voice acting and the graphics were both very nice, with the voice acting of the main character being escpecially convincing. This, however, doesn't warrant buying this game.\n\nIf this was a full length game with something other than jumpscares, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it, but because of it's boring content and short length, I warn you against buying this game, lest The Park make you it's next victim...","October 29, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Damn that woman moves slowly.\n\nIf you play The Secret World, this is a little interesting for flavor. Whether it's $13 interesting is another question. Having already been through the park, it was strange to see things out of place.  There were 2 good scares, and a couple cool creepy moments, but I've been far more scared by some storylines in TSW.\n\n+1, however, for including the "Press X to Jason" mechanic.","October 29, 2015","false","2.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is easily one of the worst horror games I've ever played. I wasn't expecting much going into it, but it dissapointed. Throwing every cliche at you that it can.\n\nIt was all a dream ending [Check]\nRandomly using gore in place of scares [Check]\nBlatantly Dangerous Place None of the Main Characters can tell is dangerous [Check]\nBig Lipped Alligator Moments Adding Nothing To The Plot [Check]\nRandom Creepy Messages For The Sake Of Random Creepy Messages [Check]\nVillains ripped off from other things [Check] (Specifically Purple Guy from FNAF and The Babadook from Babadook)\n\nOb, but there's MORE! THERE'S SO MUCH MORE!\n\nThe grahpics suck and are early Xbox 360/PS3 era, yet due to the poor optimization of this my Gaming Rig (which although needs a new graphics card by my own confession) ran this incredibly laggily until I turned the graphics as low as they would go.  Even then it ran alright, but still felt like it was going to crash anytime I picked up a note or it changed maps... it never did but I swore it was going to.\n\nBecause the story insists on using three villains for a very basic plot it comes off as trying to throw too many things at you at once... Is it about a neglectful mother? Is it about a serial killer in a child mascot costume who kidnaps kids and is obsessed with machinery? (Seriously Funtom!?!?! PURPLE GUY), or was it a demonic entiity clearly ripped off of "The Babadook" behind some poorly defined curse? Well... too bad the game doesn't seem to know itself. Because it's just going to throw random things at you hoping something sticks... half way through it gives up and just starts showing blood for no real reason.\n\nThere's notes everywhere, but it seems the protagonist holds them as far as she can from her face and they're written in small text. So I had to actually lean really close to the monitor to read them. All of them pretty much said the same things "People die here a lot, and yet somehow the protagonist is dumb enough to continue taking her son here... or not considering it turns out to be just a dream."\n\nI'll give it credit for not using any jumpscares. But that's the nicest thing I can say about it.\n\nBasically, it's a generic creepy that someone threw money behind. If you play Secret World, you get some items for that game which include the Springtrap... I mean Chad The Chipmunk costume, so it's good for that.\n\nStay away, watch someone's let's play of it if you're really curious. Unless you really want the Secret World items, I don't reccomend spending a dime on this.","January 16","false","1.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

No added 'fluff', no additional grindy parts.  In my opinion, it wasn't longer because it didn't *need* to be longer.\n\nNo spoilers, but The Park takes us to some very dark corners of the human psyche, insanity, motherhood - all while in a place that is doing... well, precisely what it was intended to do.  Weaving in the story of the Atlantic Island Park's history alongside the story of a mother looking for her son is no mean feat, but I thought Joel Bylos & Company handled it very well.\n\nThe Park doesn't throw tons of gore at you and scream "BE AFRAID DAMN YOU!  BE AFRAID!!!"  Instead it relies on clues, hints and 'lore' to paint a picture of what's going on - and a rather grisly picture indeed, if you think about it.

No added 'fluff', no additional grindy parts.  In my opinion, it wasn't longer because it didn't *need* to be longer.\n\nNo spoilers, but The Park takes us to some very dark corners of the human psyche, insanity, motherhood - all while in a place that is doing... well, precisely what it was intended to do.  Weaving in the story of the Atlantic Island Park's history alongside the story of a mother looking for her son is no mean feat, but I thought Joel Bylos & Company handled it very well.\n\nThe Park doesn't throw tons of gore at you and scream "BE AFRAID DAMN YOU!  BE AFRAID!!!"  Instead it relies on clues, hints and 'lore' to paint a picture of what's going on - and a rather grisly picture indeed, if you think about it.  There are a few jump-scares, but I thought they were sparsely-used and effective.\n\nAnd the roller coaster.  Oh.  My.  God.  The roller coaster.\n\nThe nods toward TSW were awesome.  'Nuff said.\n\nSome of the notes were a little hard to read - I had to lean forward more than once... but I only consider that a minor quibble.  Subtitles would be nice for Lorraine's voice-overs though.\n\nDo I recommend this game?  Yes.  Even if you haven't played TSW, The Park is an enjoyable (albeit very dark) romp.","October 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Gave them my money as fast as I could.\n\nThe game itself is fine. I liked exploring the park. I liked walking around and reading the clues. It got very intense towards the end. I enjoyed the atmosphere. I found the voice acting to be pretty fantanastic at time and felt imense pity for the mother trying to find her kid. The game gets a lot of things right is what I'm trying to say.\n\nProblem: The payoff is kinda weak.\n\nThe game is way too open ended. Normally I could forgive that but.... everything about it is open ended. You can't have a open ended story without some kind of facts or grounding. There are too many explainations for what happened, and the evidence for each possibility is kinda weak. I feel like it's a better story if you don't play The Secret World because it eliminates some of these options.\n\nIt feels less like a coherant story, and more like a English major's wet dream.... which considering one line the character drops it kind of is.","November 9, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's tense, atmospheric, and well-written. I was engrossed. Definitely a "set the atmosphere" kind of night. Turn off the lights, stick on your headphones, and get lost in the story. It's been a while since a game left me completely unnerved with a deep sense of dread.\n\nThere seem to be some misconceptions about what The Park is. You do not have to have played The Secret World. While there are nods here and there and a shared universe, The Park is a standalone experience. There's a lot to appreciate here as a TSW fan, but it's mostly in the way of "this is already thematically something you enjoy".\n\nThis is also a game in the loosest sense. It's a narrative experience, an interactive short story. The price-point is appropriate for what you are getting. I pay the same for a movie, and it shares a similar length. There's no combat, no puzzles, and limited interactivity.\n\nIf you enjoy a quiet kind of horror that crawls under your skin and leaves you dreading what's behind the door... not because it could kill you... but because the idea of it is so much worse than any reality, because the thought of opening that door and seeing that living room again makes you hold your breath...

It's tense, atmospheric, and well-written. I was engrossed. Definitely a "set the atmosphere" kind of night. Turn off the lights, stick on your headphones, and get lost in the story. It's been a while since a game left me completely unnerved with a deep sense of dread.\n\nThere seem to be some misconceptions about what The Park is. You do not have to have played The Secret World. While there are nods here and there and a shared universe, The Park is a standalone experience. There's a lot to appreciate here as a TSW fan, but it's mostly in the way of "this is already thematically something you enjoy".\n\nThis is also a game in the loosest sense. It's a narrative experience, an interactive short story. The price-point is appropriate for what you are getting. I pay the same for a movie, and it shares a similar length. There's no combat, no puzzles, and limited interactivity.\n\nIf you enjoy a quiet kind of horror that crawls under your skin and leaves you dreading what's behind the door... not because it could kill you... but because the idea of it is so much worse than any reality, because the thought of opening that door and seeing that living room again makes you hold your breath... The Park is for you. I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend my post-Halloween horror wind down.\n\n","November 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I want to like The Secret World more than I do. I love the writing, I just hate the things I have to do to get to the story.... also the game has so many monsters it's a little immersion breaking.\n\nSo, as soon as I got wind that they made a single player horror game set in the same setting? Gave them my money as fast as I could.\n\nThe game itself is fine. I liked exploring the park. I liked walking around and reading the clues. It got very intense towards the end. I enjoyed the atmosphere. I found the voice acting to be pretty fantanastic at time and felt imense pity for the mother trying to find her kid. The game gets a lot of things right is what I'm trying to say.\n\nProblem: The payoff is kinda weak.\n\nThe game is way too open ended. Normally I could forgive that but.... everything about it is open ended. You can't have a open ended story without some kind of facts or grounding. There are too many explainations for what happened, and the evidence for each possibility is kinda weak. I feel like it's a better story if you don't play The Secret World because it eliminates some of these options.\n\nIt feels less like a coherant story, and more like a English major's wet dream.... which considering one line the character drops it kind of is.","November 9, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In a silent hill-esque manner your life story is unraveled bit by bit as you proceed through "The Park" in a not too subtle manner. I appreciate the story focus, the atmosphere succeeded in leaving a lingering dread and the sound design was alright.\n\nWith just an hours worth of playtime I can't exactly say I feel like the overall game was enough to make me appreciate the somewhat clichéd story. The psychological effects were pretty subtle yet nicely disturbing at first but more or less became predictable later on as the game tries to throw spookiness at you left and right up to a, in my opinion, an unsatisfying climax.\n\n","January 12","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I use the term "game" lightly as it is really more of a walking simulator with some clicking.  You play a mother trying to find her son who seems to be lost in an amusment park, but it quickly changes in to something much more sinister.  There isn't much to actually do as you play through the game beyond reading notes and hints about what happened in the park.  There are a few jump scare moments, but what is really scary is the story and what it implies above and beyond the actual "gotcha" moments.\n\nAlthough the game provides a great atmosphere and story if you are looking for more gameplay then I wouldn't recommend The Park.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/real_nightmare/recommended/402020/","real_nightmare","Nightmare!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/real_nightmare/","110 products in account","A profoundly surprising and openly ambiguous game that clutches at the darker, more fundamental pillars of our most primal fears.  Humans are never quite so afraid as when an offspring is lost or in peril and The Park is an excellent analysis of the impact that such loss can cause on a psyche.  Set in The Secret World universe, The Park is richly voiced, well-written and possessed of lavish, creepy atmosphere, with truly dreadful imagery that bespeaks of unsettling evil that festers in the darkest corners of both our physical world and darkest recesses of our minds.  The game is absolutely gorgeous and Unreal Engine 4 is used to great effect.\n\nEverything from the hallucinatory episodes, to the imposing power of the ferris wheel, to the strangling darkness of the roller coaster all present a horrible playground of suffering and darker passions.  The game is very short, averaging about 2 hours with careful exploration and, yes, the ending isn't conclusive or definitive.  The game forces you to be mature, adaptable and careful with your analysis of concepts and events.  The story must be carefully pieced together from logs, article clippings and journal snippets that you discover in your examination of the park grounds but thorough players will soon crack the nut of The Park's labyrinthine ending.\n\nThe game isn't scary, per se, but it does induce dread and it definitely has occasional jump scares, like those near the Octatron, and in the midway.  What The Park does offer, is a clever, expansive world, more atmosphere than most games  can ever hope to have in campaigns that are ten times as long, and a gorgeous aesthetic that is sure to please discerning gamers.  The Park is an art piece advertising a game with far more inspiration/content but, sadly, far less style.  Pick The Park up on a Steam sale, turn the lights off, dial up the volume and enjoy the experience.\n\nIn The Park, the ride may be short but it's certainly bittersweet.\n\nRecommended:\n\n8/10.","October 30, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game feels like its good. It's well narrated, plot ain't that bad (you see most of it coming when half the game is over, and trust me, that is really soon!) and it's very well designed visually.\n\nBesides, for those of you who've played Funcom's The Secret World, it might give you some interesting side-views on it's universe.\n\nThat said, the game is definitely NOT worth it's cost. I would recommend the purchase if the game cost arround half what it costs now.\n\nSo yeah, the overall experience is great.\n\nJust not worth the price.","November 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The rest of the text youhave to read on forms or on books or signs are clear. This means LOTS of the backstory is lost.\nI got pretty sick of calling for Callum over and over. If I ever meet someone named Callum I'm going to punch him in the jejunum.\nI really hated the main character. She's a horrible person and shouldn't have kids. I wanted the kid to run away and find a new mother.\n\nIt's a solid scare but in a game where there's ZERO action, story is key.

It is set in Atlantic park on Soloman Island.\n\nThe game over all was not too scary, it definitly set a nice mood though out it all and I did like a lot of what it was doing over all with the character and how it all tied together. Is the game a masterpeice? No, far from it. But the game does have a nice plot to it with a decent mystery going on for it.\n\nAs for the bad parts about it, the game is short. I am not going to lie. It takes two hours or less to finish the game, but the Devs have that mentioned in the main part of the store so it isn't too big of an issue. And secondly, there isn't anything trying to kill you in the game. Nothing can hurt you and as far as I can tell though out the entire thing, nothing can kill you in the game. One other complaint which was mentioned a few times by others, the handwriten notes are too hard to read.\n\n\nBut, as I said, I am recomending it as a nice little continuation of the TSW world as well as the plot though it all and how it is told has been simply wonderful. so in that if I had to rate it, I would say 8/10 over all.","November 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/real_nightmare/recommended/402020/","real_nightmare","Nightmare!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/real_nightmare/","110 products in account","A profoundly surprising and openly ambiguous game that clutches at the darker, more fundamental pillars of our most primal fears.  Humans are never quite so afraid as when an offspring is lost or in peril and The Park is an excellent analysis of the impact that such loss can cause on a psyche.  Set in The Secret World universe, The Park is richly voiced, well-written and possessed of lavish, creepy atmosphere, with truly dreadful imagery that bespeaks of unsettling evil that festers in the darkest corners of both our physical world and darkest recesses of our minds.  The game is absolutely gorgeous and Unreal Engine 4 is used to great effect.\n\nEverything from the hallucinatory episodes, to the imposing power of the ferris wheel, to the strangling darkness of the roller coaster all present a horrible playground of suffering and darker passions.  The game is very short, averaging about 2 hours with careful exploration and, yes, the ending isn't conclusive or definitive.  The game forces you to be mature, adaptable and careful with your analysis of concepts and events.  The story must be carefully pieced together from logs, article clippings and journal snippets that you discover in your examination of the park grounds but thorough players will soon crack the nut of The Park's labyrinthine ending.\n\nThe game isn't scary, per se, but it does induce dread and it definitely has occasional jump scares, like those near the Octatron, and in the midway.  What The Park does offer, is a clever, expansive world, more atmosphere than most games  can ever hope to have in campaigns that are ten times as long, and a gorgeous aesthetic that is sure to please discerning gamers.  The Park is an art piece advertising a game with far more inspiration/content but, sadly, far less style.  Pick The Park up on a Steam sale, turn the lights off, dial up the volume and enjoy the experience.\n\nIn The Park, the ride may be short but it's certainly bittersweet.\n\nRecommended:\n\n8/10.","October 30, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While overall the game had superb atmosphere, the pacing seemed to be a bit off, and there just wasn't enough story-telling to make it worth the money I spent, even on sale. There were a few jump scares that worked but most of it was cheap and mostly came at the end of the game. The over-saturation of jump scares right at the end took away some of the creepiness. I want to like the game more but it just didn't have the legs to last, the content was overall light and unfortunately didn't allow for much in the way of character development. The only true scary character in the game, which I wanted to learn more about was Chad, and he only makes a few brief appearances. This game had all the right pieces to the puzzle, it was just assembled in a haphazzard way, that didn't really work.

While overall the game had superb atmosphere, the pacing seemed to be a bit off, and there just wasn't enough story-telling to make it worth the money I spent, even on sale. There were a few jump scares that worked but most of it was cheap and mostly came at the end of the game. The over-saturation of jump scares right at the end took away some of the creepiness. I want to like the game more but it just didn't have the legs to last, the content was overall light and unfortunately didn't allow for much in the way of character development. The only true scary character in the game, which I wanted to learn more about was Chad, and he only makes a few brief appearances. This game had all the right pieces to the puzzle, it was just assembled in a haphazzard way, that didn't really work.

I think i missed a couple of the notes, so I might've missed some pieces, but overall it's a very very short game with a kinda boring/cliche/annoying storyline (as someone with a mental illness who is kinda sick of them being used as horror tropes tbh).\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed the first half or so/before the big finale 'witch' trope was introduced. I thought the rides themselves and the clever use of the strange creature on those rides was really spooky and neat, especially with the octoride and the rollercoaster, and I really enjoyed the usage of the mystery aspect and kinda piecing together the story yourself. It's just the story introduced at first was a lot more intriguing than the mother/son story overall, and once it got to the 'big finale' I found myself really not enjoying the game at all.\n\nOverall, not recommended to buy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delcat177/recommended/402020/","Delcat177","Trash King Del","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delcat177/","126 products in account","I really wanted to like this game.  It came so close.  But at the end, it's tepid at best, and it definitely left me with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI enjoy experience games and walking simulators, and I enjoy short games.  The play time felt just right to me, and there weren't any bugs or lag.  I liked the atmosphere, I liked the idea, I liked the environments.  There are some solid moments in here, including one of the best-executed scares I've seen in a while--the swan head moment is perfection in subtlety, unreality, and understated terror.\n\nUnfortunately, that happens within the first twenty minutes of the game, and it's all downhill from there.\n\nFrom the beginning of the game I was already going "Sorry about your definitely dead son that you very definitely killed by the way you're in a mental institution none of this is really happening".  Seriously, from the opening lines.  It's not at all subtle.  With obvious dark magic tomfoolery gadding about, I was hoping that one of the other plotlines alluded to would go somewhere, but they devolved into cliches.  Actually, the entire game devolved into cliches.  The first few scares are inexplicable and intriguing, but they have explanations slapped onto them fast and hard.  WHAT'S BEHIND THE MYSTERIOUS MASCOT?  Some college kid who was driven to yawn-worthy slaughter by eldritch abominations.  WHAT WAS THAT THING GLIMPSED FROM THE OCTOTRON?  Literally the Babadook, also eldritch abominations.  WHAT IS THE SECRET OF THE PARK?  Blahblahblah eldritch abominations, you get to a point where you look away in secondhand embarrassment every time they "cleverly" put in a glaring Lovecraft reference, culminating in the maximum cringe of WARRIOR CTHULHU t-shirt on the damned dead kid at the end.  By the end of the game, there are literally bleeding walls, "scary" children's drawings, "eerie" nursery songs, dismembered baby dolls, the "throw a dart at the Horror section of Netflix" works.  Nothing we haven't seen before a zillion times, unless you count the so very dead kid drawing and labeling a carrot on an otherwise unrelated message JUST SO THEY COULD GET "ROT" OUT OF IT.  That is admittedly some new levels of ham-fisted.\n\nIf it had been just cliches, I could have left the game a little disappointed but remembering it fondly.  But the obvious reveal of the primary antagonist to be the mother herself made me distinctly uncomfortable for a number of reasons.  Spoilers abound, so:\n\nLook, I'm not saying there's no such thing as bad mothers, or abusive mothers.  Far from it.  I think another game (the title of which I will not reveal as it's a spoiler for it) handled the idea quite well, making the mother the antagonist but a character you could understand and sympathize with while still disliking.  Lorraine, on the other hand, is a mess of a character.  Are we supposed to sympathize with her, hate her, what?  The game offers a little room for us to sympathize, but then seems to demand it back, leaving us in the uncomfortable position of being expected to hate a single mother on welfare battling serious depression.  Seriously, that is what we're intended to vilify here.  Someone in an absolutely awful situation doing the best she can.  Because...oh no!  She takes PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION!  For a condition that we see point-blank causes her to have terrible psychotic episodes!  What a terrible mother you are, Lorraine.\n\nAnd then it's also eldritch abominations or something.  Of course.  Game, do you even KNOW what you want?  Other than people to buy The Secret World?\n\nSo, yeah.  Gameplay?  Fine.  Length?  Fine.  Atmosphere?  Awesome.  Idea?  Great.  Execution?  Pretty nice.  Predictable plot falling apart into so many unused threads you could make spaghetti out of them with eye-rolling cliches as the sauce?  Dealbreaker.\n\nGive this one a pass, you have other places to lay out your cash.","January 24","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Along the way you learn about the park and the main character, who each have pretty interesting stories. Overall the game is pretty well made, but as a standalone game I think it's somewhat hard to justify paying $10 for it. The real interest in the game comes from its relation to the The Secret World MMO from the same developer, which builds more on the lore of the park and its characters.

The story is nicely build up, but unfortunately didn't grab me like the brilliant one in Gone Home. Don't expect any puzzles on your way, but personally I believe a game like this don't need them. The last section of the game is the better part of The Park, although the ending is a bit of a let down, in my opinion.\n\nThe graphics are good. I'm forced to play the game on low detail settings and a 1366x768 resolution on my laptop (with an AMD A10-5750M APU), but it still looks acceptable that way. Only some letters in the game are a bit hard to read. The music and sound effects are nice and really fit the situations you encounter (headphones are highly recommended). I also like the voice acting.\n\nAs you may have already read The Park is short. With 1.5 to 2 hours it's actually very short for a game.

I used to work for a certain media giant and its theme parks and exploring the abandoned and left to rot secrets there were some of the most thrilling experiences I’ve had in my life. So when I started seeing The Park in my recommended titles I knew it was for me. A horror walking simulator in an abandoned theme park? Sounds awesome. I have never played or even heard of The Secret World prior to playing this.\n\nThe Park creates an awesome atmosphere through great graphics and narrative story telling. The narration is well voice acted and the monologue does well progressing the story. Each ride felt pretty real and I loved that they weren’t cut scenes and that you had full control of the camera on each ride. The climax of the game was super creepy and really tense. The way the notes are scattered and written is great too. If you take the time to read them you’ll have some idea what’s going on. If you don’t read any of them you’ll have no idea what’s happening. I like that in this type of game. It provides incentive. At the end of the game I was really enjoying myself. I was creeped out and trying to piece together what exactly was going on. Then, sadly, they completely ruined the atmosphere that they had set up and ended the game with a third person cut scene. They give you full control over your character for the entire game and then take it away from you for the ending. I have no idea why someone thought that was a good idea. Yes the game is short, but it isn’t a full retail priced game and the atmosphere is great. Gamers need to stop being brats and expecting 50 hour games for $10. I was definitely willing to purchase additional content for the game, to get more of a picture of what was going on and I was sort of hoping that there would be additional content to do that, but after the ending I’m hesitant and kind of turned off to the story. I enjoyed the game, it’s a good buy for $10 especially since I played through most of it on Halloween but the ending leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI’ll probably play through one more time to really soak in the atmosphere and get the achievements that I missed but I probably won’t touch it again otherwise. Other horror games like this have been known to follow up with free updates with additional content or maybe even a reasonably priced expansion. Those might get me to come back for another couple of hours but otherwise this is a 10ish dollar one time play through experience. Get it for $10 instead of renting an HD horror movie. Sort of recommend.","November 1, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Even if I knew how short it would be before buying it I still would of because there are a fair few games with the same general concept of walk around, investigate stuff and some jumpscares that cost $30+. $10 to me is a large big mac meal so if it means I ate less junkfood to buy this game then it's worth it :P","October 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I used to work for a certain media giant and its theme parks and exploring the abandoned and left to rot secrets there were some of the most thrilling experiences I’ve had in my life. So when I started seeing The Park in my recommended titles I knew it was for me. A horror walking simulator in an abandoned theme park? Sounds awesome. I have never played or even heard of The Secret World prior to playing this.\n\nThe Park creates an awesome atmosphere through great graphics and narrative story telling. The narration is well voice acted and the monologue does well progressing the story. Each ride felt pretty real and I loved that they weren’t cut scenes and that you had full control of the camera on each ride. The climax of the game was super creepy and really tense. The way the notes are scattered and written is great too. If you take the time to read them you’ll have some idea what’s going on. If you don’t read any of them you’ll have no idea what’s happening. I like that in this type of game. It provides incentive. At the end of the game I was really enjoying myself. I was creeped out and trying to piece together what exactly was going on. Then, sadly, they completely ruined the atmosphere that they had set up and ended the game with a third person cut scene. They give you full control over your character for the entire game and then take it away from you for the ending. I have no idea why someone thought that was a good idea. Yes the game is short, but it isn’t a full retail priced game and the atmosphere is great. Gamers need to stop being brats and expecting 50 hour games for $10. I was definitely willing to purchase additional content for the game, to get more of a picture of what was going on and I was sort of hoping that there would be additional content to do that, but after the ending I’m hesitant and kind of turned off to the story. I enjoyed the game, it’s a good buy for $10 especially since I played through most of it on Halloween but the ending leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI’ll probably play through one more time to really soak in the atmosphere and get the achievements that I missed but I probably won’t touch it again otherwise. Other horror games like this have been known to follow up with free updates with additional content or maybe even a reasonably priced expansion. Those might get me to come back for another couple of hours but otherwise this is a 10ish dollar one time play through experience. Get it for $10 instead of renting an HD horror movie. Sort of recommend.","November 1, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't know whether or not to recommend it, or support people to avoid wasting their money. I'm very conflicted here, but based on the experience, I'd have to not recommend it, my pros and cons will speak for themselves.\n\nPros\n-It's nice to see a horror game take place in an amusement park. I honestly can't remember the last time this setting was used in any horror game. A real shame really, considering the amount of scare opportunities a horror park can have.\n\n-The size is astounding. Seriously, the whole game is huge. I mean, it does take place in an amusement park after all.\n\n-It doesn't rely too heavily on jumpscares. While I am aware that jumpscares are a part of horror, it doesn't focus solely on them. Most of the scares require the player to actually notice them. It also focuses a lot on psychological horror rather than just an enemy chasing you or the boogeyman jumping out at you. It genuinely freaked me out with the atmosphere.\n\n-The monsters and scares are creative. The scares can range from a simple man in a chipmunk suit appearing out of nowhere, to the rides actually attacking you. No, I'm not joking.\n\n\nCons\n\n-The quality and rendering is awful. Now I'm not sure if it's just my computer itself, but in order to actually play the game without my frame rate and video quality going nuts, I had to lower all my settings. Like, A LOT. Either the default settings are trash, or my computer needs some work (which is unlikely considering the computer I have). The rendering is also atrocious. The game literally renders in grass when it's a foot or so in front of you. The entire ground ahead of you is bare, but around your feet is nothing but grass and rocks. The rendering also affects the structures and makes them look awful from a distance.\n\n-It's short. Seriously, it's really short. I beat the game in an hour or so, and that was with me just messing around and accidentally riding the same ride twice. Not only that, but I even managed to get all the achievements within that hour time span.\n\n-The pricing is a rip off. Thank the lord I managed to get this thing on sale, and even then it was too high priced. Why is an hour long game worth around $14? Seriously? Considering the video quality and how short it is, it shouldn't be worth $14.\n\n-Let's not forget the filler. I'm starting to think this game put in so many dragged out scenes in order for the player to feel like the game was longer and there was actual progress being made. The intro has an escalator transition that probably lasts around a minute, the swan ride in the beginning of the game is probably around ten minutes long, all of the other rides are several minutes long as well with some inner monologue forced in to make it feel like something is happening, when it really isn't. It lacks so much action and builds up tension when nothing really ever happens. It only gets interesting near the end of the game, and even then the setting is the same thing over and over with a few minor changes each time. The worst part is a supposed "story" is forced into the game that makes almost no sense in order to make it seem like the game is more interesting than it really is. Shameful really, as it barely makes any sense and was probably left vague in order to make it seem like there was a deeper meaning.\n\nIt's really hard to pinpoint how I feel. I think I would have less of a hatred towards this game if it wasn't for the fact that I spent $9 on it. If the price was lower, then I would probably recommend it. I guess it's up to you as to whether not you'll buy this game. Thanks for reading, bye!","December 9, 2015","false","6.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Funcom's style  of horror is great.  It isn't all about the jump scares or cheap thrills.  I normally don't tend to go for horror games, but this game works well.  It was downright creepy.  Especially with Funcom's good usage of sound.  It all adds up to keep you imersed and looking over your shoulder throughout.  I played with surround sound headphones, and that is totally the way to go for the best experience.\n\nAs long as you go into this game knowing what it is and what it is not, you should enjoy it. It is short, but that fits for the story that is being told.  A longer game wouldn't have been as good in this case.  You play this game for the horror story.  It is not a big sprawling actiong fps horror with combat and deaths around every corner, so if that is the style of game you tend to enjoy, this may not be the best choice for you.","October 29, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's one of the few horror games that doesn't use an overpowered enemy to make you scared but that uses a psychological "enemy" with the sounds, the jumpscares and the story itself.\nThe only bad thing is that it takes around 40/50min to finish if you dont care about the achievements and if you do it'll take you about 1/1h30 to complete. If the game was a bit more "deep" showing her life before and then showing this "trip" through the Park it would surely be among the best games of the year.\nI'm excited to see what else is going to be made by this company.\n\n8/10 -Great Job!","October 31, 2015","true","4.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

As has been well need pointed out - the game is a brief one and not particular on player agency. The tale on Lorraine and her missing son, Callum, is what is front and center here. Thankfully the story, while not immensely surprsing, is very well told. The use of the tale of Hansel and Gretel as a metaphor to the events in the game is a nice touch that is impressively woven into the imagery of the game.\n\nWhat little interactivty the game offers comes in the form of Lorraine's voice. By right clicking Lorraine calls out to Callum. This call and response mechanic not only reveals objects to be examined and functions as a guide to the next location, but also gives a window into Lorraine's mental state. The voice acting in this game deserves special mention. What is on offer is very well done.\n\nThe Park doesn't offer much. The experience can be had in roughly an hour and there isn't much reason to play again other collecting the two missable achievements or a desire to catch any symbolism that may have been missed the first time around. In honesty, there isn't even much to "play" in the traditional sense. This is an interactive tale the user moves forward - not much more, not much less. That said, The Park is a worthwhile bit of interactive horror and well worth a spin for players looking for something a bit more experimental.\n\nWith any luck Funcom churns out more game connected to The Secret World, expermental narrative jaunts like The Park, as well as perhaps some more traditional single player experiences.","October 31, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/recommended/402020/","katosepe","Katosepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/","603 products in account","The Park is an interesting game that's very difficult to nail down. I will give it a recommend because I did enjoy my experience with the game but it comes with the caveat that not everyone will enjoy this game. In fact, I would guess most people will not enjoy this game but for those who can appreciate it, it is an interesting dive into the mind of a mother, torn between societal expectations and her own experiences.\n\nThe trailers show The Park as being a horror game but in reality, it's closer to a game like Dear Esther or Gone Home than something like The Evil Within or Five Nights at Freddys. This is because, there really isn't any danger in The Park. You cannot die or lose or anything throughout the game. For me, this realization took away most of the tension I was feeling. There are some creepy jump scares, sure, but I was never concerned by what I was seeing as, for most of the game, there was nothing I could do about it anyway.\n\nBecause of this, players are more likely to enjoy the story rather than any sense of accomplishment for braving the unknown. The storyline is split between two major mysteries. Not to spoil anything, as you venture throughout the titular park, you learn about the history of the park itself and the history of the player character, a mother chasing after her son throughout his favorite amusement park that clearly has seen better days.\n\nWandering around, you ride the various rides in the park which set you up in on-rails scenes which result in something creepy happening or more backstory from the mother. This is really where the game falters a bit. You learn very quickly that backstory will come about by walking to the next ride and riding it. It becomes very formulaic so that you can expect when things will happen. As such, the journey to each ride becomes a bit tedious, further eliminating the atmosphere that the game is trying to generate.\n\nThis next bit may contain very minor spoilers but really just my reaction to the conclusion without any details. If that's too much spoiler for you, you have been warned:\n\nSo players will be playing this for the story but the story itself, is hit or miss. Well, really, hit and miss. The mother's story with her son is interesting and comes to a solid, if not predictable, conclusion. The story of the park itself, though, is much more open-ended and not in a good way. You are given bits and pieces of story about the park throughout the game but it never seems to really go anywhere. At least, I didn't find anything in my playthrough that wrapped it up. I found this rather disappointing.\n\nUltimately, if you enjoy games like Dear Esther or Gone Home and would like something in that vein with a bit of a horror vibe to it, The Park will do. It may not be the most memorable or revolutionary entry in the burgeoning genre, but it's worth a playthrough. If that doesn't sound interesting or if you're on a budget and want some bang for your buck, The Park isn't the game for you.\n\nMy Experience: Before reviewing this game, I completed the game once, missing a couple achievements in the process. I don't plan on going back for them any time soon.","November 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Like all horror games, it's best played when you've never seen anything about the game. For this reason there is very little replayability.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/402020/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","Very cool. Well done. Many games claim to be "atmospheric" and only a few truly achieve the claim. Most of the creepiness of the game comes from your own mind. Its what you dont see that is always more creepy than what you do see. Perfect example, at one point in the path through the park a shadow from a fern looks like a hand. Just as youre walking by it moves in the breeze bringing it in front of the light, making it look like a hand just reaches out a little from the dark into the light.\n\nNow, Im sure that happens a lot in these types of games. But without properly setting the atmosphere, no one is in the right state of mind to even notice or care. I wont get into any of the story either. Firstly because I only fired it up fast to see how it looked, ran, etc. (Of course I stayed 40 mins into it). Secondly, what I know about the story so far is only enough to spark my own curiousity...and set it down the path to the creepy and unknown. Better yet, a story line that I dont want to know but one that I am inadvertanly going to have to live through.\n\nThe writers and designers really did a great job in coming together. As someone who has spent half my career writing everything from basic hard news to a vast array of fiction, the medium of video games has been a place where the finished product is either great, or terrible. Or worse yet, it's totally mediocre and goes by unnoticed. But this very eaily couldve bee ruined with the slightest miscalculation. The cutting of one corner couldve damned this into mediocrity. I hope everyone who contributed to this project gives themselves credit for getting everything just right.\n\nPrice: $10 or less is really where this needs to be. I just picked it up in the final minutes of the sale. Since the product description says its about a 1-2 hour game I instantly compare that to the price of a movie. Dont get me wrong, in Unreal4 it looks like it should be $29.99. Had they been less transparent theyve couldve charged $30 and received all negative reviews. So I believe they also know the true value and respect the players' wallets.\n\nSo its all good all the way around. I would complain of no Crossfire support but it runs smooth for me on a single card at 70-80 fps on a single 290x Lightning. (If you have any other 290x expect to get about 50-65 fps maxed out settings)\n\n-DMS","November 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Without being a dedicated TSW fan, key moments of the story are incomplete.\n\nThat being said, the game is gorgeous, fascinating, and very different. It is a two-hour interactive story that fleshes out the horrors of The Secret World from the perspective of a "normal" person, as opposed to all the Agents and Insiders we see in the main MMO.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. The pacing is awkward at times, and the story teeters precariously between "Awesomely mysterious" and "Frustratingly Vague".\n\nThat being said, I do not regret my purchase, as this was a hauntingly beautiful and macabre story of desperation and human frailty unlike any other game I've played.\n\nRecommended.","November 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a good concept. It's different, unusual, out there.\n\nI played 56 minutes in total before requesting a refund.\n\nBut that's all it is. A good "concept". I requested a refund for this game because of the reasons below.\n\n\nThe way the story is written is very unrealistic. Let me explain below:\n\nThe start of the game finds you as Callum's mother, in the car park of the theme park, and he has left his teddybear in the park. The park has closed and the gates are locked, so you go to check at the ticket office to see if it's been handed in to lost property.\n\nFine. No issues there.\n\nNext, the member of staff you are talking to says that Callum has just gone back inside the park. The gates are locked, and you can't get in, so how the hell can he? The ticket office man says he will unlock the gates and allow you back in to go and get him.\n\nHow can Callum get inside the park if the gates are locked? That's the first major flaw.\n\nHe could have been kidnapped by "something", or ventured through a hole in the fence, but he goes through the locked gates.\n\n\nI tried to overlook that, and carried on playing. Next, you have to go up some escalators.\nAs you ascend, everything goes dark and the game "fades out". Suddenly you are back, and it's dark, and the park is in disarray. Broken lights, overgrown, untidy etc.\n\nThere's no explanation why this happens, and the character you're playing doesn't react to it, it's as if it's a normal event and supposed to happen. It doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n\nAnother point is that you can ride all of the rides in the park, and this is part of the game (you have to ride them to hear more of the story).\nWhy would you venture into a theme park looking for your child, to start riding the rides? What makes it worse is that the rides are supposidly "dangerous", yet you still ride them. Why are you doing this when you're supposed to be looking for Callum?\n\nThe game is a little distrubing in places too. The mother, although she is in the park looking for Callum, starts calling him "little f***"" and saying she says she should just leave him there. Why would you do that if you've gone into the park in the first place?\n\nWhen anything scary happens to make you jump, you get a Steam Achievement. This pops up on the right hand side in a box, ruining the effect and distracting you away from what has just happened.\nAnd the "acheievements" aren't an achievement at all. They're things you have to do in the game to contiunue, but you still get rewarded for. I played for approx 56 minutes and unlocked 64% of them already!\n\nWalking around the park, you find accident reports. Why would these just be left on top of a bumpercar or on the outside wall of the ferris wheel control box?\n\nThis is a story game. Far too much story and spoken audio, and not nearly enough game play. It just gets boring and repetitive.\n\nThe controls on this game didn't work properly for me. I'm using a keyboard and mouse, but when holding shift to run, it only did it half of the time.\n\nThis will eat away at your graphics card too! I can easily run Planet Coaster, which can be very graphic hungry, but I had to turn the graphics down to medium on this game, just to make it playable.\n\n\nThe lack of realism in this game, such as riding the rides (why?), events that don't make sense, long audio speeches and a story that's unbelieveable, really spoils the game in my opinion.\n\nAs I've said, it's a great idea, but it could be told and written so much better. Callum could have been kidnapped by someone or something and notes left to tell the mother he is in The Park. That could have been the reason why she had to go in there. Not because Callum ran through locked gates (!) and then she has to find him. Why would he keep ignoring his mothers calls and continue to go further into the park?\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. It's a creepy, scary, dark idea, great for a horror/ thriller game, but the realism is severely lacking, making it unbelieveable, unrealistic, and just not half as scary :(\n","April 21","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game really tries to get you to care about the storyline and the characters. Truthfully, I didn't care about what this woman was saying. The main character whom you play as is actually kind of a villain. She says some really bad things about her son and she makes stupid decisions during the entire game. She also does something pretty unforgivable at the end of the game. The graphics are pretty nice albeit some of the blurry textures but the optimization could've had a bit more work. Bearing in mind i'm playing on a beast PC that can handle games like Far Cry 4, Grand Theft Auto V, Dying Light, Fallout 4 and Alien: Isolation on ultra high settings, I should've been able to run this game at a stable 60fps the entire time. However, the framerate is very sloppy when I play. It jumps incredibly high to very low. This is unacceptable even for an indie game.\n\nThere aren't much scares in this game at all, really. When you visit each ride you expect to something really eerie to happen but nothing does. This game is boring. For half of the game I sat down not even touching the mouse as this woman talks about her past life. Instead of going to look for her child, she decides to scurry around and go on all the rides. Sure, this would be okay if the rides were actually creepy.\n\nThe first ride is actually the worst. It's like 15 or 20 minutes of the game and you literally can't do anything but sit in a boat and listen to the entire story of Hansel & Gretel which everyone knows anyway. Too short and too boring.","November 29, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It wasn't scary.\n\nYes, it had some creeepy moments. Yes I was startled by a few of the jump scares (I hate jump scares btw, I feel they are lazy and in poor taste for a truly horrifying experience) but no matter how spooky the atmosphere, or how chilling the sound effects, it all means nothing when you realize in the first 15 minuites or so that you are in no danger. Without that overhanging threat, anything you see on the rides, anything that pops up behind you, anything the game tries to scare you with is just another puppet, dancing in front of you, its strings easily seen. Many will claim this is supposed to be a "pychological" horror game and so shouldn't need to cause fear with a sense of threat. That would be fine, if they actually bothered to use psychology. I'm not talking about the mother's mental state. That's not scary. It's a predictable and overused trope. I'm talking about using the veiwers own mind against them, I'm talking about creating expectations only to pull aside the curtain and reveal nothing, or something that completely overwhelms. I'm talking about misdirection, not jumpscares, and things that creep around just out of veiw, not something that dances in front of you just to dissapear in the next moment. What I am trying to say is, almost every single scare in this game is predictable, and has been done before in better horror games. Seriously, it got to the point I was simply saying hi to Chuck the chipmunk and his stupid red glowy eyes (seriously, when will people learn that monsters lit up like christmas trees are not scary) everytime I saw him in the park.\n\nNow, the above has nothing to do with the next issue I take with this game, which is it's directly tied to The Secret World MMORPG. That in itself isn't a bad thing. It's fine to use lore your audiance might not be familiar with so long as you explain it throughout the park. The game does this, but not to the extent it should to fully immerse someone who hasn't played TSW. It's as many reviews and the forums have said  (in the most non spoilery way possible) "What does that chipmunk and his freind have to do with the actual story?" If you play TSW, you'd have a better idea, if not, such as myself, it leaves you scratching your head and wondering what was psycholigical out of the the things you saw,and what wasn't. I'll leave my own theories out, but the forums are full of many, which means the story's world and supporting elements should have probably been better explained. Also, before anyone comes on here and says "play TSW, it will make more sense then," one shouldn't have to play the supporting title to fully understand what is going on in a stand alone game.\n\nThere isn't that much more to talk about really. I bought this game because it fits the theme of the season and for $10 basically saw it as the equivilent of going out and seeing a halloween movie. I don't feel ripped off, and enjoyed my stroll through FunComs haunted amusement park. But I was hoping to be frightened, and not subjected to the same horror tropes I've seen time and again. If you're new to the horror genre and have a high end rig that can run the graphics to the fullest effect, you will likely enjoy The Park. If you're a hardened horror vet like me, whose own nightmares are far more terrifying than anything modern horror tends to throw together, then you may want to give this one a pass.","October 28, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

Just not much here at all. The scares don't really start until you've basically left the actual park. The park itself has nearly no scares of any variety. There's maybe 3 or 4 jump scares, some decent psychological scares (but only at the very end when you're not really in the park). It's got a pretty eerie atmosphere though.\n\nControls are clunky and slow and unintuitive. The shout mechanic is literally just a waypoint marker.\n\nThe story is decent given how very short the game is. I care just enough about the mother to want to know what's going to happen and the newspaper clippings really give the park a chilling history. Too bad the park itself doesn't take advantage of ANY of it's back story. Unfortunately the game kinda just... ends. No emotion from the final scene. Length is also a serious problem. Taking my sweet time I managed to beat the game in 1.5 hours. There's nothing to explore and the very short story is severely drawn out by slow movement speed and even slower mandatory rides. There's less substance here than your typical Saw or Paranormal sequel.\n\nGraphics are decent but performance is meh at best. Given the lack of draw distance, high res textures or overly detailed objects I'd expect to be able to max 60 this game at 5760x1080 with my computer (GTX 980Ti, Intel Core i7 4790k) but even with reduced settings could only get about 40-50 frames. Hardly terrible numbers at all. No serious dips and no choppiness. The graphics themselves are very decent. They more than do the job and don't detract from the game. The occasional animations however do detract from the game. They're simply bad but fortunately there aren't many animations at all. Also the triple screen support is quite excellent I'm happy to say. I didn't have to do any tinkering to get it to work and there is nearly zero screen warp on the outer edges.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game. Though it's not bad it excels at absolutely nothing including being scary. I won't even say I was disappointed by the game as it has decent moments. Do I regret my 10$ purchase? I don't. But Layers of Fear is a substantially better game in every way for about the same price. Basically this game feels like the lead up to the very first real scare of a full blown horror game.\n\nEDIT: Honestly no idea why people are saying this review isn't helpful.

Shadows are often too heavy probably to hide the terrible texture .\nI did not have problems running the game but many people reported poor optimization .\nReflections in mirrows are so bad you have to see it yourself because I can't desribe it .\n\n/One thing I know for sure is that this game has no right to brag about how good it looks/\n\n-Aesthetic opportunities were not taken to the fullest .\n\nHorror House was designed very poorly. Like cardboard pictures really ? They even use same pictures more than once . I have seen better in real life and they couden't take some liberties with a video game ?\n\nFerris Wheel - you are locked in a camera where you can only see the forest . I was hoping to at least see the entire park but this hole ride is just there to progress the narrative .\n\n\n-Many jump scares were unnecessary .\n\nFor example when they try to scare you with a heavy object coming toward but you can't die in this narrative genre it feels like a failed attempt at jumpscare. They use this more than once and it gets olds fast .\n\nPlaying game for the first time I was able to anticipate exactly when jump scares would come . Some were just not original enough and overall its a failure in terms of setting up something scary .\n\n- The story was too obvious .\n\nYou can puzzle in all parts about 20 minutes into the game and the rest 60 minutes you just hearing something you already know . Kind of a big problem for a game like this .\n\nI am not sure if this game worth recommending . For $10 I can't . Not because its short . I only enjoyaed half of the game and the big Visual experience was not that great . I am not refunding this game but I will give it a 6/10 score because it was average game in this genre .","October 27, 2015","false","2.8"," 18 of 47 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","18","47","0","2"

Because of this it focuses completely on small jump scares. The game is less than 2 hours long (more about this later) and there's literally about 4 jumpscares and thats the entire horror aspect of the game\n\nyou'd think that since there are zero quality scares in this horror/adventure game it would be more about the adventure and the amazing cinematic story right? i thought so too, but the thing about this game..from the first announcement they said the game was only meant to be an hour or two long, so i'm really confused about how the planning for this story went. The gameplay is literally walking around between cutscenes reading occasional letters on the ground that don't really form a complete story anyway, and the "twist" is predictable within the first 5 minutes of the game or maybe even in the trailers.\n\n-This game, in its short time, uses every horror stereotype/cliche known to man and completely ruins all of them..i cant go into much detail without spoiling the "story" though.\n\n-the first 30 minutes of the 2 hour game are just riding amusement park rides. (its spooky because you're the only one on the ride! ooooh!)\n\n-There are 5 characters in this game and only 1 of them has a single shred of personality and it's totally ripped apart, changed and ruined by the end of the game although there was barely anything there to start with.\n\n-You get no time with the kid before he goes missing so you have no emotional bond or reason to actually want to find him\n\n-the mother is the only character in this game with more than 2 lines unless you count the kid's prerecorded whisper when you press the mouse button to yell for him\n\n-there is SO MUCH unexplained in backstory and lore, but the main story is so uninteresting that by the time the game's over you dont care about what you missed\n\n-it tries to copy the repeating hallways trick from things that did it amazingly like PT but completely ruins it..without any real scares this is just repetitive busywork to extend the game's already short playtime\n\n\nOverall The Park was a game i was originally very excited for from the first trailers, but was extremely dissapointed with the bad voice acting, short underdeveloped story, boring characters, weird mechanics, and lack of actual horror\n\nTL;DR 1/10 cuz i got to ride a rollercoaster, thank god for steam refunds","October 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 17 of 45 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","17","45","0","0"

We have all seen our fair shares of terrible indie horror games on Steam but this one was just so promising.\n\nThis game is wildly short, in all honestly you can finish it in about 1 hour and still get the full message the game is trying to convey. Don't get me wrong this game has some really awesome parts to it that makes it stand out, such as its creepy setting, art style, and beautiful visual fidelity from the Unreal Engine 4.\n\nI will give it to the art designers, they did a wonderful job but fell really short.\n\nThis game puts you in the shoes of a mother who has lost her child in a theme park, you must find him as you physologically unravel the mother's mind. This sounds like a good idea, and honestly delievers in some aspects, but in the strongest points it falls so short that it hurts.\n\nIn this game you will experiance four slow moving boring rides, with little to no personality. It is a damn shame since the art team did such a great job at the park's design itself. In a spooky carnival maybe you should of put more creepy physological design into it, and turned the speed up a bit more. Every ride in this game is a choir. Yes, a literal chore.\n\nI found the acting actually quite good for a small indie team, and it delievers great on that part! I loved the mother's role as she gets more and more insane as the game progresses. That being said, she really is the only actor in the entire game, so good job nontheless.\n\nThe main villian you meet in this game has a really sweet design too! I love how he looks, just so creepy and well thought out. I very much enjoy this aspect.\n\nAlso what about that horror part? Is it spooky? Will it make it hard to sleep after this game?!?!? The short and easy answer is no. I wouldn't even call it a horror game, as it only has about 2 jump scares that even work and nothing phsycologically hit me. Such a sad, and dissapointing aspect.\n\nIf this game was longer I believe it could of been passable, but with its boring and lack of personality rides, bland story, and overall lack of creepy design I have to say I don't reccomend it but like what it was trying to be. Maybe if they spent more time on it and tried harder, they would of had a great game and experiance on their hands.","October 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","7","24","0","0"

You start the game at the entrance of an amusement park, with your child having left behind his teddy bear in the park. When you go to the help desk, your child runs in and you must follow his trail through the park.\n\nI'm actually fine with the concept of an "interactive movie", and I'm particularly open to ones in the horror genre. The Park was more memorable than I had hoped. The early parts can be a bit slow, but the game steadily picks up as you get further along. The game doesn't rely on the creepiness of the park alone. A lot of the game is focused on exploring the psychological state of the mother, and watching her mind unravel the deeper she goes into the park.\n\nWhile I was satisfied with the overall experience, I do feel that the developers  could've done more in certain areas.  The areas of the park seem bigger than they need to be. Not that I explored every nook and cranny, but I did try to look around, and it seems like there's not usually a reward for going off the beaten path. One of the things I value most in horror games aren't the monsters or the jumpscares, but finding creepy little oddities scattered around the environment. Although "following the trail" is an important theme in the game, I think there could've been a bit more detail for the players who like to explore. Like many horror games, there's a large focus on reading notes. But in many cases, the letters are way too small, and I had to practically press my face against my screen to be able to make out what they said.\n\nThe game really has two stories, the history and nature of the park, and exploring the character of the mother. By the end, I felt like one was resolved, and the other wasn't. I've never played The Secret World and I don't know anything about it, and perhaps playing that game would clear up the remaining questions I have, but a spin-off should be able to stand on its own. It seems that a large part of the story is symbolic, but I feel that may have resulted in a somewhat weak ending.\n\nI did have noticeable frame rate issues, but my PC is fairly old by now, and I don't have the technical know-how to say if it's my computer or the game. The indoor areas usually ran fine though.\n\nIf you aren't put off by a lack of real gameplay and just want to immerse yourself in the story and the environment, then I would definitely recommend playing through The Park.","November 10, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically an interactive teaser for The Secret World which is a fairly decent MMO from the limited time I've played it. The execution here is just far too sloppy and predictible to come close to what Kojima did with P.T.\n\nPredictible being the key word here. This is a stratighforward, linear walk sim. This hurts for two reasons. One, it takes little to no logic to get you from start to finish. It's not a rails, but it might as well be as you let the game holds your hand until the credits roll.\n\nThe second reason the game suffers from it's format, is there is no sense of danger or urgency. Part of what makes the best horror games compelling is the survival aspect. With P.T. you had the ghost Lisa that was quite hostile towards you. In The Park you know that nothing will hurt you. Any of truly dangerously feeling elements are in-game cut scenes and the remaining horror elements are a series of jump scares that were all so predictable, I found myself bracing and calling out each. I won't rob you of any, but you're gonna know when they're coming.\n\nWhen it comes to price, I try to avoid saying a game is too expensive. If I really love a film, I have no issues dropping $20 for the blu ray. Games are the same. Even if it's only an hour long, an absorbing and fanstatic journey can be worth the price in my opinion.\n\nThe Park, however, doesn't come close to meeting those kind of expectations.\n\n","January 24","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My biggest complaints, and the reasons I have to give this game a negative recommendation start with the fact that this really isnt a game. It is a visual novel. You can read newspaper clippings and walk around and that is pretty much the limit to what you as the player can do.\nSecondly, the length of the game is absolutely abysmal. I got all 14 achievements and read pretty much everything there was to read in 2 hours. That is not even worth close to the asking price for this game. I got it for 50% off and I still feel a little screwed over. And you would think that a game this short would at least have replay value or different choices or something, but alas, it does not.\nMy last complaint is that you can see where the story is going from about 30 minutes in. It's extremely obvious and not the least bit subtle in it's foreshadowing, which really negatively impacts the story's final scenes.\n\nI wanted to like this game and I wish I could give a good recommendation because the premise is gold. The setup of being stuck in a creepy closed down amusement park is exactly why I gave this game a chance, but it just doesn't deliver. I feel more like I just played a tech demo/visual novel than an actual game and that's the most disapponting aspect of all.","January 21","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe if I was 15 years old and dumb again, it would work better - I dunno.  I wasn't expect Shakespeare or even Stephen King, but the inauthenticity in the character dialogue and the little disjointed notes (the eyeball landing on the ice sclulpture, boooooo!)\n\nI did love the design, the fact that you ride on many of the rides.  I hope someone will do a game though with a similar theme, but make an effort at being authentic to real mechanics of rides.  You know, like cardboard cutouts that don't just pop up on their own even though there's nothing to prop them up.  Sound design was quite good, sounding very real and atmospheric, authentic sounds of theme park rides etc.  I could've done without the ghoulish laughing and that "Boo!" sounds at one point just seemed dumb.\n\nStill, being an amusement park fan, I enjoyed parts of it but yeah, not much here for general audience.","October 28, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of running from monsters, you hike through a forestry theme park looking for your son. I appreciated that the game didn't have villains fighting you, although you will encounter two ghosts that are haunting you.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple to master, left mouse to interact, right mouse to call out to your son. I personally did not like the limited graphic options provided, most of the settings are under a single graphics options (low, medium, high, ultra). You are able to set things like AA and Motion Blur. I also kept having problems where my mouse sensitivity setting was being set extremely low, even after raising it.\n\nThe game is very short, but the price (I got it on sale) was mostly fair. I beat the game 100% in 90 minutes. After a single play through, I'm not really interested in returning. I would have enjoyed the game more if there was more content. The game basically is a large horror-walking simulator.\n\nI cannot judge the storyline very much as I do not know anything about the game’s universe. The Park also includes some items for another game by its creators. The story slowly built up as you wander through the park and look for your missing son.\n\nThe game gets the atmosphere almost spot on. While most of the spooks are spread out around the park, each section adds more to the adventure. There are a few rides you are able to interact with, and many (hard to read) notes spread around.\n\nI enjoyed The Park and would recommend it for people who like simple horror games. You probably won’t find the game very scare, minus the few jump scares.","January 1","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No hand holding, no forced cut scenes (except when started by you) and an open world for you to discover as much or as little as you want.\n\nYou could, for example, simply walk from one end of the "map" to the other, only stopping to pick up the basic essentials you need to progress (flashlight), but you'll be missing out on pretty much all the story if you do that. Or, you can take your time and look around for items to interact with, ride the rides etc and discover the whole story.\n\nIt's the kind of game that I really enjoy at the moment, with games like "Everybody'd Gone to the Rapture" and "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" being two of my favorite games of the last 12 months, so that, couple with the atmosphere of an old theme park, made this a no brainer for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\nThere's a ton of atmosphere to be found here and it's enjoyable to just walk around and soak it all in. Graphically, my PC, despite being a decent spec, really struggled with this at times on medium settings, but it look excellent and I imagine on a real high end PC, the will look spectacular!\n\nIt's not a game for everyone though. It's not for action game fans and despite it's looks, it's not really a "horror" game either. Sure, there is a dark theme throughout and it gets really dark near the end, but there's little to no jump scares outside osf a few cheap ones inside the haunted house, but you'd expect those in there.\n\nAlthough I completed it on my first playthrough in around two hours, I still feel I've got value for money as I thoroughly enjoyed it and with two achievments still to get, I've got at least one more playthrough ahead, then more, just for fun.","January 1","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing is, you need to know what to expect. This is absolutely a short game. Some people finished in an hour, but I took my time reading everything, and it took around three.

You start the game at the entrance of an amusement park, with your child having left behind his teddy bear in the park. When you go to the help desk, your child runs in and you must follow his trail through the park.\n\nI'm actually fine with the concept of an "interactive movie", and I'm particularly open to ones in the horror genre. The Park was more memorable than I had hoped. The early parts can be a bit slow, but the game steadily picks up as you get further along. The game doesn't rely on the creepiness of the park alone. A lot of the game is focused on exploring the psychological state of the mother, and watching her mind unravel the deeper she goes into the park.\n\nWhile I was satisfied with the overall experience, I do feel that the developers  could've done more in certain areas.  The areas of the park seem bigger than they need to be. Not that I explored every nook and cranny, but I did try to look around, and it seems like there's not usually a reward for going off the beaten path. One of the things I value most in horror games aren't the monsters or the jumpscares, but finding creepy little oddities scattered around the environment. Although "following the trail" is an important theme in the game, I think there could've been a bit more detail for the players who like to explore. Like many horror games, there's a large focus on reading notes. But in many cases, the letters are way too small, and I had to practically press my face against my screen to be able to make out what they said.\n\nThe game really has two stories, the history and nature of the park, and exploring the character of the mother. By the end, I felt like one was resolved, and the other wasn't. I've never played The Secret World and I don't know anything about it, and perhaps playing that game would clear up the remaining questions I have, but a spin-off should be able to stand on its own. It seems that a large part of the story is symbolic, but I feel that may have resulted in a somewhat weak ending.\n\nI did have noticeable frame rate issues, but my PC is fairly old by now, and I don't have the technical know-how to say if it's my computer or the game. The indoor areas usually ran fine though.\n\nIf you aren't put off by a lack of real gameplay and just want to immerse yourself in the story and the environment, then I would definitely recommend playing through The Park.","November 10, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was actually the first game that I recorded a full walkthrough for, and while you can’t really hear me talking – you can definitely hear me scream!

They’re also local to me in Durham, North Carolina, which is awesome – so many great game developers around here, I had no idea!\n\nYou play the game as protagonist Lorraine, a young mother, who is forced to explore a creepy-as-hell amusement park in order to find her son, Callum, when he bolts inside at closing time. Think Silent Hill meets Dark Ride… kinda.

You were warned!\n\nFirst of all, I've heard complains about how the game is just cheap jumpscares, but that is not true at all. The game provides a proper psychological-horror experience if you play by its rules and follow the instructions it provides instantly and linear path it clearly puts you into. I was wondering what's really going on during my trip in the park and why I am seeing what I see. It's mostly an interactive story, a walking simulator, but it's a well delivered story.\n\nThe problem with the story though is that even during the events and the rides, you get very little background as to what is really going on, mostly in the form of boring newspapper and general papper cutouts. That leaves those that know nothing about the park in TSW in the black. There are also monologues by the main character throughout the game that help provide a background, but while it helps understand the main character, it doesn't help understand the world you are in.\n\nGraphically wise, the game looks great. It provides a "spooky" atmosphere and combining that with some weird events that happen gives you the feeling that you are not really safe even if you know you are. Funcom has never really failed to deliver on that department, so it doesn't surprise me!\n\nThere are a few issues though, like some events needing more... oomph so to speak. Some things appearing and disappearing in a very cheap way and the mouths having light in them for some reason, making it always look weird. Nothing too major though, just nitpicking.\n\nYeah, I do recommend this interactive story. It's good if you are into this sort of experiences. However, if you haven't played TSW and don't feel like going through some in-game reading then you probably can skip it. If you are really out of horror games to play and you are looking for anything, it's good enough!","March 16","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No hand holding, no forced cut scenes (except when started by you) and an open world for you to discover as much or as little as you want.\n\nYou could, for example, simply walk from one end of the "map" to the other, only stopping to pick up the basic essentials you need to progress (flashlight), but you'll be missing out on pretty much all the story if you do that. Or, you can take your time and look around for items to interact with, ride the rides etc and discover the whole story.\n\nIt's the kind of game that I really enjoy at the moment, with games like "Everybody'd Gone to the Rapture" and "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" being two of my favorite games of the last 12 months, so that, couple with the atmosphere of an old theme park, made this a no brainer for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\nThere's a ton of atmosphere to be found here and it's enjoyable to just walk around and soak it all in. Graphically, my PC, despite being a decent spec, really struggled with this at times on medium settings, but it look excellent and I imagine on a real high end PC, the will look spectacular!\n\nIt's not a game for everyone though. It's not for action game fans and despite it's looks, it's not really a "horror" game either. Sure, there is a dark theme throughout and it gets really dark near the end, but there's little to no jump scares outside osf a few cheap ones inside the haunted house, but you'd expect those in there.\n\nAlthough I completed it on my first playthrough in around two hours, I still feel I've got value for money as I thoroughly enjoyed it and with two achievments still to get, I've got at least one more playthrough ahead, then more, just for fun.","January 1","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing is, you need to know what to expect. This is absolutely a short game. Some people finished in an hour, but I took my time reading everything, and it took around three. Some people call it an "experience" instead of a "game", and there is some reasoning for that, but it still fits the definition of "game" as well, while still being mostly about the experience, and slowly peeling back the layers of story.\n\nIf you've played The Secret World, and want a peek at the goings-on before the fog and the bees showed up, it's great.

You start the game at the entrance of an amusement park, with your child having left behind his teddy bear in the park. When you go to the help desk, your child runs in and you must follow his trail through the park.\n\nI'm actually fine with the concept of an "interactive movie", and I'm particularly open to ones in the horror genre. The Park was more memorable than I had hoped. The early parts can be a bit slow, but the game steadily picks up as you get further along. The game doesn't rely on the creepiness of the park alone. A lot of the game is focused on exploring the psychological state of the mother, and watching her mind unravel the deeper she goes into the park.\n\nWhile I was satisfied with the overall experience, I do feel that the developers  could've done more in certain areas.  The areas of the park seem bigger than they need to be. Not that I explored every nook and cranny, but I did try to look around, and it seems like there's not usually a reward for going off the beaten path. One of the things I value most in horror games aren't the monsters or the jumpscares, but finding creepy little oddities scattered around the environment. Although "following the trail" is an important theme in the game, I think there could've been a bit more detail for the players who like to explore. Like many horror games, there's a large focus on reading notes. But in many cases, the letters are way too small, and I had to practically press my face against my screen to be able to make out what they said.\n\nThe game really has two stories, the history and nature of the park, and exploring the character of the mother. By the end, I felt like one was resolved, and the other wasn't. I've never played The Secret World and I don't know anything about it, and perhaps playing that game would clear up the remaining questions I have, but a spin-off should be able to stand on its own. It seems that a large part of the story is symbolic, but I feel that may have resulted in a somewhat weak ending.\n\nI did have noticeable frame rate issues, but my PC is fairly old by now, and I don't have the technical know-how to say if it's my computer or the game. The indoor areas usually ran fine though.\n\nIf you aren't put off by a lack of real gameplay and just want to immerse yourself in the story and the environment, then I would definitely recommend playing through The Park.","November 10, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some haunting music will creep in from time to time, but is not memorable.  Expect the occasional orchaestra sting to shake you out of your seat briefly.\n\nThe story of the game is simple and quick to grasp, with character dialogue that's well voice acted to build up the tension.  The background of the protagonist is well explored and interesting, although relatively mundane compared to standard Secret World stories.\n\nGame is very much a walking simulator.  No puzzles, simply an invitation to explore and spin random objects around in your hands.  Game never quite makes it to "scary" but does dance on the edge of creepy from time to time.  Sadly, one of the game's best horror moments was straight lifted from a rather popular and increasingly rare title that'll be immediately apparent to anyone who plays this game.\n\nThe technical problems ultimately ruin the experience.  Framerate drops will disrupt visual and audio noticably, dissolving all the tension the scene is attempting to build up.  This is especially aggravating during moments where the protagonist is monologuing to herself or when the game hitches up in a jump scare.\n\nThe experience will run you about 1-2 hours, and has nothing to offer after the first run.  At $5.00 or less, you could do worse, but at it's current retail price, it's not worth it unless you seriously need a chipmunk costume or 10.9 trinket in Secret World.  Layers of Fear is a more comprehensive and intense walking horror simulator.  Those looking for something with more game to it should consider Amnesia, the Dark Decent.

I felt obligated to do this one because this game is a mixed bag for some, but I think it is an engaging interactive story, and that´s very much what this ¨game¨is. A spinoff from the MMO, The Secret World, you enter an amusement park, a setting from the original game to explore the sinister stories and tragedies that still haunt this decrepit theme park. You walk along and follow the rides and the narrative, and try to find and read the scattered letters and notices, and listen to Lorraine´s monologues about life. I call this an ïnteractive¨story because you can´t really lose, and even with my terrible sense of game direction, you can´t really get lost. While this game´s story was not a thriller, with some awesome twist at the end, I found it to be a tour de force that made me interested in finding where the story was going. The main character was enjoyable as a flawed and very human person, and I feel a lot of attention to detail was paid to making Lorraine seem like a real person with real problems, caught up in unreal circumstances. The ending of the game is a bit of a puzzler, but again, so interesting that I continued trying to research the game after it was finished, and even briefly piqued my interest in checking out The Secret World (but who has time for MMOs with almost 200 games in the library). While reading, I came across this quote from the creator that I wanted to share:\n"Everybody's had that dream where they fall," Bylos says. "Most people have had that nightmare where they wake up because they fell from a height -- I want that feeling from people, especially as you go through the House of Horrors, the sense that the bottom is rushing up and you just can't stop it. It's inevitable."  --Joel Bylos\nIt was because of this quote that I came here to recommend this game, because it did exactly what the creator wanted to do, and I consider that to be a success. As the ending drew near, I couldn´t stop myself, and I did feel that rush of an impending end that made me both anxious and excited. While the game´s ending felt like a well-what-do-you-think-happened, I was glad for the experience. While some might want to wait for this to be on sale, as the game is maybe 1-2 hours at most, I encourage games to be the new medium for storytelling, and The Park is not to be missed for those who enjoy eerie atmospheres, realistic characters, and dark stories.","January 19","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You spend most of the game walking around trying to find out where the voice of your lost child is, and trying to figure out what actual gameplay there is.\n\nTrue, you could spend 2-5 hours walking around with a little magnifying glass, reading every small note and paying meticulous attention to any and all "changing" details throughout the game, but it makes little to no impact on the way things end. There are enough highly present visual clues throughout the game that help build  up to the ending, without the added suspense drawn from the small ones.\n\nRecommended if you:\n\n-Like story games with no choices\n-Enjoyed the lore surrounding the first stage of "The Secret World"\n-Are pumped up by reading and rereading cryptic clues formatted in letters, news articles, and journal entries\n-Have money to spend on any old game\n\n\nNOT Recommended if you:\n\n-Have never played "the Secret World"\n-Enjoy playing with choices and consequences\n-Don't like to read\n-Don't like to search for tiny clues\n-Don't scare easily (the scares only really happen if you hype yourself into thinking it is scary)\n-Want replayability and satisfaction with game experience\n-Are on a tight budget\n-Want any interaction between yourself as a player, and the game.\n\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed "The Secret World" and that's why I bought this game the second it came out, but I was deeply disappointed. Thankfully Steam gave me a full refund of my money. I hope anyone else not satisfied can get their money back too.","December 26, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get if you don't want a game where you are mostly walking and thinking about the story, the game is more about that than actually acting out in the world.  The tale is a deep one and worth a playthrough if you want something you will have to think about to really understand how the story ends (and how it led there).  It fits well with the MMO it is set in (Secret World), but it isn't a requirement to play or enjoy.  The MMO will fill out some other details for at least 2-3 of the characters represented.

The game is very well written and although it's not very long, its an intriguing experience.  I don't really like scary games moreso because I'm a wimp than anything but I love abandoned/rundown amusement parks so this game really caught my interest.  I'm not familiar with The Secret World (made by the same developer and supposedly has some ties) but I enjoyed the game nonetheless.  I would consider this game more of an experience than anything, sort of like going to a movie but interactive instead.  Make sure you take the time to explore the environment and read all of the notes/pages/newspapers you can to get the information and know whats going on.  I would probably play through this again, maybe next year around Halloween.","January 12","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are two, count them, two jumpscares in the game. The atmosphere is there, but it alone does not do a very good job. You spend most of the game going through amusement park rides, with only one of the rides having a bit of a spooky twist. The ending is confusing and gives you no closure whatsoever.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting is decent. That's about the only positives I can think for this game. A shame, really. I had high hopes for this game.\n\nOverall, If you can get it for like 75% off, go for it. It's a nice game if it had a price tag of about 5€ or so.\nOtherwise, don't buy it.

The Game is short took me around 70 minutes to complete . But If you could understand the symbolysm and the message of this game and understand what the character says and sees you will like this game and feel attached to the game and its message . I did get jump scared once , Well wearing headphones at night with max volume can make you JUMP lol. But to sum it all up It was fun playing it, but sadly it was short.\nI am a huge critic on anything and me giving it a 8/10 is amazing . would of been a 9 if it was longer .
