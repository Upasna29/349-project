They aren't pack mules.\n\n"Why a single map can be very long, and, probably, you will broke it, rendering your attempts to end in vain?"\nThat's a good question, for the not obtuse people. Really, it isn't sarcastic, i think i just broke the level at the third mission, discovered that nearly at the end of the map, and now i should play it from the start, because i can't complete it. But that should be just my problem, nothing to do with you others.\n\nLet's say, this game is boring, because it's a predictable game: the zombies come, you run, you kill them in the way while keeping at a distance from them, then you run again, and so on... Or maybe it's just me that i find tactical zombie games like that. But anyway, for me the gameplay seems too clunky, along with the bad controls and reaction of the characters, which make the game very frustrating.\n\nAlso to note, the Multiplayer Co-op it's HORRIBLE:  first you need to do a port forward in your router if you're using one to access the internet, then you can play the levels that, in case you are the host, you have completed, with the same items you had before starting. Your friends will be stuck with your stuff, sometimes getting even confused if you're not a tidy guy. If you want to play more than 2 players, you can't play the first levels with them, because the characters are pretty few, like i said. After these little problems, here comes the gameplay on multiplayer.\nThere aren't the dialogue of the characters in the map, to understand some parts of the storyline in the game. Also, your guests that entered in your game may be experiencing lots of lag, for some strange reason, in casual moments, even if they have a good computer. And that will make it unplayable until they will left it.\n\nThis game is poorly cared by the developers, and, i might be too harsh about this, maybe because, i repeat, this kind of games are boring for me, maybe because i am not much into strategy games, fighting against some slow creatures... but this game, is pretty bad, and not worth it's cost. Not even if it's on sale, for me. Not even in a bundle. Well, maybe for the cards, if you have interest in it.","December 17, 2013","false","5.0"," 61 of 82 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","61","82","0","0"

The final product is not a simulator, it's not about surviving (if we're not talking about user surviving through the UI), and squad-based part is just pontless.\n\nEvery aspect of the game represents raw incompetence of the developers -- game is bugged, UI is ridiculous, gameplay is extremely boring (if you'll last more than 1 hour, like I did, you're supposed to be awarded with a medal), fighting system is just plainly lame.\n\nThe game has active pause (you can prace Space to pause the game and give orders to your survivors). Presumably, this was implemented to introduce tactics to the game. Alas, this effort was fruitless -- fights are boring and repetitive. Most of the fights are ending up in user, luring enemies into some trap and then activating it. There's no tactics to it, honestly, it's just a waste of time.\n\nThere's a ton of useless mechanics. For example, your character can randomly start bleeding after he was wounded. You'll be bleeding for the whole duration of the level (it won't stop), yet you won't lose any HP for that. Why was that implemented? Because it attracts zombie in a bigger radius around you. But since you're walking faster then they do, they'll soon forget about you and would roam around their location aimlessly (pathfinding is awful here too, by the way).\n\nThe weapon system is plainly lame -- you can only hold 1 weapon, and if you want to turn on some switch, you first have to hide the weapon, then use the switch, then take out the weapon again. Developers couldn't care less about usability, I think.\n\nOne of the bugs that I've found in my short session was inability to launch game in windowed mode -- all my efforts lead to a point where my inventory disappeared alongside with all of the texts in the game. I was unable to fix it, so, obviously enough, I've decided to just uninstall.\n\nWill I recommend this game? Never. I may recommend to try it to people with really low self-esteem that are enjoying UI masochism and poor gameplay.\n\nI'd rate the game 2.0 out of 10.0, and would NOT recommend it to anyone.","February 15, 2015","false","1.4"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","2"

It is no shooter, neither action like "Diablo", where all you need is to click faaaster. There you have to advance slowly, be ready to run backward, count every bullet, and killing zombies one-by-one. Flawlessly, if possible, because if they get you only a scratch , you will bleed, and that will attract many more undeads... You gonna need some skill with controls, certainly.\n\nMost of the reviews on Steam are negative, for typical reasons: people who bought the game wasn't ready for it.\n1) it is slow-paced and needs patience and tactical thinking much more than quick-reflexes\n2) it can be buggy, at least in some cases, as I see. I suppose that somewhat portraying basic user who dislike that game - a schoolboy with weak PC and without skills to tune it and patience to simply let it go. Me personally, never had any serious trouble, maybe freeze one or two times when I alt-tabbed game for couple of hours on the office PC with built-in video... On the normal systems with up-to-date software it runs fine.\n\nFor me, the only real down-side was lack of ammo. It is so cliche, you know...\n\nSo! I do recommend that game, but only if you ready to beat zombies with melee weapons at slow-paced tactical game with controls like in "command&conquer". Story is basic enough - get a team, get a supplies, find a way out.\nNot a bad game overall, nothing fancy, but deserves 7/10 mark.

You get to control a party of survivors in real-time, however you can pause the game at any moment to choose what should be that character's next action.\n\nThe action is very intense as you can often become overcrowded with dozens of zombies in just a mere few seconds. The feeling of the weapons, from baseball bats, pistols, to even grenades is perfect. Letting a zombie to slowly walk right up to your character's face to finally blow his/her brains out with a well timed shot is deliciously rewarding. The game world, characters and zombies are all well designed, but the voice acting is atrocious. The game is well presented, the graphics are good, but the camera system can be extremely frustrating to control at times. Getting used to the poor camera system and controls can be a hard task.\n\nThe game uses a checkpoint system to save your progress during missions, but they're quite rare and some checkpoints are optional. These are often placed in an alternate route and protected by a bunch of zombies. While the checkpoint system builds up tension and greatly increases the challenge, it only leads to frustration because you can easily loose an hour of gameplay if the game crashes (and it does often in some missions).\n\nI would recommend to buy a 4-pack when on sale (or even better, get it in a 1 dollar bundle) to play with your friends because playing solo can be VERY tiring as you'd have to micro-manage everything.\n\nThere's no achievements in this game.","November 25, 2013","true","3.8"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

Although the concept of an isometric-style zombie survival game is solid, the execution is so bad that it seems like the development team figured out the best and worst things to do at every interval and deliberately went with the worst option every time.\n\nThe story is completely dull, as are the characters - things that can being strength to otherwise bad games. It is extremely difficult and of course this isn't a bad thing in of itself, but the game greatly encourages you to learn the intricacies of the zombie AI and exploit the computer as much as possible. It in no way promotes anything resembling "survival"; taking out a street full of zombies (the only means of proceeding) slowly and carefully results only in them all respawning from an alleyway when the game decides you're not being quick enough.\n\nMany other things about it seem to be specifically anti-player. The interface and the controls are equally terrible, as if designed to be so. But even, getting past these things, it is just dull, incredibly boring and predictable.

Not that I'm recommending this game on its potential alone.\n\nWhere there can be filler sections, there are a good smattering of genuinely exciting sections where you have to tactically micromanage your team's position, weaponry and targets to escape the hordes that are rolling inexorably over your position.  Cramped indoors or built up urban areas add to this excitement, where every move is key.  I found the game's difficulty relatively on the low side though (no difficulty settings either), and was never short of ammunition but the game is swift to punish carelessness as your guys can become zombie chow in 2 seconds if left unattended next to a hungry undead.\n\nThe story plays homage to all the zombie cliches in a suitably brief (only about 8 or so hours of gameplay so it doesn't outstay it's welcome) tour of all the standard zombie invasion locations.  There are rough bits granted, and it could be buggy at times.  I had at least one crash to desktop, and sometimes injured zombies would suddenly stand up many metres from where you had smashed/blasted them to.  Also there are some truly bizarre choices at times (the end credits ends on a box of cereal) and the ending was a bit of a flop, leaving me with a bit of an anticlimx as the only thing resembling a boss fight coming on the penultimate level.\n\nI will allow there are better zombie games out there.  Though if you love all things zombies and tire of the standard run and gun zombie kill-a-thon then this could be the game for you.  Definitely pick it up on sale.","June 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It has some flaws, of course, but which game hasn't them?\n\nCommands:\nCommands are quite simple (but not simplistic) and respond pretty well. I don't really understand why people complain so much about the controls, mine always worked well. Maybe people were mistaking commands (ordering your party to walk into an enemy instead of fighting it - I did it a few times). Maybe devs released a patch or something, I don't know.\n\nLMB to walk and RMB to fight. The guy you're directly controlling will keep hitting the enemy until you tell him to stop or until he runs out of stamina. Problem here are those guys you're not controlling - once you order them to attack, sometimes they keep attacking, sometimes they do it once and stop. I discovered that, most often, you give them a gun, you'll have to place an attack command for each shot; you give them a melee weapon, they'll do the job until stamina goes out\n\nCamera can be controlled with mouse or keyboard. However, the mouse can only hover the camera throughout the scenario - if you want to turn the camera (and it does 360°, to the left and to the right), you have to use the keyboard, so controlling the camera can be a little tricky. I ended up preferring controlling the camera solely by the keyboard, which is not really difficult once you get used to it. Camera can also be freely moved when you pause the game\n\nMouse scroll zooms in and out is. Problem here is that the game didn't recognize the scroll on my wireless mouse (which didn't happen on my wired mouse) - so I had to rebind it to up/down. In the end, I didn't use it much because even though the zoom in is really "in", the zoom out is not that "out", it is pretty much the FOV you'll be using anyway, so it's not that useful.  Apart from that, both wired and wireless mouse work perfectly. Keys are rebindable, by the way.\n\nThe characters you are playing with can be selected either by mouse (clicking on the character or in the hud) or by pressing F1-F4 (I'll talk about the hud later on)\n\nGraphics and sound:\nGraphics are pretty good. The story is presented via cutscenes in such a comic book style which is pure eye candy, really well done. In-game graphics are also very good - there's blood and corpses everywhere, and the dead zombies (I mean, those you sent back to death) remain in the scenario\n\nOverall sound is great - the zombies' moaning, the munching, even the doc's wheelchair makes noise when he moves. Voice acting, on the other hand…not so great. I don't know if they tried to parody old movies or if it was just bad choice, either way it didn't work. Thankfully, it only plays during cutscenes (and if you manage to blow a zombie's head off)\n\nGameplay\nIt's a strategy game, so run and gun will only get you eaten - which I soon discovered. There's a pause button ('space bar') so make use of it. Pausing and telling you're character what to do tends to work pretty well. Unfortunally you can't give commands in-a-row\n\nBe advised not to bleed and be careful when running. Zombies will smell you if you're bleeding and will hear you if you run, so they will start to chase you. Besides, running burns stamina, and you may run out of it right before a fight - and you can't fight without stamina.\n\nProblem is, zombies will not chase you forever. If you're on an open space, you can just keep walking. The zombies will start giving up on chasing you until there's only 2 or 3 left on your tail.\n\nTalking about stamina, always keep an eye on it. If your guys run out of stamina while fighting, they'll stop the fight to take a break - meaning, they will just stand there taking hits until they eventually die. Trust me, you don't want to die on this game\n\nInventory management is neat - drag and drop all the way. Items can be rearranged, dropped on the floor or  given to another character and weapons take up to 3 spaces (each character has 12 inv spaces), no issues here\n\nGame hud displays the characters you've met so far, the inventory (which you can hide by pressing 'I') and 4 buttons, each one representing walk, run, select group and camera mode. Select group means select the whole group and give them all the same order (the whole group can also be select via mouse). Camera mode 'on' means that the camera will follow the character you're controlling; 'off', that you'll have to control the camera yourself. Pretty good in my opinion\n\nAvoid alt-tab at all costs. Sometimes, when you alt-tab back to the game, your inventory is gone. I mean, it's there but you can't see it, making the game unplayable. So, if you need to alt-tab, I highly advise you to do it right after saving\n\nMicromanaging can became another issue - your party does not think for themselves, so you need to give your partners orders for every little thing, which may become a little tiring. Not an issue for me, actually, but some people just don't like it\n\nSomething I really missed is a bit more of exploration - you know, search locks, garbage cans, drawers, cabinets etc. Items are just dumped anywhere and they have a green glow - so you can't really miss them\n\nThe real problem in this game, the one that is most likely to make you stop playing it for good, is the saving system. The game doesn't allow manual save and: I) save points are oddly placed; II) can only be used once; and III) all your characters have to stand within the save radius in order to the game be saved. This, my friends, can be a pain, because if you die or if the games crashes you may easily lose one hour of gameplay\n\nHere is how the save system works: save points are represented as closed manholes. Once the manhole is used, it opens and it can't be used anymore - so you know exactly which ones were used and which ones were not. Pretty cool if there were plenty of them. However, in some levels you'll desperate cry for save points, while in others you may even not use all of them. Besides, you have to have all your crew together at the same save point for it to work - sometimes it's nice because you can have the whole group to walk through the save point and keep it for later, but if you left someone behind due to the micromanaging thing, you'd better be sure that you left no zombie behind either\n\nI don't play multiplayer games, so I can't talk about it, sorry. And I think it has any achievements, but as I don't care for them I'm not really sure\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is not, by no means, unplayable. Devs could had made a few things better, of course, and the saving system can be frustrating at times but the game does the job to keep you entertained. Zombies are slow as they should be and, for what it is, it is a good game\n\nEven though I don't recommend it getting it at full price, if you can cope with the saving system just wait for a sale to grab it\n\nAll in all, I give it a 7 out of 10 - because I really liked it and I think it worth the money I paid for it","February 26, 2014","true","17.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is A GREAT GAME! This game is AWESOME.\n\n(READ IT IF YOU DID NOT LIKE THE GAME... this is SPOILER)\n\nI was longing to play a zombie game that has slow moving yet scary zombies, and this gives me that. The environment is great, the difficulty is awesome. It doesn't throw countless zombies at you. The zombies are few, but tackling even two of them together can be dangerous. You got to keep devising plans to isolate each one so that you can kill it before another one reaches you.\n\nCONTROLS\nThe controls are a bit clumsy. But it is not impossible to get used to. I took an hour to tap the right key/button. Main things in control are:-\n- most control is mouse-centric\n- after the first level, you control two or more players. So, you have to select the player you want to act as and perform the action.\n- I couldn't read it mentioned anywhere, but it seemed like the characters got stronger in the skills you used them for, and some innate skills\n- to save the game, you need to bring all the playable characters to the savepoint (manhole)\n\ni rarely write reviews, and they are never this elaborate.

I quite enjoy the gameplay and I'm finding the controls pretty easy as well, despite complaints, however I assume these complaints were made before a patch came out, which is why the controls seem fine to me. I got the game at a great price of £2 as a special offer, and it is definitely worth it, however I'd hesitate to say whether it was worth the original price. I'd rate this game 7/10 for what it is, as I'm finding it an enjoyable experience and worth the money I paid for it.","January 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The video seems to show the same game, but there's simply no way it could, because it shows characters responding both to given commands and threats, neither of which has happened at any point during my play-time. The online mode is, somehow, even worse. The only good tool, the 'Guard Area' mode, is taken out, leaving you with no choice but to try your luck with running up to the zombie hordes and hitting them one at a time with lag, even over LAN, that makes it impossible to actually survive more than 2 zobies at the same time. Also, in multi-player, only one of my team began with a weapon, making the others stand around waiting for another weapon to show up.

You can even move the camera to see the horrors that lies ahead and plan carefully.\n\nThe atmosphere and the setting is highly detailed, especially the map props. Any fans of George A.

In fact, I had some fun with it until it became unplayable due to frame-rate issues. Not sure what that's all about, but if that never happened I would have put some more time into 'Trapped Dead'. The premise is every generic zombie movie you've ever seen, but the game could be decent if the developers fleshed out more of the ideas and if the many bugs were addressed. Simply put, there are just too many technical and non-technical issues with this game to recommend it to anyone for any price.\n\nWhat's wrong with 'Trapped Dead'? It basically feels like a beta release. The controls are terrible. The graphics are terrible. The sounds are terrible. There are frame-rate issues. The characters have no depth. The story is boring. There isn't enough player guidance. Everything just feels incomplete and in need of work. As if the developers got sick of working on it and decided to release it, hoping that nobody would notice.

I'm sorry but while I do love me some realtime isometric squad based tactics abnd the zombie story and characters seem interesting I have to say this game should be avoided. An example of a solid concept ruined by shoddy execution.\n\nI'm sorry, at this point I cannot recommend this game. v1.1. I can't, I honestly can't.  I like the premise and what it's trying to do but the execution is in a word, sloppy. The interface should not be an obstacle to the game and unresponsive controles should not be part of the challenge.\n\nWhen you sometimes have to click 3-4 times to get a character to even move, that is a recipe for frustration and disaster for while your shosen chracter will not respond the zombies around you will respond quite readily. Then there are the crashes., which are made doubly frustrating because the game uses a checkpoint system so you can lose a whole lot of progress, just because the game decided to crash. Did I mention that each save/checkpoint can only be used once per mission and there are usually no more than 4 for an entire mission? So you can't even mitigate the crash problem by 'saving frequently. It is also far too easy to accidentally drop an item from your inventory, which in the heat of a fight... can be a problem.\n\nOverall, the game needs quite a few fixes and sadly those will have to be fan/community made since the devs have pretty much said 'nope we're done, enjoy'. Understand that when the game works, when the controls choose to respond and the game doesn't bother to crash... it is a good game...these moments arem at least for me (and quite a few others), few and far between. a textbook example of a good concept and good mechanics cripppled by poor implementation and interface.","November 30, 2013","false","7.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However by the third level (prison) - I had killed roughly 60 zombies, - mostly with the baseball bat but I had such an issue controling my char during combat.\n\nI decided I did not want to play anymore when I had wounded 2 zombies with a gun.  Tried to equip my bat... my charactor threw it on the floor.  Then I picked it up and equiped it.  Clicked the zombie to hit it, but because of the messy door physics.  My Charactor decided to spin in a circle, then swing.  I yelled a profrantity, and decided I didn't want to play this game.\n\nThis is a top down, point and click style combat.  Think Fallout 1-2 combat, but in real time instead of turn based.  The controls and the camera make it feel difficult to control, open, fight, ect:  I see what they were trying to do with the game and I get it, but I did not enjoy the controls.\n\nTo be fair - I did not play it mutiplayer.... I guess it is easier when you have 4 people with crappy controls.","November 12, 2011","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately the title is marred by a multiplayer mode that appears non-functional, wonky camera controls and an exceedingly slow pace in the normal movement mode.  While the graphics are quite well done and do a good job of adding to the immersion, unfortunately the voice acting is so bad it immediately rips you right back out.  The music is an ambient and repetitive, although fitting for the slow pacing of the game.  Widescreen modes and the Steam Overlay are supported but the game controller is not.  Most frustrating about the title however is that your death will often be the result of the frustrating camera controls and not a a tactical error, and combined with a checkpoint save system almost guarantees frustration at certain challenging points in the campaign.  Altogether Trapped Dead disappoints and should only be picked up by genre collectors or die hard zombie enthusiasts.","August 26, 2012","true","0.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

The game could of lasted another 3 or 4 levels at least. The graphics are also nice and still enjoyable.

Screenshots and reviews don't do it justice, the graphics are ok, nothing outstanding but acceptable, the gameplay is simple enough ( select a squad member then click where you want him to go and which way to face him). inventory is a basic affair but you can swap items between characters. Tactics aren't too involved, mainly choosing when to run and use stamina (which you also need for melee attacks) or stand and shoot with your limited ammo. I found the best way was to lure the zombies towards a squad member then get another character behind them with a bat or, even better, an axe and then thwack 'em. First aid is administered using the doctor with med packs but these are in limited supply, pistols, shotguns, grenades, all the usual suspects are there.\nThere aren't too many pickups so ammo is scarce at the start, a few more things to find (and maybe chests etc) would've been a nice addition, levels can feel a bit sparse except for the zombies and some loot locations, instead of stuff lying around, would have given it and extra degree of gameplay. All the negatives aside it's a fun enough game if you just want some relaxed undead bashing.....always a good thing in my opinion !","November 1, 2011","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, I had to restart first mission twice to get an ending animation after reaching the car. And on and on, bugs keep on creeping on me and they're more dangerous than zombies.\n\nAlso, clumsy bad camera is something you don't want in these type of games and that is where Trapped Dead fails miserably.\n\nThese two, bugs and bad camera, are unfortunately dealbreakers and I cannot recommend Trapped Dead to anyone until it's fixed.

Screenshots and reviews don't do it justice, the graphics are ok, nothing outstanding but acceptable, the gameplay is simple enough ( select a squad member then click where you want him to go and which way to face him). inventory is a basic affair but you can swap items between characters. Tactics aren't too involved, mainly choosing when to run and use stamina (which you also need for melee attacks) or stand and shoot with your limited ammo. I found the best way was to lure the zombies towards a squad member then get another character behind them with a bat or, even better, an axe and then thwack 'em. First aid is administered using the doctor with med packs but these are in limited supply, pistols, shotguns, grenades, all the usual suspects are there.\nThere aren't too many pickups so ammo is scarce at the start, a few more things to find (and maybe chests etc) would've been a nice addition, levels can feel a bit sparse except for the zombies and some loot locations, instead of stuff lying around, would have given it and extra degree of gameplay. All the negatives aside it's a fun enough game if you just want some relaxed undead bashing.....always a good thing in my opinion !","November 1, 2011","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are delayed as are the actions.. This feels more like a turn-based game than an "action" game.\n\nThe game doesn't let you into the options menu from the main menu meaning you need to start a game for you to set up controls and you can't seem to disable the annoying "tutorial" hints which change the camera view.\n\nIf the artwork was paired with project zomboid, it'd be a great game. It's a shame that PZ didn't get these artists.","November 16, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the initial idea seems to be good, it is however poorly executed with too many tutorials cut-out forcing you to click on a continue button and a poorly implemented game interface that will make you die quicker than you should.\n\nFor a low price (like $0.30), it is not a bad buy but I would stay away from this game for more than that.\n\n","January 12","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mechanically, it's a joke.  Buggier than Skyrim during a particularly hot summer, this title is likely not worth anybody's money.\n\nWhen the game isn't lagging severely due to what can only be assumed to be an overall poor optimization, it's controls are equally unresponsive.  When the controls do respond, it starts glitching out on the pathing.  When the pathing doesn't have you running in circles, it will just decide to stop moving, at random.  The ancient Warcraft RTS games were more functional by comparison.\n\nGranting your Steam profile a few more levels through crafting five relatively cheap badges is likely the best part of this game.  It certainly was for me.  But I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it for that purpose.  The multiplayer's dead, the game's unsupported, and it's basically a pile of crap which shows how not to get sucked into a zombie survival game for zombies alone.","January 3","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
