Casual but quite stressful on later levels. Since you deploy ships instead of towers, you of course can move them around. This makes the strategy a little bit different.\nThere's a cute kind of humour and cartoon-style graphics. The controls are very easy to understand - You just use the mouse. If you like Tower Defense games you will probably enjoy this game. Although I think the price is a bit steep. 13 euro is too much. If you can pick this up at a sale with 50% discount or more - I'd say: Go for it.","December 15, 2013","true","5.2"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

It's a sort of a defense game where you set up your ships and defend/defeat the zombie enemy onslaught.  The difficulty was perfect in my opinion; it was really hard to achieve diamond rank in some levels, but not impossible. The variety of ships and characters were entertaining. It has a comic story line and feel which makes it fun to play. I recommond it.","December 30, 2011","true","29.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This can't compete with most $15 DECENT games (so I'm not even considering games that got avg Metascore of 80+).\nIt's not the worst thing on Steam, but you don't want to bother with it, it is forgettable, barely inspired, and plain simple, it is the archetype of a mobile game, not as fun as it should thou.","June 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It should not be compared to Plants vs. Zombies, since that is a much better game.  That had strategy.  Zombie Pirates is basically killing zombie ships and furiously clicking what they drop before it disappears.   A dead ship drops a parrot, which can purchase ships, grop, which heals one ship, or a bomb which can blow up an area and may destroy several ships.  It's just too hard.  Try moving ships and using strategy in your spare seconds.   While you're clicking on loot, you may miss healing a ship and it sinks, very easily.  Or you miss picking up everything, and even if you do, you may not get a strong enough fleet.  The worst are the birds which come out in flock to sink your ships, yet drop nothing.  You run out  of bombs, grog, or parrots and there's nothing to do but wait for another long load screen to try again and again.  You can purchase upgrades, but they are so expensive, it takes a ton of grinding to earn enough gold, which is a sick attempt to extend the length of the game.  It's too hard and frustrating and I quit halfway.","August 29, 2014","false","7.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManualSearch/recommended/46850/","ManualSearch","<-GLD> Admiral Baconcakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManualSearch/","404 products in account","Let's be totally up front here; Zombie Pirates both looks and feels like a game designed by someone who has never made a video game before.\n\nWhen it opens, it presents a quaint little opening where pirates destroy a person's ship and steals the owner's woman. Then, he rises from the dead because his love is too strong. Nothing special, but I understand - sometimes, you don't want to be too heavy with story. You just want a dumb little love story, and I can side with that. Our character has come back from the DEAD to save his love, because it's silly and this is a game about pirates and *zombies*. And then when you load the first level... you're playing as the pirates.\n\nWait, we're against the zombies? We're the pirates? We stole that guy's love, killed him, destroyed his ship, and now we're Chuck McPirateFace, ruler of the Seven Seas, killing off hordes of zombie pirate ships? ...Okay... I guess? The game only told us that the one zombie guy came back. Where did all these zombie ships come from?\n\nAnd the gameplay. My god, the gameplay. There's an implied grid, and you sail your ship around it. When you get close to enemy ships, you fire at them. If they get close enough, they fire at you. You can't dodge the shots the enemy shoot at you, so your only option is to stay in a sweet spot range. Each enemy drops an item which can be helpful, but ultimately it's extremely difficult to downright impossible to utilize and use an item (in which at least one of them involves getting another ship to control, giving you a strategic advantage) and also keeping yourself in the sweet spot you need to be.\n\nAnd then, the game rates you on the *number of ships you've lost*. Are you trying to make a strategy game? If this were turn-based, I could understand punishing me for losing ships. But it's real time. You can't punish someone for losing ships in real time, especially if you're already expecting me to control my main ship in real time as well.\n\nSew it all up with having to hear your main ship spit out dumb phrases ("These dead men are telling tales!"? Really?) over and over every time you move your character, and it becomes so sickeningly cheezy, and you're left with a sickly, amateur game that couldn't even keep me occupied for a friggin hour for me to review it in a serious manner. I'm disgraced to have this game in my library, and it is barely worth fifteen cents, let alone the fifteen dollar asking price.\n\nI find it funny that up above, in the game description, it seems to end with 'Zombie Pirates will send a shiver right'. The cut-off sentence just sounds like a question, and a good one. Will it send a shiver? Sure, but not from horror. Pastels do not lend themselves to horror. I shivered from the very idea that someone, somewhere spent the kind of money that could feed someone for a few days, or buy something objectively more interesting on this pile.\n\ntl;dr Avoid this game. It is not worth either your money or your time. If real-time strategy or tower defence is what you're after, there are better, cheaper games (read: Plants vs. Zombies, Sanctum).","November 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Another TD game was frustrating me, this one seemed similar, and the reviews were mixed. It turned out to be not terrible. I stopped playing for the day but then gave it a second chance the next. Yes, it's worse than Plants vs. Zombies but as a lane defense game it's not horrendous. It all goes by fairly quickly and can present challenges without being excessively difficult. The people who complained about clicking all over the screen all the time woul clearly prefer to do nothing, even though that is most of the movement in the game once you have set up a row of defense ships.\n\nI would give this game a neutral score for general gamers and say get it on sale if you like lane defense.\n\nYou might need to follow instructions on the discussion page for how to get it to work.
