I had a copy for streaming purposes on twitch and I really loved the experience with my viewers.Here is a sneek peek for you to enjoy. http://www.twitch.tv/ricgod2068/v/51787437 . Believe me when I say you will need to think some levels through before moving your cubes. I'm not done with the game yet, but I will keep you posted. It doesn't look so much like a work in progress. This was a good early access for me until now.","March 2","true","2.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

You have to split up the cubes to make them go onto buttons or platforms to get to new areas. Some levels take quite a bit of thinking and replaying to figure out. The beautiful little area's you go through and the level select menu are super well done. Other than a few small bugs, this game is pretty well made. The bugs can be worked around right now and the game will keep you interested for a bit!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jbW4FUakzZs","March 2","true","0.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The art direction is top notch and the soundtrack that accompanies Split is stunningly whimsical. I'm pretty terrible at puzzle games myself so it's going to take me a while to 100% the levels, but the challenge curve is such that I'm willing to keep going even if it's not usually my type of game.","March 2","true","1.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Even worse, some buttons do have irreversible consequences, which force you to restart the level multiple times.\n\nFiguring out the solution: This is very easy, since most levels are fairly simple.\n\nExecuting the solution: This again is very frustrtating, because it requires very tight timing and almost every mistake forces you to restart the level. It doesn't help that the controls feel clunky and as they were designed for mobile.\n\nCommented Gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6Ix0ENJUWQ\n","March 3","false","5.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

In Split, you're in control of cube with ability to split into smaller ones. Your goal is to reach doors using this power to figure out how each level works and how to pass them perfectly. And you will, don't worry, difficulty is not that hard, yet sometimes it will take you a while to solve some of them. Try not to loose parts of you on the way!\n\nAdvantages\nLevel design is good and ingenious, each level is really different, what makes this game hard to get bored of\nGame graphics are minimalistic, nonetheless are pretty and very nice to look at\nVariety of soundtrack in each level makes it even better to play through\nLevel editor is in progress, can't wait to see what community can create from it\nDisadvantages\nGame is a bit glitchy (graphic options reset after rebooting game or sometimes small cubes throw other ones into the air when they touch each others)\nCamera spins only around center of levels and in some of them, for example Stormberg or Wild Rooftoops it's hard to place it comfortably (possibility of flying camera around would be much better)\nSummary\nGame is as pleasing to the eyes and ears as it's entertaining in every single level, 100% worth getting for puzzle lovers. It might feel a little expensive, but still it's challenging enough to have ton of fun playing it and trying to get all achievements (achievement hunters - embrace, it won't be easy!). It also have a potential of a tablet game, I hope we will get an opportunity to try it out there\n\nPersonal score\n8.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 7","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Family means no one gets left behind... Lilo and Stich feels... Shelter Feels...\n\nLove this little big game!\n\nHighly recommend Split, the introspective progression I felt the more I jammed played on a lot of the triaits a comp csgo player knows all too well... frustration, rushing vs taking time and remembering sequence. I think the thing I love the most about Split 35 minutes in is that it has given me a sense of achievement, challenge and calm... in one swoop.\n\nNot an easy thing to achieve! I think a headshot in this is getting 100% of your cube family to the end!... feels like a headshot, but like a high 5 from a digital Yogi type headshot.\n\nWorth your time! challenging rewarding and intuitive! I JUST WANT IT ON MORE DEVICES!!! haha","March 6","true","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirtaptap/recommended/444860/","sirtaptap","Sir TapTap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirtaptap/","966 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a unique multi-tasking puzzle game with a lovely art style. You split your cube into up to 8 separate bits and activate switches, move bridges and other things to reach the goal. The puzzles are decently forgiving in that you can basically "skip" a level as long as 1/8th of your cube makes it to the exit, but you have to find a way to get 100% of them to perfect a level, and if you skip too many levels without perfects you can't advance.\n\nDespite the game being in Early Access it seems to be mostly done except the level editor, which sounds fun of course, but most of the single player is there and it doesn't really "feel" early access. Puzzle difficulty ramps up fairly quickly leaving little wasted time.\n\nThe one major downside I've noticed so far is performance is pretty rough. I have a 6950 (old but should be enough for this) and an i7 4770k and I have to turn almost all the settings down to their lowest to get it running at 60 FPS, it's a little under 30 at all max. Like I said  it's early access so that might improve, and it doesn't get too much in the way of things. Just note you'll probably have to play with options if your hardware isn't top of the line.\n\nI made a video as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAi1Gh26sHc\nReview copy provided by publisher.","March 7","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mechanic of splitting the cube in order to solve the puzzles is an interesting idea and the game does a good job creating puzzles that use the idea well. The puzzles are clever but are a little easy. The artwork is great. People who like these type of puzzle games should enjoy Split.\n\nWhile I think Split is a good game, it has a couple negatives at this point.\n\nThe camera could use some work since in some of the puzzles it becomes pretty hard to position the camera so you can see what you want to see.\nI don't really like the timed switches/buttons. On some of the puzzles the switches don't give you enough time which means you need very good/near perfect timing in order to finish the puzzles even if you know what to do.\nThe game has some small glitches here and there which includes the game not always recognizing when you want to move one of the cubes and sometimes your cubes get destroyed for unexplained reasons.\nAt this stage the game is pretty short since it doesn't have a lot of puzzles. It takes only around three hours or so to beat all of the puzzles in the game. I hope the final version of the game adds more puzzles.\nAt this point I think Split is a good puzzle game that can be a great puzzle game if some of these issues are addressed.\n\nIf the idea behind the game interests you and you like puzzle games, I think you will enjoy your time with Split.\n\nNote: I received a review copy but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","April 3","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
