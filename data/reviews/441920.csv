But even coming from that background, spending an average of $250-1000 annually for addons, accersories and peripherals, watching an waiting with bated breath for over a decade for a true successor to pick up the mantle of flagship Flight Simulators... yet EVEN I CAN FIND SOMETHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT DTG Flight School.\n\nI have to congratulate the hard working developers for picking up the torch and running the brutal gauntlet that the flight simming community has become, to take the abuse --undeserved-- of a selfish, entitled, over-critical and under-helpful society of miserly, withering, "armchair pilot" wannabes with nothing better to do than COMPLAIN.\n\nIs this today, as of this moment, the next best simulation platform? Is it FSeleven? FS2016? No. Of course not. It was never meant to be. IT'S ONLY $15 FOR HEAVENS SAKE! Have the whiners SEEN the prices of FS addons this last DECADE?\n\nBut does DTG Flight School show potential...? OH MY, YES. YES INDEED.\n\nI just spent my first total hour of flight time, the first few training missions, a few Alaskan Bush pilot missions and a few touch n' gos around my local real life airport... I HAD A BLAST. In fact I was surprised to find it performing almost just as smoothly "out-the-box" as my heavily tweaked FSX and P3Dv3 except with a slightly BETTER framerate! The amazing effect of the new lighting system (needs some adjustment, perhaps, but attractive) combined with Orbx scenery and higher, smoother framerate equals immersion, sweet immersion... Toss in the simple goal of racking up Flight hours that equate to real achivements and earning licenses, and now, all your flights matter, now getting back on the ground safely means something, now you care.\n\nDovetail Games still have lots of work to do until they release their full blown DTG Flight Simulator, that's a given, but shame on every poncy, 2 sentence reviewer who bails at the first glimpse of their unrealistic over-expectations dashed in disappointment, ending with, "save your money, refund requested".\n\nLet them leave, they'll never know what their missing!","May 24","true","2.5"," 378 of 426 people (89%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","89","378","426","26","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101182113/recommended/441920/","76561198101182113","Midcon 113","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101182113/","34 products in account","TL;DR Version: I love it for what it is, I'm excited for the future of the product and for Dovetail's next flight simulator, and I think it's worth the money.\n\nFull Version: DGT Flight School is, first and foremost, a new approach to flight simulation, based on the Microsoft Flight Simulator X engine, though heavily modified (64-bit support being the main modification.)  So, first things first - I'm coming from a background of a few thousand hours of flight simming that goes all the way back to subLOGIC's FS2, then on to Flight Assignment: ATP, Microsoft Flight Simulator 4, 5, FSFW95, FS98, FS2000, FS2002, FS2004, FSX, and for fun, Terminal Reality's Fly!, plus a host of combat flight simulators.  I've flown a LOT, run a few virtual airlines, and more.  So, I've been in this hobby more or less for 25 years, and that's my perspective as I write this.\n\nOn to the review.  The first thing you need to know if you're reading the forums about this product is to understand what a lot of the chatter is about.  Flight School is based on FSX, but that's no different that saying that Windows 10 is based on Windows 8 (and all the prior versions of Windows.)  Just because it's based on a prior product doesn't mean that Flight School is the next version of that product.  It's not, and that was never the intention.  Instead, it's a product designed to introduce people new to the flight simulation genre the "proper" way - that is, instead of just dumping them into the pilot's seat and letting them have at it, it strives to introduce the new virtual pilot to flying in the same way that a real pilot would be introduced to flying.  And that's the first reason I'm giving this product a positive review: with the exception of ATP, no other product has really done that.  I've wanted to see something like this for a long time - and while FSX (and versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator before that) had lessons that were available, the aim of the product was to let you do whatever you want, and if you wanted to skip the lessons and just learn by trial and error, good for you.\n\nMany people were looking to Flight School to be the "next version" of FSX since it was "based on "FSX".  Dovetail is working on a full-fledged flight simulator that will likely be close to that "next version" of FSX those people were looking for, but that's not the intention of Flight School.  Again, it's based on the FSX engine, but it's not supposed to be the "new" FSX.\n\nSo, what is it?  It's a simulator that includes two (at launch) beautifully rendered aircraft: the Piper Super Cub, and the Piper Cherokee, along with flight lessons for both a Light Aircraft Pilot's License (LAPL) and a Private Pilot's License (PPL).  There is a structure to getting these licenses - first, a series of lessons, followed by a requirement to build hours in Free Flight or Mission modes, then a skills test to wrap it all up.  This is representative of the steps a real trainee pilot would go through, and does a good job of giving you a taste of the real thing.\n\nIf you're already an experienced pilot, however, this content will not last you very long, and you'll likely move straight into Free Flight mode.  Flight School, because it is based on FSX, includes 24,000 airports covering the entire globe, and you can fly into any of them.  Here, we see an evolution of the FSX engine.  The move to 64 bit has improved performance of the sim significantly compared to FSX on the same machine.  The old default terrain mesh and auto-generated scenery has been vastly improved, incorporating textures from ORBX, a company that consistently produces very high quality scenery packages for FSX and it's variations.  That alone, as a side note, is worth the price.  I never invested in ORBX scenery for FSX due to the fact that on my machine, FSX would likely have run very poorly with it.  The improvement in the default texturing between the two is phenomenal.\n\nFor Free Flight mode there is a flight planning tool that operates quite nicely, but is a bit more limited than it might appear at first glance.  You can basically point and click to generate a flight plan, but what happens is that you're in essence just giving the GPS coordinates to fly to - if you click on a navigation aid, for instance, you don't get a flight plan that includes that navaid's radio frequency.  You just turn and fly to those coordinates.\n\nAnother area of deviation from FSX is that you are truely flying VFR - no autopilots on these planes, which again is fine with me.  The intent of the product is to teach you how to fly, not how to program the autopilot.  Yes, airliners fly mainly on the autopilot, but not by pilots with no flight time in their logbooks.  When the gizmos go haywire, you still need stick and rudder skills, and that's what this sim is all about.\n\nPotentially the most exciting feature - though currently not utilized to the fullest in my opinion - is the pilot profile, which keeps track of your progress as  you earn ratings and build time in both aircraft.  Oddly, there's not a "logbook" per se (that I can find) that lists your individual flights, but you do see your endorsements and your overall progression.  I would like to see Dovetail expand the profile to include an actual logbook so you can review the details of your flights down the road.  Or, if you really want to go all out, hop onto Amazon and buy a real pilot's logbook and keep track of it by hand.  That'd actually be more realistic!\n\nBack to the profile - I hope Dovetail continues the same profile into the future.  Soon, Flight School will be expanded to include the DA42, a twin-engine aircraft, and new lessons likely aimed at instrument flight rules.  Getting an IFR endorsement is something I'm looking forward to.  I'm also hoping that when the full simulator comes out (targetted for later in 2016 at the moment) that all those hours and endorsements come over, and my "career" in the Dovetail series continues.  I believe this is the plan but confirmation of thise from Dovetail would be nice.\n\nIn conclusion, is Flight School "perfect"?  Not by any stretch.  That was something I was totally expecting.  Having lived through the launches of all the prior versions of Flight Simulator, NONE of them was perfect at launch, and only a few of them really improved enough over their lifetimes to really be considered "done."  FSX was unique in this respect in that add-on developers had 10 years to work out all the inner workings and improve FSX on multiple levels.  I would argue, however (and again, this is directed at those who say Flight School is disappointing them because it's not the "next" FSX) that the heavily modified versions of FSX out there aren't really FSX.  Is Flight School an improvement on the base FSX package?  Of course it is, though it has a different purpose than FSX did.\n\nI highly recommend you try Flight School out - you can't beat the price, and even for a guy like me, brushing up on my VFR skills and getting a taste of what's to come is worth the price of admission.  If you're new to Flight Simulation, go for it - you're not going to go wrong, and you'll not have to "unlearn" a lot of bad habits you'll pick up if you just dive into FSX Steam Edition without any instruction.\n\nDovetail - great job, keep up the good work, and I'm looking forward to what's on the horizon!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabacus/recommended/441920/","kabacus","Kabacus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kabacus/","596 products in account","There is no conditional recommendation feature on Steam, because of this I cannot recommend, however the program can be useful to would be flight simmers.\n\nThe idea behind Dovetail Games Flight School is to give newcomers to the genre a taste of what flight sims are all about at a reasonable price. For me it misses the mark, though the price is reasonable.\n\nThe program offers the ability to gain two pilots licences by completing various tasks that form part of the basic mechanics of general aviation flying. It doesn’t give much by way of an understanding though, it is good at telling you what to do, but not as good at telling you why.\n\nThe program also offers a number of missions of varying difficulty. These are fun, but are at the same time quite frustrating.\n\nFinally the program also offers the ability to freely fly anywhere on the planet using the two (soon to be three) supplied aircraft.\n\nI have used the program for just over 9 hours at the time of writing and my overall experience can only be described as one of frustration. I have over a thousand hours under my belt with FSX:SE and FSX before it, I found the amount of information made available to the pilot prior to any task or mission lacking.\n\nSimple things, like what the heading is of the runway you are being sent to for a mission, some of the strips are very tight. If you aren’t able to set up a good approach it just makes things more difficult and frustrating.\n\nIn the lessons, you don’t get to find out exactly what you are going to do until you are trying to trim the aircraft, monitor the speed/throttle and check your heading while the instructor is also filling you in on the facts as to why you are in the air in the first place. This usually results in a failure of that particular mission/task, lots of swearing at the monitor and another attempt. At least you have a better understanding of what the objective is second or third time round.\n\nNow I haven’t been to flight school IRL, I do think though that I would receive a full briefing of what todays lesson was going to be before I got anywhere near the aircraft.\n\nIf you can ride the waves of frustration and persevere with the lessons/missions, there is a sense of achievement upon completion. If you do this, there is a good chance that you will enjoy a step up to FSX, P3D, X-Plane or DTG’s upcoming Flight Simulator, so maybe the program is really just one big test.\n\nDespite community hub complaints, I find the graphics far better than many of the available flight sims that have global coverage out of the box. Just make sure your rig comfortably meets the spec requirements and you will have access to a program that performs and looks as good as a £100+ spend on other sims for the sweet price of £11, though there is room for some improvement (clouds, sky, mid-day ambient lighting).\n\nTo summarise. It’s a cheap way to find out if you are willing to shell out substantially more on a good flight simulator. If you can put up with the programs foibles it is a good indication that this genre is for you.\n\n<TL;DR>\nIf you are just testing the water for flight simming this will put you off more than encourage you to progress. If you think it is something you really want to get into, a little perseverance will help in making your mind up.\n</TL;DR>","May 28","false","13.7"," 64 of 85 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","64","85","4","1"

Plane keeps drifting and within a few minutes I am out of time/space without any warning. OK fixed this dritfing by changing my null settings on my CH flightstick, so tried again and got as far as the instructor waffling how great a job I did etc etc, then suddenly, "woah woah you're out of space, gone too far". Wtf? At least give me warning and if I have completed it then please just stop, don't let the sim continue to it decides to screw you.\n\nSeriously, if the lessons are this strict without any warnings (no time to adjust, or have the instructor fly you back within the limits, whatever they maybe, how fun can they be to a complete newbie?"\n\n* Edit Finally completed the 2nd lesson and now up to the point of needing 2 hrs in free flight to try and complete the last lesson, adding a pause will help a lot. Other lessons do this, 2nd lesson needs it. When it detects you keep losing level flight advising the student to check null values/calibration of stick also will help.\n\nNow completed my my first solo in Flight School, I do believe we're potentially seeing the successor to FSX later when they release the full flight sim.\n\nDo not get this if you into A2A level aircraft, just like FSX/P3D the defaults aren't that great, or you're expecting your local airport to be fully accurate. Treat it like an enhanced FSX lite with lessons for people who are new to flight sim, or older hands who may never had lessons before, or indeed if you feel rusty.\n\nOverall am I enjoying it?

I am also hearing that Dovetail is planning on releasing a full fledged simulator later on this year.\n\nAnyhow, this is what this review will focus on what's there right now.\n\nPROS:\n- Easy to get started\n- Tutorial has some minor issues (too picky when you fly off course)\n- Graphics are nice and smooth for me (Windows 10, GTX 680)\n- Realism is settled somewhere between MS Flight and FSX, but that's a pro for someone who just wants to take a quick spin\n- Convers entire world with good global airport availability\n\nCONS:\n- Tutorial has some minor issues (too picky when you fly off course)\n- You should have a controller (I couldn't fly it with using a mouse, but it does work using a keyboard)\n- Realism could be better\n- Graphics are detailed in some areas, but can be a hit or miss in others\n- Only two planes (hopefully, this will be fixed in a patch soon)\n\n\nMy takeaway is that this simulator is aimed at beginners or people who just want to take a quick spin.

I got it when it was $5 on Steam (best $5 I've ever spent!). Since I began playing, I've logged over 200 hours in FSX and I've become a pretty good pilot. But I still had much to learn. So that is when DTGFS was announced.\n\nI pre-purchased the gamed a little less than a month before it was scheduled to come out (then it was moved, of course). I've been highly anticipating this game. I downloaded it onto my computer last night, and I was excited to play! My PC is about 5 years old and not a gaming powerhouse, but it ran FSX fine so I thought it could surely handle Flight School. I booted the game up, and then I got a message telling me "Your PC does not have a graphics card that can support directx11. You can't play this game on your PC. DTGFS will now shut down." I was very dissapointed. I tried everything, but it wouldn't work. I thought I had wasted $15! But then, my brother let me use his PC. It turned out that it ran DX11. I was saved!!! Lesson learned: Don't buy a game if it doesn't support my version of directx.\n\nNow the game.\n\nDTGFS is EXTREMELY UNDERRATED. I don't know about you, but I think it's a good game, and a solid effort by Dovetail Games. But you need to look at it from a different perspective. This game is NOT Flight Simulator 2016. This is Flight SCHOOL. That means you aren't going to get all the features that a full fledged flight simulator has. And that is where I see all the complaints. If you are a hardcore and experienced flight simmer, this game is not for you.\n\nFirst of all, DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THE GRAPHICS. My brother's PC is not a gaming PC at all, and I had to turn the graphics settings way down. Luckily, on low settings, the game runs at a manageable 15-25 fps. I don't care about the scenery enough that not having it period will ruin my experience. Remember, this is a FLIGHT SIMULATOR, not a SCENERY SIMULATOR. Nice scenery is nice, but it shouldn't be the whole purpose of the game. Other than that, the aircraft models look exceptional even on low settings!\n\nFor gameplay, it feels a lot like FSX. And that is a good thing. The planes fly highly realisticly, and the game works perfectly with my joystick, with most of the mapping exactly the same. I do wish I could map my own buttons though, since I had certain buttons manually assigned for the flaps, but I can't assign those buttons in Flight School. But that's not a big deal. I like the structure of the game a lot. I think it's cool how the game simulates being in an actual flight school, where racking up flight hours will earn you new liscenses. It's much more engaging than having just a series of tutorials!\n\nFinally, I like the new user interface. It's modern, works well, and it's easy to navigate. One little feature I like is how I can adjust the graphics settings during a flight so I can maximize framerate or increase the quality of the scenery based on what my location is. The new flight planning works very well and is very intuitive to the new user. I like how you can fly in and out of any airport in the entire world - a feature that's neat considering this is a $15 game and it's not the full fledged flight simulator. Intuitive elements such as the ATC and GPS have been retained from FSX, and I like having the familiarity of both of those.\n\nSeeing all the negative reviews, this game deserves more than just that. It's not meant to be the next Flight Simulator, that's coming out later this summer. This is meant to be a stepping stone for new pilots who have never played a Flight Simulator before or want to improve their skills. If you want to improve your skills or you want to get into the flight simming genre, then this is absolutely the game for you. Dovetail Games did a great job reviving the flight simming genre. Buy it, enjoy it, and ignore all of the negative reviews on this excellent little flight simulator.","May 25","true","3.9"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

FSc does not have an extensive in-game library of knowledge like FSX.  However, they take the students straight in the airplanes without any ground school lessons in an attempt to get them to try things hands-on.\n\nThe missions, at least for me, are all easy to slightly difficult.  Only one mission is a toughie and unfortunately the lessons won't prepare students well for it.\n\nThe free flight mode is much easier to access than FSX:SE, but it has unfortunately been stripped down.  You can fly VFR only and you need to use the useful in-game GPS (which has no in-game instruction explaining its use) to look up things like ILS frequencies and headings for upcoming waypoints.\n\nThe colors in the game are pretty bad compared to FSX:SE, which is a letdown when you consider that FSX was released 10 years ago and still looks better right out of the box.  Unfortunately I do not feel that the Orbx terrain add much to the visuals.  The two planes are nice to fly, and have somewhat functional cockpits.  The frame rate on my computer is good.\n\nFor US $15, Dovetail Flight School will absolutely not replace your current flight simulator if you already have one.  However, it is a challenge for newbies and a good refresher for veterans.  This game gives a glimpse of what DTG hopes they can produce by the end of this year.  Those who are ready to graduate from Dovetail Flight School and cannot wait for that new sim will feel right at home with FSX:SE.","May 29","true","30.0"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","2"

I own FSX:SE and XP10, so I've had my fair share of sim time.  So this is a "day of release" first impressions review after a whole .7 hours of playtime.\n\nWhat I LOVED!\nI was VERY happy to find that controls appear to equal to my FSX:SE version, so far I don't have to learn anything new.  My TRACK-IR works, but my Saitek radio & throttle stacks don't appear to be functional, perhaps later after I've unlocked a few missions they will become usable I hope.\n\n\nWhat was okay:\nThe graphics update over FSX really didn't impress me, sure the aircraft had a bit more detail and resolution but I also found the instrumentation much harder to read, and manipulating Kolesman window for altitude adjustment was a Beechcraft!  If it wasn't for my Track-IR, I wouldn't have been able to zoom in to read those items.  The instructor was pretty clear and adaptive to my handling of the plane.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nI ran into quite a few issues, maybe because of the Track-IR, maybe because of the number of Saitek/Mad Cat equipment I have, but on replays I had issues with brakes that wouldn't release, steering that wouldn't turn, and other various control issues that wouldn't clear unless I rebooted my computer, restarting the application failed to clear.  What really blew my gasket was the continue fails on the very first mission, you're instructed to start a 500 fpm descent on the last half of the downwind leg and you're never told to stop nor are you given an elevation to level out at.  You're not given a warning you're too low, you just fail and mission is over.  If you're not descending you are warned you're too high, but at least it continues.  And drop a notch of flaps?!  Where the heck are the flap controls and is my trainer handling them or am I supposed to be handling them because he's not stopping with the commands do drop another notch of flaps.  Communication needs a bit of improving in just the first lesson and should have already been a polished mission as this is the users very first experience with the simulation.\n\nI should probably be watching the PAPI lights instead of waiting for the instructor to say something, but as this is the first flight and they haven't gone over the PAPI approach yet.  Unless you're already know about them, the chances are a new pilot doesn't even know what PAPI means much less how to use them.\n\nSo, my early impression is that of frustration and dissappointment overall and as such I can't say I'd recommend this simulator over FSX:SE, which already has great tutorials.   Hopefully we'll see some reaction and some improvements as a result of user feedback.","May 25","false","0.7"," 41 of 69 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","41","69","5","0"

First thing I did when i booted up this game is go to the graphics settings and change the graphics becuase my computer is pretty decent and can hold up most games at 100% graphic output.

I load up the flight and am dissapointed to see im still only at less than 20FPS i get into the air.  and all i see are squares on the ground. youve go to be kidding me. low textures = huge block of a sigle texture.

In DTG you can hop in, choose your route (using a really nice routing tool) and as you go along you can expand your route. The Simulator does include the entire world, and you can land anywhere, with thousands of airports and airstrips. All in all, you can't rate the sim by its accuracy, its a $15 flight sim made to tease for Dovetail Games Flight Simulator which is coming out late 2016.\n\nFor $15, it's totally worth it.\n\nMy DTG flight school flight","May 28","true","13.5"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

A few months ago I flew for my first time on an intro flight with a licensed pilot. What I felt and saw as I soared was amazing! Afterward I was informed on what I needed to know and the steps that I will need to take to eventually earn my pilot's license.\n\nI am also new to flight simulation. Wanting to know more I've searched some amazing simulator videos. I realized that I can learn how to fly on a simulator, and that I wouldn't have to spend a whole lot of money and spend all day at the airport to learn how to fly. From what I've seen and heard it wouldn't cost a whole lot of cash to get sceneries, planes and experiences that match that of real life flying.\n\nSo when Steam first announced Dovetail Flight School I was ecstatic! I thought this was where I would start my flight school training. I've prepaid and waited 2 months and even paid more for this then any other game I've purchased so far.\n\nMy excitement was extinguished soon after I started my training in Dovetail's Flight School. I am not going to bash every single detail, but I will point out some areas that I was truly disappointed in my experience with Flight School. First, the sceneries are no where close to being realistic. I've seen videos from a few years ago that have some amazing, realistic, and accurate sceneries. Second, I feel that the flight training jumped around. On the day of my intro flight, my first 30 minutes was spent on understanding the instruments, then the preflight checks, and the takeoff. In Flight School it started you off in flying the traffic pattern. If I was completely new to flying I wouldn't have known what is a traffic pattern. So Flight School, in my opinion, is NOT for someone new and wanting to learn to fly. Finally, the AI flight instructor and ATC, are they for real! The flight instructor I just want to slap the side of his head with his constant badgering, of little help and quick to judge personality. I know it's just a game, but he just gets on my nerve. And the ATC, I find myself asking "say again" because I just can't get past the robot speech and mispronouncing of simple words.\n\nFor those who are really interested and thinking about getting their pilot's license, Dovetail Flight School is not the flight school they should start with. There are a lot of other ways to learn and get the experiences of flying.","June 2","false","18.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","10","14","3","0"

Frame rates consistently above 45 FPS.\n- Lessons feature high quality dialogue. Brought back nolstagia of my own flight school experiences when I was younger.\n- Night lighting is exquisite.\n-  ORBX's FTX Global is included ($80 value)\n- Lighting on the plane and it's cockpit is beautiful. Very fine job.\n- Flight model improvements. Stalling after prematurely leaving ground effect before adequate speed killed me -- twice. Adverse yaw correctly modeled. Stalls and spins improved.\n\nCons:\n- Lighting contrast during the day is horrible. Some of the trees look like splotchy, very dark green textures.\n- Clouds are not shaded correctly. It seems the shaded part of the cloud never takes into consideration of the Sun's azimuth.\n- Antialiasing needs work. Looks to use some kind of SMAA. We need real MSAA.\n- Cannot change the time of day after a flight has started. In fact many of the menu bar options in FSX have been removed. For better and worse.\n- No SDK for user submitted content.\n- No LOD_Radius and frame lock options in the options. Have to manually edit the fsc.cfg.\n\nOverall, I recommend this experience for newcomers into the hobby. The lessons are high quality and reminded me of my own flight school experiences. It's cheap and effective. Older members of the hobby will probably find not much value in this if they disregard the lesson portion of this product. Other simulators are more comprehensive in the free flight experience. For the flight school experience, this one takes the cake.","May 25","true","4.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","1"

It feels like a stripped down version of fsx that runs even worse.  However, you have to remember one key factor, you get what you pay for.  If, like me, you enjoy sims such as Xplane or Prepar3d, then this sim is not for you.  However, if you're looking to transition over from something like War Thunder, and are looking for a good start in the flight sim world, then I highly recommend this.  It does a decent job of explaining the basics of flying, and what you need to learn to get into the more advanced sims.","May 25","false","0.4"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","23","40","0","0"

I like the scenery though and for what you pay for this basic flight simulator it's very good.\n\n2. Cockpit instrument panels are sharp, instruments are sharp and from what I can tell so far the instruments respond realistically to attitude and directional changes with out jerkiness or lag\n\n3. I only tried one lesson so far, the flight pattern around the airfield in Prescott, and I am a real world light sport pilot and found it challenging with some good pointers from the instructor. Look forward to seeing how the rest of these basic lessons are presented.\n\nDislikes are the sky and water textures seem grainy not very high in resolution, not quite what I would expect for a new flight simulator, less pleasing in sky graphics then either FSX or Prepard3d. But really, again for the money this is far and away a great buy and should do exactly what is intended to do, make it easy for those not yet deep into flight sims to explore this type of pastime/ hobby/ obssesion, that those of us already deep in, enjoy so much.\n\nAnother possible dissapointment for some is that so far, and I may not activated every audio possibily in the menu, is the instructor gives you directives and pointers by a text readout, similar to weather and ATC text in FSX, so far the lessons do not seem to have audio.\n\nIf I discover I need to correct these first impressions as I explorer the sim futher I will later. For now I definetly recommend for those considering thier first general aviation flight sim, or thinking of taking real world flight lessons. And for my fellow long time flight simmers, a great value for the money and worth checking out.","May 25","true","5.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Got into DCS World the month after. With this experience, let me state my 75 minutes of experience on Dovetail Games Flight School.\n\nPROS:\n\n64-bit GOODNESS\nLetting you use all that RAM is a must not just in your typical AAA games but simulators that use huge sceneries can definitely benefit from this.\n\nSLIGHTLY BETTER GRAPHICS\nThis is actually a 50/50 but let me focus on the positive. The planes are highly detailed. I really like the texture. I can only imagine what the DA42 is gonna look like.\n\nLESSONS FOR BEGINNERS\nAs we all know, this game is aimed towards newcomers to flight sim and  a sort of teaser as well to DTG's Flight Simulator that will come out later this year. I only tried out 1 and went straight to free flight but I watched Squirrel's videos on Youtube. The lessons covered enough ground for new flight simmers to begin their aviation journey although some parts of the lessons are not well instructed or a bit confusing(watch Squirrel's videos).\n\nFLIGHT MODEL AND PHYSICS\nIt feels good. After all, this is modeled from FSX.\n\nPILOT PROFILE AND UNLOCKING MISSIONS\nYou put in the flight hours, you get to unlock the missions. Gives the player an initiative to learn and fly some more.\n\nREASONABLE PRICE\nAlthough I'd rather fly lessons in a full flight simulator, one can agree that you're certainly getting a good deal with DTG Flight School at its price.\n\nCONS:\n\nPRE-ORDER PROMISE\nWhen I first saw their announcement on Steam, it got me excited. A possible predecessor to FSX is coming and you'll get a DA42 if you pre-order. Cool. Let me pre-order that. Announcement said April 24 or 25(can't remember) was the release date. Come that date, no game. WTH?! Got moved by a month. I seldomly pre-order but this was the first I got a pre-order that got delayed. Can't do nothing but wait until May 25 now. Lo and behold, no DA42. Even that is delayed. JUST GREAT.\n\nUI NEEDS A BIT OF WORK\nThe UI for DTG is certainly good but some elements of it don't add up. The action button shows up in upper left corner and if you hover over it, it shows the action at the bottom right part of the screen. I also noticed that changing key mapping is somewhat "hidden". When you go to settings you would have to choose from a drop down menu in "Control Settings". There could've been easily a separate panel for keyboard mapping.\n\nBUGS\nExperienced two. One was using 'S' where one view is just going a screen that goes crazy. Another is the ATC ok'ing your approach then after turning off your engine after landing the ATC will say you're not cleared to land. LOL!\n\nUGLY PANELS\nI can't believe what I saw when I saw it. The 2D panels from FSX even looked more detailed and better. The 2D radio comms from both the default aircrafts lookedl ike they were in alpha. Seriously, check it out.\n\n\n\nOverall, this game and the upcoming Flight Simulator shows promise. But I don't recommend this for flight sim enthusiasts. Newcomers are getting a reasonable product for a reasonable price. I would have to refund this for now and wait for their FS later this year.\n","May 25","false","1.3"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","29","52","3","0"

It would be like reviewing "Fifty Shades of Grey" based on my 20+ years of experience in watching movies ;) Instead, I will review the product after I actually tested it. Before i wrote this review I unlocked all the achievements that did not require spending ridiculous amount of time hand flying a poorly designed aircraft. But, for my tests to be effective, I completed all the missions and both flight training programs. So I hold FSc LAPL and PPL licenses. That forced me to fly some time in free flight mode... which in turn allowed me to know both planes a little better. It also got me acquainted with the FSc flight planning... In short - now I understand why achievement statistics are so bad when it comes to any achievement that requires more than couple of minutes to unlock.This is a short version. For longer - go to my blog and check if FSc is the best sim of this century ;)\n\nFull review at: http://c-aviation.net/review/dovetail-flight-school-best-sim-century/","June 5","false","22.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think it is great to see DTG trying to improve upon FSX. At this stage the game is only at v1.0.xyz, and I hope that DTG will continue to put a lot of effort into improving upon this attempt.\n\nMy First 3 Hrs of Game Play:Installation: Installation through steam was simple (though it may be a farily large downlaod, for some). Upon initial launch, the game spent a few minutes generating scenery file indices. Overall; No Probs.\n\nPilot Profile Creation: I'm South African; When it came to picking my nationality during this stage, I only had the option to select "Africa". Many European countries, and America had thier actual countries as options. WTF... What about RSA :/ ?? Overall; No Probs.\n\nGraphics: It was a jittery experience at times; Not unflyable, but does require some attention from the developers. The scenery, I thought, was quite nice, no issues there. The 3D aircraft models were pleasing to the eye, well detailed, and had legible flight guages even at lower graphics settings. As for the flight model; This may require some tweaking/calibration in the settings (which is possible) to suit ones personal preference.\n\nUser Interface: I noticed one, or two spelling errors (Profile statistics -> Achievements list). Overall; Quite nice, easy to navigate, and fairly intuitive.\n\nFlight Planning: Great! Shows airspace descriptions on mouse-over. DTG does need to update the airports and airfield database though, many of the South African aerodromes (those in FSX) operating a decade ago, are either not operational today, or their names and/or ICAO codes have changed.\n\nIn-Game: I did do about 30min of free flight, I did all the LAPL lessons out of Waltham Flying Club (based in England), and I flew the mission, "At a Stretch".\nThe lessons did feel a little bit rushed. It would be better, I think, for new flight simmers to have a bit more time to carry out the maneuvers during a lesson, in order to get a proper feel for the aircraft.\nThere is no explination of the basic physics/principles of flight, nor details of the maneuvers to be performed during a lesson, either before or after the lesson. As DTG has designed this game to be a "Flight School", I think that at least a link to the wikipedia descripiton of the subject material shoulld be provided, if not proper documentation in-game.\nFlight Controller: I used the Saitek X52 Flight Controls. When the throttle was set to 0%, the aircraft engine died. I've not had this happen to me in other flight sims before, and I'm not sure if it's correct. I thought it was actually pretty cool though, because it seems like it could be a plausable situation.\n\n\nMissions: I only flew the "At a Stretch" mission. I think that missions could, quite possibly, be the most exciting part about DTG: Flight School, for me. Admittedly, I only got this mission right on the fourth try (Mix: 30%; RPM: 1500; Maintain Alt. Until Final), but it was really fun! It would be nice if DTG would include a map/briefing of the mission area before dropping the player into it, though.\n\nConclusion: DTG: Flight School shows a lot of promise, and I think that experienced flight simmers can have a lot of fun flying in it.  I do not think it will be the easy experience, for new flight simmers, DTG was aiming for, but maybe I'm wrong. The game does still require a lot of work and fine tuning which I hope DTG will address in regular future updates, and of course in their, "DTG: Flight Simulator" due for release later this year.","May 24","true","9.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

For anyone who is looking for a clickable cockpit, you are in the wrong area! If you want full clickable cockpit (mostly) then I'd consider X-plane 10 or even FSX. Even though this game is a really close if not copy of FSX don't let it fool you, it runs like and pretty much is a clone of FSX without all of the goodies we have to choose from; from DLCs and such. Starting out with only two planes is really limited, and not having them fully clickable is a stab to the foot. But I'm sure they do this for a reason. If you want a good general aviation simulation get X-plane, if you want a good study combat sim get DCS and one if it's modules.

It feels like a beta more then anything.\n\nWhat it does right: The airplanes feel good and with the right setup the free flight system can be lovely, mechanics wise its good.\n\nWhat it lacks:\n\n1. The land graphics are reused in every single part of the world which breaks emersion for me. When I fly over Cancun I should not be looking at pine trees and english conuntry side.\n\n2. The lessons are incredibly picky as to what they want but offer little to no coaching to fix minor issues like listing to the right or left and then you just fail... the thing I hate is not being able to skip the cut scenes or coaching after I have heard it four times. I almost land the thing slip 5 mph below for example and I have to start the whole lesson again! This sucks.\n\n3. Only two planes at relase and they are basicly the same plane, doing long haul flights in a cub is nay impossible unless you want to invest the time.\n\n4. The GPS graphics are from 1999 and many of the assets are right from FSX it does not bode well that the full game later will be any different then FSX with add-ons.\n\nall in all is it worth 15$ Yes... but I won't be investing in the full game later because I feel this is basicly the same old FSX which I already own.","May 24","false","7.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

After 15 Hours flying time i try to do that.\n\nDon`t get me wrong, i like that DTG is investing in the future of flight sim. But this product "DTG Flight School" is a fail in my eyes.\n\nI try not bash it, but english is not my native language and the negative impressions weight more.\n\nShort version:\n\nDTGFS is just like a Mission Pack from a modified version of FSX (modified worse?) with ugly graphics and loads of bugs, and less features.\n\nThe aim to attract new people to Flight Sim will not happen with this. More likely that they are scared away now. The "Flight School" or flight training element doesn`t succeeded.\n\nHere is why\n\nPro`s:\n\n- Engine Sound\n\n- Airport database updated? (at least for some airports)\n\nNeutral`s:\n\n- Iced Windshield ( but only during mission, couldn`t reproduce during free flight)\n\n- Aircraft graphic - Not too bad but not what i expected. MS Flight aircraft -with Cockpits;) - were way better\n\n- Flight Planner - not enough features for a decent flight planning. More or less only A to B selection.\n\nCon`s:\n\n- Controls configuration - Took me almost one hour, not beginner friendly, not even for "professionals". Too much commands, most of them didn`t even work, hard to configure. UI tricky.\n\n- AWFUL scenery/objects and sky/cloud graphic (unless the aircraft itself) I won`t go into detail. It`s just not what to expect in 2016.\n\n- Bugged "Training Lessons" - Different orders per voice/text. Little margin for errors. No good introduction. NOt suitable for real beginners into aviation. Aviation basics are not explained really.\n\n- Cockpit not fully functionable\n\n- Trim controls too coarse\n\n- Missions - I love missions, but most of the DTGFS missions are very short,clumsy and (opposite of fanciful) + also bugged.\n\nI cannot resist to compare it with MS Flight. Which was -in my eyes- the most advanced "out of the box" Flight Sim, despite the missing features and issues.\n\nIt had better graphics, better performance, better (if not the best) Flight model, great missions.\n\nYes you can get there with FSX or P3D with loads and expensive add-ons. But thats not the point.\n\nI just hope that the full DTGFS Simulator later this year has nothing to do with DTGFligthSchool. Because they made everything wrong except the 64Bit DX11 portation.

There is no AA at all. What I see is a very bad picture of default FSX... Settup- and control menus are aweful, I'm missing lots of settings and the setup from menus is very unpractical. I notice problems with starting up, screen stays either white or black and nothing is happening. Looking at the file structure, I see a stripped down version of original FSX, it doesnt seem like a newly written simulator to me, just another revamp of FSX that doesnt look that well (compared to default FSX) and is very unpractical to work with.\nCoulds dont move, raindrop are just hanging in the air, they're not falling, or moving in any way. Creating a second cockpit view window for a panel view on my second monitor crashes the program.\nFor me to start using this sim, it would need a lot of changes, and I mean a LOT of changes! To start with a proper userinterface, 2016-worthy graphics, a color/contrast settings menu and propper anti alliasing. After seeing this, I'm almost longing for DTG's default FSX:SE, if I didnt remmember that well why I shoved it aside in the first place.\nFor this sim to get even up date with FSX:SE, it doesnt need changes, it needs a complete rewrite.","May 25","false","2.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

If you want a beautiful sim, this is your choice. From the graphics and performance pov, it's the best sim ever. Well, there haven't been a lot lately, but this brings me to point 2...\n2. It's very hard to make a good flight sim, especially one including the whole world. When Google Earth will look like NYC everywhere in the world without taking 300TB on your PC we'll have something to talk about.\n3. The controls and physics feel real. With the weather conditions and all... It's really a sim (unlike X-plane who claim to have the realest physics but IMHO they don't). So if you wan't to feel what it's like to control a plane, this is your choice.\n4. I like the lessons. Easy step by step basics to people who never played a sim.\n\nNOW, I do have a couple of remarks for improvement:\n\n1. Considering it's 2016, it's kinda disappointing how obvious it is that it's based on MFS. This really is an improved MFS like some said, in which many of us spent thousands of hours (me personally 2002, 2004, X, and it feels like almost the same game many many years later). The direction of adapting dotays technologies is great, but looks like too much is re-used.\n2. I hope to see more planes in this game, not the next. I bought this game. I'm glad to be part of this interesting POC but I'd like to get a little more than 2 small Pipers without even auto-pilot.\n\nBottom line, it's a nice game to try if you're a simmer, or maybe wait for the real thing (although it's only 15$).\nIf you're new to flight sims, this is the BEST to start with.","June 5","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not exactly in the market Dovetail Games is targeting, in that I am a flight simmer, but not a rank beginner. But I only really got into flight simming in a big way six months ago, so I'm still enough of a newbie, I think, to somewhat appreciate what DTG Flight School has to offer.\n\nSo far I have done three lessons and a short free flight. (You actually have to do at least three hours of free flights to unlock the checkride at the British flight school, which offers the most basic lessons to start you off.) Here are some initial impressions:\n\nFirstly, the frame rates are pretty ordinary for me, and I initially had very choppy performance, even with the settings turned down to Medium High. But when I turned off anti-aliasing, this seemed to help. Even at my lower graphic settings, the Orbx scenery still looks very nice indeed.\n\nPerhaps the experience I have built up in other flight sims (FSX, P3D V3 and X-Plane 10) helps, but I found the first three lessons relatively easy to pass. However, the instructor doesn't explain much about the principles of flight (although I realise that with absolute beginners, you have to keep things fairly simple at first). In the FSX Learning Center, there is a Lessons tab that includes "Ground School" articles. The very first article (so presumably aimed at beginners) explains things like how thrust increases lift, drag decreases it and so on. I found this quite useful when I was trying to figure out the basics of flying. Even if the instructor doesn't want to go into these sorts of details, it would be good to have some "Ground School" articles like the Rod Machado ones in FSX to help give people a more thorough grounding in flying fundamentals.\n\nSpeaking of the instructor, he can tend to "nag" a little bit. I don't need to be told QUITE so often that I need to descend to 1,000 feet or increase/decrease my speed to 90 knots or whatever. Otherwise though, he does quite a good job of explaining basic skills like trimming and using power and pitch to control airspeed.\n\nThe free flight mode came as a bit of a shock to the system after what I'm used to in FSX/P3D, and even X-Plane (which I don't find nearly as intuitive for flight planning as FSX or P3D). It does not appear as though you can start your flight parked at a gate. There is also no Navlog, as far as I can tell, and no Kneeboard either, two features I like a lot in FSX and P3D. Also, it appears as though the game is designed for VFR flying only. You can't do IFR flights, it would seem. So there's not much ATC guidance, or working out beacon frequencies for your route, or suchlike. You're on VFR rules only. But I guess the instrument rating stage of flight training is beyond the scope of this particular game, which concentrates on the "bare bones basics" of flying.\n\nOne change that I find completely unnecessary and frankly inexcusable is the pilot and ATC voices. They sound like robots! Were the DTG designers smoking something illegal when they decided it would be a good idea to make the ATC and pilot voices sound like a singer with really bad autotune? Because I can't believe that whoever made that call could possibly have been in his or her right mind at the time. Please, DTG, fix these voices up, because they're a huge step backwards from not only FSX and P3D, but even X-Plane with its deeply flawed ATC! Interaction is otherwise just like in FSX though, with the same menu-driven system.\n\nNot everything is like FSX though. For example, when pressing the F10 key, which takes you to the 2D panel in FSX or P3D, I was startled to end up in the overhead view. So it looks like 3D VC cockpits only. There are no autopilots in the planes either, but then the aim of this game is to learn manual flying, and with proper trim a little GA plane will just about fly itself anyway. But forget about doing ILS landings or anything of that sort (which again comes under instrument flying, a bridge too far for this game).\n\nI have not yet tried any of the missions, so cannot yet comment on those. I might update this review when I do.\n\nOverall, I think this game is reasonable for the market it's aimed at, but there is still room for improvement, especially with the ATC/pilot voices and also perhaps in providing more information with written articles à la the "Ground School" material in FSX. Those of you who, like me, are used to the more sophisticated sims like FSX and P3D may find this game a bit lacking in terms of things like advanced flight planning, radio navigation, ILS landings and that sort of thing. But remember it's VFR only and aimed at beginners. That doesn't mean more experienced virtual pilots can't get something out of this game though. Sometimes there's no harm in going over the basics, and the game is good for practising your manual flying skills and VFR flying generally. The various achievements are good fun.\n\nSo on balance, I recommend this game. I will definitely be playing it some more, but I hope DTG refine it a bit and listen to the constructive feedback while ignoring the tidal wave of bashing, some of which may be merited, but much of which is a bit on the harsh side. Because it is aimed at beginners though, you can't use it for IFR flying. But for practising your VFR flights and manual flying generally, it's decent enough.","May 25","true","2.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I have almost 60k hour logged, I use flight simulators for more than 22 years now, you can search for "jari jr." and you will find ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s about me. I deleted my youtube channel and created another one just for simming (since the older one had some WoW videos and stuff). And btw, i'm also a fs developer.\n\nOk, here is my "list" of failures.\n\n- MS ESP again? Seriously? Do you really believe dovetail can do anything better? Their FS:SE version is the same as the old FSX, with almost no improvements at all. In fact, my FSX:Accel looks 10x better and you can check my youtube videos if you don't believe it. And no, my videos are not edited at all. In fact, I have a support page where I help people to improve the fsx graphics\performance.\n\n- Lack of creativity is strong with this one. You have a LESSON with an engine failure, seriously? This is not supposed to be a lesson, but a mission. The lesson should be like you have a simulated engine failure and you are not allowed to use throttle. If you use, you FAIL the lesson. But in this mission, you cant land in the airport at your 3 o'clock because you have to fly NE.. and there are no fields there. Also, if you try to land in a road, you get a BUILDING CRASH.. and no, there are no buildings \ lightpoles at all. And a "flightschool" where in the FIRST mission you already start with the instructor starting up the plane for you and not teatching you about mixture\prime\prop\fuel selector valve and anything else, seriously? In conclusion: this is exactly like FSX:Accel with missions. TBH is worse... you have waaaaay more missions and interesting things in the old simulator.\n\n- Lack of aircrafts... its pathetic. Seriously, what the heck is the view point? In a J3 you CANT see the runway if you're on the ground, you have to use your peripheral vision to taxi and also use your differential brakes to steering the plane. In the DTS J3, you can see anything because your eye point is waaay to high.. I mean, WAY to high. The gauges.. omg, the gauges.. looks like FS98. Same as the Cherokee.. no intrument illumination, only red flood lights. The radios looks like a freeware gauge available on avsim. The landing lights don't illuminate the ground at night.. we don't have even the white-coned fs2004. The flight dynamics are reeeally bad. And only two planes, seriously? Let me understand... so you have only 2 planes, with some missions and some "lessons".. and why only two planes? Let me guess... MICROTRANSACTIONS... hell yeah! If you want other planes with missions and lessons guess what? FU and give me money!\n\n- The textures.. omg the textures. The ground textures, the sky, the clouds... are just bad. The performance even worse. What a shame\n\n- "No engine missions".. oh... I think I already saw that.. do you know that game called FSX Acceleration? Yeah, the Boeing mission... I remember that.\n\n- Free Flight is a joke... start with a running engine on the runway ready for takeoff... seriously? wow.. what a nice "Flight School" trainer. Also.. in FREE flight you need a route (they called flightplan) so the amazing system can give you points and steam achievements. And btw, the achievement system is not working also... I already completed some of them and untill now they're locked.\n\n- The scenery... omg the scenery... the colors, the shadows.. everything is a mess!\n\nI can keep going.. but cba. This is just bad as the MS Flight. Nice design, fail execution.\n\n\nTLDR: Lessons, missions, planes... everything is so pathetic. Don't bother, seriously.","May 24","false","3.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

I owned FSX long before it became available on Steam. I also have P3D, so i've done my share of simming and I still do. I believe some folks didn't quite get what DTG FS suppose to be. It's suppose to be very easy and user friendly entry for complete newbies, for anyone who wanted to try virtual flying. And IMHO, DTG FS does it really good. It's a cut out part (i agree that a very small part) from FSX that uses current technology like 64 bit and DX11. But still you can fly all over the world, there are hundreds of airports, various seasons, weather, time of day. I mean that's huge and the game costs only 15$. It's a steal if you ask me.\n\nI can't understand how anyone can say that stock FSX looks better than this. It sooo does not! I know some folks experience some issues and i hope DTG will resolve all of them. I haven't noticed any so far. The game looks awsome (it's using ORBX terrain) and runs great on maxed out settings (i5 3570, GTX 970 and 8GB RAM).\n\nI'am loving it. It's so nice to get back to basics and just fly the Cub. I know that that the full Flight Simulator to be realased later this year needs to have much, much more than this. And i hope it will. But for now, if you want to check if virtual flying is for you, DTG FS is the best place to start. Very friendly UI, very easy to use lessons and a free flight mode can keep you busy for many, many hours.","May 31","true","12.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This game, which uses the FSX engine, fails to capitalize on that strength and does very little to help introduce a new user to the world of flight sims, whether it's FSX, Prepar3d, or any future flight simulator DTG may release.\n\nThis game's shortcomings fall on the lack of airplanes available, and the lack of airplanes means a lack of skills a pilot will develop.  Starting users off with the Piper Super Cub and Piper Cherokee are an excellent way to get a new user flying and to teach them the basics, but there is only so much you can do with these planes.  Once you master them, that's it.  There are no additional planes (or lessons) that will teach you how to fly with IFR, how to navigate with NDB's, how to operate an autopilot, how to land using ILS, or even how to fly an airplane that has a glass cockpit.  There is a Garmin GPS unit included with each airplane, but this game doesn't teach you how to use that either.\n\nThe other problem is with the flight planner in free-flight mode, which doesn't allow you to do much planning with it.  Sure, you can plot a route from one direction to the next, but again, this game doesn't give you the tools to properly plan a flight.  For example, if you want to navigate by using VOR, a compass isn't included to help you determine what radial you should be using to set the OBS on your VOR indicator.  Knowing how to fly stick-and-rudder is an important skill, but knowing how to get yourself from A to B is equally important.  Without proper flight planning tools at your disposal, the free-flight portion of the game is useless and does nothing to help a pilot hone their skills.\n\nThe missions are the only bright spot in the game, as they are short enough to keep you entertained, and they do have challenges that force you to think outside the box.  But, I think it's a mistake to not have the time spent flying these missions count toward the minimum flight time needed to qualify for a license.\n\nThis game could've been much greater than it is, but the lack of lessons to help develop a pilot hurts this game more than the graphics quality that others have complained about.  For what you're paying for this game, you're better off buying a few e-books on Amazon or searching the the internet for guides that flight simmers and real-world pilots have written if you want to learn how to fly.","June 2","false","68.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

When I attempted (more than once) to use this program, my 23" HD monitor at full screen and high graphics was just too small to render the instruments (which would not light with "Control L or L" and almost alwqys didn't know my position on ramps and runways (the yellow lines were very faint).  Result, disaster every time.  I can't even get close to obeying my "instructor" on LESSON ONE!  So, being the patient man I am (NOT), I'm just going to use MFS and fly around aimlessly, landing wherever I see a runway (gotten pretty good at that even in a P-51!).  That IS fun, but this school obviously requires I have a much larger monitor (or reduce resolution - a crime in my book for sims).  My joystick is a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro and yet the Dovetail guide provides little or no info on how to configure the multiple buttons at my disposal.  I left X-Plane some time ago because it was way too complicated.  I hate keyboard flying and I'm going to leave this program unless there is a savior out there that can straighten me out.

I notice that most of the negative comments are in reference to scenery, planes and the like. But this is a Flight School. Therefore it would make sense to make comments about these aspects. I have even noticed that one person bags the product and stated he will only fly some other sim, but keeps posting flack on this forum. I guess this shows what some peoples real motives are.\n\nFor me, I would rather be positive and encourage Dovetails efforts and help them even in a small way, to improve.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irafos/recommended/441920/","irafos","Irafos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irafos/","91 products in account","Here's my impression as of the first 60 minutes of gameplay...\n\nBefore anything, the screenshots are not accurate. The planes look about the same, but everything else is sugarcoated. Now that that's out of the way, lets move on...\n\nThe game does not have a lot to offer in its current state. There are some lessons that you can play through, yet the AI "instructor" is painfully buggy. As a certificated private pilot in the U.S (with an instrument rating), I had trouble understanding what it wanted me to do, even with the insight into what the lesson was trying to achieve, and therefore "failed" some of the early lessons.\n\nThen there are missions that you can do which are more aptly entitled scenarios that involve basic flying and landing skills. Fine. Nothing on the level of what stock FSX or addon mission packs offer, but it's a different game.\n\nAs to the looks, well, it looks like a slightly more updated FSX VFR simulator. Veterans of the Microsoft FS series will recognize the ATC interface, cockpit interface, etc. The mouse-over hints look the same, and though I enjoy FSX to this day, I was hoping for something just a little more different. The game's visuals are better than FSX, though the textures and scenary leave a lot to be desired in a game being released in 2016. I'm not someone who is shallow when it comes to games, especially sims, but come on, there's a certain level of expectations that need to be met. I have not had the crashing, frame-rate drops, or any graphical issues that other reviewers are complaining about.\n\nThe planes themselves look nice; DTG did a good job on the models. As far as I can tell, the flight physics are pretty decent (it's the FSX engine so I mean...). The cub feels a little bouncy and overpowered, but hey, whatevs. The cherokee performs nicely... and that's about it. Two planes.\n\nSo let's get down to the nitty gritty. Was I expecting more? Yes. This game is supposed to be a tech demo of sorts for the full fledged flight simulator that DTG is releasing later this year. This game should have been polished and clean as a whistle to demonstrate one thing to the flight simulator community... There is something better than FSX coming... This was not accomplished. In fact, i'm not really to sure what DTG was hoping to accomplish with this game at all. I know it's only $15 USD ( or however much in European monies), and i'm not harping on the lack of content. The game has about as much content as you would expect for $15. The point is that there is no indication that what DTG will release will be better / different than FSX... and to the flight simulator community, which has a literal network built around the aging collosus that is FSX, there's little reason to change.\n\nBefore I wrap this up, the game does have a pretty UI, if a little bit un-intuitive. The flight planning is also waypoint based and doesn't really use NAVAIDS. As in, you can put a waypoint over the top of a NAVAID, but it displays as wpt 1, 2, 3, etc. rather than SWO VOR, etc.\n\nI will not be refunding the game (which is why I am giving it a thumbs up), as I love flying and i'm interested to see what changes are made (if any). Till then, i'll continue to putter around in my tail dragger around KSWO.

Yes, the game has many bugs but it is new and it is their first flight simulator and I now think that there is lots to come from this game.\n\nPros:\n-Good if you want to learn\n-DX11 is good\n-Easy flight planner\n-Good looking menu\n-Aircraft design is kind of good but does need improving\n\nCons\n-Most textures are from FSX\n-Poor optimization\n-Low FPS around big airports\n-Lots of bugs\n-The game is called Flight School but there are less missions in this than FSX","May 24","true","2.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Before I dive into my review, I should state that I have played FSX with most of the scenery DLC installed and have put quite a few hours into that game, so let's get started. Pros DTG Flight School gets quite a few things right, such as having training, free flight, and missions all separate from each other, which allows you to learn how to fly if you are new, fly anywhere in the world (except for less populated areas), and challenge yourself in missions. Cons This game does have some flaws however, as it is still not finished. The scenery is great in urban environments, but is severely lacking in areas such as forests or plains. The instructor in the training missions is also another issue with the game, as he does not always give the best instructions and can be quite annoying and confusing on training missions where you may have done a step wrong. There are not many aircraft now, but DTG plans on adding more as the game becomes more developed. This game also has an issue of very low framerates on ultra, as my 980ti/i7 6700K only gets 24 fps, but does not often drop below that.Conclusion Overall, this game is okay for what it tries to accomplish, but unless you are a fan of the flight sim genre, I would reccomend waiting for a sale or until the game is more fleshed out and fixing the "cinematic" framerates.\n!YOU WILL NEED A JOYSTICK TO PROPERLY PLAY THIS GAME!","May 26","true","3.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You get the whole world to fly in and it looks great. The performance is still not perfect but far better than FSX and most crucially the two aircraft included are (although not every switch is 100 percent functional) absolutely brilliant quality and look among the best I have seen. Honestly you can pay much more than for this whole sim to get just one lower quality fsx add on if you're not careful. The lighting is an exciting change that probably needs a few tweaks and the cockpit shadows and textures just look fantastic.\n\nI've done just a few missions and they have been great fun although here is the thing to remember. This is called flight SCHOOL. It's not meant to be the full simulator! So yes the missions might seem simple to long time FS fans. But they have been put together with care.\n\nThe user interface was a pelasant surprise. Drawing out a VFR route on the chart and having it pre loaded into the GPS, all very simple and makes for some enjoyable flights in the great scenery.\n\nSo if you have a full FSX/X plane setup then yes this will not compare for what you can do, but it does provide an interesting set of missions in some great GA planes at a nice price point. For newbies to flight simming then this is ideal.\n\nJust IMHO the real test for this developer and product is the way additions are handled (new aircraft/mission/scenery). If it gets too expensive to expand the experience then yes it may offset the benefits, but for now this is a reasonable package. It perhaps could be seen as a sort of demo for what the future can bring to flight simulation at home.","May 26","true","1.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Trim, climb, descend, turns, instruments  all explained for beginners. For experience simmers go elsewhere.  Good place to start before moving on to FSX or Xplane or Prepar3d or even DTG flight simulator later this year.\nThis should not be compared to a fully featured sim as it is just for teaching the basics which it actually does reasonably well. It allows you to fly anywhere in the world in different weather and also has some entertainment and teaching value with the included missions. It even spins which default fsx and xplane do not do!\n\nIgnore the negative comments - they are from experienced simmers who want to show off how superior they are because they have sims that cost many times what this does. To put this in perspective I have FSX, Xplane and thousands invested in Prepar3d but I can see the value in this starter product rather than childish bashing of it which is populer these days. Yes it has problems graphically that need to be patched but it runs well and allows easy access to simulation and training without spending hours reading setup guides and trying to get into the elitist club that is flight sim forums.","May 25","true","62.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Why, I do not quite understand. Let's go through the things I think is important to mention.\n\nOk, so this is a Flight School, not a full scale flight sim. Therefore keep in mind that this game is aimed for those new to flight sims. Considering that, Dovetail Games have done a good job. It includes two planes (one more coming for free in June) that are good planes to start flying in to learn the basics. As this is based on the Microsoft flight sims, it feels very similar to that. In this Flight Schools you got lessons and missions but also free flight so you can practice what you learn.\n\nEverything looks good compared to what else is on the market, not saying better but good. To make for example FSX look really good you would have to spend money on scenery add-ons, so looking at the price of Flight School I am not disappointed.\n\nSome people say it is unoptimized, and maybe that is true for cheaper/older PC's, but for me (on a decent system) it runs smooth. This is not expensive so it is worth it.","May 24","true","7.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","2"

The night lighting, while amazingly better than that of FSX, is quite sparse when flying near a city, and lights emanating from houses start showing up only when you are flying right over them.

Not that bad as you think, but not that good as you expected. Just think Dovetail Games release a small 'flight teaching game', not a full flight simulator.\n\nPros\n+ High improved performance than FSX Original. I fly over Paris in low altitude at 50FPS average in High setting(1920x1080) in this game. Which over double FPS than hardly optimized FSX:SE in similar condition(FSX:SE+Orbx Global/Vector/HD Tree+REX4, If my memory is correct, result was 15~20FPS in same situration).\n+ Well made UI especially Flight Planner.(very good for Flight Simultation newbies) Looks clean and easy to use.\n+ Good prices consider the contents. Devs want to make a 'small Flight Simulation game which teach to fly small aircraft', consider this. I think price is acceptable.\n+ Well designed aircraft.\n\nCons\n- GPS crach bug. I don't know why this happens. Need to fix it ASAP.\n- Too small improvments on graphic except optimize. Basic graphic were close to FSX+Orbx Global. Ground Autogen, Cloud, weather effect... they didn't seem any improvement from FSX's one. Definatly Not a 'modern graphic' and either 'improved from FSX's one'.\n- Land data were just reuse of old FSX's one. Seoul didn't have 2 islands, only one and that one islands has wrong shape. Why they just reuse it?\n- Sometimes graphic seems wired due to extreme saturation. Looks odd.\n\nConclusion\n* Good for Flight Simulator newbies. Not for hardcore players.\n* Not that bad game as you seem on steam's review. But not that good as flight simulation players were expected.\n* Want to play a new Flight Simulation? Don't buy it. No modding, No ATC, No big airplanes in this game. That thing release at fall. It's just a small scale game which concentrated to teach fly a small aircraft.\n* Worried about next flight simulator because they still reuse many old graphic part of FSX. I know good graphic dosen't means good game but it's too old.\n\nWho recommend to buy\n* Want to play a good light aircraft simulation on cheap price\n* Want to see 'What DTG(Dovetail Games) do for next game'.\n\nWho didn't recommend to buy\n* Want to buy a full contents Flight Simulator. It released at fall.\n* Who plays P3D with Orbx Global add-on.

I'm an hardcore flightsimmer, 22 years old and 16 years of simulation (i started on FS4). I got a 5000h record on IVAO and 2000 on VATSIM. A 30 000+ total on FSX and i'm pretty sure that, every simulator combined (DCS, Condor, Falcon 4, X-Plane), i'm close to 40 or 50 000h of flying. It's been 1 year that i've really slow down simulation, so it was a renewal for me. A way to see where the market was going on and if there was any improvement.\n\nDo the graphics are bad ?\n\nNo. Yes, the contrast is horrible (the same i've found in P3D and X-Plane 10, i hate it) and the clouds are uglier than FSX's. But the autogen is way better (waaaaaaay better) and ground textures also (especially at night). Planes are good looking, and more realistic, relatively speaking to what FS's previously offered.\n\nPlus, the first two problems are easily fixed.\n\nHow much more realistic ?\n\nNot really that much compared to FSX. Overall feeling is the same, and aircraft.cfg didn't change one inch. But failures are slightly better managed now.\n\nBuggy ?\n\nNot at all on my PC, but there's report saying that yes it's buggy and even laggy. Didn't have any of these two problems.\n\nIs the content up to the price ?\n\nIt really depends.\n\nMissions are very short (some even 1 minute), and there's only 9 of them. There are a little bit more lessons. But not that much. Though, lessons are very good, and missions are realistic. Overall the content is good but it lacks of it.\n\n+ There's only 2 (3 for pre-order) planes and you can't add any of your FSX/P3D planes (for now ?).\n\nWell for 15€ i consider it a very good and challenging sim for wannabe hardcore pilots. They'll get a fairly good experience. Now, if the devs repair some of the above problems (for free that is) it could also be good little sim (Aerofly-alike) to keep you close from the flightsim community. Especially if modding is added.\n\nDo you recommend it ?\n\nUntil there's a public plan for the future : no. It's expensive for what we have now. Wait a little, come back, see what's there and maybe it will be a very good flight sim school. For now it's an average good-looking flight sim school. But it's promising for Dovetail's future in the flight simulation market (if they don't hold us up with their own addons).\n\nP.S : Dovetail dev, if you are reading this, the hours threshold on LAPL & PPL flight lessons are really annoying. I don't want to free flight three hours just to access the exams. Especially if my other flights didn't count for total flight hours.","May 24","true","9.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Having been a heavy user of FSX, PrePar 3D and X-Plane over the years, I can see how DTG Flight School fits in and it does it well.\n\nApart from setting up your controller it seems straight forward and easy to get flying. The lessons are not bad and you can then still fly all over the world just like in FSX:SE. The graphics and flight dynamics may not match my maxed out PrePar 3D or FSX:SE (using hundreds of dollars of addons and many hours of tweaking) but they are still pretty good and from my results the framerate on any half decent system should also be good. This game still requires a certain amount of power from your PC and trying to run it on one that is too low spec will cause you pain.\n\nIt offers nothing more then FSX:SE does (except the lessons, etc.) but as an introduction to flying for the new person it is worth the money. If you want to learn the basics of flying then get it. If you want the full involved experience of flight simulation then look at one of the others.\n\nBear in mind that you will not be able to install any non-DTG aircraft or scenery addons in this simulator and just look at it as an in-expensive way to try out the world of flight simulation.

Went through all the iterations of Microfsoft Flight Simulator as far as FSX and even dabbled in Microsoft flight. I am impressed by the value for money in this simulator and with the twin engine addon next month it will be even greater value for money.  There has been much discussion about the scenery (quality thereof) and I am very happy with it. I checked off the single monitor option on setup. So I have 60 fps with the high setting for Scenery and Aircraft. My PC has an intel I5 processor with 8Gb of ram ,an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 graphics card (2013 vintage)  with 2Gb  onboard Ram. One can actually fly VFR out of the box. My local horizons (Snowdonia) are easily recognisible in the sim. I can see trees where there should not be any in real life but that has not been detrimental to my enjoyment of the program. After being a virtual autopilot pilot being required to trim an aircraft and maintain heading and altitude manually has been most instructive.","May 28","true","21.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I've never been able to take a sensible, realistic flight. But now, I think I might be taking my first steps towards being a half decent PC pilot.\n\nThe lessons taught me a lot about keeping the aircraft in control and actually using the instruments properly. Finally discovering how to use trim is also a revelation to me. I deffinitely have gained a lot of useful knowledge I can put to good use in free flight. However, during the lessons, I found it quite annoying when you couldn't do what the instructor comanded. If you're doing something wrong, you either get hastled repeatedly until you get it right or you don't get a warning at all. If you bank left instead of right (which I did on more than one occasion) nobody warns you. Then, when you reach the end the instructor suddenly realizes you're in the wrong place all together, you have to restart. I've done each of the lessons twice because of this. I feel the lessons should be a little more forgiving and improvised to a degree, but that hasn't stopped me from learning.\n\nOne thing I'd love to see, if this ever gets another look in by the developers, is another progression to more advanced trainer aircraft like the T6 Texan or the PC-9. That would be a great help to students like me who want to be able to taker bigger and better aircraft.\n\nThis glimpse into what DTG is doing with the flight simulator series is very promising. A magnificent graphic improvement on the last instalment (albeit with a few glitches) makes me feel much more immersed in the experience, especially in the two great aircraft inculded. I can see exactly what this simulator is all about and I think it's a very reasonable price for what you get with it. I can't wait for the comming release at the end of the year.\n\n","May 27","true","11.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

However, DTG has made it blatantly clear that this is not what the simulator is.  This is DTG Flight School, not DTG Flight Simulator.  This game was created for the purpose of bringing in new simmers by teaching them with a, might I say, very well designed lesson system.  Yes, veteran flight simmers (such as myself) can still enjoy this game, but only if you understand why this game was created.\n\nI will be reviewing this with thet perspective.\n\nPros:\nAchievement system.\n\nPilot hours logged for each flight.\n\nAn actual reason to fly in freeflight now:\nChoosing your aiport to spawn at is now identified on a map...\nAfter choosing your aircraft in a beautiful, modern UI system that shows the model of each aircraft in a hangar, it brings you to the world map that resembles a navigational map, then you choose the airport and create a flight plan.When you complete your flight plan, your hours are logged and you are given a nice "award" notification.Absolutely beautiful aircraft models, inside and out.  Possibly surpassing A2A models.\n\nHDR lighting system.  Forgive me, I am no graphics/developer genius, but I believe that is what it's called.  The lighting changes per situation, ie. when you look at a bright area in the sky, the overall exposure dims, when you look away, the exposure brightens.  This effect is nice.\n\nLessons are well made.\n\nBeautiful Orbx FTX Global world textures.\n\nCity/town/airport lighting at night and at darker times (ie. dawn) is gorgeous.\n\nFPS Greatly improved, draw distance greatly improved.\n\nCons:\nCockpits aren't as "clickable" as I would like.\n\nIssues with tearing, graphical issues such as textures strangely flashing and glitching all over the screen in some areas.  I used to have this issue using a Radeon graphics card in FSX.  The solution was to turn off DX10 preview, so I'm not sure what the solution would be for Flight School.\n\nGraphics are not greatly improved from FSX, but that shouldn't be a problem considering that isn't the point of this game.\n\nMaking mistakes in a lesson is an automatic failure which results in restarting the lesson.  I feel DTG needs to put some more work in this area because in a real flight lesson, the instructor would tell you how to improve and redirect the aircraft instead of just failing you.  It should be a lesson where you learn from a mistake, not an automtic punishment.\n\nOnly two aircraft so far, a DA-42 coming in the future making it three.  However, the current aircraft are good for learning to fly.  I would wish that DTG added a C-172 considering that is the most common and one of the best training aircraft.\n\nSummary:\nOverall, for what it's worth, $15.00 will get you a nice little simulator here.  The game is well polished, but in need of some bug fixing.  With two updates already released since launch, it seems that DTG is staying on top of it.  NO game will be perfect on launch, so it's relieving to see a group of developers making sure to deliver what they promise.  Again, with Flight School, they did NOT promise a full-fledged revamped flight simulator.  They promised what they gave us.  If you wish to learn more, make sure to check out this forum on AVSIM, where Flight Simulation Community Manager Martin is doing his best to reach out to us and answer all our questions and concerns about Flight School and the release of DTG Flight Simulator:  AVSIM Community Forum [www.avsim.com]\n\nI hope this all helped!","May 28","true","1.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

But MFSX is ♥♥♥♥ in terms of realysm and ugly as hell and X-Plane quite expensive and also has a litte bit rusty graphics. So when I heard of Dovetail's Flight School, this was perfect... I hoped for a little nice looking and realistic Flight simulator. But I din't get what I expected\n\nFirst the Planes look nice.. but the trees.. come on how dare you to make such ugly trees in 2016!! Also the water is a gren-tourquoise flickering peace of something.. although I still hope that this is an issue with my graphics card and not what it was intended to look like. The clouds are not too bad.. but not too good neither. The 3D areas are quite realistic though, i recognised my surrounding hills quite well.. but considering ground textures; google maps is still more detailed.\n\nThen the realism.. Franky in terms of "feeling like real flying", Flight School is quite disappointment.. (like MSFX. If you want something realistic go to X-Plane)\n\nFinally the Missions: You can't skip the intros the talking and you can't save.... So if you want to learn basic circuits with the instructor (THE THING you have to learn as a pilot), you have to listen to his explanation about the surrounding landscape of the airfield and blablabla EVEREY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME... So thats quite annoying.\n\nFinnaly I'm still waiting of a nice looking, state of the art, realistic flight sim. That's why I don't recommend this game.\n\nBut hey I mean it's just 15 bucks, so I think that's more than just fair if you just want to cruise around a little bit or learn some basics flying skills.","May 28","false","2.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

At $16.00 the limitations should be obvious as this was intended to be the first foray in using the engine in 64 bit. And what a joy to have all the graphics cranked up and see 4.1 gb used huge framerates and using only 35% of available memory. I cranked up the LOD radius to 12.000000 and looks even more beautiful. FPS dropped as expected but to a very nice 40 fps and memeory went up to 4.5 gb with available memory noted at 45% so lots of headroom.\n\nLOD of the mesh is very good. Fly in Austria and you'll find out. Not those stupid rounded mountains of FSX.\n\nORBX has supplied the Global Base and I'm assuming Vector and Open LC as well. Very nice and again a huge improvement over default FSX. Plenty of autogen - trees and buildings give the scenery a robust look. Would have like Speedtrees implemented something P3D did.\n\nDon't know what all the *itching is about. This is the beginning framework for 64 bit and after years running up against out of memory in pathetic 32 bit BRAVO to Dovetail. Hugely excited for the full monty fit as tentatively noted in the fall.\n\nIn the meantime I like the school, the missions, and the free flying, UI is easy enough to navigate. Flightplanning is fun.

I have actually  met people who have written  nasty things about me in real life and all I can say is that all of them have been insecure people who would never behave or say what they normally write behind a keyboard. Sad state of affairs. Same type of people who seek confrontation over things normal people just let slide and move along because it is not about life or death.\n\nSecondly, how old are you people really who write some of the garbage here? I have spent 15 euros and got what a reasonable person can expect from an entry level flight simulator based on a 2006 engine. You want a fully featured flight simulator buy FSX or Xplane 10. At no  point was this advertised as a successor to FSX. It is a rebuild of FSX in 64-bit environment with updated scenary textures such as buildings and various environmental textures. The successor to FSX is coming later this year, it has been repeatdly layed out in interviews and various articles.\n\nFinally, about the game. I have played sims since Sublogic days on Apple and monochrome days, especially Flight Simulator. I have also flown small Cessna planes although not completed any official license and dont intend to at the moment.\n\nThe graphics at full resolution and maxed out do look like the screen shoots. It is not that hard. Full settings, 1920x1080 resolution and you get the same results, seriously people just try it. If you dont have the horsepower then that is how it works, it is PC gaming after all. The FPS are slightly lower with somewhat comparable settings on FSX but it is hard to compare. There is not alot of customization for the graphics, only sliders, but OK, that is how it is.\n\nFlight model is allright, it does its job for being an entry level flight simulator.\n\n2 planes, that is what was advertised and that is what it has, period.\n\nI had higher expectations myself but I enjoyed it for what it is. I wish I could customize things such as weather and a more precise scenary control panel but OK.\n\nI remember FSX the day it came out, it was not running very well but with service pack it most things were taken care of. For those who say MS Flight should be revived...you know why they ditched that? The community said it was not what they wanted. Personally, I thought it was at best mediocre, it was an attempt to test if the community was still alive. MS Flight should stay where it is...in the past.","May 26","true","2.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I dont know whether its too much contrast or HDR, but it's just off. Additionally, the games ties to the dated FSX are prominent in a time when we desperately need something that is built from the ground up for modern PCs. If Flight School is an indication of what's to come in Dovetail Flight Simulator, then I will be very disappointed.\n\nSad to see that PC games in general are pushing the boundaries of realism with new graphics engines and support for new technologies like DX12, while flight simulators released in 2016 look cartoonish, even with their "photorealitic textures". Ironically, the failed Microsoft Flight looked better than this.\n\nThanks to the devs though for introducing much needed updates like 64-bit support and a UI overhaul. I can recommend Flight School for its intended audience, but my support ends there unfortunately.\n\nPS.

I have about 1 year with FSX and XPlane. Although I prefer the Airliners, This is a taste of what is to come. FSX is outdated but excellent , With all the addons like Orbx, PMDG, etc. the game really comes alive. Now Dovetail is dipping thier toes in what many of us in the FSX Community have been wanting and that is a 64 Bit Upgrade to use the power of our now demanding Computers.\n\nMany of the reviews I have seen have been from many relatively new persons to Flight Simulations. Therefore they cannot appreciate the difference between old and new. I am having a blast with the missions, and free flight. The scenery is gorgeous. I now simply cannot wait for Dovetails next release. I just hope it stays on schedule and comes with Airliners that are ready to go. Hopefully a cooperative effort with PMDG or Aerosoft for Airliner compatibility will be a reality. I also would like if some how my airliners that I paid good money for are able to be ported over to the new Sim. With that said I anxiously await the next release from DoveTail Games.

I dislike how you spawn at the runway with engine on. I think it would be important to include a tutorial on the start up procedure - priming the engine, turning on fuel pump to check pressure and other general checklist items for startup. It will make the game much more immersive.\n\nPlanes/ physics are great, although would have liked more detail in the Planes. e.g. on the PA28 the fuel tank selector, circuit breakers - little details like being able to open the small window on port side)\n\nI found the "task" of turning the dial for the VOR and Heading indicator AWFUL - when ajusting with a mouse. very glitchy and rarely went to the number i wanted. was very frustrating.\n\nScenery looks great over all - a big improvement from FSX. although up close it had very angled shorelines.\n\nOn my system the game runs very well,  i've had zero performance issues with FPS or crashes.\n\nOverall the issues i've listed are very minor,\ni've focused on the negatives more so.

I am having too much fun sim flying with 64 bit. Just think of the potential, I am already using REX sky textures.

First of all, when you start the game, the new interface isn't quite intuitive, with most of the advanced settings of previous versions not available, or at least, not reachable. Once you get to start the process to flight, everything start to fall apart.\n\nThe first problem appear when you want to choose a plane to flight, despite knowing that this game is kind a tutorials game, they could have maintained the default planes of FSX, but adding or changing the new ones with “better” quality; not only being able to pick two planes. Once you go to the next screen, it makes the impression that you have to create a route to flight, no matter flying on VFR or IFR. As I said before, the interface makes difficult to find basic options like change the weather, now only with the predefined options, or change the Time and Season settings. But, once you have passed through all of this, it’s time of playing, if you can. In my case, in the same machine that runs FSX at 120FPS without any add ons in my local airport with a Cessna172, this game is not able to reach at least 10FPS, in the same position, and with a similar settings.\n\nWith this experience, my last thing to do about this game is to regret about the missed chance to really have a good or updated simulator; so all of this have take me to apply for a refund.","May 26","false","0.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Once you feel you got the feeling invest in a Joystick or Yoke and buy Flight Simulator X (Original is always better) or  X Planes 9 and 10 (Great Graphics and realism) and if you feel like you wan't to fo further check out Prepar3d (Insane Realism and Graphics).\n\nBut yeah as previously mentioned this is good for starters not for the main course (That guy who was 10000 hours in FSX lol).\n\nSomethings for the developers to consider.\nPlease add graphic revamps and DLCs or Freeware aircrafts etc.\n\n6/10 - Great sim for 15 bucks!","May 27","true","2.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I have played numerous games with planes in them such as birds of steel and war thunder, and have always been interested in planes in general. So I thought I might try this game since its supposed to be an introduction to flight simulation. What a big mistake. My first problem is the tutorials. They do not tell you what key is assigned to the action they want you to do, like in the first tutorial where you do your first take off it has you move the ailerons, elevator, and rudder it just says at the top of the screen "move the ailerons". No instruction on what key to press. My second complaint is that Its graphics suck. After looking at Microsoft flight simulator which has been out for quite some time now, I thought this might be better for graphics, but no. The screen shots that are shown on the product page are a lie. They somewhat resemble how the interiors of the planes look, but the enviorment is just as bad as FSX. I was really disapointed with this product, it was a waste of my $15 dollars.

You will enjoy this a lot if you are new to flight simming and want to learn to fly, but I think many more experienced players might like doing the missions and pilot school too.\n\nThere are some negative reviews, which seem to be from quite established flight simmers who are used to very optimised experiences that they have paid hundreds or even thousands of pounds/dollars to create. Some of these seem a little over the top to me. I am running the game smoothly on a two year old average-good gaming laptop.\n\nThis is a great little game that will teach you the basics of flying, give you the chance to fly several light aircraft and allow you to explore the whole globe once you have developed your skills.\n\nIt was fantastic that Dovetail brought FSX to Steam, it got me back into the genre and this represents another step in the right direction.

Learn the basics of flying, which is a tough topic, while having fun. Isn’t that good :) After that, ready to enter into a more complex and global simulator, like FSX or so.\n\nProbably we don't learn all the details of piloting, FSX learning center lessons are more detailed, but perfect for a novice who would like to sit in the cockpit and go, practice is the best way to learn :)\n\nDTFSc is a subset of FSX, with some enhancements and changes:\n\n- Sim engine moved to 64 bits. The entry to a new modern platform for building future simulators. The result is visible, I’ve noticed enhanced framerates in all areas (from x1.5 to x2), at ultra-high settings (running an ASUS ROG with i7-6700HQ and GTX 960m). Also, NO crash experienced so far.\n- New worldwide terrain, designed with ORBX. I’ve compared it with FSX+ORBX Global+vector+LC EU+LC NA, and Flight School terrain and airports are MUCH better at least in the areas I’ve visited, in UK and USA! That’s for me the major step up of the sim environment in DTFSc, along with better framerates. And for a 15$ product, there’s no comment compared to the price of the ORBX suite only!\n- The 2 GA Airplanes are fine, Cub and PA28 are perfect for training and VFR\n- DTFSc is VFR only. No IFR, and everything around IFR like ILS, autopilot, has been removed. But no use here in the concept of learning flight basics and flying GA.\n- The remaining is mostly some brush up cosmetic changes from FSX, like a new interactive map to plan flights (much interactive and easier to use), new UI, and simplified configuration (in some way a “gaming-like” setting).\n- Some points of surprise: Skies and ATC. Skies are very basic like original FSX (could be rendered much better with REX) and ATC voices are unnatural. 2 axes of improvements, hope for the future sim, but DTFSc is not aimed as being the long term sim that will take over FSX on the market.\nFinally, a good entertainment product!\n\nAnd kudos to the devs and teams who have taken over millions of lines of code developed during 25 years by hundreds of others, I know for sure that’s not an easy task to fulfil. Result is promising anyway for the future.","May 28","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You want a great VFR experience, go Aerofly FS 1. you want somthing easy to get into, try and find a copy of microsoft flight.\n\nfirst off. this is cheap. mindblowingly cheap. knowing already that this was a tweak of the jankey FSX engine, and that aerofly FS 2 was also out around now, i actually chose this game. £12. £12 for a reasonabbly accurate map of the world, with most airports, and 2 well modeled aircraft. i think the alaska DLC for microsoft flight was more, and "all" you got was alaska and a 3rd aircraft with no cockpit. for £12 im not even refunding this. im letting it sit here, letting it grow.\n\nNext, i have been a flight simmer my whole life. whether it be my dad showing some ancient floppy disk flight sim, seeing my uncles computer, visiting people who have built their own cockpits, to my HOTAS at my desk for the past 12 years. I have even touched a bit on real flying (solo flight with the Royal Air Force Air Cadets), but that was some time ago. so thats my background, and where this review comes from.\n\nHonestly, i found X-plane and FSX just a bit too complicated. im a VFR guy, not an adjust an auto pilot heading every 3 hours guy. i love these android tablet flight simulators, so goofy accesable and fun, while trying to be serious. we havent got that on PC.\nwhat i enjoyed the most was (now dead) "microsoft Flight" and Aerofly FS 1. they were great. beautiful and diverse scenery, ran very well, and were authentic. they didnt hold a light to the big boys, but they were accesable, especially MS flight with its game style aerocaches and HUD.\n\nFlight school is trying to fill this gap. the gap between an arcade shooter style, and xplane. but it doesnt quite get there. the interface is still microsoft flight simulator. how the hell do i changn view? 1? no, F1? no. oh its in the menu bar at the top. and its just, dull.\nfor a VRF simulator, there aren't may references to navigate by.\n\nfor newbies, its all to much, for the hardcore, its just not enough. time will tell. I imagine dovetail will do great things. they have proven themselves with train simulator (though the DLC is a little bit over the top! sorry bank!) and they will prove themselves again.\n\nin conclusion, as with my review at the top, Xplane, FSX, MS flight and aerofly FS 1 all do their own thing well. flight is trying to put its hand in each on of their pies, and ends up being too flavourless and bland","May 25","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
