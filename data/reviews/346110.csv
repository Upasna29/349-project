I have been playing games for over  25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests.\nI had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming.\nI found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me.\nAfter I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled ♥♥♥ back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought "oh well". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose.\nI have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.","August 16, 2015","true","887.5"," 2,693 of 2,835 people (95%) found this review helpful 679 people found this review funny","95","693","2","679","54"

The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc.\n\nMe and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.\n\nA few weeks later.\n\nwe have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.\n\nOne week later.\n\nRandom (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls)\n\nThe chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies.\n\nThe next day.\n\nI log on.\nEverything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins.\nHundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....\n\nThe chinese tribe who helped us out from day one, Destroyed us.\n\nRIP.\nAtlas\nAbraxis\nNien\nTalon\nAeon\nMckitten\nMcCat\nMcMuffin\nMike the trike\nBob the trike\nArmageddon\nMorgoth\nApocalypse\nAnkrahmun\nAnkaderp\nMuffin\nDeem\nDemonspawn\nSharkenator\nLulu\nRammus\nRockey\nStoney\nScorpenator\nMitten\nRappy\nOmega\nMammutan\nWoolly\nMamenamenamenan\nCarny\nBrontenator\n\nAnd many more....\n\nThat empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.\n\n3 days later.\n\nwe set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one.\nBut we we're determined and longing for revenge....\nwe broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.\n\nWe started mass producing grenades.\n\nI went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends.\n\nToday,\n\nwe're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.\n\nOnly a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.\n\n\n\nApoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language.\n\n\n","September 18, 2015","true","425.5"," 1,969 of 2,084 people (94%) found this review helpful 920 people found this review funny","94","969","2","920","83"

I met a man named Jigger Jaw. He was Level 13. I was level 2. We hit it off, and ended up becoming a tribe and hunting together. All was well. He made it to Level 14, I made it to Level 5. But then, I saw a supply drop, in which he said he thought it was Level 15 needed to unlock it. Sparking my curiosity, I told him I would check it out. He stayed at the campfire and told me to watch out for the snake and frog-like creatures. So I got to the supply drop, and I could open it! I got many useful crafting items. I turned back to go to our campfire, but red words of death appeared. Jigger Jaw had been killed by a Level 80 dino. Gasping, I ran back to camp to find him. His remains were nowhere to be found, along with his killer. I messaged him asking if he was around, but got no answer. He had left. Later I found his murderer around the beach, and knew I was not yet ready to face this foe. But I was ready to survive. For Jigger Jaw had taught me how to survive.

Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.\n\nArk Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things.  Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs.  Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.\n\nBut there is a downside.  There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win.  Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server.  They'll be fed up.  As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.\n\nNow a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.\n\nThen you win.  Then you are the supreme ruler of the server.  You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest.  But then it will hit you.  The sadness. As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone.  Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same.  Even if not in your tribe, you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag.  You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finally, you'll get bored and leave.\n\nMonths will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  You'll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New names, faces, bases, everything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldn't ever even imagine.  The wars you'd fought and people you'd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone.  In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.\n\nArk Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight.  To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours.  To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours.  To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours.  To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.\n\nIf you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this games.  But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.\n\n10/10 Masterpiece.","April 20","true","068.5"," 1,390 of 1,480 people (94%) found this review helpful 316 people found this review funny","94","390","1","316","57"

All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.\n\nI'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.\n\nBut you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.\n\nI get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.\n\nBut if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.\n\nAnd if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.\n\nAs a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.\n\nAn all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh, and it's also pretty cheap.","June 29, 2015","true","188.7"," 1,840 of 1,976 people (93%) found this review helpful 126 people found this review funny","93","840","1","126","56"

When I looked at ARK: Survival Evolved  (currently in Early Access on Steam) it looked like just such a thing. When I dug into it and learned that I could host a LAN server in my house, and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generous, went all in with my sons.\n\nBefore long I had all four of my kids playing with me, and each other.\n\nCurrently my girls are the heavy hitters, training mobs of small dinosaurs, and then marching them into harm's way. The game's A.I. spawns some tough beasts, but short of the epic boss battles (which we have not bothered with), and the Alpha T-Rex (which we haven't run into), nothing stands for long against Keliana's swarm of dilophosaurs and dimorphodons, or Gleek's hopping mob of giant frogs.\n\nKeliana and I did run into a bit of trouble with our expedition from the north-east river mouth, but that wasn't her fault. I shall now tell you about it.\n\nWe  attempted to bring 24 tamed dinos and one tricked-out crafting raft southwest through narrows and swamps. We discovered, after it was too late to turn around, that the size of our mob and the size of our raft made the trip extremely tedious. It didn't get dangerous until I got fed up and decided on a side trip.\n\nMy plan was simple. Ride Terry, my pteranodon who kept fouling the raft's travel, from our mob's location at the western edge of the Eastern Plains, east and south to a platform we'd been building in the middle of the Eastern Forest. There he'd be high, dry, and safe. I would then parachute back, timing my glide to get me most of the way to safety. It's a high platform, and I'd seen my son make that kind of glide before.\n\n(Note: The logic that goes "I saw my son do a thing in a game so it is a thing I can now do" has never gotten me into trouble before, I swear.)\n\nA dimorphodon named Zed was following me and Terry. Unfortunately, Zed fell behind, and I forgot he was there. I landed Terry safely, lined up my jump, and leapt back the way we'd come. My chute popped perfectly, and my glide was going to be LONG. Then Zed caught up, flew straight at me, and fouled the lines of my chute.\n\nI dropped fast. Not killed-by-the-fall fast, but definitely short-of-my-goal-by-80% fast. I landed in a boulder-filled vale just to the west of the platform. The vale's only other major feature besides boulders was hungry carnivores. I emptied my shotgun into a 'raptor, then finished it off with a pike only to discover that a carnotaur had stopped quarreling with a pair of sabertooths, and was charging me.\n\nCarnos charge in straight lines, and turn poorly. I used the terrain to my advantage, and attempted to lead him back into his sabertoothed foes. It worked perfectly, except for the part where they decided to share a meal. I now had three carnivores chasing me.  I almost ran headlong into another sabertooth, but it leaped and I ducked, and then I kept running.\n\n"Keliana, where are you?"\n\n"North of that purple light. There's a cliff between me and you. You'll need to go around it."\n\nI turned and checked to see how close pursuit was.\n\nI screamed.\n\nThe game does a really good job of getting predators right. They don't roar or screech unless they're fighting. They come at you teeth-first, and quietly.\n\nI had a perfect view of three sabertooths, one carnotaur, and behind them, just starting to take interest, a pair of tyrannosaurs who I may have run a bit too close to without noticing them.\n\n"THERE IS NO AROUND!"\n\nThe nice thing about video-game cliffs is that if they're not sheer, sometimes you can cheat them, running sideways and down, and landing without having broken your bones. I did this, knowing that my pursuit could do the same thing.\n\nI splashed through shallows at the base of the cliffs, and then saw that I was being charged from the front by a velociraptor.

So here goes...\n\nI'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin, GoG, etc.\n\nLet me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.\n\nMake no mistake, this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues, and the server numbers didn't cover the 100,000+ players... BUT, the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.\n\nIn the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour.\n\nFor me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie, or AAA team.\n\nThat said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust, with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).\n\nIn all, you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.","June 5, 2015","true","54.6"," 1,228 of 1,339 people (92%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","92","228","1","55","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emptytextfield/recommended/346110/","emptytextfield","x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emptytextfield/","34 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(+) Built on the Unreal Engine, so everything looks gorgeous.\n(+) Despite following the trend of survival games in recent memory, probably the best, conceptually speaking.\n(+) The music, while in short stock, is great. Quality over quantity.\n(+) Dinosaur AI is pretty well made, as well as the taming system.\n(+) Unofficial servers and mod support, which makes the game infinitely more acceptable to people hoping to play with friends, and people who like to create new things.\n(+) This is the type of game where it is extremely hard to use hacks to modify in-game values, and virtually pointless to use client-side hacks. Aimbots, trainers, and other hacks (with the exception of enhanced perception hacks) are rendered mostly useless.\n(+) Resource generation is almost perfect. Rocks and driftwood wash up on the beach, trees regrow after time, and metal veins get exposed on mountains after waiting a bit. The only issue is that HUGE boulders decide to randomly generate in places that are not particularly realistic.\n\n(*) Still rather unoptimized, but the game is still in Early Access, so that's expected, if not standard.\n(*) Built on the Unreal Engine, so this game destroys your graphics card.\n(*) Updated very often, but patch notes are often missing certain inclusions, and installing updates every day or so kinda stinks.\n(*) The crafting system is really robust, but some blueprints for some higher quality/tier items are broken (too many materials for too few slots on a smithy/fabricator) (FIXED)\n(*) Taming dinosaurs takes hours, but having it take up any less time would make them too accessible. Casual players may feel disheartened by this.\n(*) This game is one HUMONGOUS grind. Do not play if you dislike long hours of repeating specific tasks to level up.\n\n(-) The community that is sheltered by official servers is incredibly toxic. If you don't have an "in" with one of the supertribes that belong to a server, you're probably going to get raided/killed in a few days just for the sake of griefing/security (assuming you play on a PvP server). You might also get stuck in a wood/stone box, which you can't punch out of. Many also have no tolerance for new players.\n(-) The company does not intend to wipe/reset the official servers, so superclans get richer, while scattered tribes and solo players get poorer.\n(-) Very spotty official servers. Often has significantly more lag than advertised on the server page (+50 ping).\n(-) Deplorable mob balance. The final "boss" is roughly on par with some of the higher tier dinos, in terms of difficulty.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Far and away the best game in its individual market in terms of concept and execution, and extremely mature for being an "Early Access" game. Official server support and the communities that surround them leaves a lot to be desied.\n\nIf you have any questions about my review, or the game, feel free to add me as a friend on Steam, and message me. Maybe even trade me some CS:GO skins!","July 11, 2015","true","360.3"," 950 of 1,034 people (92%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","92","950","1","48","18"

Died.\n\nRespawned, re-equipped, dodge shots from my OWN GUN THAT THEY STOLE, killed boyfriend with spear to the face.\n\nPunched out woman while she was screaming profanity's at me in in-game voice chat.\n\nDrowned her in a river, screaming the whole time.\n\nGot all my stuff back.\n\nThrew a grenade into the thieves thatch hut. Boom.\n\nJustice.\n\n10/10 Would justice again.\n\nIn all seriousness, the Official servers lack clear rules and administration. Do yourself a favor, find a good unofficial server, and the game will be loads better. No hacking, no cheaters, no lag, no rubberbanding, etc. You'll also find a better community on these servers, which is part of the fun in a game like this.\n\nAs for leveling, it's quite easy, as everything you do that requires input from yourself except taming, gives you exp from 1 to 67, which is current max level. Hence, you don't have to move on to a new area, like some other games on the market.\n\nThe game is harsh, however, and it does not go easy on you. If your T-rex dies, that you just spent 7 hours taming, it's dead. There's no way to bring it back, or rez it, or take backs. If you get overly attached to the things you tame, play PVE. You'll have a much more fun time, because if you play PVP, you may just log in naked on the beach with everything you own destroyed. Again, play on an unofficial with rules that you agree with. Some unofficials don't allow base leveling, or killing of passive dino's, etc.\n\nYou'll want to find a tribe, because the more people you have working on a base, the stronger it will be, and the less time it will take building it. Once you get to metal tier, the sheer amount of stones you need to make a small metal building will be astonishing, so you need to work with others to accomplish goals that are out of a single players reach.\n\nIf you play on a PVP server, know that at some point, you will wake up dead. It's only a matter of time before this happens. Expect it, and have a backup plan. IE: A small hidden home, preferrably metal, with supplies for retaming, rearming, retooling, etc., so that you don't have to start from a stone axe again.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent experience, as long as you are OK with an EA title. You'll find bugs that will screw you over and cause you to lose tons of your time, but that's par for the course at this stage of development.\n\nThere is no other survival game on the market that comes close to Ark at the moment. My playtime attests to that fact.\n\nIf you pick it up, good luck on the isle! If you have questions, stop by my stream and ask away. I'm live from Morning (10 AM MST) to afternoon (3PM MST), and from evening (6-7PM MST) until late at night (1-3AM MST).

First off the game looks realy nice, no way i could say it was a early access game if i didnt know it alrdy. No major game breaking buggs so far, some bigger dinos stuck between trees but so far i just seen a handfull of them.\n\nA few highlight of my gameplay\n\nWoke up on a beach and started to get the feel of the game and controls. Looking around  i saw another player working his way  thoward the forest and i tough: hey ill stalk him and see what hes up to. a few 100 meters into the dence forest he gets attacked by what i think was a Trex feeling for a snack. i didnt stay to check what happend to the guy, i legged back to the beach where i woke up.\n\nNext few hours i was working my hardest just to get though the nights without falling to the smaller reptiles prowling the beach. Though to myself after makeing a spear, fish should be easy food to catch, I swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeper, spotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars....\n\nI spend a cold night out on that rock.\n\nWorking my way north along the shoreline looking for a good spot to call home i came across a dino that was left for dead that i decided to tamed. Over a period of 3 ingame days and nights feeding it and defending it and me the entire time. Gathering berries and makeing a campfire to cook myslef some meat and for light for the night times. After 3 long night and days he finaly woke up and i had my first companion.\n\nFor a time all was well i was building the house on a hill loverlooking the shore, My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy. Oneday i felt the gound shake as a pack of big herbivores deciced that my house was totaly in the wrong place and started to attack it. Fido the good guard dog as he was attacked without delay. Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee. The only thing i could do was to watch from afar with my spyglass the destruction of my house and mourn the death of my brave Fido.\n\nWould i recomend to buy it?

At least I assume it's an island. I tried to see if I could explore by walking from one side to the other. This is a bad idea as there are numerous carnivorous dinosaurs that want nothing more than to eat my face. As I run along I'm collecting lots of neat stuff but I'm only wearing a pair of basic cloth boxers. I have no idea where I'm keeping all this crap.\n\nDay 2- Decided to put down roots. Tried to perfect my skills and build a house. Got attacked by a Compy but I clubbed it. Three more came over and ate my face.\n\nDay 3- Tried to get back to my homestead. Got attacked by a massive crocodile. Tried to go back again. Got eaten by a T-Rex's angry cousin. Tried one more time and got swarmed by gigantic mosquito bugs. This area sucks.\n\nDay 4- Magically spawned in a new area. Has to be further north as its cold. And snowing. Got eaten by a big buzzard. Washed ashore in a slightly warmer region of the north. Used my skills that I had been honing while getting my face eaten to build a house. I'm currently inside it while two dilophosaurus try to bust the door in and eat my face. These guys are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nDay 5- After cowering in fear during the night I finally decided to grow a pair and protect my measly thatch house. The dilophosaurs ate my face. Made it back to the house and killed the smaller of the two. Decided to make a slingshot and fight the other from a distance and put my ridiculous amount of rocks to good use. A few good shots to the dome and the female is unconscious.\n\nDay 6- Fed the knocked out Dilophosarus some raw meat and Narcoberries. When she came too she started following me around like a lost puppy. Named her Popcorn. She might be a good companion since she's 20 levels higher than me.\n\nDay 7- Popcorn saved me. Got ambushed in the forest behind my house by more of those annoying little Compy things. I'd like to think I helped weaken them with my club but ultimately Popcorn killed all three while I lay in the fetal position wounded and crying like a baby. At least they didn't eat my face.\n\nDay 10- The last few days have been pure bliss. Popcorn and I have been roaming the area establishing our dominance by killing smaller, weaker things. We're collecting the hides in preparation for taming and saddling up a Trike. Irrigation is established and I'm trying to farm. Life is good and my face hasn't been eaten.\n\nDay 12- Tragedy has struck as Popcorn has been killed. As we were scouring the area for hides we came across a turkey. I was hungry. So was Popcorn. We attacked and things seemed to be going well. Until a giant tortoise looking dino with spikes on its shell decided to help the stupid turkey. I got disoriented trying to lead the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off tortoise away. Surely my Level 40 Popcorn would be ok against a level 6 turkey. Alas she wasn't. The turkey ate my dinosaur =(\n\nDay 13- Went out in search of a new companion. Found and tamed another female dilophosaurus and named her CapriSun.

Its a big socilogical experiment and we are the Guinea Pigs. Most of the time this game is so much fun, but then some jerk does the equivalent of Home Invasion in real life and ruins everything. They scream and shout about PvP and so on. PvP is garbage in this game. Tribe Warfare and PvP when you and your oponent are on even ground is fun. Being lvl 65 or 100 depending what you play on, and running around picking up and dropping new spawns isnt pvp, thats pretty much just going to the newborn ward at the local hospital and punching babies. Mostly its high level people and large Tribes wiping out smaller ones for some weird reason.  Alot of the interactions that go on in game are mostly people whom are very "small" in real life, who are a bit to big for their britches in game. (Yeah I said Britches,,whats up ?)   One of my first encounters with the lower lifeforms in this game was as I was taming a dino with  some tribe members, two people came up to us and accused us of stealing something. We didnt, and we told them that. They decided anyways to Tranq me and when I dare voice my displeasure over it, the female aggressor killed me, and said that I should be nice..... I called her a scumbag.  Oh well life goes on.\nAnyways whole point being this game will pretty much let you live out your sociopathic fantasys of murdering people for nothing, and more than likely be stabbed to death in a dark jungle by a 15 year old.  Mostly this game is just an excuse to act crappy toward people with no reprocussions.\n\nBUT :PvP can be great when things are relativly fair. Rideing dinosaurs is great, EVERYTHING about this game is awesome. EXCEPT other people, who mostly spend time griefing. Find a good server. Find a group of people, not just 1-4 guys. I mean like 15-20 people. Then the game will really shine.\n\n\nAlso to the Toxic comments I keep Deleteing, IDGAF about you thoughts feelings or opinions. Go write your own review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/346110/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter many have tried, Studio Wildcards and associate dev-studios are trying to finally deliver us what we have all been craving for: A survival game with dinosaurs! ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly that, with an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster?\n\nARK puts you in the shoes of a half-naked guy (or gal), stranded on the eponymous ARK, the island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your character, although like in many other games, anything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscled, giraffe-necked dwarf or super tall, onyx-skinned valkyrie?), but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specific, meaning you can have one on every server.\nYour character will start the game with nothing to his or her name, true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gatherer, as your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get wood, but doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.).\nEven at this early point, the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Huge, prehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill you, however, some just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each other, as the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself.\nPlayers should quickly realise that most of the island's monsters are beyond their combat-capabilities and that they should steer clear of the particularly agressive ones dwelling on land, in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same time, ARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over time, with a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributes, as well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventure, later down the line you may pick up the recipes for weapons, buildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high level, so specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit.\nThe unwritten goal in ARK, for most players, is to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeed, whoever has played Rust will immediately feel at home, as the whole game plays very much like it. This includes player's characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnects, adding additional treat to potential raiders, who will be able to take all of your character's belongings even when you are not on the server. Of course, building a secure base will help combat this threat.\nWhat sets ARK apart from Rust is its setting (frigging dinosaurs), its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen), its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players), you can choose to knock them unconscious instead, beginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventually, it will become your (and your tribe's) companion, able to aid you in combat, bear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinos, too!). What more needs to be said, really.\n\nYes of course, the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devs, they did not expect such a large resonance initially, which caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Also, the stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in time, you need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag.\nAll of this was to be expected, really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In fact, the devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on content, wanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Access, which I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project.\nIndeed, even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanics, with so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled out, resulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players. I am very much looking forward to see more stuff added to ARK: Survival Evolved and I believe the very pleasant developers have the right ideas on how to steer it to success.","June 5, 2015","true","141.9"," 494 of 555 people (89%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","89","494","555","35","18"

I didn't know it was pvp until i was raided, but i realized my thatch wasnt't going to stop anybody, so i rebuilt a wooden fortress, tamed a few dilos and raptors. Find a few other noobs and make a family together. Working hard and proud on our home, we ventured through our island chopping down trees, and killing what we could. Then the server wiped. We understood it was a great time to move to a better location, block off a cave and pray no one f****s with us.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/topsideentertainment/recommended/346110/","topsideentertainment","Topside","http://steamcommunity.com/id/topsideentertainment/","78 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME\n1.) Change inventory keybinding to Tab. Make console "~" Plays off very fluent.\n2.) 5,000+ Negative reviews about optimization, You need more than just a great graphics card. This game is more CPU          dependant, I'm using an old 550gtx card and runs pretty smooth and with custom video settings it looks just fine. Tweak with everything for a few minutes, you'll find a good enjoyable setting. Unless you're running an old IBM pc. (lol)\n3.) Note that you can customize your character down to hand size, male/female, etc. My only downside is somehow I still look the same as everyone.\nOFF TO THE GAMEPLAY\n1.) Unique inventory system, you have a mysterious impant in your hand which is the HUD for everything. You learn how to craft everything without a single blueprint through engrams, which better items require certain higher level. There are blueprints to find for a shortcut, but you never Really need them. EDIT: Blueprints can be BETTER than just the original engram I.E higher armor or durability. Survival is basic eat/drink over time it decays like rust, etc.\n2.) Supply Drops, (I assume everyone is a test subject sent to this planet and these drops are hi tech packages warped to the land by the Army/Scientist) are also unique rather than a box that falls from a random helicopter. They are level restricted from level 5 to level 45 (so far I've seen). Can drop nearly anything in the game. I.E. Level 5 drop gave me an entire 1 square house, door and all. Drops have a cool and unique item model and the way drops work is just sci-fi-ish and refreshing.\n3.) Crafting is Very seamless, pretty much a basic system though, which works just fine for replayablity. Repairs are on the spot until you get better items then you'll use the Smithy. You can refine items so they won't break when you level higher.\n4.) Weather system/Temperature is neat. You get hot and cold, leading to burning or freezing to death after a long while. So far I've only seen rain and heavy fog as far as precipitaion. Hopefully while server days pass and development continues We will see snow and disasters such as tornados, typhoons, etc.\n5.) Combat. Let's be frank. Task Manager Says is all under processes = "Shooter Game" Basic swing and strike for melee. Iron sights for ranged. Online combat is sketchy due to ping. But Singleplayer/Local is very solid. There are multiple weapon attachments as well.\n6.) Physics in the game are great, due to Unreal 4. But I will ADD THE FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. At first I died nearly encumbered falling from maybe a 3 meter drop (thinking, oh I had alot on me it would hurt more). Only to die off the same drop being naked to get my gear back. So water, landscapes, foliage, all great. But FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE REDUCED.\n7.) Dinosaurs (they are currently adding a multitude of species). Right now there are maybe a dozen different dinos and animals. Like a sabertooth tiger, mammoth, sharks etc. All very well produced and modeled. Sometimes pathing is a little bad, I kill T-Rex's and Bronto just because they get stuck in trees or up a mountain side. Other than that, all dinos attack as they should and look great doing so. The taming method is very tedious, but unique. If you USE a nonlethal weapon on a dino they will go unconsious, which will have a meter telling you how long, and also a meter bar for taming. You simply place the food in their "inventory" wait and protect. Simple yet tedious. Making saddles are level required as well. (i'm to the point in local-play to just "~ ForceTame")\n8.) Building is best described as rust or h1z1. Simple place foundation and addon. Yet there are alot of extra things you can do, such as catwalks, ladders, water pipes to transport a water source 17423 miles away. Also pipes can help you find your way around areas (I used some as placements and arrows). There is a modern aspect to building as well. Such as air conditioners, refridgerators, lamps, turrets, all need to be powered by generator and electrical wires. So that's a grade A move, on my part. Also if you play online just simply beware, this is a survival game. Meaning people are psycho.\n9.) Finally last and foremost, you can defecate, ♥♥♥♥, poop, take a number two, talk to a horse named john, pop a squat, and pick it right up to fertilize your crops (which is VERY nessecary in my case)\nSO OVERALL\nThis game is still in development, it does have it's lower qualities, which I mentioned. BUT, I can see why this game is coming to my Xbox One and PS4, rather than Rust, Dayz (never happening), H1Z1 (who is really gunna play that?), or many other survival games. It is simply because this game has all of the qualities of a AAA game and showed them to a playable extent, which companies like Steam, Sony, and Microsoft will gladly support. And for people who have not been able to play the game. Buy it on your Next Gen console because "PC master race, right?"\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this long a$$ review.

I would make gains in the daytime and by night my stuff would be attacked.\nI stayed up at odd hours to defend my property, eventually I was ground down and killed.\nI went through 4 public PVP servers when the chinese invasion first hit. lost several tribes of good people who one by one fell apart under the pressure to keep things running.\n\nIn that respect I feel the developers failed me as a player. they took a hands off approach and forever scarred my experience of the game.\n\nNow my views on the game irrespective of social and dev issues:\n\nPro's:\nthe game looks beautiful\ngameplay is tight\nsounds are good\nAI is acceptable mostly\nlots and lots of stuff to do\nPVP and PVE\nCustom servers\nMOOOODS!\n\nCon's:\npublic servers are really bad and not administered\nThere is no offline protection\nThere is limited enjoyment to be had from PVE as 3/4 of stuff is pvp oriented\nthe game is a huge time sink\n\n\nNow, the number one Issue i have is that, the  game caters to players who play all the time, like anyone who is a 3hr per day type person simply cannot play PVP or enjoy it. and if they do usually its on the backs of a group of people who play 11hr+ a day keeping things running and protected.\nThis one single issue, is why the game annoys me, without offline protection, the game puts too much pressure on smaller groups forcing them to join larger groups simply to have any fun at all. this wieghting towards larger tribes basically destroys any aspirations of long term play for any group.\n\nLife cycle within the game is basically.  tribes get bigger and bigger, biggest tribe rules and kills anyone who annoys them, and eventually starts killing people because they can, around that time, they usually force many smaller tribes out of the server and then eventually they break up and leave.\n\nsomeone fills the power gap and it starts all over again.\n\nThat being said, the game is fun, and rewarding, you can make great friends and have alot of fun. you can also subject yourself to sleepless nights. worry and lose friends over it. so its your choice how you play the game, but play it to have fun.\n","February 16","true","136.1"," 392 of 455 people (86%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","86","392","455","73","46"

Looked like nobody was home so I went in the stealthy way. Once I finally broke in, I started to look for some stuff to steal. But then suddenly, a wild light appeared!

Awesome!\n\nSecond—Buy the game, find some friends and start a tribe, get ripped up by a Carno as a noob and LOL for 5 minutes, hunt some Dinos and build a house. Great!\n\nThird—Get murdered in your sleep, house destroyed, all your Dinos are dead.\n\nFourth—Rebuild house, hunt some Dinos and gather materials. Awesome! We are back into it.\n\nFifth—Get murdered in your sleep, house destroyed, all your Dinos are dead.\n\nSixth—Move and rebuild house, hunt some Dinos and gather materials. Ok. We are good now but we lost a few friends because they no longer log in. They probably took advantage of the summer sale.\n\nSeventh—Get murdered in your sleep, house destroyed, all your Dinos are dead.\n\nEighth—Move again and rebuild house, hunt some Dinos and gather materials. Seriously, I think we found the best hiding spot in the game.\n\nNineth—Get murdered in your sleep, house destroyed, all your Dinos are dead.\n\nTenth-- Move again and rebuild house, hunt some Dinos and gather materials. Do it mostly by yourself because none of your tribe is online anymore…you pause for a minute and notice you no longer have to wait to get on a server.\n\nEleventh—Get murdered in your sleep, house destroyed, all your Dinos are dead.\n\nTwelfth—Stand there naked and with nothing to show for near 80 hours of gameplay. Log off and hope the summer sale is still going with something good. You have now completed Ark, no reason to purchase.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that it is a griefer survival game, not a dino survival game. There is not even PVP, you just get killed while your offline, that is it. If you compare this to another survival game you dumber than a box of rocks because not every game has to be the same, the devs can chose to do something better and make the game better than the others. I never saw one ad or comment put out by the devs saying, “hey come play this dino game and get killed in your sleep because that is “survival”.\n\nPvPvE should be: Players in general engage in PvE however can choose to engage in mutual combat while online or engage in Tribal warfare, all gloves are off.\n\nPvE should be: 100% player versus dino with no or little ability to harm another player. Restrict building around mines and resources areas to include other player buildings to eliminate griefing. Provide moderators to kick griefers and delete their characters from the server.\n\nHardcore PvP should be: What the game is now. If you are so dang interested in dying while you are at work, at school, eating with your family, or sleeping then this should be the option for you.\n\nThe griefers and midnight murderers are too dang spineless and carebear to be a real PvPer and hit the hardcore because at the end of the day, they are just a little ----- who likes to kill new and casual players.\n\n-----Update as of 21 June 2015-----\nI have since moved on to an unofficial server and successfully avoided the toxic nature of the official server griefers, which I honestly believe is sad. Why? Because the official servers should be the most opening to the gaming community by default and not push people away. The “official” server is what most players will click on whether they are new to gaming or survival games or whatever. I have also found that the unofficial server I chose does not generate a large population of players who log on consistently. Simply move you say? I may, but for now I am holding out. The only other problem with a random unofficial server is the ever looming thought; “what if the admin turns the server off?!?” Then your character and all you have built is done for. Try to know your admin in my opinion.\n\nTelling the gamers who do not want griefing to simply go on a PvE server cupcake! is not effective. Have you looked at the data? Most players do not want griefing and most of the servers are in fact NOT built for PvE only. Furthermore, those who are suggesting this are assuming we never want to PvP. Wrong! I want to be online when the PvP happens and at least have some kind of story to associate the event with and tell friends about. What do I tell friends now? Go on an official server and you will log in dead--hands down. I hope you like to log in and see your characters cheeky rear because you will get familiar with it. I have also found that PvE servers lower MY FPS and I believe this is because of the hundreds of players logging in, building a hut and then never logging in again. Some of the servers are starting to look like shanty town island and not survival island. Also, there are only 70 spots available on those servers, so you better plan on never playing during prime time.\n\nThere does seem to be some reading comprehension issues with some of the community who have left some fairly nasty comments. I am not sure if they even read the entire post or just TL;DR, “you mad bro!?!” Either way--ignorance is not a virtue. I have no problem with people disagreeing but at least be intelligent about it. Please keep that is mind. It is early access and the developers want to know what we think, so I gave my opinion based on my experiences.","June 17, 2015","false","431.9"," 4,822 of 6,176 people (78%) found this review helpful 1,045 people found this review funny","78","822","6","045","235"

So what? The dodos, they slapped my walls, as they were slowly darkening the horror sunk in. I was a goner. As my walls collapsed the hope of escape went with it, I was surrounded, by dodos. As the dodos closed in on me I was saved by a player on a Argy, he picked me up out of my house and we flew away. He said nothing when I thanked him for saving me from my doom, we were going very far away from any place the dodo army couldn't reach. He flew me entirely across the map with no breaks, and I realised where we were going. My name was Pepperoni at the time, the player stops and says one thing; "I aem goinng tu cook u into a pizza" and drops me into a volcano, (On The Center) and I was sure as I was falling I was about to die, but no, I was grappled into a cave in the volcano, and pulled back to safety. As I thanked him he said "jk fam" and punched me back into the volcano, expecting someone to grapple me again but I plunged into the lava I heard one thing, the squak of the dodo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moral Of The Story: 10/10 would get irrational fear of chickens again","May 22","true","395.0"," 211 of 238 people (89%) found this review helpful 321 people found this review funny","89","211","238","321","6"

So everyone flocked to the review board of steam and flagged it down. That's over and this is an honest first impression with a full 2 hours of game time acctually in game.\n\nBy no means am I reviewing an early access, im just setting the record straight,\nthe game delivers what it said it would, are there servers? yes. Is there a single player? Yes. Is the game about taming and surviving in a dinosaur filled world? You Stegasaurus belive it.\n\nIn retrospect, i would like to point out the devs dropped 3 minor patches in the course of 4-5 hours, to address hard and dubious complaints, and also went out of their way to include something that may or may not have been acceidently left out at publish, thats a good developer in my book. So say what you will about the serves being full on a great game, or say what you will about lazy devs who dropped 3 minor patches on a dime to keep the game from exploding. The game, and its dev team, for an early access title are well worth at least 25 bucks to say hey,\n"Great job guys, keep going."\n\nWe support good music and art, we should support great dinosaur games too.","June 2, 2015","true","19.6"," 450 of 556 people (81%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","81","450","556","20","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaztyFox/recommended/346110/","NaztyFox","Nazty Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaztyFox/","4270 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is one of the best survival games I have ever played and it's only in early access right now. There is already a ton of content and the game looks beautiful. There are a few bugs here and there and the game still needs to be optimized for better performance (Devs said this is in progress already) but right out of the gates, this game is amazing.\n\nThere currently is no tutorial for what to do or how to progress but it's a survival game so it's fun to learn the hard way, especially when the hard way means getting your body gnawed on by dinosaurs. When you first join the game you are welcomed by a character creation screen. You can choose either Male or Female and then customize your look. The customization is a little sparse at the moment with some awkward scale adjustments for the body. After fiddling around with it for a while, I just ended up going with something very close to the default look.\n\nOnce you create your character and choose one of 4 general areas to spawn (North/South/East/West) you find yourself waking up on a beach and scratching your arm that has some weird implant in it. This implant seems to be the key to how you manage your inventory, crafting, and leveling up. The first thing you will notice when you start on your beach is just how good this game looks and it is truly beautiful. The sun is beating down onto the beach where the water meets the sand. The trees in the richly detailed forest sway in the wind and the grass and foliage cover the landscape before you. So much vibrant life all around you and then you see the dinosaurs.\n\nThe dinosaurs are very detailed and bring a since of awe to the game just like the first scene you see in Jurassic Park. Luckily you see mostly herbivores but do be careful because there are some small carnivores you can run into on the beach as well. It seems that the most dangerous wildlife can be found more inland. That isn’t to say that these herbivores are pushovers. That triceratops or giant turtle will most likely kill at this point in the game, so don’t attack them just yet.\n\nYou begin your hard life of survival punching some trees and picking up rocks until you can craft your first pickaxe and move on from there. You can collect berries and fibers from the plant life, bash giant boulders to smithereens, and chop down any tree. You will need all of these materials to craft better items, starting with some clothes to cover up your nakedness.\n\nThis brings us to experience. You gain experience throughout the game from doing any action. Collecting materials, crafting, and combat all add to your experience pool. If you are in a tribe you gain bonus xp from your tribe mates. Once you level up you get to choose one stat to increase permanently (health, stamina, attack, weight, etc…) and then you earn some engram points to use towards learning new items to craft. The more you level, the stronger you get and the more you learn to craft. So far this is the only way to learn recipes for crafting.\n\nThis is a survival game as well so you have to keep an eye on your overall health. You can’t let yourself get too hot or cold, clothes, fire, and water help with this. You can’t let yourself starve so you need to forage for berries and hunt the wildlife. With eating comes defecating so make yourself regularly take a dump or your character will just act like a horse and take it anywhere they please. Actions require stamina and your character will tire if the stamina is depleted. You need to stay hydrated as well so go dunk your head in some water or craft a flask. If you take an excessive blow or fall from too high you will break a bone and walk at a snail’s pace so do be careful.\n\nYou can hunt the dinosaurs in this game but you can also tame and even ride some of them. This process can be long depending on the dinosaur you wish to tame so be prepared before you do so. You basically either punch or shoot them with sling shots/arrows until they get knocked unconscious. Once unconscious you need to load them up with their respective food type (berries for herbivores, meat for carnivores). Make sure you have narco berries to feed them as well so that they can stay under for the entire time it takes. Some dinosaurs take a single in game day to tame while others can take multiple days. It is always easier to tame a dinosaur with a group of friends. If you have learned the ability to craft that dinos saddle, then you can also ride them to your heart’s content.\n\nThis also brings us to the multiplayer interaction. This is a survival game so banding together with others increases your odds of survival. You also have to be weary of those who don’t have your welfare in mind and are only looking out for themselves. If you can band together you can create your own tribal town with dino protectors and likeminded players. This will also protect you from those looking to do harm. When you log out of the game your character goes to sleep and is vulnerable. If you have friends and tamed dinos, this makes it safer to log out when you are done.\n\nThere is so much to this game and it is only in early access. The devs have promised a plethora of more content to come and I am looking forward to all of it. For now I will try and do my best to survive this harsh world. My next goal is to tame a raptor and ride him/her… if it doesn’t kill me first…","June 4, 2015","true","47.7"," 211 of 244 people (86%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","86","211","244","20","5"

It is not an easy game and survivng takes a lot of effort and planning! Probably a game best played with friends or in a group (because on your own is going to take a long time to make a study house and when other gangs come knocking on your door they wil kill you!). I for one like the whole engrams side of the game (blueprints for crafting) and I am glad you do not lose these upon death (only items are lost upon death).\n\nA few issues do need fixing (and the Devs say they are working on it). The game needs optimizing (everybody know's that by now). Every so often the server will lag and at the wrong time and this can cost you your life!. The levelling up I believe takes a little bit too long in my opinion and I think you should get a lot more experience points when you tame a dinosaur (since it can take hours to do so). You will probably notice every so often dinosaurs that are stuck and make for easy kills/taming etc so I would like to see this fixed! I would also like to see dinosaurs die when they fall off the side of a cliff (at the moment iv seen several falls from cliffs and survive ha)\n\nSo overall I really enjoy this game but I can understand why people may want to wait a few weeks til everything is sorted out and then buy the game, but I couldn't wait that long and I'm glad I didnt :).\n\nHere is the video in which the tortoise destroys my house and me!!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2O3RG5U_kPU","June 4, 2015","true","139.2"," 573 of 726 people (79%) found this review helpful 639 people found this review funny","79","573","726","639","10"

(we found their livestream while they were raiding us)\nThe problem is that they must have had admin access or something cuz they could open up our doors/gates like normal, and would remove generators that were guarded behind multiple layers of metal disabling all our turrets without firing a shot.\nNot to mention we'd fly by with a full lvl bird with TONS of health and one shot would instant kill any dino we had.\n\nI would be okay with some aimbots cuz at least we'd have a chance to fight them off. But there's no chance of winning against that type of hacking which is apparently getting quite common\n\nWe had several people from huge tribes that put 1000+ hours into the game to build up massive defenses and huge amounts of dinos all be destoryed without being able to do a thing to stop it\n\nThe game it's self is amazing, love it. Great playing with people. But on your own the game is impossible to get almost anywhere, and hacking is so rampade that you risks losing a dino that took you 20+ hours to tame in seconds with nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nIt's a trolls pradise for horrible people to torture and destory months of your life in a blink of an eye\nIt was so infuriating that many players that it created a lot of racism to chinese people in general because of how dirty the cheating was.\n\n\nEDIT: I have seen that the Devs have been hard at work trying to better secure against super hardcore hacking.\nI still can't really recommend this game to most people I know since the online interaction basically is one or 2 super tribes a server that will destory you because they can. We tried to restart on a new server and worked on that for about a week before the big tribe came in and just demo'd our base because they could.\nQuite a lot of time and work lost due to people being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it makes really angry when people act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s just because they can. Kind of makes me want to learn how to hack just to wipe them from the server.","October 30, 2015","false","308.2"," 1,262 of 1,645 people (77%) found this review helpful 156 people found this review funny","77","262","1","156","92"

Find one friend he starts tribe of Senator Armstrong. We build a fire and hideout in the ruins of a broken house. As we gather supplies along the beach a person riding a T-rex runs by almost chomping Senator Armstrong as he says "Nom Nom Nom" over his mic. We immediately run inside our poor shelter as he runs off clearly not interested in us. build small thatch base hidden by rocks on the beach go to sleep for the night.\n\nDay 2: Wake up to find out a dilosaur broke through our thatch walls and killed us in our sleep. I learned that you need some dinos to protect you at night or else you might as well sleep outside and wait to die rather than have your house destroyed. More friends join Senator Armstrong and myself (total of 4 now). Start upgrading thatch base walls to wooden walls for extra protection. tamed a parasaur and raptor. While picking berries got snatched up by a player riding a pteranodon. He yelled for me to not attack his pteranodon, and informed me to be careful of a person who owns multiple T-rexs in the area and drops me off at the beach. its 12:30 a.m. I'm about to head to bed as a group of people riding T-rexs comes and destroys our house, bed, kills my sleeping tribesmen, and our dinos. I finally find our destroyed base and build a bed in the ruins. Finally head to bed in RL.\n\nDay 3: Tribe builds a wood fort in the woods hidden between two cliffs a little off the beach and tames 2 raptors, turtle, and a phiomia. Phiomia is named Chubster Mike and has a cool pair of shades on. He is our new mascot we glitched him inside the building where he silently watches over us as we sleep. Raptors have saddles now and we can gather hide much quicker than previously. Built a wall around our wood fort and a dino gate so we can set dinos to aggressive at night. carnotaurus (slightly smaller T-rex) wanders near base we punch and use slingshots to knock it unconscious. T-rex finds us while taming carnotaurus, pull turtle out from base since he has an absurd 1400 hp and he tanks T-rex while we shoot it with arrows (OP turtle). stay up until 3:00 am taming carnotaurus.\n\n(Time of writing this review Day 4)\nDay 4: Extremely Tired at work constantly worrying about carnotaurus. Almost wanted to take a day off work since it is friday so I don't have to sleep. I realize now how addicted I have become to this game, So addicted I write this review while pretending to write my reports.\n\nAbove is my personal experience playing Ark now I will write my opinions on the game and things to watch out for.\n\nI recommend playing on an official server pvpve when I first convinced my friends to buy Ark Evolved they joined a PVE server and the lag was so bad they were ready to refund the game after 90 minutes. Luckily i got home around that time and joined an official server pvpve and talked them into trying it one more time. On the pvpve server there was almost no lag just a bit of desync once in a while. They slowly got over their bad mood and are having fun now.\n\nThere is server lag mostly noticeable when fighting raptors they rubber-band all over the place makes it hard to hit them with a slingshot or even with a spear. The lag isn't nearly as bad when fighting larger dinosaurs as they normally aren't very agile.\n\nYour character does sleep while you are offline and persists inside the game. This can be frustrating especially when your base is destroyed and you are killed while at work or sleeping. Having had this happen to us twice now losing everything we worked for I have a different take on this. I think this is a great factor for the game because my tribe is constantly rebuilding and finding ways to make a better base more well hidden and better defended from dinos. As a result we are gaining xp without ever focusing on the grind. It brings the team together and puts us on a common goal, SURVIVAL.\n\nPlay this game with a group of friends or join a tribe and make friends in game I feel it is a must for both leveling and overall enjoyment. You can play solo but you will level slower, and have a much more difficult time.\n\ncons\n-Requires a powerful CPU to run still needs a lot of optimization.\n-A little bit of server lag mostly noticeable when fighting quick dinos such as raptors.\n\nSeriously get this game its amazing.\n\nAs I write this post a friend took the day off of work and has just checked the base. The carnotaurus is alive (YAY!)\nI am playing on official server 81 which is pvpve\n\nThe addiction is real 10/10\n\n(the following section was added June 30, 2015)\n\nI am torn whether or not I should update this review because it reflects the experience I had with the first 10-20 hours of gameplay as a noob. I feel that I caught a good glimpse of what you will experience as a new player that is learning the game for the first time.\n\nUnfortunately the review doesn't address any late game aspects of the game which where most people will spend their time focusing on. I added a few intermediate tips below and address the controversial issue of griefing while offline (PVO).\n\nHonestly now that I have experienced more of the game and due to recent patches this review is pretty much obsolete. Stone walls fix the griefing problem in my opinion. They can't be torn down by any decent sized dino (immune to dino damage) and only take like 2-4 damage from metal weapons. These walls have 10,000 hp which means someone wanting inside your house will have to swing at the walls 2,500-5,000 times. Not to mention the metal tools they are using will break and need to be repaired using metal ingots, hide, wood many times in the process. Alternatively explosives can be used to knock them down, but those take high end materials and can blow through metal anyways. Now that I am lvl 62 it is obvious that until around lvl 35 when you can make pteranodon saddle and longneck rifle you really have no tools to fend for yourself. At 35 it would be possible to pick up people riding the bigger dinos with your pteranodon drop them from the sky for the kill, while using the longneck rifles to counter enemy flyers. Pteranodons are also faster than argentavis which is the most popular pvp flyer so can be used to out maneuver and pick players up from their argentavis. Before at least lvl 35 though build stone walls for deterrence and try to keep your base low key and out of sight away from beaches/rivers.\n\ntip- Keep your storage chests unlocked because if/when someone does break into your house they won't be forced to break your storage chests for the loot inside.","June 19, 2015","true","748.3"," 336 of 415 people (81%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","81","336","415","98","13"

I've played more of ARK than I ever have of the Stomping Lands. But like the Stomping Lands or any other survival game, it's not the game that's the problem, it's the people.\n\nAND THIS REVIEW ONLY APPLIES TO PVP SERVERS, MOSTLY OFFICIAL.\n\nMy time in official servers are indeed limited. But the mix of what I have seen and reports from my friends and other Ark players tell me that Official servers are bad. One of the moderators has apparently even called them cesspools. Unofficials aren't immune to griefing, but you'll be better off in them.\n\n\n\nARK: Survival Evolved is a different take on what we wanted since the Stomping Lands. Surviving against dinosaurs and teaming up with friends to harness the awesome strength of these animals and build amazing forts. Sadly, what we have right now is a grief fest with dinosaurs in the background.\n\nIt IS the Stomping Lands. Sure, it's prettier, it's got more species and structures and blah blah blah. But I see dinosaurs wandering around aimlessly in ridiculous numbers with no proper herding behavior, angry predators that can chase you forever and kill everything in their path until they die, and people just KoSing and destroying everything in sight. There is little, in its current stages, setting this apart from the Stomping Lands. But there is tons of potential here and the devs can easily move ARK away from its deceased predecessor.\n\nAs it stands, ARK's gameplay is like the Stomping Lands in that you're probably going to log on to your stuff being destroyed. The only way to prevent that is to get amazing defences as quickly as you can. I did that once, tamed a bronto before I was even half way to getting the saddle. He became obsolete after Tyrannosaurs were powered up, and a Tyrannosaur that was lower level than him killed him before that patch anyway. I now have my own Tyrannosaur, and my tribe has only been raided one time since we got him...and by raided I mean the people attempted to raid us but our Tyrannosaur ate them all.\n\nBefore all the 'hardcore' PvP lovers come yelling at me and calling me a carebear and that I should go to PvE, let me make one thing clear. I don't mind PvP, PvP can be fun, but not as it is now. Let me explain better for those of you who do not have the game yet.\n\nLike Rust, which I have not played, ARK uses a 'sleeper' mechanic. You log off, your unconcious body remains in the world for others to do with as they please. If you've worked hard, hopefully you have a decent wall and a few loyal dinosaurs between your loot and any looters. However, the tamed dino AI is somewhat lackluster, as are the sensory ranges of some of the animals over all. And the balancing is even worse.\n\nThis game suffers from a bad case of PvO. Player versus Offline. Essentially, you log off, cowardly raiders ride in on their dinosaurs, kill your dinosaurs since your dinosaurs don't attack as fast as mounted ones do, and then proceed to steamroll your base into the dirt, taking all your hard earned goodies with them. The raiders who attacked our base were PvOers. None of my tribe was online. It was only because of our Tyrannosaurus that our stuff is in tact. This sort of stuff will likely be the only combat you ever see, or rather never see. That, or KOSing by fresh spawns or griefing trolls. I was knocked unconcious for a handful of berries and stone pickaxe once. No joke.\n\nAs it stands, there is no viable way to defend your base. There are turrets, but you must constantly resupply them with fuel and ammunition. Your dinos are probably going to do jack diddly squat, because someone is always going to have a dinosaur that is stronger than yours, and probably more of them. I can't list the number of animals I've tamed or began taming, only for them to be killed by someone 'fer de lolz'.\n\nIf you buy this game as it is now, you will only be met with your work being destroyed, a multitude of times. I play on an unofficial server, and these are apparently better, especially ones where the admins and owners are active, vocal, and friendly. But you WILL lose your work, and you will most likely be offline when it happens.\n\nI want to recommend ARK, I do. If you can get your friends together it can be good fun, fleeing from hungry carnotaurs, or doing battle with a tyrannosaurus, but the fact of the matter is that you will encounter cowards who will destroy your work time and again because they're bored or get some sick pleasure out of it. Until the developers can find some cure to the PvO issue, I really just can't say you should buy it right now. You WILL waste your time rebuilding.\n\nWill I keep playing it? Most certainly, but the fact of the matter is that the PvO is starting to take its toll in other ways and it's not good. Ruins are being left like confetti on New Years' Eve in Time Square. The coast is littered with abandoned huts and bases, all broken into by griefers or raiders. And likely, the owners were offline when it happened.\n\nAs soon as a cure to this ailment is found, I shall change my review. Until then, I just have to say no to buying it, for sake of your time and money. You WILL invest hundreds of hours into this game, I can tell you that. But most of that time should not be spent building back what you had because you actually had to go to sleep, or work, or go to school.","June 22, 2015","false","690.5"," 1,775 of 2,348 people (76%) found this review helpful 134 people found this review funny","76","775","2","134","70"

I've had some great fun, and some good times.  I run a Un-official private server.  Overall the game was pretty good,  the game does suffer from PVP and PVE split options, such as many items in game are useless or nerfed to useless to make them pointless.  But that is okay its a nature of development in progress.\n\nRegardless it was a good time, some nagging issues in core features was wearing myself and well as friends down.  But again early access so hopefully in time they will improve.  (Building pain, Survival is kinda of not a game aspect post the first day of play.  Lots of maintenance time sinks)\n\nThen game along Battleye...\n\nBattleye Anti-cheat was added to ARK a few weeks back.  Information as to what all was entailed in the addtion of Battleye via ARK (Wildcard)  wasn't really laid out prior to the patch it came in with.\n\nWildcard (ARK devs)  Drops this 3rd party software into their patch.  Battleye has all of its files put in place on your root drive, as well as within the ARK directories.  Basically all the parts of being installed minus a single command to imbed it into your kernal.\n\nOn launching ARK you were prompted to Accept Battleye EULA. (Note the EULA was not listed to read it was buried in a file on your hard-drive basically hidden.)    So you were blind to what you were accepting basically.  Simply because it did not load or show up,  Battleye Devs said basically "well its on your drive read it"  Yeah....   The EULA stated "upon installation of battleye you accept the EULA"   Ironically the files are placed onto your drive, before you even were able to accept the EULA so you are forced to accept the EULA...    Devs say that putting Exicutables ect on your drive is not a installation.... yeah I call BS.    Even if you hunted down the files and removed them.  Each patch places those files right back onto your PC.  So you get to hunt down the files in multiple locations to remove them.   Also to note,  Battleye is installed at the Kernal level,  So to remove you have to have above normal PC experience to stop and delete services from Admin control command prompty via tryped commands.   Also to note, Battleye is self updating with no prompting and can change its operation as per what ever the Battleye devs decided to change it too.   Its a Very Large backdoor into your PC plain and simple.  Ironically they are quick to post saying their intentions are good and the strive to protect our info.  Yet they legally won't place that into you know legal privacy statement or EULA......  Ironic\n\nSo Battleye has a good bit of negitive crap on the net,  Battleye Devs claim its all hackers trash talking their service.  I wholely think the mass majority of it is crap stirred up by hackers.   But the Battleye Devs, are pretty much disrespectful to people with concerns, they have made changes in a few places.  But off course, if your not PRO battleye you are just "Criticizers" as per Battleye.  Basically everyone is a evil hacker and your not allowed to be just a player with concerns about their privacy.  Simply put the Battleye Devs are very passonate, but quick to agression, un-professional and speak down to anyone with concerns.   Also note,  Battleye itself has been hacked so lets hope their not comprimised and we pay the price for the backdoor into our PC is not misused.\n\nNon-Professional Devs in conduct and community communication (Battleye)  is the last people I would want to have a backdoor into my PC and my trust.\n\nWhat Does battleye do?\n\nBattleye Reads anything saved and ram,  If its in ram it can read it copy it and send it to the Battleye servers and saved.  Keep in mind, You have no idea what was sent, how long its stored, nor when they do it.  Also to keep in mind anything you do on your PC is copied into ram and left, as most programs ect do no unload from ram.  So  anything you have done that sit in RAM is fair game to Battleye.  Check some banking?   Hey look RAM saved info!\n\nFile scanning?  Yeah pretty much no matter how you slice it, its allowed and can/will sifting through files.  Supposedly only Hacking files.....but they have stated sometimes other files get sent was well.....\n\nEULA is 100% protect Battleye and you have no leg to stand on or protection.  They have no Privacy Statement to protect your information (Check out steam they have a nice one to protect us)  But Battleye doesn't want to be responsible if their software causes your information to be hacked or stolen via battleye's own software backdoor on your PC.  Let alone the files the send to their servers (the ones we don't get to see or approve) if those are stolen well tough luck battleye is safe your not.\n\nBattleye,  At first has no UNINSTALL program or feature.  I guess after our concerns they added one to the steam luncher.  Now no tsure if they are still patching the files back in every patch but I would bet yes.  Also why can't it be a seperate programe we install? You know one that shows up in our program list?  Nah its hidden idling in tke Kernal ready to be used on command as a backdoor to check your system out....\n\nRegardlesss Wildcard (ARK) Dropped this into our laps, and exposed us without much information of how this is going to work.   I Trusted Wildcard,  After this I Distrust them.....\n\nCheck out the forums they have a pinned topic on Battleye, as their trying to improve a few features to appear less like a un-professional company and more like a real legit one we might trust.  I don't think respect to those with concerns is going to happen, and any company that can't keep it calm and professional in regards to concerns even if some are bad, just screams un-professional.  Anyway check it out.\n\nIn the end, I can't and do not trust Battleye based on their interactions and how they have injected their software on to my PC.  I do not Trust Wildcard for allowing it to happen.\n\nMaybe in time Battleye will step up and join the world of professional upstanding companies, but to me they are as bad as hackers.  Best part is anyone concerned with battleye....is a hacker in battleye's opinion and communications as they imply a lot.\n\nAnyway have fun all, I'm taking a break for them to clean up their act.  My server lost its entire population over this breach of trust.  So we shut it down to wait and see.","February 10","false","789.9"," 1,201 of 1,579 people (76%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","76","201","1","80","65"

My brother and I were in the guild "Pirates" on  Official Server 305. There's a tribe by the name of Brother Union on 305: the infamous chinese hackers.\n\nThey have bragged in general chat multiple times about having duped C4 and grenades. There have been multiple people from multiple tribes who have recorded multiple videos showing BU hacking with aimbots and ESP (the fact that ESP is even a thing points to shoddy programming: why does the client even have access to data neccessary for an ESP hack to work?).\n\nThere is also a littany of forum posts about BU, every one of them with the same copy/pasted response from Nubsly (who then locks the thread):\n---\nAll reports of hacking, cheating, harassment or abuse should be documented and reported to reports@studiowildcard.com as outlined here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/517142253854644884\n---\n\nThat multitude of videos recorded by the various tribes of 305? They've all been forwarded to both valve and WildCard. Months and months have gone by and BU is still there. 305 is completely unplayable because the devs would rather attract new players and their money than fix the blatant hacks and exploits that run rampant.\n\nHere's someone asking for help - not even trying to report BU - just asking for other players to join the server and help fight them. The thread was still locked.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/490125103641550369/\n\n\nOverall its a great game and incredibly fun and addicting but its simply not worth playing until the devs decide to take cheating seriously. Maybe after the games been fully released it will be playable but in its current state you need to play on a private server to have any chance of ensuring you don't get screwed by hackers. This whole debacle has cost Wildcard my respect.

I really do...But, it's intolerable. It will push you to the brink of frustration, and not for the right reasons. I've played over 60 hours, and probably another 60 on my friends account.\n\nI can deal with the optimization problems. It's in early access. They're working hard on it. I can be patient with that...\nI can deal with bugs, and falling through the world, drowning in a bottomless ocean as my newly tamed Carno dies...\nI can deal with taming a new Dino for hours, only to disconnect and have him eaten while logging back in...\nI can deal with my body (full of awesome gear and materials) bugging out, and not letting me retrieve my stuff...\nI can deal with all of that. It's tolerable. I love the challenge an unforgiving game poses.\n\nWhat I can't deal with, and which is why I'm writing this review, is the fact that this persistent world is literally a griefers paradise. Literally days of hard work and frustration (although satisfying frustration) will, not can, will be flushed down the drain...it's an innevitability. Once your base is discovered, you're done. That Bronto that took you 4 hours to tame? Gone. Those Raptors you loved and nurtured since lvl 1? Dead. Those Pterasaurs you painstakingly nursed back to life, and love soaring the island of Ark? Hopefully they booked it at the first sign of trouble.\n\nYes, everything you've worked hard for can and will be destroyed, killed, and looted...while you're sleeping ever so peacefully in your bed. It's not fun. It's a great idea. Kudos to the developers for such an awesome game, and so many great ideas...but it simply doesn't work this way. People are jerks. People ruin good ideas. People ruin everything. It's why rainforests have to be preserved, and beautiful paintings have to be locked away behind glass.\n\nYes, the first few days, you'll laugh it off. You'll shrug, and think "Man, this game is unforgiving...but it's awesome! I'll keep leveling up, and getting better!" You'll feel the highs of accomplishment. You'll feel on top. You'll feel motivated, and set goals...And you WILL be utterly disappointed.\n\nPlease fix this game. It's so close to being one of the best games I've ever played...I just can't recommend this game to anyone with a clean conscience.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------------\n\n\nI told myself I wasn't going to reply to any of these comments, for obvious reasons, but I'll address my feelings on some of the common points being made.\n\n1) Go player Local/PVE server (insert offensive word here).\n\n-Unfortunately, that's what I've been doing. It's not nearly as fun as a PvP server, and I am having to downgrade my playing experience due to the issues mentioned in my Review. I happen to enjoy playing PvP, and like the idea of having to defend my dinosaurs and my base...but, in real time. Waking up after taming/building the entire day before, and seeing that everything has been destroyed/killed/looted while I was sleeping is not enjoyable. I'm not a masochist. I don't enjoy self-inflicted pain.\n\nMy review was intended to, as unlikely as it may be, prompt some kind of change to an aspect of the game that I don't enjoy. I paid the same price that all of you paid. I feel I shouldn't have to downgrade my playing experience, playing an aspect I don't enjoy as much. That's like, for example, I'm playing baseball but the pitcher keeps throwing the ball at my head while I'm batting..."Uhm, hey! Can you please not throw the ball at my head? I want to bat", and then the pitcher and the rest of the opposing team replies "Shuttup noob. Go play T-Ball if you don't like it!"\n\n2) But you're still playing the game! You're a hypocrite...\n\n- Again, I enjoy the game. I mentioned in my review how much I enjoyed the game. I like PVP much more than I like PVE (which I'm currently playing). I do not enjoy PVO (player vs Offline) at all, which is extremely prevalent in PVP servers.\n\n3) If you enjoy the game, why did you give it a negative review?\n\n- There's an old saying that goes "the squeeky wheel gets the grease." That basically means, if we want to enact a change, we need to squeek a little. Unfortunately, there are only two options...Recommend or Not Recommend. If an individual were to read my review, and doesn't want to experience the same issues, then they would be able to save themselves $30. People often check Negative reviews for the, obviously, negative aspects of a game. You can only learn so much from a review about how great it is to be able to poop in the game...","June 24, 2015","false","415.7"," 1,556 of 2,088 people (75%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","75","556","2","168","104"

If you can't handle PvP, don't play it. If you can't wait for tames to finish, don't play on a server with unaltered rates/XP. There's so many solutions for the problems that people have. The models may not be accurate, but they are amazingly detailed and well made. (Technically every species in ark is a subspecies so NOTHING is inaccurate.) The feeling of success in the game is euphoric, from taming your first pack of dilos, to taming a giga, from your first thatch home, to your metal fortress covered in turrets. Some people complain that it is a grind, and it can be depending on what angle you look at it from. If your killing everything in sight to level up just because you want, its a grind. But if you keep yourself occupied in between levels it isn't that bad at all. All the game mechanics and soon to be added mechanics make surviving either a struggle, or extremeley easy just depending on your area.

In this time, however, I've played on both PVP and PVE servers and had a go at hosting a server of my own.\n\nWhen I first bought ARK I quit the game after 2 minutes and didn't return to it for months. My PC isn't a beast, but it plays all the games I own at a decent Frames Per Second with good settings. I was absolutely astounded, however, when I could barely hit 10 FPS on the lowest of settings. It was completely unplayable and a great deal of the community had the same problem. A few months later and the developers have patched and updated the game so much that, with a few 'launch parameters', I can play this game at around 50 FPS with good settings. This game IS demanding, but I would think negatively towards anyone who doesn't recommend this game based on it's performance. It's come along way already - think how much further it can be optimised!\n\nBut most people know about the performance issues and if YOU didn't know about them before this, I suggest you read into it on the forums etc. to make sure you'll be happy with the game you purchase. Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the gameplay!\n\nThe first server I joined was an Official PVP server. This means that the gather rate, XP gain, taming speed etc. was all at standard speed (x1). If you're new to the game, or you've only played on x1 servers this may not seem that bad, but trust me, it gets VERY tedious, VERY quickly. You could end up having to babysit an unconscious T-Rex for hours upon hours while it tames, only for it to get killed in a raid or PVP fight in minutes. If you have the time and patience, then please be my guest.\n\nNow, if all the servers had these settings and the modding community wasn't as great as it is, I would have probably never played this game again. Instead, you can find a plethora of servers packed with mods and custom settings that, in my opinion, REALLY bring the game to life! Some servers are a little bit silly, being about to tame an extremely high level Bronto in 2 mins for example, but if that's your cup of tea, don't let anyone stop you!\n\nThe aforementioned mods are numerous and varied, ranging from new content such as advanced machinery, to level changing scripts that make wild dinos stronger and even total coversion mods that change the whole game so you're either a pirate or stuck permanently in 'cave-man mode'.\n\nI for one, will never be able to go back to a vanilla (un-modded) server with x1 settings. It's too much of a chore. If you're hesitant about wether you'll be able to put up with it too, check the Steam Workshop and you'll see what I mean. Check YouTube too. There are many famous youtubers with daily episodes.\n\nI purposely have avoided detailed descriptions of things you can do in this game because I think it's more fun to explore them yourself. Besides, there are many reviews with that kind of info already.\n\nI hope this review helped at least some what!\n\n-XCAL\n\n","May 7","true","530.4"," 138 of 162 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","138","162","12","4"

Fully expecting to die on this journey, I didn't pay attention to where I was going, but took off. The first night consisted of making myself some armor and tools. After crafting a spear and collecting all the meet I could carry, I was off. The first day was a roller coster of emotions and close calls as I roamed the island from supply drop to supply drop. With each new loot box, I became more powerful and cautiously optimistic that this would work out. I found myself well armed and starving atop a mountain with a few parachutes I had just collected.\nI did the only logical thing and dove off the mountain, soaring across a ravine and past brontosaurs like a scene from jurassic park. I landed next to another supply drop, and to my surprise, found the makings of a decent wooden house.\nWith the ability to make a small abode, I decided traveling alone had gotten lonely, so i used my bow and tranq arrows to take down a small dilo, that would be named Mr. Spitter. Life was good, we traveled together and became close friends. Mr. Spitter had my back and I had his, but all of my gear had gotten too heavy, and the little dilo couldn't help much. It was time for a mount.\nThe only mount of choice for a wander in this game is the raptor, its speed and lethality make it a perfect traveling companion. with some time and hunting, I brought down a raptor and tamed it slowly. So slowly, im fact, that I got Mr. Spitter a mate, and hunted with them while my raptor was tamed. I returned to the raptor just before he became a loyal companion to place my new forged saddle on him and rode off into the sun.\nUsually this would be the happy ending, but in all survivor games like this one, there is no happy ending. Either you quit while you're content, or you live long enough to see everything taken from you. My new family and i traveled together until I found a supply drop under water. With the loot pulling me forward like a moth to a flame, I dove in the river and my trusty companions followed me in. Little did I know what lurked beneath the surface. Piranha swarmed us and devoured Mr. Spitter alive before I could even react. I pulled out my spear just in time for my second dilo to die. I couldn't let Speedy, my raptor, suffer the same fate. In a flurry of thrusts, I managed to save Speedy by a hair. The loot that laid inside contained the remaining pieces i needed for a house.\nFilled with sorrow, I decided it was time to head home and rebuild a base for my tribe, but I soon realized I was lost. Speedy and I roamed for hours searching for landmarks to guide us home. I finally found the path home and eagerly followed the beach along the river to where I could rest for the night. Speedy was tired from running, and we were both to the limits of what we could bare to carry. I decided to give speedy a break and jump off, just to luckily find a stegosaraus egg. I thought it would be nice to return to the tribe with another dinosaur that we could all hatch and train together. I didn't notice the two large dinodaurs who were watching the egg closely, and didn't appreciate a stranger taking their young. THey were on me before I could draw my weapon. I had over encumbered myself, and Speedy counldn't move. I died slowly trying to drop the egg, and received the final blow as i attemted to join speedy to make my get away. As I lay dying on the beach, I watched as Speedy was slowly beaten to death by two enemies he should have never met.\nMy wishful thinking turned to greed, and lead to dispair. I awoke at the shambles of our base, naked and alone, with nothing left to show for my time on the island.\nHonestly a great game if you enjoy a true survival format and I highly recomend it to anyone willing to put the time in to get the rewards they want.","June 25, 2015","true","184.1"," 142 of 169 people (84%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","84","142","169","67","4"

This game is a survival game with a twist, it has dinosaurs along with other extinct animals. This game actually reignited my interest in dinosaurs from when i was a little kid. If you want the best experience for this game, i would advise you to play on PVE servers or a private server with friends.\n\nArk's Pro's\n\nThis game has great dev's, They update the game at least twice a week, and push out new content at least once a week. So as of right now, this game will not be getting stale for the people who play alot for a very long time.  ARK has REALLY beautiful graphics.This game also features a huge open world enviornment along with a day/night cycle and temperature. There is also a little bit of endgame content which includes taking down tough creatures and collecting artifacts which is found in dangerous caves to summon the final boss. ARK is capable of supporting mods for the people who love creating modifications.\n\nArk's Con's\n\nThe game is still pretty poorly optimized so don't be suprised when your game runs at half the frames you are used to. Official PVP servers are normally plauged by really big PVP tribes that will raid you the chance they get to. This will not affect you if you play on PVE or private servers. Official servers are pretty unstable as of right now. But by far the worst con in my opinion is the taming system. Taming some creatures can take as long as 10 hours or even longer. I really think they need to cut the taming time down a lot. But thankfully you dont exactly have to stand over them the whole time, you can do other things while you are taming a creature. But if you want to avoid long taming times, join some unofficial servers that provides faster taming times.\n\nOverall, This game has much better pro's than con's. You can fix most con's by just joining the right servers. The dev's are really helpful and updates very often so you shouldnt have to worry about bugs in the game that much.

As this bore no result i decided to go punch something else. I soon beset upon a small gathering of dodo’s who attempted communication by squawking, I immediately took this to be an insult and beat most of them to death with my bare hands. a few minutes later I figured out how to put some meager tools together and picked some berries to try and domesticate some dodos, I failed miserably.\n\nDay 2, figured out how too make a slingshot and took out a dodo and force fed it berries. According to the bestiary the dodo doesn’t do much so I decided to name it “Emergency Food”. after putting together some spears I sought to slate my blood lust with the hunt. The first non dodo beast i came across was a dilophosaurus which immediately spat in my face. After blindly throwing spears in every direction i managed to kill the rude prick that had no meat on him. Not 30 seconds later a big ♥♥♥ scorpion descended upon me like a sack of thunder, after only 4 thrown spears it went down but not after i tranquilized me on its sweet scorpion juices. As I lay their on the brink of consciousness i hear a faint flapping and then a thud. I started taking damage and I could barely make out  the beast which appeared to be a big ♥♥♥ Condor that picked out my small intestines while I lay there helpless.\n\n10/10 would feed birds again\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\n\nDay 33, I have finally tracked down and tamed the bird that ate my intestines. He gazed at me in an almost shocked manner, and i met that gaze with a hail of arrows dripping in the poison of my hatred towards the avian fiend. In a flash of feathers, talons, and arrows the battle was over as fast as it began. The feathered transgressor fell unconscious. As i pondered weather or not to return the kindness of the beast when his family fell upon me with great fury and anger. I tear into bag of human blood as I dove to meet my enemies allies I drew my metal pike, "Chicken ♥♥♥♥er". Within moments of the conflicts ingition, it ended in a gurgled squawk. Before me lay 3 dead Argentavis' and one that still lay unconscious. I had made my decicion. I cleaned the corpses of the gargantuan carrion feeders and started to cut them into several small pieces. After I gathered all of the flesh I slowly started to slip it to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bird that feasted on my sweet insides almost a month before. Now e knows the taste of his own clan.\n\nDay 34: After a few hours of feeding him his family, I have tamed the beast that consumed me.

I've been very cautious about survival games after the past few I tried have all let me down, bigtime. I usually shy away from PvP in games, so naturally I was hesitant to play this one. A few weeks ago, I received it as a gift from my significant other, and finally gave it a shot.\n\nFirst of all, what worried me the most about this game, was the many many stories I read about joining and being instantly ganked, being killed in their sleep, being griefed, trolled, and every other horrible PvP thing that can possibly happen. So far I just have not experienced this. Maybe I have just been very lucky....but so far I have not yet ran into someone who instantly tried to kill me. Everyone has been friendly, saying hello on voice, offering supplies, and I even met a tribe leader that took me into the tribe to teach me the basics. I just have not seen the toxicity that some other reviews talk about. But again, maybe I just got lucky.\n\nThe game is beautiful. A screenshotter's paradise. It is graphics intensive but Im able to play on high without many issues (I get short freezes when I enter a new biome while flying, that's about it). There are also frequent latency issues on the official servers.\n\nContent is added all the time. It seems like every few days there is a new dino being added, and there are pretty much daily updates. I saw many negative reviews that say "the devs don't care", but I am not sure where that idea came from. Maybe I'm missing something, but they seem quite passionate about the game to me.\n\nFor me the game is very addictive. It is HARD for me to get "sucked into" a game on Steam. I usually play for about 12 hours and then move on. But so far in Ark I'm at 60 hours and usually log off still wanting to play more.\n\nThere are some small things that bug me, and they are kinda silly things...mainly the artistic freedom the devs use on the dinos. I know they said they aren't going for total accuracy, but small things like the Stego having 6 tail spikes instead of 4 makes me roll my eyes. Same with the two downwards-pointing horns on the Ankylo's chin. Just minor things.\n\nOverall for me, the game is one of the best I've played on Steam so far. I am really loving it, and look forward to logging in every night.","October 8, 2015","true","270.6"," 236 of 306 people (77%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","77","236","306","22","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radiantblur/recommended/346110/","radiantblur","Rebs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radiantblur/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGame Details\n\nPublished by:  Studio Wildcard\nDeveloped by: Studio Wildcard ,Instinct Games ,Efecto Studios ,Virtual Basement\nGenre:  Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Early Access\nRelease Date: 2 June, 2015\nCompletionist Gameplay: 100+\n\nLet’s start this review off with the most talked about issue surrounding the game: its performance. While there is a very comprehensive menu with lots of settings you’d never have thought to create in regards to the visual settings, even with a blend of medium to low settings I seem to max out on 15 frames per second with a few random glitches. While it is playable and no where near as bad as it was when it first came out, it isn’t ideal. If your system can somehow run the higher settings, then the game is incredibly beautiful and you’re going to want to take hundreds of screenshots.\n\nBefore you start to play, you’ll have the option of creating your survivalist. You are presented with sliders for head, torso, leg, foot and arm widths, lengths and heights. You can change the colour of your survivalist’s hair and eyes, though you can’t really see your eyes anyway and the hair colours are kind of dull. You unfortunately only have one hairstyle, and I’m hoping that once the game leaves Early Access it will have several options to choose from. Honestly, the best part about the sliders overall is that you can have different character heights from all the other players around you, something that not even The Sims 4 has managed to accomplish.\n\nAs you wake up in the world of Ark, you notice the many HUD indicators for survival purposes. Some of these include stamina, food, water, health, oxygen and your level progress. Watching and being aware of these is the most important thing that you can do in this game. If you have too low stamina, you won’t be able to run away from the raptor that is chasing you. If you have too low water or food, your screen will start to become clouded with the same red effect we’re all used too in survival games.\nThese indicators can also be affected by the weather. Severe heat can damage your health, and running through a humid rainforest will take a higher toll on your stamina and hydration levels. A handy feature is being able to drink rain straight from the sky for when you’ve died and lost your waterskin or are too far away from a river, pond or the ocean.\n\nCrafting is a huge component in Ark. If you’re familiar with Rust, the crafting system in Ark is somewhat similar. As you level up, you gain engrams that can be used to unlock blueprints. Blueprints ten levels ahead of you will be hidden, encouraging you to continue to level up to find out what they are. This system also encourages a lot of planning, forward thinking and just plain luck, as you can’t unlock all of the engrams at the same time.\n\nLast but not least, the one major feature that distinguishes Ark from the many other survival games out on the market; the dinosaurs. Able to be tamed and ridden, a source of food and a way to make the resource gathering faster, they are a vital component of the game. As you learn which dinosaurs are dangerous and which are not, you gain confidence with your ability to survive in the land of Ark. Taming dinosaurs is an adrenaline-filled process that requires a lot of teamwork, but the payoff is worth it when you put a saddle on your first T-Rex and stomp off into the sunset. In a major case of art imitating life I accidentally seemed to have exterminated the entire dodo population at one point during my playtime as they were the only non-dangerous sources of meat in the game. Thankfully, it doesn’t take too long for dinosaurs to respawn and when they do they tend to respawn in the same places. This can either make your game raptor-filled hell if you accidentally build your base too close to their spawn points on the island, or very easy, if you build your base on one of the southern islands that no carnivores inhabit.\n\nOverall Verdict\nWhile the performance of this game is lacking and a few key survival concepts of the game haven’t been re-imaged from the other survival games out there, Ark: Survival Evolved is a very fun game that will fulfill your childhood dreams of having a pet Tyrannosaurus Rex, even if you lose everything and your tribe in the process.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","September 2, 2015","true","33.9"," 150 of 188 people (80%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","80","150","188","25","5"

ARK has the potential to be THE one you remember." But it's still some ways off. For starters it's currently running bad. I'm getting about 35ish fps with a 780Ti with settings on medium which is unacceptable. If you don't own a high end system I recommend you to wait until they patch some optimization in.\n\nIf we forget about the performance issues we're looking at what might be the reference in the survival dinosaurs sub genre. The game looks amazing and there are quite a lot of quality options to chose from. Even though, once again, the performance doesn't change all that much. The crafting system is tied with experience which is a pretty good idea. In games like Rust you login and you can immediately start crafting high end stuff (assuming that you have the materials). In ARK you need to spend more time which adds depth. You need to level up in order to craft & acquire some of the high end stuff like a rifle. You also chose where you want to spend your points, stamina, health, movement speed, attacking power, etc. Which for me makes it much more meaningful than other survival games out there.\n\nThere's much more to explore and I'll try to update this review. If you are really into survival gaming and have a top system go ahead. My recommendation comes to the ones wanting to support what seems to be a good start.\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video, it's a First Look into the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GdmGMCACf8&index=1&list=PLBqXrq67D6oruPRVRMvWWIhSBKnPJ5XaA","June 2, 2015","true","718.8"," 353 of 481 people (73%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","73","353","481","20","9"

But my concerns were some of the people on the servers and the amount of time needed in order to accomplish anything decent.\n\nPLEASE READ: The main issue is how easily you can lose things. You could spend hours and hours getting a metal base and tame a very high level dino and all of that could be taken away from you during the time you went downstairs to eat your dinner.\n\nIMPORTANT: I have played this game since day 1 on release. I have seen how it's developed from the very start and that is why I mention later on how I think it got worse. I did love the game from the start but there were certain things that ruined it for me.\n\nOne thing I also need to address is that PVE isn't interesting, yeah sure you can get everything but there is no challenge or exploration involved as you will never stumble across other people. PVE might be fun for you but it definitely isn't for me, it would get boring, quickly.\n\nPVP/PVE : If they implemented something such as PVE/P where you shouldn't attack other tribes or do damage to anything they own unless you declare war on them and both sides agree to it. But, if one side doesn't agree and the other attacks them anyway they should be punished pretty hard about it. Not sure how, but there should be something involved.\nThat seems a little more fair in my opinion, I understand how the game works, PVP speaks for itself...right? But there is also a part of actual fair play, if a massive tribe attacks me for the sh**'s and giggles when I own 2 little dinos and have a small stone base then that is pretty boring and un-necessary. If 2 huge tribes have a serious war, that would be cool as hell and would bring so much more to the game, the PVP potential would be much better and enjoyable if you actually wanted to participate in a battle with someone.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This review might help someone that simply wants to find out about ARK, I believe I clear up points such as time consuption, possible dissapointment and the possible opportunities for fun that I have had and many people also can. Also if they want to look at the positives of the game they can simply click the tab directly next to this one that states 'Positive'.\nto read all the good things it has to offer. This review isn't a definite answer on what the game is like, as after all my problems couldn't mean anything to you and you might enjoy the game regardless of whatever other people say.\n\nAnyone that would like to recommend private servers to me or other players, go ahead but some people don't like private servers including me. I do not like how easy things are, things are given way to easily and too quick. Ark servers are too slow and private ones are too fast. So far there is no balance that is "just right" in my opinion. I guess that's why the game is still early access so they can change that in the future. Please bare in mind that some people prefer to tame a dino in half an hour and have a large stone base after an hour of gameplay and some do geniuanly like the fact that things take a long time.\nEveryone has their own preference.\n\n\nARK was a fun game when it first came out... now it's getting progressively worse.\nThe team is trying to pack more stuff than they can fit onto one little island and there is still\na major problem, at least for me, the taming times are ridicilous. Takes way too long.\nThe game itself is fun and enjoyable (with friends, for the love of Gabe do not play this game solo) If you are fine with spending a massive amount of hours just to get the Triceratops to collect a few berries and then find out the next morning you and your precious lvl 12 Trike have been eaten alive by a T-Rex... go for it, Ark might be for you.\nIf you enjoy the pure idea of an annoying clan that is practically planted in every server to mess\nup your day and cause grief (most likely destroy everything you own or just kill you for fun, and your dinos, you know because why not kill a low level player with a straw house...)\nYeah sure ARK is for you my friend, but for me, having work and school this game is simply unplayable since you have to put in a mass amount of time to lose it over night.\nSo if you're like me and are fairly busy, you might not enjoy the game as you will get dissapointed like me and many others that have stuff to do. If you have a free day, everyday and you don't have to care about anything, buy it as you can become that legendary clan that will be spoken about in a thousand years for your accopmlishments on the ARK Island.\n\nPlease think twice before commenting anything negative, these reviews are personal opinions, just like millions of other reviews online that aren't made by companies such as PCGamer. This is just my own personal thought and some people will agree and some will disagree. Please keep it neutral when commenting.","March 8","false","603.8"," 1,178 of 1,673 people (70%) found this review helpful 150 people found this review funny","70","178","1","150","106"

This game has lived up to all of my hopes and far surpassed some – easily worth the money and STRONGLY recommended to anyone interested in the genre as a whole.\n\n\nNEGATIVE REVIEWS:\nIt is unfortunate that this game has such a solid portion of negative reviews. A strong majority of the negative reviews are complaining that it is unoptimised (as to be expected in early access) and that when they play on low the game doesn’t look good compared to the trailers. I have a decent computer admittedly but I can run on ultra quite playable (scale back to high + to be smoother though) and it looks just as good as the trailer so the graphics are there, the optimisation is coming. The devs are incredibly active and the game is regularly patched in relation to not only preplanned elements but bugs and community suggestions.\n\nFeel free to have a look at my screenshots if you want to see what it looks like at higher (but not full) settings.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/615086038675991453/\n\n\nThe main issues I have experienced is the dino pathing once tamed can be a little rough, especially once you start getting more and more dinos. On more than one occasion our little hunting party of 3-5 Dilos ends up missing one who is later found with its head in a rock somewhere. Far from game breaking but something to be worked on a bit.\n\nThe control of tamed dinos can be a little clumsy (Using whistles to follow/stop works well but changing aggression requires you to go up face to face and cycle through a menu) and it would be great if you could assign groups - if a hunting party of 5 dinos is in the same area as someone else from your tribe with other followers, you manually have to tell each of them to stop - using the 'stop all' whistle will stop all the dinos in the tribe, not just the ones you have following. Note this is quite handy as it allows tribe wide dino control (which has come in VERY handy) but an additional grouping option with 'follow/stop my group' would make things much easier.\nAn option to remotely set dino aggression stance would also be a godsend - In a tribe where we have 20-30 tamed dinos, changing all aggression stances is a task in itself.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs far as gameplay, there is very little I could say against it. The game premise is great, content is through the roof. The levelling mechanic I feel works quite well and gives a small sense of purpose that you build your own experience around. It also allows you to customise your character to fulfil the role you wish to play.\n\nIt is probably best to watch a few videos on taming and other core mechanics so you don’t waste your time as some things in this game do require a large commitment. Overall I think taming works well but do note that taming large dinos is a massive effort... A small Dilo may take 10-20 minutes to tame but once you start going bigger, it starts hurting. Larger herbivores (Trike, stego etc) take over an hour. Our T Rex took 3ish hours and our Bronto took a whopping 4.5 hours to tame (During which time you manage a two progress meters and defend from anyone/thing that comes by). While it is painful it does ensure that the apex animals are the prized possessions they should be.\n\n\nContent wise... I have played a fair bit and haven’t even scratched the surface. We have a small tribe and have built up a bit of a base, tamed a Rex and a Bronto as well as a menagerie of other dinos but still haven’t cleared through more than one small island on the map.\n\nOne thing that I am noticing now our base is expanding is the permanent impact you can have. When we first started our shack on the beach we were on the edge of a forest - Now the mountain is cleared and as we have built there it isn’t growing back. Very interesting sense of permanent change.\n\nWhile we are comfortable in our little area, we still have yet to go into caves, the main mountains or deep underwater. I am currently sitting on 38 hours - The amount of time it would take to 'finish' all the content is staggering and more is coming.\n\n\n\nPVE/PVP:\nWhile I normally stay right away from pure PVP (survival) games, this one makes it work.\n\nThere are still a few of the sociopaths that seem to be everywhere online these days but overall it works quite well. I think the strong PVE backbone (ie. Dinos are bloody dangerous) tones the DayZ effect down a bit and makes for quite a good dynamic. There is still a deep distrust and caution applied when meeting other random people but it is far from a KOS-fest, indeed you will often find yourself cooperating while your interests align. (My tribe has been formed from me and one mate recruiting other stragglers)\n\nPVE works great and levelling makes you far from indestructible (even low level Dilos can be an issue if your weapon is broken or you are taken by surprise without support). I have not seen the ‘endgame’ bosses (Super large creatures you summon with materials found on the largest and most dangerous animals on the Ark) but if you are into the MMO raiding style approach, that is there for you too.\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe beauty of this game though is you can make your own story - Having a tribe is great as it allows you to get larger scale things done (eg. building an expansive and well defended base) but I have equally enjoyed running around solo or with one other on hunting trips, operating out of small temporary outposts. The modding potential of this game is promised to be significant as the devs are giving access to their own editor for creation of mods Originally posted by  The Right Hand:You will have access day 1 to our entirely functional 100% exactly the same as ours custom copy of the Unreal 4 Editor including all of our assets and everything else about the game to do whatever you want with.

It's now end of April. Not really interested in PVP. The game is made for PVP and PVE is quite the afterthought.\n\nI've played this game many hours so far, so you may be wondering how I can give a negative review and recommend that you not buy this game. I'll explain.\n\nThis game requires so much time that literally, you pretty much can't play this game the way it's intended and be employed at the same time. It's just a fact and most will agree. The game is designed by the developers to hook you and devour you. You have to work excessively hard with long hours to tame dinosaurs and breed them. For example, if you don't tame with kibble and just berries, you have to literally sit there for 10 hours and monitor a high level mammoth until it's tamed. Breeding dinosaurs is even worse. A baby giga requires 28 hours straight of handfeeding before it can reach the juvenile stage. Think about that. 28 hrs at your computer hand feeding and waiting. Does that sound like a "game" to you or a second life? What's worse is there is no salary for all that hard work. If you're all down for spending innumberable hours of your life toiling away and that's your only challenge, waiting, then yay for you. Get this game.\n\nI wanted to quit 500 hours ago but my tribe keeps asking me to stay and help them. So I stay and it's not fun. Three quarters of the time I'm in this game, it's a chore, not a game. And it just keeps getting more difficult, more time consuming and more complicated. I guess the developers think that's a plus. It isn't. The reason you can't quit is because after you spend innumerable hours breeding and taming dinos, you don't want to just throw them away. They are hard earned prizes so you hang onto them as long as you can, while your life is wasted. This game can be really one of those terrible games for your mental health if you have any kind of penchant for clinging to games and grinding your life away.\n\nIf you can play this game without engaging in the behaviors that this game attempts to make you engage in, e.g. you don't tame dinosaurs, you let other people do it for you, then you're life won't be wasted, I guess. That's the way I do it. I never work. I claim other people's dinos, fly around, socialize and scavenge off other people's hard work, which is not the way the game is intended to be played. I've only ever tamed one dodo and a couple penguins by myself in 1800 hours of gaming. Not taming or breeding is really the only way to enjoy oneself, in my opinion, unless you don't value your time and your life. And that's what this game is all about really. Taming and breeding. And building. Building is my thing I guess. I've built a bunch of enormous bases. The grind to build is uber-tedious.\n\nAnd make no mistake. Wildcard made $60 million so far and definitely doesn't care if you're their personal blood doll.\n\nThe lag in this game is atrocious. I've never played a game with lag problems anywhere near this one. There's something wrong with it. The lag spikes have become so enormous, I literally go onto google or other internet places while I wait for the rubberband back. Then it happens again and again. Way too often. It's an alpha game though, so whatever. But they are doing nothing to improve it. It's been going on for like 6 months and it never gets fixed.\n\nIt's a good game for basement dwellers, so if you are a lifeless basement dweller, I do recommend it. But I wrote a negative review assuming you're a person with a life and you don't need to have your life wasted by these developer vampires. They've created the game so that you have to stay in it innumerable hours to get anything done, to keep you hooked and to keep you there. I have no idea why they would set that as a goal, given we don't pay a monthly sub to play. Maybe it's just developer naivety and inexperience? It doesn't make sense to make end game so out of reach when you aren't paying a monthly subscription fee. You want to get to end game. It shouldn't take your lifetime.\n\nI think if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bought this game. I look forward to the day  I drop it and I know I'll look back with regret at all the time wasted. My life wasted. Just be forewarned.\n\nThis review is for Official/PVE","April 29","false","063.4"," 915 of 1,302 people (70%) found this review helpful 157 people found this review funny","70","915","1","157","110"

Before I give my 2 cent I would like to say this.\n\nIF YOU ARE EXPECTING A SMOOTH RELEASE WITH NO HITCHES STOP READING AND DON'T BUY THE GAME RIGHT NOW!!!\n\nI'm tired of these people thinking that they can play a finished project when the project is not finished or refined and then complaining about it. This is an early access game.\n\nThat being said the game has a lot of potential and from the few mins I've played I found it pretty fun. Though getting everything off the bat kind of took away from the experience. Thank you devs I do love the fact you're giving me gifts but I think I can manage.\n\nOptimization is needed big time, but I know that will come in due course but untill then I'm fine at the med setting I have it on right now with my GTX 770.\n\nIf you're expecting a game that was shown in the trailers but you don't have a hefty GPU like most of the negative reviewers, Just wait and don't bother buying. But if you can look past that and want to play an unfinished build that they have so far like me. Go for it!\n\nEDIT: 06/03/2015\n\nMy Current PC Specs:\n\nCPU: i7-4790 3.60GHz\nGPU: GTX 770 4GB\nRAM: 16GB\nOS: Windows 7\n\nSo after an hour or so I found a sweet spot with my graphics card and it's running at a decent 25-30 FPS with max Textures running at 1920 x 1080. draw distance is low and various setting set from low to med. Taken screen shots to prove it.\n\nI know I don't have a super high end PC but mine is better than most. that being said after several hours of gameplay I can say it's a real fun game to play. there's a lot of room to improve and yes the otimazation still needs work (but then again it's just been a day). The graphics are quite nice even though I don't have them set to high and it runs nicely on my rig (So if you have anything close to my specs I believe you will get similar results you just have to fiddle a bit).\n\nSo I still keep my initial stand on it. This is an early access game so expect bugs and what nots and I still recommend this game for those willing to look over the obvious bugs. I do however not recommend this game to those running lower then a Nvidia 7xx series card or equivalent unless there is someone out there with something lower that can testify it works well on their rig.","June 2, 2015","true","34.2"," 306 of 418 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","306","418","13","6"

Of those 2200 hours I have played estimated 400 hours on an unofficial server and the rest on official servers in EU (mostly PvPvE, a little bit PVE and PVP hardcore). I really loved ARK, but this love is dying slowly for the last two months.\n\nMany will ask now why somebody who played so many hours would NOT recommend buying ARK. There are several reasons:\n\n1. Recent changes to the strength of tamed dinosaurs\n2. Implementation of a totally overpowered dino named Giganotosaurus\n3. Ridiculuosly long lags for more than 4 months now\n4. Flawed physics\n5. Lack of communication with community\n\nIn more Detail:\n\n1. With patch 231 Wildcard nerfed the attributes of tamed animals. The problem is the scale in which they did it and the fact that most players were satisfied with the state tamed animals were in and saw no reason for changing that. Wildcard went overboard and lowered attributes like hitpoints and damage by up to 80 percent, rendering many tamed animals useless. This is very annoying for players who had many high-level perfect tamed and leveled animals. Animals which were used to farm metal, stone, wood etc. now have a much much lower yield than before. This has as a consequence that getting resources for crafting now becomes a nuisance.\n\nIf Wildcard would have nerfed tamed animals only by 20 percent instead of the actual 80 percent, animals would have been weaker but still usefull and players might have accepted that. But nerfing them by 80 percent is a affront to many players.\n\n2. Back when Wildcard implemented the alpha dinos (raptor, carno, rex) they said that they wouldn't be tamable because this would impact the balance of the game to much. But only two months later they implemented the Giganotosaurus which is far worse than an alpha dino and made it tamable. And to make things worse they gave it the ability to destroy stone structures. Since then it was used hundreds of times by alpha tribes to destroy potential competitors before they even could upgrade their bases to metal. This shifted balance even more towards large and already powerful tribes and hasn't been addressed by Wildcard yet.\n\n3. For more than 4 months now there have been so called 'megalags', intermittend lags up to 15 seconds, often happening every 1 or 2 minutes. On servers with lower count of structures (buildings) lags are less prolonged as on servers with a high count of structures. Wildcard explained those lags with problems with the so called garbage collection and stated already three times in past patchnotes, that they improved the garbage collection. But because of no effect on lags at all (!) I think this were just lies. Additionally there are severe and frequent drops of the framerate while travelling across the island. This issue was also explained by Wildcard and also allegedly 'improved' without any noticable effect.\n\n4. Temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius underwater show that Wildcard devs cut school a little too often. Other things are little animals pushing much larger animals back while attacking them, no bullet drop with sniper rifles, but severe drop with other weapons like rpg launcher, building structures floating in the air after destruction of foundations and so on.\n\n5. At first Wildcard communicated quite well with the community, but lately they push hotfixes without any notification, they push back patches without giving information or giving it hours late and they are giving statements to problems like Giganotosaurus and the actual balancing fail only because they feel pressure from the community. They act more and more like politicians and not like the 'cool dudes' they were in the beginning.\n\n\nI won't conceal the fact that there are many nice things in this game, but at this moment I cannot recommend anyone buying this game due to the problems I described before. I recommend waiting several months and searching for actual information then.\n\nI most likely will pause playing ARK untill this balancing patch is reversed and other problems mentioned are solved too.","January 6","false","234.4"," 740 of 1,050 people (70%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","70","740","1","86","33"

I fully understand it is a EARLY ACCESS GAME, This doesn't change the fact that i don't reccommend it at this state.\n\nI have a firm belief this game will be fantastic in the future but, unless you wish to let the current state of the game deter from the experience of the full release i'd advise you to hold off on purchasing the game until a further date.\n\nPros:\n+ Amazing Sandbox Experience\n+ MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT (Quite suprised the game launched into early access with such a large amount of content)\n+ Building System is fairly standard and not lacking in any way\n+ Nice RPG-like elements to the game. (Leveling is awesome)\nThere are a bunch of more Pros but i'd advise you to experience them for yourself at a later date\n+ The developers are insane with their work ethic, An update gets released almost hourly!\n\nCons:\n- Poor optimization (Feel as if i don't need to beat the dead horse on this one; Laggy, regardless of specs)\n- Bugs\n- I initially percieved the hunger system to be ridiculous, after spending more time playing the game the more i approve of it, however i do not like not having a place to store food so that they can be preserved longer\n\nIt would seem that the pros outweight the cons, why is this review is still a 'not recommended'?

You should buy this game now' and the other option being 'Not Recommended' which is to say 'Hey you! you shouldn't buy this game now'.\n\nIf this was a proper review rather than steams "review" system review i would give the game high marks for being a great in-depth survival game and beating out it's genre competitors, But this is not a proper review system.

Most of the time when you invest in early access you’re gambling on a game that can reach full potential or be forgotten by the devs as they make a break for it with your money. ARK is the first early access game that I’ve personally played that doesn’t feel like early access. It’s got a lot more content than most finished games. The developers are usually always coming up with new content to keep the game fresh and the base game is fantastic while only getting better (most of the time anyway). There’s a few big issues with the current state of the game, but I’m willing to give the devs the benefit of the doubt that they will try to balance it out before launch.\n\nPros:\n-Hundreds of hours play time either by yourself or with a friend. For $29.99 this game has lasted me much longer than almost every full priced $60.00 game I’ve purchased in the past 10 years.\n-Many different dinosaur species to tame and more on the way\n-Beautiful world that has great map design. Everything feels hand crafted.\n-Building a base feels more like building a home rather than a hole to hide in until PVP\n-Dinosaurs control well and you’ll really develop strong bonds with your tames (including incredible sadness if they die)\n-Graphics are beautiful (if you can run them) and help immerse you into the well-designed world\n-Forming a tribe can lead to fantastic friendships\n-PVP is incredibly tense and when played well you can get into seriously intense action\n-Very rewarding but difficult learning curve\n\nCons:\n-At times the game can feel like a chore. Lots of grinding and some taming can take more than 3 hours\n-Very unbalanced PVP that can really turn most people off\n-Kibble that can shorten tames are being implemented poorly (EG late game dinosaur eggs required for mid-early game dinosaurs)\n-Giganotosaurus completely broken (turned off in my private server)\n-Needs better optimization\n\nAll in all ARK is a fantastic game. If you’re even mildly curious about it give it a shot. It’s been a game that has consumed all of my time and I love every minute of it.\nI highly suggest staying away from official servers and try to find a nice unofficial one. They usually have better tame times and active admins can remove problem players fast.\n\n","February 12","true","160.5"," 130 of 164 people (79%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","79","130","164","18","1"

A great survival game should let the players create the fun instead of the game trying to make the fun for you. In Ark there is no point in talking to other tribes and battling with other tribes doesn't even exist really. There are no tactical battles, just curbstomps by the team with who builds ugly giant metal structures and tames the same 2-3 dinos over and over again. Essentially whoever gets on the server first and invests 100+ hours can build an indestructable base made of metal guarded by plant turrets and then scout the map once every few days to make sure no rival bases are in contruction that could ever build anything that could damage them. Normally all the powerful tribes ally and the saddest thing is watching new player after new player join a server, spend about 20 hours on that server and then leave once they realize a tribe or tribes have build foundations all over an area of the map so no one else can build there and the noobs have to inhabbit useless areas.\n\nThe problem really is a balance issue.  As a middle player at level 60 with a few dinos I can raid a lower player and destroy everything they have done in seconds and if they wanted to fight me or even damage one of my walls it would take them hours upon hours. The same could be said if I was to go up against a high player. He could destroy me and all my dinos without much effort yet if I attacked him I would have to spend hours upon hours to destroy just one turret. People that invest time playing and are high levels can have an advantage sure but not to this extremist extent that it just defeats the purpose of playing.\n\nAs I said in the beginning the problem is the games philosophy. Once a tribe becomes powerful on a server they nearly never fall and the dynamic remains the same pretty much forever. A free-to-play and very basic game by the name of Unturned gets this concept right where ARK fails. In Unturned in the course of a week many teams rise, have their time as #1, then they fall, etc. I'm pretty sure in the space of an entire servers existence the same Alpha tribe remains Alpha always in ARK even when outnumbed just because they got on first and can manipulate the bugs in the game such as building pillars/foundations all over 66% of the map.\n\nI understand this game is in Beta but the reason I'm giving a negative review is because the developers seem more interested in wowing its audience with new dinosaurs and items all the time instead of fixing the game mechanics required for a dynamic experience. I have Zero respect for developers who go for style over substance and ARK is very much style over substance. Everyone says it: You HAVE to play on a private server (this should be a strong message to developers STOP releasing more dinos and FIX the game dynamic). You have to play on a private server if you want to have fun and have all the tribes starting from the same place but good luck finding one without an abusive admin or one that will just go down making all your hard work pointless.\n\nOverall: Great Game Concept, Enjoyable at times, Super Addicting but a bad execution and philosophy.","November 24, 2015","false","405.1"," 549 of 794 people (69%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","69","549","794","49","45"

I plan to continue, but there are some RED FLAGS for anyone looking to get into the game at this point:\n\n1) there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT:\n\nFor a game with a full priced "beta" release, there is absolutely no support. This is to the extent that even the official website has removed all contact information, up to and including even listing the name of the game developer. The steam page takes you to the website, the website takes you to the steam page, the steam page suggests you visit the forums, in which there are close to 18,000 threads.\n\nThe steam page also says the "beta" is  an "Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development". so not only can you not report an issue, since there is no support, there is a chance the issue will never be fixed. I have never heard of a game that is being developed where the developer removes their name from the product and doesn't want to hear from you about in game issues, and admits they don't know if there will be future development. Not to mention, there is no way to know if you're going to be happy with the progress so far, or the game need more develpment without actually playing the game for yourself.\n\n2) IMPOSSIBLE TO START NEW: the game has no balance to allow new players to compete. I'm not new, I've been playing since day one so I have all the fun stuff, but if you don't already have it, you're not going to get it.\n\na: The game has a server cap of 70 players at a time. So as I write this there are.... between 44-85000 players online. So while you can have a single character on multiple servers, you can't play that character on a different server. So if there are 70 people playing on one map you're on, you can wait and spam refresh/relaunch for up to an hour trying to get online, or start over on a new server from lvl 1 with nothing.\n\nb) If you start from new, you're competing for space with everyone on the server, so lvl 1-40 (75 is the current max) everything you can accomplish can be destroyed in actual seconds by a lvl 50. Until you are around lvl 60 and have progressed from thatch, to wood, to stone, to full metal structures, which will take you roughly 100-150 hours, everything you accomplish will be destroyed within a day. The reason is structures stop creature and resources from spawning. So basically if you're online or offline, and I'm on a T-Rex looking for something, your home base is stopping it from spawning, and it's easier for me to spend 20 seconds to crush your base and reset the spawns, than it is to leave it there and look somewhere else.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT\n\nc) PET TAMING AND RESOURCES:\n\nDINOS\nthe most enjoyable part of the game is training and using your dinosaurs, it's the main draw, it's the actual game ad photo. The problem is the time required and the level gaps. You can check the numbers incase they change at http://www.ark-survival.net/en/taming-calculator/ but I'll use the current numbers.\n\nSo you want a T-Rex, and be honest, you do. The way taming works is you stun the dino, and feed it until it's trained and yours. They range in level from 1-120, the average is in the mid to low teens. As you tame the dino, you get a level cap, ten levels above it's trained starting level. How you tame it creates a bonus multiplier. So as a NEW player, a lvl 15 T-Rex will take you 3h 45m to tame, and require you to craft 249 drugs to keep is sleeping while you feed it 114 raw meat. Meat can be kept in stacks of 20, with one from each stack expiring every 10 minutes, So the simple math is 20*10min is 200 minutes, the taming time is 225 minutes, so you basically have to work in a team of 2, or leave it alone while you gather meat. But while it's sleeping, any dinosaur, or any player can kill it, so even if it's 224 minutes into the tame, it's just gone. And since a rex can eat wood and thatch bases is seconds, and kill most tames and players, high level players don't want you to have it, and will look for you training it to take it off the map.\n\nThat's a lvl 15, which is hard enough, but if you want the dinosaurs like your competition has, a lvl 120, it's a 14h 18 min tame with 2855 drugs and 429 meat, which after the training multiplier and level cap will get you a lvl 160 ish rex.\n\nNow for a senior player, that has had the time to develop a base and collect premium training products, they can do the same lvl 120 tame in 10h 40 min, which after the cap, will be lvl 220. In roughly 3/4 the time a group can take the same pet to 140% your max level. So every time we meet, the best you can do is 75% as good as a long term player, meaning you and the dino are done, and that 14 hours you spent taming it are gone as well.\n\nThis can also happen when you're offline, even in a stone or metal base, it only takes about an hour of resources to make bombs to destroy a wall, to sneak in and kill it. To protect it you're invested about 200-300 hours to build up base defences, which will take roughly 3 hours per day of upkeep (which is why only established groups really have or use them). Basically, until you have 300 hours of play time building up your base, I can kill yours, but you can't kill mine.\n\nRESOURCES\nTo build a base to protect your stuff, you basically have to upgrade everything to metal, which requires metal and "glue" to make. So I'll use the rex example, just to make the door for the room you'll need to build for it, which will need walls a floor and roof, as well as a fence and spiked wall to protect it, I'm not doing all the math so I'm just doing the door for that room, will take about 400 metal, 50 "glue", and 20 polymer. If you break down the ingredients, or at least the important ones, it's 400 metal, 200 bone chips, and 40 carbon. The problem for new players is, all I have to do is put a metal door (which you can't break) in front of the places you have to go to get these things. So if the room requires a total of roughly 100,000 of something, I can take the dino that farms it into the area, and collect 4-500 in a few minutes, while you have to run around picking them up one at a time for how ever long it takes you. The only option you have is to build up explosives for a couple for days to break the door, or to spend hundreds of hours searching for the materials outside of the farming areas. BUT, there's an catch, because if you blow up the door, and I'm notified about it, I just go fly over and put up another door, leaving you trapped on the other side, until you die and lose all of your stuff, not to mention all the time you wasted making the stuff to blow up the first door. Remember, it takes me minutes to replace it, and I have dozens of replacements already made and waiting,\n\nAlso, the artifacts to even try to fight the "end game" boss is locked in the end of the caves, behind the locked doors people put up. So even if you want to just see the boss, you have to collect these from over a dozen caves, all require you to get past the doors and the auto guns and dinos people put around the entrances, making it basically impossible at this stage for even elite players to collect.\n\n3) FAULTY UPDATES\n\nRemember there's no customer support, so if you have an issue, and there are updates literally every day, there is no support, uninstal, reinstal, hope it works. But beyond that, there's other really weird problem to the updates. A minor one, which is why I'll just get it out of the way, is it isn't in PST, so you have to google the time changes to put it on par with every other game in NA. But this doesn't really matter, because it isn't when it happens anyways. Typically you get a message saying in an hour the server will be down for fifteen minutes to update. but 45 minutes later...","September 3, 2015","false","720.0"," 875 of 1,281 people (68%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","68","875","1","73","60"

Here you'll find it out!Note: This game is still in early access. There might be many changes throughout the development.\nHint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nIt seems to be the best idea in the genre of survival games. A Rust-like game with RPG elements and the best of all: tameable dinosaurs. Who didn't ever dream as a kid to have a T-Rex or Carnotaurus as a pet? The dream will finally come true with "ARK - Survival Evolved".\n\nThe start is very familiar for those who are used to survival games. You're stranded on an island with nothing but your panties on you. A strange artefact is implemented in your arm and the world is filled with wild and dangerous creatures; dinosaurs. Like in every other survival game you have to start as a gatherer and hunter with the goal to build up some walls to find cover against the harsh nature, the dinosaurs and probably against other gatherers.\nBit by bit you farm everything you need and will be able to build your first own shelter. The time has come to discover the island, farm more specific ressources and collect supplies at the so-called ARKs. They're findable everywhere on the island and glow in different colors. You'll find out what they mean in time.\n\nBack to the more important or probably most interesting part of ARK: taming dinosaurs. You need to knock them out - even the biggest of all. Either with your bare hands or - if you're more advanced - with tranquil arrows. Every dinosaur has his own favorite food that will make the tameprocess easier and a lot faster. Till now the tameprocess is very time wasting. Some dinosaurs like a high level T-Rex still need hours for taming. But in the end it will be worth the time you put in - many dinosaurs are real farming monsters. E.g. a mammoth will turn a forest into a warfield in seconds and rewards you with more wood and berries than you're able to carry around. Every tamed dinosaur is able to level up which allows you to assign statpoints.\n\nDon't throw the berries your mammoth farmed away. With some berries, coal and water you might get some dye out of it. Paint your walls, your roof and your floor - not enough? Try the dye on armor and even your tools.\n\nBut every golden coin has a not so shiny side. As I mentioned before, the taming and also the farming process takes a lot of time. Casual players won't have fun or won't see so much progress as other hardcore gamers will.\nThe community is surprisingly friendly but even here are black sheeps. They're called offline raiders. They wait for you to go offline and will steal your hard farmed ressources in notime. Without a tribe, a proper base made out of stone or metal and in advanced time turrets, you won't keep your stuff for long.\n\nThe graphics are stunning. The island and all now available dinosaurs are made with the love for detail.  But for this you have to have a even better PC. Stuttering, server or PC sided, in the current development state is not unusual. Anyways, bugs here and there - like dinosaurs glitching through walls or stuck in another- are not game breaking anymore. You'll find everytime a way out of the missery.\n\nOne thing I have to mention in the end: Nearly every day the game gets updated and developers reveal information about new dinosaurs. You may get a unfinished project now but the chance that it will be a finished game in a year is really high.\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nIf bugs in the game won't bug you, you'll get a fantastic survival game, yet in early access but already stable to have a lot of fun. Make your own tribe and invite your friends. Survive the harsh world and open a happy farm with dinosaurs.\n\nARK - Survival Evolved mesmerized me more like other survival game never could. Time will just pass by and you feel like you're a kid again with all these tamed Raptors and T-Rex.\n\nT-Rex approves!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nSince its first Early Access release many things changed!\nThe most important change is the performance. Everything runs a lot smoother now, crashes might be rare on your exploration through the world of ARK. For now 46 different dinosaurs will crave for your flesh and bones. Alot more will be implemented in ARKs last development stages!\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Stunning graphics\n[✔] Tameable and rideable dinosaurs you need to care for\n[✔] A big world with many facets, each biome has its own creatures\n[✔] Many crafting options, items and building materials\n[✔] Possibility to create a own tribe\n[✔] Option to run a local server for "singleplayer", incl. many commands\n[✔] Regular updates and fixes\n\n[✖] Gathering and taming takes a very long time to be done, not suitable for casual gamers\n[✖] Offline Raiders, like you will find in any survival MMO\n[✖] Might not work on weaker PCs\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up! I also appreciate every feedback!\n\nTo keep updated about my reviews, feel free to visit Morbs' Review Base and follow the curator page to never miss an review from me!\n\nCheck also  CompleteTheBacklog out!\n- ℳorbus","August 15, 2015","true","539.6"," 103 of 130 people (79%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","79","103","130","23","7"

These guys patched through the important items quick fast and in a hurry. Awesome Job and a good sign for things in the future. Now for a quick pro and con.\n\nPro\n*So far everything seen in the trailer I have been able to do.\n*Tons of content right off the bat with more to come.\n*Crafting system took me a whole of about 5 minutes to figure out and the only thing missing was rocks.\nI spawned of the eastern beach which had very few but patch notes say they fixed it.\n*Tribes\n\nCon\n*Ninja raptors\n*Lost the items I got for buying early access in 1 minute as people were waiting nearby to kill newbies.

These guys keep coming out with more content and the craziest pace I have ever seen. Do you people even sleep??? Devs listen to the community and put forth a concerted effort to attempt to prevent hacking and cheating even offering money for those types of software to be reported. They also listen to most suggestions such as dinos that gather fiber and even the scythe. Man we were hurting for some way to farm that fiber and now it's almost to easy.

It punishes you extremely harshly for any mistake, which may have been as simple as “I needed to drink so I did, which meant I didn’t see the 3 raptors behind a bush who are now enjoying a little midday snack”.\n\nSometimes It made me want to put down the game and cry in the corner, which happened when my first tamed dinosaur “Kevin” was tragically killed by a giant scorpion! The game has some nice touches though which allowed me to erect a gravestone in his memory.\nRIP Kevin.\n\nDespite all this danger and misery, there is something that takes the sting off and indeed is what I feel makes this game. Actually surviving!  Sure, you’re gonna die a dozen or so times before you finally work out how it all fits together, but once you learn to be cautious, learn which creatures to hunt and (usually) which ones to run from as fast as you’re little human legs can go, learn what things you really need and build and setup that first camp, the game makes you feel a real sense achievement.\n\nDespite all the danger lurking around every corner (or above you in the sky or below you in the water), despite the hardships you must go through to gather those resources, you have done it. You are Bear Grylls.\nBut Bear Grylls alone couldn’t defend his friendly dino mount and camp from a rampaging T-Rex!\nBut he could if that other great survivalist, Ray Mears, was in the area!\n\nWhich is where this game really comes into it’s own.  Working together with your friends and forming a tribe is where the real enjoyment for me happens. That’s why it’s an MMO and is why I play the game.\n\nThe servers currently allow 70 players on at a time which helps to prevent overcrowding which would certainly ruin the feel of the game. It also works well as I rarely see any maxed out servers.\n\nEach server is also a new start for all players. So if you join a friend (in my case brother) who’s been playing ark for a while, if you both jump onto a new server you will both wakeup in loin cloths on a beach and have to etch out a living from scratch. To me this helped me to not overly rely on my brother as he was just as vulnerable as I am and also meant he wasn’t slowing down his gameplay to help set me up in the game.\n\nAnd working together allows you to travel further, explore dangerous places and take down huge creatures. Alone it’s not impossible, but together it works and feels better.\n\nMeeting other players is also an interesting (and sometimes nerve racking) experience. Wondering along and suddenly 3 guys riding T-Rexs emerge from the trees! Do I run? Will they perhaps trade? Offer my lowly character free gear to help me survive? Point me in the direction of new wonders and resources? Or will they just kill me and take my stuff? So far, all of these things have happened to me, and I enjoyed it all (even my murder by thieves).\n\nAll in all, ARK is a fantastic gaming environment full of possibilities and adventures with plenty of danger! There’s the odd bug and having the option to switch between 1st and 3rd person would be nice along with other minor gripes. But these things can be fixed and other things may change, it’s not at full release after all.\n\nFor now, my tribe and I are happy to roam the world of ARK, trying to go beyond surviving and build a lasting civilisation! Or maybe just a dry hut. And with more content to come and the many mods being created by the community, I can see myself playing this game for a long time.\n","April 9","true","255.4"," 94 of 117 people (80%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","80","94","117","52","4"

(beware giant sharks)\n-Some dinosaurs are a threat but you can easily outrun them if you're not ready to fight\n-leveling system to improve your character and learn new recipes\n-mods\n-offline local play!!!!!!!!\n-characters can move between servers and local play (special locations in game to do this)\n-you poop\n-you can poop on command (worthy of separate mention)\n\nCons\n-It isn't optimized so if you want to play maxed out graphics even a beast desktop will have trouble\n-KOS is better than other games but bad if you're traveling with important things & tamed animals (people may kill them)\n-if you die, you have a pretty short time to reclaim your stuff before your body decomposes\n-a little difficult to navigate, you can't tell where you are on a map\n-food spoils fast\n-early game is tough with water because early water containers leak over time\n-you need to be completely submerged in water to drink it (be careful in murky water - lots of crocs and scorpions!)\n\nMoot\n-KOS can be disable - PVE servers\n-Mods are allowed and will improve the game in any and every way you desire\n-food is easy to obtain so spoiling isn't really an issue except when taming dinosaurs\n-if you have a waterskin (or other container), you can fill it and drink it while being only ankle deep in water\n\n\nThere are a few flaws related to performance that will be handled with optimization, but it's hard to make legitimate complaints about design choices and mechanics because those will be changeable with mods. It's a lot of fun and it's difficult to play without making progress. I had a rough start looking for rocks and couldn't find any for a whole game day, but I kept moving and found some a little far from shore. Great game, would definitely recommend it.","June 2, 2015","true","19.8"," 185 of 255 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","185","255","12","0"

It's very addictive and there's a long grind but it rarely becomes tedious, especially with a group of friends.\n\nOverall pretty much as good as it gets for an early access survival game.

Die of thirst while being chased by small spitting dinos.\n\nDiary Log Day 1 Attempt 2\nRespawn start gathering berries, eat the black ones get knocked the **** out. Die shortly after to a group of other indigenous people while they chant a blood oath ceremony and extract my blood from my veins and begin to drink it.\n\nDiary Log Day 1 Attempt 3\nRespawn! Run like a pansy towards trees in the forest. Gather thatch and wood and make a pickaxe. Gather even more, make an axe and some spears. Feeling pretty good .......<_<  what was that noise. Dies shortly after to a pack of ravenous giant dragon flies .Thinking "this game has my worst fears included in the alpha"\n\nDiary Log Day 3.......Night has come attempt 23\nFinally Not starving or dying from the elements, phew I kind of like this game. Guy on a giant death bird "Hey you this is our beach" ......Me  <_<  >_>  "uhhhhh, ok man I'm leaving" start to run ... get picked up by said giant death bird and tossed into a dino pen with 3 rex, 2 spino, and 20 dilos............\n\nDiary Log Day 35\nI have been recruited into a tribe, they are not the brightest but they took me in no questions asked. We will be taming a dilo and some other creatures by the beach today really excited for tribe life!\n\nDiary Log Day 36\nWe were attacked in the night and without warning, the other tribe was tactical and read. We had just put the last dilo down and we were stalking  a phiomia when they struck. We were slaughtered like  lambs! The laughed as they killed our tames one by one and they saw the fear in my eyes as they finally killed me while i was cowering under a thatch foundation.. We never stood a chance.......CURSE THIS ISLAND!\n\nDiary Log Day 67\nI am no longer weak, I can run for miles without stopping and able to carry twice my body weight as I swiftly track my prey. I strike as hard as a hammer and I only have to hit once. I have seen men do crazy things on this island but i will keep my sanity. I have started my own tribe I will no longer be prey to others, no I will be the hunter not the hunted and I will get my revenge for that night on the beach long forgotten by my adversary. They will know my fear.\n\nDiary Log Day 86\nHow my tribe has flourished in these past few weeks, we have grown into a force to be reckoned with on this island. No longer do people laugh as they see us run by. Our animals have grown strong, we have acquired much in the past few days. A T rex that almost took out my second in command as we fought bravely to take it down at the Frozen Fang. Losing many brave warriors we were able to pin it to the side of the mountain while firing volley after volley of deadly poison arrows, finally the beast lay still a great victory to be had. We will celebrate tonight with dodo fights and strong stimulants!\n\nDiary Log Day 115\nWe were ambushed last night, those responsible live no more. We suffered heavy losses even with this latest victory three Argentavis and a Spino named DickHardstaff were killed, we mourned there passing. They will be remembered for their bravery and courage to save there masters lives.\n\nDiary Log Day 118\nWe have found the ones responsible for the massacre a few moons ago. We have set the bait, a trade so grand no one would resist and that is where we ambushed them. We had been stock piling well over 2 weeks for this moment everything must go smoothly we wouldn't get a chance as this again. Good i see that they brought there highest level dinos. As I stand there on the ground waiting with the rex we have brought as a peace offering. I greet the leader with a offering of 500 cementing paste and I tell him we were sorry for taking lands that he had his eyes on but had not built on. We then go through the formalities of talking land and who will get the land to the south east. But what he doesn't know is my tribe has taken 100 c4 to there main base along with grenades, assault rifles, and our strongest dinos and is in the process of blowing the enemies walls and dragging all of the tames left into the ocean while stealing everything in site and blowing the vault wide open. They will know my fear.\n\nDiary Log Day 154\nWe have eradicated the enemy, after the breaching of the walls and the great water baptism of the dinos our enemies were left with only a hand full of dinos and a scarce amount of resources. We have tracked them down wherever they tried rebuilding, and destroying them utterly they have given up. We had finally won the right to the island. No more would fresh spawns have to run cowering on the beach as there tames were slain. No longer would there be war but peace! We would bring a new era to this land and no one would be able to stop us.\n\nDiary Log Day 167\nI thought I would never write these words but mutiny has occurred, the tribe has split down the middle my second in command tried to rise above his position and take what he believed to be rightfully his. He pitted the tribe against me saying if the tribe was to stay strong that we must advance on our other enemies strike them down while they were not strong enough to resist and take the island by force. Some sided with him, others sided with me. We lost half of the tribe that night along with a good amount of our dinos. The parting was bitter we had a new enemy on the island and he had a different idea than peace.\n\nDiary Log Day 179\nWe know that we are being targeted, other tribes are staying away from us. Keeping there distance when once they were friendly and offering aid. The other tribe members are talking behind my back, saying things should be done differently and they are always watching me and waiting. I feel outnumbered and a growing sense of betrayal is rising within my gut. Have they sided with him? My second in command who now days ago had demanded his right over the island and tribe. I shudder at the thought.\n\nDiary Log Day 183\nI awoke early to ride along the sunset, my trusted Argentavis at my side. He has seen many battles and may not see many more. Its days like this I think the island beautiful but I know that this place is cursed beyond reason, turning men into monsters and taking your very soul away from you when it has had its way with you. Today would be the ideal day to slip into the darkness leave the warring and fighting behind me and start a new life. I park the bird on the cliff and jump from the edge. The frozen fang is the only one who will see my passing.\n\nDiary Log 197\nWhen I fell from the cliff I was given another chance, a way to come back and turn the tide. The light has spoken and said mighty warrior you have fallen but you may try again, or become another and start all over. My mind made up I chose to begin again, knowing that this time my enemies would be none the wiser, and that I would fear nothing having already experienced it all before.\n\nDiary Log Day 202\nSpawn into a server as a random black man, start smacking stuff with fists. Die of thirst while being chased by dilos!\n\nDiary Log Day 203 attempt 579\nI have become one with the island.\n\n10/10 Would spawn in again\n\n\nBut seriously this game is fun, get a couple of friends on any server and just have a good time. Definitely a blast with people and pretty fun to solo if you know what you are doing. Worth picking up if you are into survival games or you flip out over dinosaurs.","September 21, 2015","true","539.1"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","86","64","74","66","0"

The game is still awesome! Everyday I find new ways to do things and new tricks so the “replayability” of this game is excellent. How many early access out there you played for 250+ hours and still feel like you are just a couple hours fresh into the game.\n\nThe devs still patch the game daily, they put so much effort and energy, the bleeding edge patching is just brutal, they patch during the day, they patch during the night, sometime you patch during the evening, eat a bit, come back BAM new patch is out, no joke.\n\nBut what about the quality you may ask, great question, and under normal circumstances they would fail to deliver quality content on bleeding edge speed we all know that, but quite frankly, they nailed it so far. They have a very nice workflow, they know how to push new content and game balance fixes together, one could think it's almost impossible to bring something new on every patch and he would be right, in fact they only push 1,2,3 or 4 new features, sometime small sometime big, but it ship with a lot of fixes for old stuff already in the game so everything feels new.  At then end of the day, you realize that you got only X new things in the game BUT 20 or 25 problems you had are now fixed and you feel great about that. The devs reads the game forum A LOT (on steam community so it's even better because you don't need to setup a new account, you just add your comment and that's it), they act on half the things they read, see it by yourself, go read the forum a bit and I guarantee you that the next patch will include 70 or 80% of suggestions from the players.\n\nSo far they fixed the FPS, it's a lot smoother, you don't feel like dragging a whale on your shoulders when moving anymore, it's crisp and fluid. However the game is still on the laggy side of things when you play on the official servers, I'm not gonna lie, the rubberband is pretty bad, the server need to verify several things every time you take a step, so if everybody is playing actively on the server at the same time, it takes a few milliseconds to receive the answer from the server (yes the door is open, yes you can go thru that doorstep, the dino's tail is in your way you can't go there etc..). Basically your client is only a "viewer", the server receive your inputs and apply them, this prevent 99% of the cheat you could see in a more traditional game, but there is a cost, performance cost. I'm very confident they will find a way to fix this eventually, I suppose with enough money they will cut on the virtual server doldrums and buy more physical servers so everybody is happy. For now, it's the only "blocker" I could point out about the game, every thing else is personal preferences and very minor things like improving the interface a bit and balance this or that.\n\nI was eager to see the first server wipe, we all know it's inevitable, it came about a week ago (like Shmurda). They were classy about it, only an item wipe (and map wipe) to counter a nasty dupe cheat the community used and abused during a few days. We got to keep our character progression which is great. Currently they offer 200 bucks to anyone that report a successful hack/cheat on the official server (as a consultant in offensive security IRL, this entertain me a lot to see new people try to hack the sh*t out of them lol).\n\nStill no cash shop or cash grab or shady business, that's also a big plus for me and for a lot of people.\n-----------\n\n55 hours in a couple of days...  trust me this game is awesome! The game is on the laggy side of things right now but the devs are working hard to optimize everything.  It's a giant fusion between every survival games out there I would say,  they avoided the clichés and focused on the important game mechanics instead. There is no cashshop or any kind of cash grab, devs are highly motivated and you feel it with the bleeding edge patching process! The engine is crisp and most of the time the server reg is excellent for fighting and shooting. Also, don't get me wrong, it is an early access game and on some aspects it feels like it BUT  it could be one of the best early access I tryed to this day.","June 6, 2015","true","387.3"," 94 of 121 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","94","121","10","0"

FIrst of all, I really enjoyed the game.  While it is still in Alpha, there are many positives, and very few negatives.  The leveling system is kind of strange to a newcomer.  Unlike most games, you are given "Engram" points to distribute. What the game doesn't tell you is that you never gain enough points to have all of the engrams.  As a player who leveled a toon on a solo server, that was kind of annoying.  However, playing with a tribe kind of makes that a moot point.  The combat is janky at best.  On official servers you will be chasing raptors running backwards, stuck in turtles who are eating you from the inside out, and whacked by brontos that tail swipe you through a hillside.  This lag isn't a problem on most local/private servers, btw.  The mounted combat is pretty cool, too.  I have found that the PvP side of this game is really a hit and miss experience.  Half of my game time was spent playing PvP.  I really liked how I could "Raid" another camp, emprison the poor soul inside, and blow up all their stuff/dinos, BUT having it happen to you really sucks.  You spend hours upon hours building your base, and with a few sticks of C4 it's all gone.  As most others have said, PvP is a work in progress and you will be bashing your head on the wall in frustration as a chinese tribe murders your family in your sleep.  Oh, and I hate birds. Really.  I hate the birds.\n\nOn to my favorite things about the game.\n\nIts really difficult!  I love hard games.  ARK takes survival to a whole new level.  Even navigation can be a real pain in the beginning.  ARK forces you to leave your arcade gaming state of mind behind.  It's a game that forces you to adapt or die at the mercy of the island.  I really enjoyed exploring the world.  There is a wide variety of biomes.  My favorite being Caves; something most players tend to ignore.  There's something about trudging alone down a cold dark hole with a spear and torch that just puts a grin on my face.  I also love the dinos, but don't we all?  I'm sure there are many other things I could address, but there really isn't much more to say except, "This is the grown up version of Minecraft with Dinos."

It does not cover; graphics, content, Survival of the Fittest, or other already covered aspects of other reviews.\nArk: Survival Evolved is not for the faint of heart or the short sighted. As a survival  genre game at it's core, it requires a large level of logistical skills in order to see maximum results. If you don't like the idea of losing progress, survival games aren't for you. If you like the idea of out-thinking the system, and learning to be a better player within your provided environment, then you'll likely excell in this game.\n\nArk is a dangerous world. Many people take for granted the civillian life they live. As an example, in this player's opinion; dIno pens with roofs is a must. Building roofless pens must be done high enough so that large monsters can't walk over, or reach in. But roofless pens still allow flying creatures to get in, or enemy players if on PvP.\nTravelling with all your best stuff all the time is a great way to make sure that every wipe (death without corpse recovery) is the worst it can be. Instead, travelling with equipment you can replace easily might be more advantageous until a player is more familiar with their surroundings.\nMany players think "I'm being attacked, I can't win, run home!". Then they lose their house to dino attack. Dieing and respawning and saving your house and it's contents is way more beneficial. Sometimes it's impossible to avoid aggro(aggression from an attacker) on your house, you might even be outside when it happens, with your entrance blocked. This is why players should have a safe house/houses nearby with basic supplies, enough to see, and lure creatures away from their main base (stuff if they lose it, it wont matter).\n\nWith over 2 dozen creature types, each with its own biome type, movement patterns, size, relative speed/strength, and its own dislikes and likes, they must be approached with a learning process in mind. Argentavis will have a much lower aggro range if you simply duck when nearby. Raptors appear to see spyglass glints in day time if you look at them. Rexes will hone in on torches in night time, compy packs canniballize fallen pack mates, Terror Bird and Scorpions won't fight each other but they both fight you, some carnivores scavange unconscious tames, some don't, etc, etc.\n\nThe point is; one must understand and respect their environment, while trying to learn more about it through observational gameplay. As an experienced player, I have yet to lose anything that wasn't 100% avoidable by something I could have done before hand. Everytime it happened, I adapted accordingly and my losses became less and less. You can't just pound through ARK and expect to be a good player. One needs to pay attention and learn as they play.\n\nEDIT: Comprehension and grammar.\n\nSummary:\nIf you want to hop into a game and just get some action with little to no penalty, then look into a private server for ARK with 'excelerated' settings, x4 exp, lower spoil times, quicker tame times etc. Or I'd recommend; a hack and slash, a First Person Shooter(FPS) or a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) type game.\n\nIf you like the idea of the game minus the survival aspects, then I'd recommend looking into hosting your own server, and/or adding mods.\n\nIf you want a gameplay experience that forces you to pay attention, learn and adapt as you go, while allowing player made structures in world, then a survival sandbox game such as ARK: Survival Evolved is for you.","March 25","true","406.8"," 96 of 126 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","96","126","10","0"

I have put over thirty hours into the game in two days.  I'd be playing it right now-- but I'm currenty at a place where the net's just not that great so I have to wait. (Unfortunately, might I add.)  That being said; a review.\n\nThe game is, to put it frankly, fun.  It's pretty.  Animations are GENERALLY great.  The AI for the dinosaurs could use some tweaking-- I'd like to see the specific species given a little more flavor that's more for them and the supposed personalities they'll have once the game's fully released; but that's in due time!  So far I feel as though the devs have earned every penny I spent on this game.  It can be challenging going solo, however.  There's an actual sense of progression to the game-- you don't want to run into raptors before you're ready for them.  Though once you're in leather armor you'll be able to go fisticuff with the lower leveled ones to tame them.\n\nThere's a few cons to the game, naturally.  I don't personally enjoy the "Sleeping" players being in game upon logout-- though I can see why it's a thing.  Personal preference.  Dinosaurs sometimes keep their momentum when you kill them, causing them to artifact or slide or fly away.  Your body can randomly die when logged out. (Either a bug or I logged out outside of my house and froze to death.) There were, of course, the maintenance issues.  There's also the issue of no spots in official servers. (Just play on an unofficial one for now, honestly.)  I've leveled to 15 three times in this game already, having to start on different servers for various reasons.  However...\n\nOnce I was able to run the game with higher settings with no lag-- riding on raptor back has become one of my favorite things to do.  I very, very seriously love just hopping on my raptor's back and exploring.  I cannot wait to see player-made ARK islands.  I have yet to go to the very center of the map, but I've gone up and down all of the coasts.  Normally, I'm one of those players that gets lost in survival games.  The Island presented by the dev team, however, I find is diverse and unique enough that I can pinpoint where I need to go.  If it's a new place, just look at one of the large floating colorful obelisks.  If it's a familiar place-- I know my way around it.  I've taken to calling this little 'U' shaped portion near my home "Bronto Valley" due to the fact it constantly has a Brontosaurus or two within it.  It's just so easy to find my way around just by the natural landmarks alone.\n\nI feel that the crafting leaves a little bit to desire-- and I always welcome more player/dinosaur customization.  I expect that these things will come along eventually, seeing as it's an early access game.  The devs are just fantastic-- and I've noticed them more often than not commenting on the game's forums helping players and making light jokes.  It is refreshing.  After the furious patching that was done to make the game playable, I do not worry about the developers pulling a Jig and running away with our hopes and money.  Good job, devs.  Keep up the good work.  You've made me one happy customer.","June 5, 2015","true","442.4"," 69 of 85 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","69","85","3","0"

The main reason I made this a negative review is simply because I don't find it fun, and that's the reason we play games is it not?\n\nTo start off, this game features and incredible amount of grinding in the form of resource gathering and it takes a very long time to actually get anything, and when you finally do get to some kind of goal you usually just get screwed over and lose everything anyway...I feel this game just doesn't reward the player for their time and effort that they put in - which can be a lot, I might add. Don't get me wrong I'm no stranger to grindy games, I play my fair share of MMOs and the like...but the thing is, in an MMO you don't constantly get screwed over and lose everything over and over again, I can see how some people find this fun (okay...maybe not fun unless you're a masochist, but tolerable), but for me it's enraging. When I log out from a game I want to feel like i've accomplished something...the only time I ever quit out of this game is in rage after I lose everything.\n\nThe second thing that really puts me off this game is the fact it's impossible to navigate using the map, it is only a rough sketch of the terrain you have discovered so far and it doesn't show your location at all, now I understand that this is a design choice...but I think it's a, quite frankly, utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one. The map, which to the games credit is beautiful and immense in scope, is just too vast to not have any kind of navigation system, even if you do get some kind of improved map later on (I got to around lvl 23 or so) you shouldn't have to go that long, and likely a lot longer seeing as I didn't see any kind of map recipe in the coming levels, with no means of navigation or finding your base after a longish expedition other than dying to spawn back at your bed, which is hardly an option as you will lose everything on you...and it kind of defeats the whole purpose, this game would be so much more enjoyable if you had a (decent) map.\n\nAnother thing that I don't like is that (at least on multiplayer this is, not sure about single as I didn't play it) you can't just log out from this game, you have to make sure your character has enough food, and your dinos (if they didn't get murdered by insects the second the patch introducing them went live, that is) must also be in a safe enclosure and have enough food to not die of hunger until you next get on, oh...also, if you are on a PVPVE or PVP server, you will also have to hope nobody comes and murders you in your sleep, takes all your stuff, griefs your base or kills your dinos. Granted that last bit is more of a people thing and is true for any survival type game, but it's something that I personally don't like. Also...as far as i'm aware, even on the PVE only (I was on a PVPVE server) servers It is my understanding that you can still get raided and have your stuff stolen, although I don't think thye can kill you or your dinos while you are asleep. Assuming this isn't some tall tale, that doesn't sit quite right with me, PVE should not have to worry about being raided...that's kind of the reason why you play PVE.\n\nLike I said at the start of this review, this isn't a bad game...not at all, I know many people love it and with good reason, I think the map on this game is gorgeous and mindnumbingly massive, I also love the whole basis around training dinos and making a tribe and all that, the combat also seems quite good (well, at least what it's supposed to be, more on that in a bit), there are a few quality of life things that could be done to the combat, such as being able to un-nock an arrow from your bow but that's a minor thing that will probably be added. One thing I did notice though, even playing on one of the lowest ping servers that I could find for an NZ player such as myself, combat is quite jumpy and there is a lot of glitching going on, the dinosaur AI could also use some work, for dinos that are skittish, you kind of just chase them till they run into a rock and get stuck and then proceed to brutally stab them to death, and for the larger ones that will fight back, you can avoid their attacks ridiculously easily, the fast nippy aggressive dinos like raptors and dilos kind of just glitch around, don't really hurt you much and are just annoying to take down due to said glitching.\n\nThe final thing that must be mentioned, which can be somewhat forgiven for being early in development, is the seemingly poor optimization. I wouldn't say I own a super beast million dollar dual SLI GTX titan rig or anything, but I own a pretty respectable GTX 770 rig with a good amount of RAM and a perfectly capable CPU (which though it may be, is next on my upgrade list), but this game has far worse performance than it should have, most settings had to be toned down to medium and low just in order to play the game at 30 frames or so, which is good enough but not great, added to this sub-par framerate, there are frequent micro-freezes and bouts of slideshow like framerates. Thankfully I didn't experience any crashes in my time, although there were many times where it felt like one was coming. Another thing that is annoying is that it takes a very long time to actually log into the game, on my first login to a server, it took about 15 minutes and subsequent logins about 8-10. This makes it very hard just to go "oh, I know lets play some arc for half an hour or so", if you decide to go play some arc you are gonna wanna make it a decent sized sesh if it takes that long to login and load.\n\nAnyway, if you have made it this far in my wall of text review then I commend you. I always seem to get carried away writing steam reviews, I start thinking I will make a paragraph or so review and write and entire damn essay on it. But I hope I have given you a good review on my thoughts on the game. Like I have mentioned several times, this is not a bad game, but it's not the game for everyone, It's my hope that this review will help you to establish which of those two catagories you fall into, and then allow you to make the informed decision as to whether or not you wish to buy this game. I am personally asking for a refund due to the fact that I just don't get any fun from it, and I have played it enough for it to be beyond the point of just a first impressions rage quit, though I will likely start it up a few more times and proceed to rage quit once more if it doesn't get refunded, I don't think I am ever going to get properly into this game. If you chose to buy it I wish you the best of luck and hope you find it more enjoyable than I have.","July 20, 2015","false","47.3"," 155 of 220 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","155","220","12","18"

THIS GAME IS VERY LIKELY TO BE TAKEN OFF STEAM IN THE NEAR FUTURE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwoGo0J4A8E\n\n-----------------------\n\nAn amazing game with an amazing concept that has also borrowed many design philosophies from games like Rust (Without creating a pancake shoot-on-sight mess with guns everywhere by making them tedious to make & rare and by introducing dozens of other things to take up a player's time like gardening or building complex structures) but It so sadly collapses under It's own weight due to the progression system being a steaming pile of shÌt on a dozen different fronts. I'm just gonna list a few of these and hopefully you'll see what I mean.\n\n-----------\n\n1. Dinosaur Levels. One of the more glaring issues in this game is the level system that dinosaurs have. Humans (players) have a near identical system too but It's fair game as everyone starts on 1 and can only reach a maximum of level 94. Dinosaurs have a completely different ball-game however as they can spawn in being as high as level 95-120~ being insanely strong the moment they decide to pop into the game. If you happen to be able to tame one of these high level dinos, you can level them up an addtional 34 more levels and ontop of that, there's a disgustingly complex breeding system that allows you to mate two dinos and have them make an egg which you can then choose to waste several days (Actual real-life days) of your life incubating it to make a baby that inherit the "stats/levels" from the high-level dino parents by random, requiring lots of luck. This in turn increases their max level more and more above the normal limit and allows strength that is borderline absurd. Page of all the math, calculations and statics (along with how convoluted all of it is) can be found here: http://ark.gamepedia.com/Breeding\n\nTo summarize, this system allows you to grow game-breakingly strong dinosaurs that run/fly at the speed of light, are invincible with 50,000 hp and hit like trucks. What's my problem with all of this, you ask? It doesn't require skill. Whatsoever. All it requires is reading of the wiki-page, dumb luck finding high-level wild dinosaurs and LOTS n LOTS of TIME. Taming ONE high level dinosaur can take up to NINE TO TWELVE REAL LIFE HOURS and the egg incubation & growing up part of doing this will require an additional ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTY + HOURS for EACH EGG.. (Depends on the dino) Which means that players who had a general disadvantage to this player that joined before them having a giant base + tons of materials + weapons and so forth is now officially screwed in every single capacity there is by also having said players that came before them on a server be on unstoppable killing machines with no equal in terms of sheer power.\n\n---------\n\n2. Time Requirements & Dedication. The above is not something you can just carelessly go AFK or log out during either. You (or someone else) needs to first knock a dinosaur unconcious using narcotics on arrows and then force-feed said dinosaur with thousands upon thousands of more narcotics to make sure It doesn't wake up while also supplying it with a constant stream of meat/berries and then hope for more luck that no one comes and interferes. If they do, It's going to take even longer or have everything be ruined/reset all together. There is absolutely zero flexibility, zero mercy and zero chance for you to be "successful" in this game If you do not dedicate every single fiber of your being and at the very least 20 hours of playing a day. And for that, I can only shake my head in shame as there could be so much more in terms of making things more manageable such as being able to tame dinosaurs overnight (Not being stuck to feeding them narcotics 24/7) or having the dinosaur progression system be fair play with the most ferocious (strongest) dinos being found in nature and rightfully so by being hardened by harsh living conditions instead of coming out of some inbred's dinos àrse that some human took and stuffed it down their pants to make it hatch.\n\nThen again.. You'd think people would not bother doing all of this seeing just how long It takes, but they do. And they do it over and over, faster and faster after every single server wipe. Why? Because there is legitimately nothing that others can do besides cheesing said dinos out of existence by glitching them or doing a 500v1 bumrush/sleep raids which the dino growers have now started to immunize themselves against by building bases on high mountains or ontop of cliffs while also showering these bases with automatic turrets that gun down anyone that gets even remotely close with a flying dino. "Just give the flying dino more HP" you say? Extremely inconventional as the developers have gone out of their way to give ranged attacks a flat 300-700% damage boost against flying dinosaurs while also increasing the damage buildings take in caves by 650% which is just a sad display of game development gone out of control.. And this keeps being a worrisome theme as the devs also thought It'd be a great idea to turn every bit of the map into a snow biome during christmas which you NEED high level/good gear to survive in or die from hypothermia. Even if you have all the mats to say, make fur or leather armor, you NEED DOZENS OF LEVELS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE THEM.\n\nIt has gotten so bad to the point where literally everyone who knows the real state of these official servers have utterly ABANDONED them in favor of playing on unofficial ones that do a marginally better job with admins being able to log and actually ban cheaters (but this obviously comes with It's own problems of player admins being braindead rètards, see: http://puu.sh/mapr0/0a11546d3f.jpg ) and having higher rates of which you level with but along with these official servers literally never resetting so others can actually have a fair chance to start out playing for the first time, the developers have also currently completely broken the performance of their servers by introducing a horrendously network-inefficient anti-cheating software that has proven itself to not only add a fat 1-3 sec delay on every action you do, overloading the servers (and adding ontop of this game already being very badly optimized FPS wise) but also be completely useless at doing it's job: stopping cheaters that are still running rampant to this very day.\n\n---------\n\n3. Difficulty Curve. You start out with this game, wearing a pair of soiled diapers and your hands. What is the very first thing you have to do in effort to progress in this world, infested beyond reason with things that want to kill you on land, in air and by sea? Punch the nearby tree repeatedly for 50% or more of your health until you get enough stuff to make a pick-axe. Then grind for 60 levels, dying over 250 times so you can begin building things by unlocking level-capped blueprints that also require you dedicating points to things so you can craft them.\n\nAs much as I like hardcore difficulty, the techniques and manners you have to do to progress in this game is just absurd. From the gun-to-head requirement of having a Mammoth to gather wood & berries to the absurdly rarity of metal that can literally only be found in trace-amounts of scraps besides a few giant hotspot point in the middle of the map inside a 1500 meter high volcano (not even kidding), this game needs to have It's entire resource system and overall progression overhauled.\n\n---------\n\n:::TL;DR:::\n\nThe game has potential but the developers have proven to be misguided and struggle to get their priorities straight by shovelling out waves of new broken content 24/7 and slapping on things like "X takes 650% more damage if Y" to try and band-aid a clearly broken system instead of properly re-working things.\n\nThey've also been caught censorshipping and banning people who give the game critique on the forums.

New updates and content almost weekly, lots of dinos and stuff to do. It's somewhat one of those games where you always have something to do.\n\nYes, you have to do a lot of grinding, especially if you're a solo player.\nYes, you will die a lot.\nYes, you will lose your dinos because of random reasons.\nYes, you will have to run for your life sometimes.\n\nI've seen people complain a lot about the "poor optimization". Darlings, don't expect it to be perfect; the game is still in alpha stage. Have patience, they're still adding a lot of awesome content and they'll get to the optimization part in time.\n\nIt's true, you will experience a lot of stupid stuff like your dinos randomly disappearing, platforms randomly appearing at 50 50, not being able to find your body after you die due to it falling under the map or something like that. Yea, stuff like that can happen, not very often, but it can happen. So what? Get mad and get over it. They are still working on the game and eventually stuff like this will be fixed.\n\nAnyway, in the end, if you like survival games and grinding, you should give ARK a try. I've had a lot of fun in my almost 2000 hours on this game. I've died many, MANY times, I've lost my stuff and dinos many times and got angry at the game, but in the end I still love the game. Now that I look back at my past in this game, I remember how much fun all of those adventures actually were and all those losses were actually useful; it's like real life, you learn from your mistakes.\n\nSo buy ARK, be part of the community. I hope you'll enjoy the game and meet a lot of great people like I did. :)","May 24","true","111.5"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","47","52","7","3"

I got a one day early access to this game, and ever since that day I have been ADDICTED to it!\n\nI'll start off by saying, the only way you will love this game is if you can actually play it. Currently, the optimization is fairly poor for average users. You should not expect more then 30FPS in it's current build. However, as long as you can actually play with okay frames it is amazing.\n\nIt combined the feel of building from reign of kings, or rust. Combined with MMO type feel of leveling and crafting.\n\nThis game is competetive! Fight other tribes, get the best dinosaurs, and be the first to get a gun and start taking over the ARK!\n\nWether you play PvE, or PVP, this game is challenging and never gets dull.\n\nThe devs update this game CONSTANTLY. They have weekly updates and new dinosaurs come out regularly too! What they have managed to pull off in such early stages in the game is incredible, it has so much content  you can spend thousands of hours playing this game and never get bored.\n\nI haven't been able to touch another game since playing this, and I don't see tha changing anytime in the near future. Grab your friends, get on a server together and start building your life up! It's so much fun!","June 7, 2015","true","367.1"," 75 of 96 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","75","96","3","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zippywinds/recommended/346110/","zippywinds","The Zipper!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zippywinds/","184 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nARK is a very interesting survival game.  I must admit that I am biased because I've always loved dinosaurs, from Dizzy Dizzy Dinosaur to the plastic dinosaur figurines that had a playmat with a volcano that would erupt when combined with vinegar and baking soda.\n\nMoving past the nostalgia...  The game can be unforgiving at first, which basically means that players just starting out should be VERY cautious when exploring. The first creatures encountred, except for maybe the Dodo bird, are all potentially dangerous. I don't want to give away any spoilers for those who enjoy discovering the game's values and mechanics on their own, so I'll just explain a bit why I enjoy the game.  1st off, the game is absolutely beautiful, pending the PC's power and capabilities on which it's running.  While this is a plus, it's also tough on mid-level machines, even on the lowest of detail settings.  Even though the watered down visuals appear more similarly to early King's Quests games, ARK is still phenomenally enjoyable, especially when played with friends.\n\nThere are a lot of aspects to ARK that I haven't seen in other survival games, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite genres.  Mounting dinosaurs as a means of transportation is definitely something that makes this game unique, as well as being able to tame almost all of the creatures you encounter.\n\nThe environment changes oftenly as well, with rainstorms passing through occasionally.  This is a very cool aspect as I always enjoy weather in games, especiialy when it affects the gameplay, such as getting cold and needing to take shelter, which is present in ARK.\n\nThe developers of ARK are constantly updating the game with patches to increase optimization, fix bugs that have been reported by the community, and oh yeah, giving away free stuff in contests! The contests have been a variety of challenges, such as taming all creatures in the game, to sending in pictures of your base and tribe (clan).  The activeness of the developers shows just how important this game is to them and the community which supports it.  While the game is in early access, there is a multitude of different aspects that are intended to be in the final product, which are all listed under the early access portion of the product page.\n\nOne thing I would enjoy seeing in the future is an option to randomize the map. I always enjoy a randomly generated environment, such as in 7 Days to Die. The defaut map in ARK, however, is enormous with so much environment to explore that this is really more of a final release type suggestion to increase replay value.\n\nWell, I thank everyone who took the time to read this review and I hope it helps. There are many other reviews that have more specifics about the game, but I don't like giving away spoilers as I don't enjoy being "spoiled" myself.\n\n9/10 final rating, just because it's tough to run on PCs at the moment, but that should change with more and more optimization updates.","June 16, 2015","true","50.3"," 154 of 220 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","154","220","12","2"

And more of them are getting patched into the game\n- Playing PvE is actually an option, because a few of the them are  really hard to kill!\n\n\nCons:\n\n- PERFORMANCE!! They need to optimize the game really bad!\n- You are forced to play in a team, because u have limited skillpoints and you are not able to get all of the skills.\n- No option to reskill!\n- To build a bigger base takes actually hours. They need to reduce the materials required to craft buildings.\n- The time to tame a dinosaur could be reduced aswell. To tame a bronto could take up to 4 hours or more!\n- Food! Food! Food! Your character is always hungry.

Still no interest in going back to the game. The grind is still real.\n\nNow with this latest patch they've enable BattlEye. Currently anyone who's not running Windows as their OS is unable to connect to any server running BattlEye, as it's Windows only. This was incredibly short-sighted by the developers, but now it just feels like yet another mistake in a long list of mistakes so far.\n\nThe moderator(s) on the steam forums are still terrible.\n\nA good company really needs to address their customers concerns, not just sweep them under the rug. I still had high hopes the game would turn fun again but those hopes are dying rapidly.\n\nThere are longstanding very serious bugs that have been around since release that they still haven't even bothered saying "We're aware of that and working on a fix."\n\nGranted, this is an early access game and so you should expect bugs. However, since it is an early access game I also expect lots of communication from the developers on what they're working on and that's not very forthcoming. The developers have gotten less and less communicative as this process has gone on.\n\nThey used to post on the forums on a regular basis, now it's rather rare. If you see a post from a "dev" it's probably Jat with some copy/paste nonsense about bans or hacking.\n\nNow I've been permanently banned from their forum for "  ".

Each server is usually owned by 1 tribe who have amassed enough c4 to level everyone's base if they wanted to.  Most of the servers I've been to on PVP have ultimately became more or less PVE because of the dominant tribes that raid other tribes trying to PVP or Explore caves that are blocked off.\n\nThe game has some fun parts.

Either you will like it or you will have a horrible time with it. DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT buy this game if you plan to play by yourself. This is a sandbox survival game that lets you get attacked by other players while you are offline and you cant defend youself. This means that if you arent in a large tribe or arent lucky, someone will find you and they will kill you and destroy all your stuff, which means that you have to start all over EVERY SINGLE TIME.\n\nThe only way you can progress in this game playing solo is if you get extremely lucky and no one finds your base before you research metal, but for a new player, that means you have to level up and farm for materials, and that would take a really long time to do.\n\nI cant recommend this game based on the fact progress requires extreme luck/ and or forcing a play style people might not want to play, however, if you do intend to play with a large group, this game would be lots of fun.

I do not speak mandarian so my only English communication is really inside of ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes, FB with friends and family, etc...\n\nI come from a gaming history on the PC with my first love of games being MMORPG like Conquer Online, runescape, WOW, etc...\n\nQuickly as I moved to consoles I fell in love with single player RPGs such as the witcher series, bioshock 1-3***, all of the Elder Scrolls, fable (< I'm sorry), borderlands series, dying light, etc\n\nI have always played these games as if they were persistent worlds and truly dove into the progression min / maxing elements. When I play a game I immerse myself in it, following the current expert YouTube players, watching twitch streams, becoming actively engaged in forums... Anything I can to get a leg up and progress efficiently in these RPG esc games.\n\nNow disclaimer: I have never truly played a persistent MMO survival game until Ark\n\nThis was the game I had thought I was playing in all of the above but had yet to truly experience.\n\n1000+ hours of skyrim left me empty in that I had mastered the map... There was no true progression left, and mainly with all the games listed before I was only benefiting myself. Yes we have guilds and clans in some of the MMO's but for the exception of guide war game modes there was little point for me to be pouring in hours into these games except to be more pvp powerful than the next joe. I have been searching for a game without even knowing one could exist that was truly persistent, populated, challenging, and rewarding on more than a min / max scale.... That was until I found Ark Survival Evolved - I will now begin my review\n\nArk Survival Evolved\n\nThis is a game for those who love adapting play styles, techniques, load outs in order to advance and grow in a persistent world of challenge.\n\nThis is a game for anyone who is fascinated by the jungles of Farcry and the building mechanics (that are being polished now) of a crafting game.\n\nThis is a game for those who can be social, responsible, and can communicate with others to grow on a communal level.\n\nThis is a game for those who want a world to dive into and truly immerse themselves for 1000+ hours\n\nI have found the community to actually be incredibly helpful , supportive, giving, and kind - keep in mind I'm a "mature" gamer 24+ that knows how to "handle" global chat - if your a young kid who goes on a temper tantrum after losing 10 hours of work you will get eaten alive in this game and you will quit.\n\nThis is a game that going into you MUST understand NOTHING is permanent\n\nThis is a game where you MUST learn from what happens to you and understand that everything you lose or gain is YOUR FAULT and you must adapt accordingly - this can include how you interact with other players, building locations, building techniques, etc\n\nThis is truly a beautiful world, one that allows you to find yourself grinding out hours and days at a time for something bigger than just yourself.\n\nThis is an early access game, one that is updated almost daily and has many bugs, errors, glitches. But again you can be a part of this process! If you report these things the devs will respond and fix them! This in my mind is simply another global skill tree we are as a community working towards mastering.\n\nThis is a game where everything you have done, physically may be erased tmro, but the knowledge, contacts, and skills you have gained can never be taken from you.\n\nThis is a game worth playing :D\n\n"Together we Thrive"\nBooker\nGuardians\nOS5\n","January 27","true","157.2"," 201 of 303 people (66%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","66","201","303","27","28"

Ark is a grinbdfest and a time management game. The more time you can commit to play and the more you learn to grind, the better you do. You cant outplay other plays. You cant perform better and make any meaningful advances as the game encourages waiting out your enemy. I am sure there are tons of private servers that fix these inherent problems with the game but the overall point is the official servers encourage gameplay through the grind.\n\nIf you are a devoted PvP player who likes dominating others and has a large amount of time to commit, this game is probably for you, but I wont recommend a game to anyone that supplements gameplay with grinding and outweighing your enemy.\n\nAs a few people have mentioned. It is a somewhat better situation on private servers. Unfortunately, the game has no PvE endgame currently and the PvP is too heavily time mismanaged by forcing players to spend hours taming and gathering resources, as opposed to engaging in actual combat, which makes the game so unbelievably grindy. Get players fighting in person, not fighting bases while they are offline.","March 11","false","477.6"," 483 of 759 people (64%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","64","483","759","28","51"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neosageinfinite/recommended/346110/","neosageinfinite","Neo_Pi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neosageinfinite/","11 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlease note, I am assessing the game based on early access and not as a full game, thank you.\n\nAnd yes, I said no, even after playing so long because you get to this stage when you have played long. No I would not recommend it especially as an early access. Here's why:\n\n1) Community is rubbish.\nAs many of the above reviews have mentioned, this is seriously a downside if you are planning on early access and community response. Its true, many a critic, casual gamers and newcomers alike are now all experiencing Faction dominance, tribe stealing, griefing, etc. Some die 5 times the moment they respawn, some join a tribe, build for weeks to months only to have their gaming efforts kicked out of tribe and turned over to the chief, who could be a b*st*rd.\n\nSolution: For an Early Access game, you want your community expansive, subjective and evolving, not dominating and uncooperative. The only way to avoid tribes becoming disaster is to take out tribe governance option and leave one tribe option, which is everything owned personally, but shared riding along with a random generated map like Ark so that no one dominates, and no one have superiority over any land mass.\n\n2) Overgrinding versus overplay.\n\nYou want everyone on equal playing field the moment you release it as an early access. Grinding too much will differentiate individuals to a highly variable inequality. Its early access, and some reports are already mentioning the idea of official server resets. I mean cmon, its early access, set up the speed of gathering, taming and what not, you want casual gamers to comment on it too, not shy them away, you are gonna swipe the data once the game releases anyway. When you set the time pace too such a slow rate, yet lose you items so easily you leave no time for actual action gameplay. An hour of grinding for 5 mins of action and that doesn't even include the risks (which are plenty) to lose them all in a blink of an eye. Also note updates are daily, taming takes hours, the risk is higher that in one of those taming sessions, its gonna end up on a server maintanence period and boom, you'll lose the entire procedure by getting kicked out of server.\n\nSolution: There are already plenty of unofficial servers now coming out with 5xtaming, 3xExp, etc. It shows you the community have spoken, they want the grinding hours DOWN! Especially on official servers. Set up faster everything in certain official servers or have all of them revamped till the early access is over. Plan for a revamped Ark map that has random generation that includes seperated large archipellagoes connected only through seas of different arks in the pairs of three. This can also be done by having different maps for different servers or a random generated start of different islands. You avoid land dominance in this manner.\n\n3) Bugs that contribute to the above two points. There are bugs almost everywhere in the game, but that's no surprise, its the fact that it affects the above two points is what bugs me. When you have bugs that send dinos flying away at lightspeed after a spear or chop while your starving, place structures wrongly losing a huge resource stock on it and only getting half back, remove resources because some idiot wants his stamp on Ark mining spots, randomly jump out of a flying bird ( I mean cmon, whose lazy/stupid enough not to secure that use button while flying? Few codes and that use button wont work while flying..is that soooo hard? ), dinos keep rushing on you while you harvest therefore end up hitting them or killing them and more than half the dinos dont know how to follow properly and/or get stuck into spots leaving you exposed to losing both your dinos and yourself, etc its time to NOT ignore the bugs. Again, take note all this requires hours of grinding and to lose them to bugs, you break apart the community into haves and haves not, where one cudn't careless of the bugs and those that do, tend to take the game less seriously. You want all players to invest their interest into the game and these bugs is one main reason why you have a community problem due to the bugs that cause unstable grinding and overt stress that shys away gamers that could have spend way more hours on record.\n\nSolution: Stop adding all those other funny stuff...enough is enough, the bugs and interface have to go or you will submit your pride and joy into a very uncertain and risky future. You have no more cards behind your sleeves, there is no more dino movie coming out to publicize for you, its time to stop the hanky panky and completely eradicate the bugs that were existant since god knowns when. Its time to at least prepare the game into a version that is at least releasable.\n\n4)YOLO:\nAlmost everything in this game's gameplay is a YOLO dive. If you die, thats it, there's nothing saving your data. IF you do want to save your data, you STILL have to kill yourself. Seriously, what's with all the game's impact on YOLO?  You can't save halfway, you can't save your character for download while keeping them alive (Meaning if the server resets, any server, your entire character development goes), there are no checkpoint spots, you characters is entirely exposed when you're off with only a bed that can respawn you with a cooldown and weak health. Seriously, this game has a hardcore grinding mechanics for a YOLO trip. We already have a real life, don't make this game another one of those let's try to be real thing with unfair life-like mechanics, its a very wrong move for a survival game, instead go arcade monster hunter freedom and minecraft-like. You'd want this game to last long, not just for a short time period before it vanishes even before its released.\n\n5) Game processing and optimizing is very poor not because of vamped up graphics but server to pc data transfer that causes those stop frames and huge FPS when you know your pc can run it, just taking time to process it. This means, not only does this game demand high system requirements, it also demands high internet bandwidth. You'd have a pretty sucky time with gameplay if you're connection sucks. That itself eradicates even more potential players, not to mention potential dedicated servers that can't handle that much requirements. It's almost like this game demands a whole lot from you but offers little in return at this stage.\n\nSo no...unfortunately I would not recommend others to this game at this stage in early access. I definitely will when the solutions to the problems above are handled but for now, it's not that I won't but I believe I can't, it doesn't even allow me to do that because I would feel like I'm treating other gamers unfairly. I say this after playing for 203.8 hours of gaming it as an avid gamer with a casual perspective for gaming.\n\nContrast option:\n- Most of the positive reviews are true, the game has depth for it to be released, but as above, it lacks quality.\n- I would say the highest ranking in survival games in terms of graphics and sandbox freedom\n- High customizability (as of recent skins and patches)\n- Smooth transcendence between solo and co-op play. One minute you feel alone, the next theres a random dude half naked running across the beach yelling "YOLO!!!" (The mic voice even fades in and out in strength compared to the distance you are to the voice source)\n- Variable high definition weather (However this looses points to the overhardcore grinding mentioned above as the weather influences your survivability to a level displeasing or stressfull rather than engaging and adrenaline kicked excitement)\n- The game encourages tribe joining  and player cooperation but as seen by proof of many such a state, due to the above mentioned negative points, almost all of the long standing servers with larger memory banks often end up corrupted or with negative based community.\n\n*Note my opinions of this game is subject to change on a later date after the improvements*","July 31, 2015","false","266.7"," 139 of 206 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","139","206","3","9"

Had a good smile seeing that i could. Got some rocks off the beach and made a pickaxe. Then i saw the turtle looking dino. It moved slow, and didn't alarm me as i walked up to it. So i figured i'd try to tame it.... so i punched it.\n\n"Apparently" they don't like that.... I died.\n\nI respawned, ran to get my stuff (i was lucky i respawned in the same area, as this was before we could pick our respawn point, and of course i didn't have a bed yet or anything).\n\nI decided it would be a better idea to continue to gather stuff. I leveled up and found i could make a spear. I made a spear, and thought.... VENGEANCE for that turtle killing me. I now had my Mighty Spear!!!\n\nI ran back to where the turtle was hanging out (i hadn't really left that spawn area yet). I poked it with my spear... HAHA!!\n\nMy Spear broke... and "Apparently" those turtles don't like to be poked by spears... i died.\n\nI respawned again close by (very lucky). Got my stuff back.\n\nI decided it was time for me to move on, see if i couldn't find something else to poke with my spear (i made a new one, at the time, i believed that my spear broke on the turtles hard shell, i later read that spears can sometimes break randomly with use).\n\nI traveled along the coast and found on a small cliff, one of those glowing supply drop that are randomly dropped from the sky. I got some nice loot, a bed, some walls, and a base to put the walls down on. Even a fire pit. I was pumped. I then backed away from where the supply drop, and fell down a spot between rocks (that weren't mineable) and the cliff. i was stuck.\n\nI starved to death...\n\nI respawned in the same respawn place Again.\n\nI couldn't get my stuff and it was getting dark... so i saw one of those glowing oblisks.. i figured i'd make a dash for that.\n\nI found some Dilo's on the way... but managed to LIVE!\n\nI set up a little spot that i've been at since.\n\nReal Review.\n\nThe game is an Alpha game. I feel I need to say that first. It is always very easy to say that you understand what it means, with the bugs, wipes, etc that can happen. It's another story when you have to deal with them first hand. This game has bugs, glitches, performance issues. Don't buy the game expecting to run it flawlessly. Because if it starts messing up, you're just going to get frustrated. Also, because this is an Alpha game, some of the features could change, or be fixed if it wasn't meant to be done in the first place. So BE WARNED IT IS NOT A FINISHED GAME. I just want to stress that part. Since sometimes folks tend to say.. "yeah, yeah, i know, I know"... then rage because something is broken, or gets broken because of an update/patch.\n\nNow that i've got the disclaimer out of the day.\nPros:\nTons of content.\nGreat features such as taming, building, farming.\nLevel progression, so you don't get access to everything at once. You have to work for it, which makes it that much better.\nEnd game content, such as bosses to face, high tier weapons, and base defenses.\nDino's to ride\nLarge list of ever growing dino's/creatures to tame, ride. Each with different needs and challenges when taming. Each brings something new to the table for use once tamed.\nActive Dev team. They're working what seems like non-stop to get more features in, creatures in, and making the game run more smoothly.\nTo go with the above, Communication!

Yesterday (6/4/2015), I read reviews and watched reviews and this game got a HORRIBLE wrap from everyone. "Buggy", " Unpolished" are just a few of the words that come to my mind from the reviews. I decided to hold off on buying it. I was done buying unfinished games.\n\nToday, I decided to check on it and did a few searches online to see if any progress has been made with performance. I noticed the reviews on here went from "Mixed" to "Mostly Positive", then a friend convinced me to buy it. It wasn't hard to convince me as I saw that the developers were actually working hard on improving this and I was willing to give them a shot.....(AND I EFFING LOVE DINOSAURS!!!!!!!)\n\nI logged in expecting the game to just not work, like a lot of the reivews have stated. Logged in and made my character and was pleasantly surprised by the "Awful" performance. (sarcasm)\n\nSystem specs:\n- i7-5820K\n- Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4 2666MhZ (32GB)\n- EVGA GTX 980 2-way SLI\n- EVGA Supernova 1500 watt\n- MSI X99 SLI Plus\n\nI listed my specs here because I want you to know that this rig can blast through just about any game on Ultra so there's no issue of my hardware not being able to handle this game. That being said, I set all of my settings to "Epic" and prepared for the worst. I logged in and was immediately greeted by a Brontosaurus walking right next to me. I was running at a SOLID 20 FPS, which I know, 20 FPS isn't good, but for some reason it seemed smooth and was totally playable. I'm not sure if my FPS counter was broken, I just used the built in steam FPS counter. Sometimes it would dip to 15 but again, it was still smooth and didn't have ANY hickups and drop down to 5 FPS or anything, and it honestly looked more like 40 FPS. This game is 100% playable for me and is amazing. Again, this is an EARLY ACCESS GAME, people who are expecting a bugless launch and perfect optimization should have their Master Race cards revoked. I look forward to many more hours spent on this game.\n\nLastly, I don't leave many comments on games that I buy but I feel like these developers deserve to know that they are doing an amazing job. This game has been patched so many times over the past few days and it shows they actually care about their game, and the least we can do is support them and acknowledge that they are doing a fantastic job. While the game might not be FULLY optimized to run at 60 FPS yet, they have made great strides in the stability and performance in only 3 days and are now AWESOME Developers in my book. Fantastic job you guys, keep up the amazing work! I can't wait to see where this game will be in another week.","June 5, 2015","true","104.9"," 63 of 84 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","63","84","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swashblade/recommended/346110/","swashblade","Swashblade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swashblade/","142 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've revisited this game to see if anything has improved in the last 12 months.  Because there are comments that refer to my original review I'll leave that text here.  The updated review can be found further down.\n\n-----Original Review-----\nI'll start with this simple statement: This is not a game to play alone.\n\nThe crafting system pretty much requires that you work with other people to have access to all the craftable items.  Some people will need to specialise in building construction, others in tools, weapons and armour.  Unless you do that you'll find that you run out of Engram Points by the time you reach the level cap (60) and can't buy the upper tier schematics.\n\nI had high hopes for this game.  It's horribly unforgiving though.  On my first login my character was dead before he'd even finished scratching his shiny wrist implant, having woken up next to a crocodile who seemed to take offense at its dinner suddenly becoming self-aware and put a stop to it as quickly as possible.\n\nAnything you try to do in this game is going to take a whole mess of time.  The big attraction in the game, taming and riding dinosaurs, can take anywhere up to four hours (real time) during which you have to sit next to your prospective steed force feeding it whatever its favourite food is with the occasional narcotic berry slipped in to keep it from running away while you wait for Stockholm syndrome to kick in.  During that time you're very unlikely to be able to go anywhere else, so you're a sitting duck for any carnivore who decides a nice soft human looks much more appetizing than any of the bite sized morsels it walks past on its way to you.\n\nThe pvp aspect of the game is also very punishing.  To make a base you'll spend hours levelling up to unlock the necessary schematics, gathering materials, picking out a spot with access to water and far enough from the beaten track to avoid being killed while you're building and then putting together a few modest rooms with a lockable door in which you can safely log off, knowing that your unconscious body will remain in the game until you log back in.  Unfortunately those hours of effort can be undone in a matter of minutes by the first person to wander by, bash down a wall, ransack your supplies and drag your body away for blood draining and/or butchering.  Apparently having tamed dinosaurs as guardians is the way to avoid this.  I've already addressed the problems there.  Or make sure you play exclusively on pve servers where the coast is covered in enough thatched huts and campfires that you'll wonder if you haven't accidentally wandered into a Pacific island resort.\n\nThis is pre-release of course and a lot of the problems can be solved with a few tweaks.  Times can be changed, damage can be retuned, hell, maybe they'll even manage to make the AI more sophisticated and create the "living ecosystem" they've been advertising instead of the sandbox of dinosaurs versus megalodons that it is currently.  That won't change my core problem with the game though - the rigidity of the building system.\n\nIf, like me, you don't enjoy the building system in Rust or The Forest, where walls and floor snap together in predefined ways, you're going to have a hard time enjoying this game.  Say goodbye to any plan of building bridges between islands - you can't build a span more than a few blocks of a foundation piece and as soon as the ground drops away more than a metre that's the end of your foundation.  I long for epic constructions, a Jurassic Park style gate between two cliffs or a village on stilts above a lagoon.  Sadly that kind of thing remains purely in the realm of the voxel-based building games.\n-----End Original Review-----\n\nI originally said this wasn't a game designed for playing alone.  That remains true.  What I didn't mention is that you shouldn't buy this game if you don't intend to devote a large proportion of your waking hours to it.  I alluded to the time-heavy nature of the game but I never spelled it out in these terms : If you do not treat this game as a job you will not succeed in online play.\n\nI was not aware of blueprints when I wrote the original review - they can supplement your engrams and can be found in what are basically supply drops.  Supply drops are rated with different colours showing the value of the contained loot and are visible from as far as your draw distance will allow so the more lucrative drops will be hotly contested.  On a pvp server you can probably forget it unless you're online during a lull.  The established tribes on each server will by now be strong enough to dictate who can play on that server.\n\nThe game appears to be much more unforgiving than I remember.  Heat and cold are even more out of whack, with my character overheating while waist deep in water and freezing to death while crouched next to a roaring campfire.  The multitude of new creatures added to the game mean that it's rare to go far without something attacking you - In the hour I played it tonight I was spawn killed by pirahnas, snakes and some kind of winged creature that I only heard, never saw, before I was dead.\n\nThe game world itself is horribly unintuitive.  Rocks on the ground are sometimes just textures rather than resource nodes.  Likewise driftwood on the beach is just a texture, not something you can pick up to avoid having to punch a tree down to get materials to make your tools.  Berries and fibres can be picked from almost anything leafy that isn't a tree.  Except for the leafy stuff that you can't harvest from that looks just like the stuff you can.  Predators and prey mingle together completely unconcerned meaning you can't assume an area with grazing herbivores is in any way safe - a snake or a raptor will ignore all of them in favour of taking down the player.\n\nI don't think it's reasonable for the developers to claim this game is in early access at this point.  For the last year the core of the game has remained unchanged - a poorly optimised, unbalanced time sink.  All they appear to have done is add biomes to the map and a bunch of new prehistoric beasties, the kinds of things you'd normally consider to be a normal post-release update.\n\nI honestly wish Steam's refund policy had been updated before I purchased this game.  I have no desire to ever revisit this game.","June 12, 2015","false","27.6"," 235 of 366 people (64%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","64","235","366","36","14"

Midway i spot another tribe's base, noticing no turrets gives me courage to go closer and have a look at it. The turrets were hidden and took my ptera down in 30ms.As cigarette smoke starts filling the room, I soon realize I'm out in the wilderness kilometres away from any friendly settlement, running out of ammo. A carno charges at me from the bushes, I defeat it in a tense fight. A T-rex appears behind my back, and I barely evade it's first strike and rush towards the hillside close by. I mindlessly start running up north towards our remote village. After running away for minutes, I arrive at a glade and spot the cliff the village is located on and I remember that my clifftop village is unaccessible by foot. I start building a platform to reach it, and when i reach about 20m of height, I catch sight of the near identical cliff on which the village is built. An hour, and 2 rebuilds later my platform reaches the top of the cliff and I'm in safety.\n\n10/10 Would play until dawn trying to reach my safe haven.\n\nPS: Best graphic simulator ever! 10/10 would reapply settings and mess around with them to get the fps i had a day ago.\n\nTL;DR : Ark is very promising and could be an enjoyable game in it's current state. Graphics are gorgeous but won't even run on my friend's custom built very high end rig properly without inconsistent fps drops. Gameplay mechanics are UTTERMOSTLY interesting but are not perfectly polished. The music is composed by Gareth Coker who composed the wonderful themes of Ori and the blind forest<3, and are therefore very inspiring, but for instance constant in and out restart of combat music gets annoying and repetitive after a while. Gameplay experience in overall is satisfying. But players who hate to grind mindlessly, or are not prepared to lose their items or buildings anytime should not consider playing it. Given it's an early access game glitches, bugs and poor optimization are present, building placement should be redesigned, game balance should be adjusted.Devs are active, tho they should put their focus on graphics optimization, building system polishment, and PROPER game balance changes to appeal to more casual players. Instead of pushing content and MAKING A HORRIBLE DECISION with nerfing tamed dino stats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArk is a promising title in the currently popular survival genre. If you are into survival games and enjoy playing with many people as a community sharing resources, you are guaranteed to have a lot of fun. But the game is hardcore and is therefore not suited for the faint-hearted and in it's current state has it's flaws, given it's an early access game, and that the devs are active, improvements are certainly coming.\n\nIt's basically a MMO-ish survival game, with crafting system, building placement, and companion/mount taming. It's heavily focused on PvPvE gameplay(meaning it kind of forces you to play in a tribe but there is a constant threat of encountering aggressive players) and is very unforgiving (If anyone played KMMOs could know what it means when a game is about THE GRIND, and this game wants you to hoard high amounts of materials to progress in the tech tree and craft higher end items. with official multiplier rates it's very very grindy. Atop of that you could lose anything, anytime, anywhere.) The grind is eased by the clan system, which are from now on are mentioned as tribes. Players could form tribes and share bases and mounts and basically all their wealth.\n\nTo even maximalize time sink effect, taming or breeding dinos and other beasts, takes from an hour to 16+hrs, without the ability to completely leave the game unattended for extended periods.\n\nBuilding placement is very tricky and is hard to use properly. Given your mats are earned with hard work, this is very annoying in certain situations.\n\nGame balance is heading in a disastrous direction after tamed dinos had their stats nerfed badly.\nInstead game designers should have at least lowered mat requirements and taming duration globally.\n\nGraphics are very unoptimized and settings are currently broken ( you have to reapply settings every now and then(after alt-tabs, steam overlay. View distance for instance won't differ on max and low settings, some settings give better results when maxed out than on medium)","January 19","true","528.0"," 81 of 116 people (70%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","70","81","116","19","5"

This review will be partially gaming community, game features / the devs, and the entire game concept.  This is not a bad game, it is a decent game that can be a lot of fun, but I cannot recommend at this time unfortunately.\n\nThis is not a "complaint review", but rather my experience with the game so far.  If we are rating this by a "what I paid vs. what I got", it's almost impossible for me to say "don't buy this game".  Honestly, if you're looking at it, you should probably buy this game.\n\nI've played a lot of survival games, I have almost 1000 hours into the genre, so I am used to losing / regaining, etc.  ARK's primary problem (in my opinion) is the massive time investment vs. the progression you actually get out of it.  Raiding in ARK is easier than in Rust once you are established, the only thing stopping the servers from getting flattened nightly by offline raiders is the time investment and politics on every server preventing that.\n\nThat being said, probably 95% of my time spent ingame has been rebuilding what I had already progressed to, because I had been entirely wiped out by a group of people.  Not regular raiding, concentrated griefing and base flattening / dino griefing.  I've had to change servers multiple times due to big Chinese clans who join the server overnight in the 30-40 range of player count and just clear cut half the island to level up.  They openly admit to selling ARK items / resources online through the obelisk system, and make it impossible to progress because they use various exploits (shooting from under the ground / noclipping through gates) to grief your dinos.\n\nI've personally had to leave 4 servers because of Chinese players.  They flatten entire servers with numbers overnight (North American servers) and will ESP every single one of your bases until you can no longer play.  I started playing this game with a small group of friends that eventually expanded into 20 people, and most of them no longer play the game because of this.\n\nThe rest of the ARK community is disgustingly similar to Rust, and I hate the Rust community.  "Get rekt fa**ot" and the "n-word" are thrown around every ten seconds, and people will do things just to be d-ouch-ebags.  This is obviously not the devs fault, but it is the state of the community regardless.\n\nMy main gripe:\n\nYou can spend almost 12 hours (12 real life hours) sitting and staring at the pixellated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a dinosaur only to have that dinosaur die 10-20 minutes after taming it due to one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a single flying ant.  A FLYING ANT.  And that's not even including the time needed to level this dinosaur up and make it actually effective.  For example, during 3.0 difficulty I spent about a week on a sabertooth only to have it get griefed during a raid.\n\nThe game is okay, you'll spend a lot of hours on it, but it's the lucky few who seem to actually get a good experience out of their hours.  The devs also seem to cater SPECIFICALLY to the "forum minority", those few players who whine on the forums all day get what they want.  The entire resources progression of the game for example is now ♥♥♥♥ed because it was "too hard to find resources" or "too hard to do this, or that", "devs nerf caves pls everything should be fair".\n\nThese same people will then comment on this review calling me a "scrub" and saying I need to "learn to play".  Because they are mostly hypocrites.  Cheers!

There wasn't really much PvP, it was more like PvE until you get stitched up by a tribe.\n\nThe thing I didn't like about this game is that it takes over your life. If you log off the game, there's a high chance your buildings will be destroyed and your stuff looted and dinos killed. Therefore, it's a bad idea to log off the game. Taming the dinosaurs was kind of rewarding, but they'll probably be dead when you log back in.\n\nI know what some of you are thinking, play on an unofficial server. This doesn't make any difference.

Anything good about it is ruined by a couple critical issues, bad bugs, and all the terrible people who populate servers.\n\nI much prefer playing in single player, or on non dedicated servers.  Both because the people aren't awful, but also because the game actually runs differently.  However, for a game that is supposed to be a multiplayer open world survival, not having the multiplayer working right makes me feel like I didn't get what I was trying to buy.\n\nThe major issues was the way the game plays.  Basically, if you go on a multiplayer server there's a top tribe.  In PvP that tribe rules with an iron fist, enforcing whatever server rules they like.  Their superior blueprints, resources and dinos will always enable them to crush any up and coming group, or small tribes.  For example, *every* PvP server I played on, the top tribe had a ban on Gigas, calling them too powerful to trust to lower tribes.  And I was blocked from the holiday events, because other players didn't want to share the drops.\n\nOn the one hand, this is totally cool.  It's an open world, and it's amazing that it let's people do anything, and who wouldn't want to put out the eye of new rival clans entering your server/island?\n\nOn the other hand, as someone new to the game, I have basically experienced nothing but the misery that comes with watching hours of my time be destroyed, along with my emotional attachment to my homes and tamed dinosaurs.  As you hit stone age tools and weapons, top tribes take notice and start to suppress you.  It makes leveling more difficult and gathering top tier resources impossible.  This effectively blocks you from high level & end game content, unless you are in the top tribe.\n\nTruely, the game is difficult.  Which makes the losses so much more painful.  And because live servers run all the time, you'll likely wake to your things destroyed.  The only way to combat this, is to be part of a large tribe... or, the top tribe.  Leading to all servers I visted having one top tribe that basically controlled the server.\n\nThose tribes put people through all sorts of hazzing & harassment.  The worst case, my gf (whom I play games with regularly) was sexually harassed, after being locked in a cage (which is an in game mechanic).  She cried for two hours, having lost weeks of labor, and being imprisoned and sexually harassed.\n\nCertainly, this is not the developers fault, although it did happen on an official server.\n\nMy point is that, when its awful... it gets very very awful.  And then you basically have to restart from scratch.  There are whole groups of people who just roam from server to server talking about how they were abused by this person or that group, and which servers to avoid.\n\nOn PvE servers, top tribes simply control all the best spots to build, or build collumns to block other tribes from building in their terriorty.  Bases are huge, and top tribes basically have zoos everywhere.  Many servers look like deserts where there are no wild animals, and no resources.\n\nConsidering the difficulty of the game, this (early access) game's bugs are pretty critical.  Oops, your dino pops through a wall/floor and died/disappeared?  Oh well, hours of work gone.\n\nI've basically quit online play, and play a small game singe player/offline with roommates.  Problem is, you don't have enough skill points to do everything alone, so even single player/offline is difficult.\n\nUnless you have a server and some friends to play with, do not buy.","January 1","false","459.3"," 112 of 169 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","112","169","5","8"

In otherwords, it felt extremely unforgiving, personal, and gutwrenching as we watched from a tranq arrow induced coma, as several players beat our dinos and base into the ground.\n\nWith that said, we learned a valuable lesson, never build a base out of wood without first building weapons, a defensive wall, and possibly a gun. Even as harsh as the pvp in the game can be, it is without a doubt completely exhilarating, you never get used to a sudden gunshot, or a group of raptor riders chasing you through longgrass, or breaking through a forest, backpeddeling while hastily firing an assault rifle into the treeline as a saddled T-Rex or Spinosaurus crashes through with jaws agape searching for your torso.\n\nNow with nearly 300 hours into the game, and no sign of becoming bored with the game in all of its unflinching ruthlessness, I can honestly say this game deserves a long and dedicated look.\n\nAs far as the games developer team goes, I have yet to see a team so interested in their own creation! From consistantly and quickly releasing new content, teasing upcoming new content, interacting with and assisting the current player community, and even playing the game with us in their downtime. 10/10 on the devs for not pulling a DayZ-like scenario.\n\nTLDR - Game is great, put the time in with no regrets, throw poop and rocks, help actually shape the game while it's in development, and last but definitely not least - This is how early access and game developers are supposed to act!","June 29, 2015","true","298.7"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","42","53","9","0"

So, I'm going to mark this game as Not Recommend. As the game continues to be worked on, it becomes easier and easier to run, but also becomes more and more complex with how many dinos there are.\nBasically, I wouldnt recommend this not just because of performance issues but also because of the other players. It's hard to take any players seriously or trust them when sometime they'll end up killing you, your dinos, or griefing your base while offline. Sadly, it's not a matter of if you'll get killed/griefed... it's a matter of when. If you've poured over 600 hours into this game like myself, then you'd understand the pain associated with getting wiped after 600 hours of playing in peace. I played on a PvPvE server, and knew it would happen eventually, but I didnt even get a chance to defend myself. I was offline and so was my tribe.\nAs a seasoned player, this game was easy when I first started playing. However... When I created a new character on a different server, it was extremely difficult to stay alive. If you like struggling for 3+ hours starting out in a new game, then this is definitely for you! But, if you like to survive based on your skills as a player, then this probably isnt for you (not anymore). The beach is packed with Dilos, Raptors, Sabercats, Eagles (or Argents), sometimes a Rex with the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bronto.\nCovered the players\nTalked about starting fresh\nThe build system...\nAs a crafter and builder, this game is beautiful! Absolutely love the crafting system. Hit this, hit that, grab this and that.. press Craft and tada! You have a pickaxe. lol. You can gather a lot, and craft a lot, but if you are on a pvp server, dont make it obvious by how much you are packing. (Dont wear fabricated armor and carry around a fabricated weapon... Shows you got good supplies at your base) A raiding tribe sees this, they mark you, find you, and watch to see when you go offline.. anyways lol. Crafting. The amount of supplies needed to craft is pretty on par with what you get, but not on how easy it is to consume/destroy. Maybe it is, maybe it isnt.. Maybe the developers intended for a solo player to raid a tribe's triple metal wall base, load up all their supplies on a rex and walk away.. who knows.. lol. Bottom line is...\nIt's still early access and there are balance issues to be addressed. I dont think more dinos need to be added unless they are dinos that help balance. (Snails that create paste to help build more metal walls for example). If it were easier by being a smarter player to build... Id be down with that. I wouldnt be ok with it just being easier to build... then there would be noob huts everywhere. O_O\n\nReview in a nutshell- Play this game if you love dinos and just want to play casual. Dont get attached to anything. It will most likely die, or burn to the ground.. :'(\n\nIf any Dev was actually paying attention to this review- Thanks for listening and adding PVE "pvp" flag like I recommended. lol. Now just add PvP "pve" flag too... so PVP server tribes can have times of peace (and cant remove it until a set amount of time has passed).","June 21, 2015","false","795.0"," 194 of 307 people (63%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","63","194","307","21","19"

It is still being heavily and carefully worked on.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy Experience so far has been great, frame rate is still struggling as expected but did go up after a few patches. The crafting system is nice and progressive and forces you to do things to level up and unlock more recipes. As expected you don't lose recipes when you die or levels making it very easy to recover from death. The building mechanic so far is solid and players from Rust legacy will be familar with it. Taming is difficult as it should be but is very rewarding. Most people have also not even seen a full 15% of the game yet at the time of this, gauranteed. This game is massive and takes a lot of leveling to unlock all the craftables while also encouraging you to venture deeper into the island as you get stronger.\n\nAll expected bugs and performance issues aside it is a very promising Early Access game. The fact that this has mixed reviews already comes from the majority of inexperienced people with Early Access games ♥♥♥♥♥ing that something doesn't work Day 1.\n\nNothing ever works Day 1 launch, get over it.

However it quickly became apperent that if you can't give up working  , school and sleeping you will get literally no where in this game.   The game is designed to make the strong tribe wipe out any threat that starts building up power just so they can stay the strongest.  After watching some youtube videos I found there were some servers full of nice people that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s went out of their way to make a survivor and just troll them nonstop  by griefing dinos and bases everyway they could.  I even saw one dude get outed after griefing and bought another copy of the game just to go back and  troll them some more.\n\nGameplay review;\n\nThere is so much amazingness about the game but its surrounded  by so much ♥♥♥♥ and bugs it is  hard to give this a solid  review.  Without spending days to farm kibble a high level dinosaur can take you upwards of 12hours to tame.  That is 12 hours you have to spend playing the game you can't even start it and come back later since you have to protect your dinosaur from wild dinosaurs and trolls + keep the torpor raised and food on it.\nAfter taming the dinosaur you have to have somewhere to keep it safe otherwise there is an extremely high chance it will be dead by the time you log on the next day.\n\n\nThey are  constantly pushing out new content at an incredible rate but they aren't fixing some major issues the game has.\n\n\nTribe glitch:  There is a chance upon leaving a tribe and joining one that your previous tribe will just become completely owned by the new tribe.  So  you have to be careful who you recruit as if they leave and join a dif tribe you could lose 100% of everything you own and have absolutely no way to fix it.\n\nFalling through the map:  Isn't 100% death but without points in  stam / oxygen it pretty much is.  Oh rememeber that dinosaur you spent 12 hours to tame and 1 week farming up resources to build him a safe dinopen?  Yeah he fell through the map with you and drown.\n\nTwo biggest glitches I know about.\n\n\nWhen I first bought this game it was amazing.  I literally lost myself in it and it was worse then crack or heroin for me.  I'd stay up  4 days in a row with a couple friends playing it nonstop.  sleep for maybe 5 hours and repeat.  Had about 12 active tribe members and a pretty big base.  Was pretty awesome.  I was a peaceful tribe who only traded  and helped new players get started.   Until one day I got drug into a war between the 2 strongest tribes and wiped out in 1 night of being offline.  My entire base and all 200+ of my dinos were killed.   1000 hours of work and I have absolutely nothing to show for it.\n\n\nTL;DR  I definitely got my moneys worth buying the game and I'd definitely go back and buy it again if I could.

It takes the most successful components of survival games, crafting, collecting resources, eating, building shelter, and brings all these things to another level: Surviving on an island with Dinosaurs. Building a base is not as easy as you would think on an island with Dinosaurs, as the larger ones can easily destroy any dwelling created simply by walking on it. You have several types of materials to build structures with including; Thatch, Wood, Stone, and Metal. There are over 60 different types of dinosaurs so far in the game and the developers are always adding new content. Some Dinosaurs can be tamed and used as protection, pack mules, for egg or ♥♥♥♥ farming, resource collecting, or even to ride.\n\nYou can play Ark: Survival Evolved both as a single player game, as well as in multiplayer mode, either on public or privately hosted servers. You are not limited to first-person perspective as some survival games do, a third-person perspective is an option. You can also tailor various aspects of the game to your own personal playstyle, using the settings prior to launching the game in single player. Make the nights shorter and the days longer, adjust the regrowth rate of flora and fauna, there are dozens of options to choose from.\n\nArk: Survival Evolved initially made me wary, because of the concept of a survival game on an island with dinosaurs; However, once I played it I realized the amazing potential it had. Some Dinosaurs are passive, and of course many are hostile and predatory, but there is a great balance to the game and if you play it smart, you can survive a long time and have a lot of fun. The developers seem to really be interested in making this an amazing game, even going as far as to reward players who are able to find exploits. Visually speaking I think the game is on par with a lot of the more recent survival titles and the details of the dinosaurs are amazing. This game is good enough, if you enjoy survival games it is worth paying full price for. You won't be disappointed.","August 13, 2015","true","112.9"," 55 of 76 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","55","76","4","3"

Yes you do need a good graphics card to run but they haven't optimized it yet.\nBesides that, the game has a lot of content for just being released but compared to what they want to add they game doesnt have much.\nThe progression system in the game in my opinion is pretty good. Instead of being able to know how to craft everything as you spawn you have to progress through levels to get points to spend on recipes.\nThe taming system of dinos i think is good too.

What did this mean? 75% reduction in the health and damage on ALL of your tamed dinos. Just to put that in perspective, a Rex tames in with x health and y damage.. let's say 8000 health and 448 damage. Once this Rex is around 50 of its 58 (or whatever the current cap is) levels, it will have around 60k health and 1500 damage. Now, SLASH those numbers down to 14k health and 375 damage and you have what the devs just released.\n\nThis is when we start screaming. The devs said "Ok, let's fix this a little". Now that same Rex has about 17k health and 600 damage. That's the end! When you tame your first Rex, it's just a Rex! It's awesome! It's a Rex! Then you get a big base and (probably) venture into the realm of breeding dinos and taming more dinos. Now you're investing A LOT of time into these dinos. You spend weeks hatching eggs and raising dinos from baby to adulthood looking for the right stats so you can get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc generation dino. Finally you are breeding an ultra badass Rex!\n\nNOW ALL OF THAT WORK IS GONE.\n\nDino stats and levels are virtually pointless now that the stats are so incredibly low. Why spend days or weeks looking for that 120 (max wild level) dino and all of the resources it requires to tame it with the most effectiveness if the difference between it and something half its' level is 2k health and less than 100 damage? You don't! You can go out and tame the first 4 Rexs you find and they will be better than that ONE you spent weeks selectively breeding for!\n\nBrand new players won't have it as rough as those of us who have a lot of time involved in this game, just don't forget that the devs have a hard on for screwing over your months of investment down the road.","January 5","false","186.3"," 202 of 323 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","202","323","9","6"

You wake up on a strange island, lost to time, with nothing to your name except a ragged loin cloth, and chances are it's going to stay that way for awhile.\nThe Island is not a forgiving place, your best chance at survival in the early hours is to gather resources quick and stay close to some big herbivores that might turn aggressive on a carnivore if it comes your way.  This can only protect you for so long, eventually you're going to have to scavenge food, construct shelter and, hopefully, some tools that will ease you on your way to a more permanent residence on the island.\n\nYou aren't the top of the foodchain out here, but you can be, if you're quick and cunning.\n\nBut maybe that's not for you. Maybe you're more of a Lego-minded sort, just wanting to build something impressive in an ancient world, and guess what? This game is still the place for you.\nIt's Minecraft on a whole new level. If you just want to build, adjust your singleplayer game to your liking, make yourself invincible if you wish, and go to town. No Dino will hurt you and you can build to your hearts content.\n\nFrankly, the only question you should ask yourself about ARK isn't whether you'll like it--you will, it has something for everyone--the thing you have to answer is "Can my computer handle it?"\nThat's the only true difficulty in purchasing this game. It's beautiful, it's vivid, and it can make even the heartiest of gaming rigs chug for support. My own PC is top of the line but when I crank up this game my tower's gentle fans turn into the engines of jumbo jet to ensure I keep running smoothly.\nI do, I've never had the game crash on me, and rarely suffer any slowdown, but I can hear the effort it takes for my computer to ensure my enjoyment on The Island.\n\n\n"Is ARK the game for me?"\n\nARK is the game for everyone, just as long as you can run it.","March 18","true","171.1"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","37","47","2","3"

Far more entertaining, than following the rules. Common psychology and also verging on what the broader topic of mass hysteria.\nYou are correct. Developers cannot solve people. However, if they develop the game with this in mind, whilst aiming to delliver something great, then there is less damage the community can do.\n\nTo anyone who wishes to comment about me and the community, whilst defending developers, just look at what the developers have had to do to try and combat this - with a semi "police system", encouraging others to take matters in their own hands, where players feel someone is cheating, etc. etc.\nThen look at how some are using what the developers gave them, to make things even worse for some - finding a random person, keeping them unconscious and then forcing them to do menial tasks - even if said player is innocent.\nIf the game was developed correctly, to begin with, then the chances of this happening, would be less.\n\nTake my review, or leave it. I have my opinion. I bought the game. I was unsatisfied with my purchase. I left my feedback.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/346110/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is the shining example of a great idea, no...amazing idea held back by various technical limitations or issues. It's just too shoddily executed and put together at the moment. The word that I associate with ARK: Survival Evolved is most definitely inconsistency. ♥♥♥ Rape at your Keyboard was another thing I associated A.R.K. to, as that is what it feels like while playing, but jokes aside this game suffers from a roller coaster experience of execution.  From the good, such as the various dinosaurs, building and weapon variety, and graphics, to the bad; Spawns, AI behavior, and right down to various game mechanics. Worse yet is that all of these factors just end up resulting in a very, very frustrating experience. I have never been so angry at a video game before, because at every single turn I kept wanting to like this game more and more only to get frustrated just as equally.\n\nTo get into the inconsistency, let me tackle the spawning system. It's ♥♥♥♥ing ATROCIOUS. I don't even just mean your own character - as you will frequently spawn right next to a hostile creature, to die or take damage as you look at your arms with the spawn animation - but how aggressive enemies will just up and appear out of nowhere at times. Swimming down a stream? Oh, ♥♥♥♥ you here's a Megapiranha. Trudging through a swamp? Hey, check it out a Titanoboa out of the blue! Winding down the beaten path? Here's a Pulmonoscorpius(Scorpion) to ♥♥♥♥ your day up. As I said, they'll appear out of thin air at times, and the most mind boggling thing is when multiple of them are in the same area at once. I once ran around a corner into 4 Titanoboa's who weren't there before. Were they just chilling, shooting the ♥♥♥♥ before coming out to ♥♥♥♥ up the next guy? I guess so. They probably proceeded to high-five each other afterwards as they quadruple teamed my unconscious body. I am not exaggerating. I have seen a Sarcosuchus(Crocodile) rise up from beneath the map to give chase to me. It's ludicrous.\n\nIt doesn't even stop at hostile creatures. Even neutral creatures that don't typically attack you, will sometimes out of the blue start a fight with you. I was attempting to tame a Gigantopithecus(aka Jack Links Jerky Sasquatch), and was at it for like an hour and a half when suddenly he just became aggressive at a roaming dinosaur that passed by. The aggression carried over and he attacked me, resulting in my own tamed creature killing him. What the ♥♥♥♥? Why? What even caused this? I didn't even initate anything to have him attack me, nor did I wish to deal with his silly knock back attacks that throw me half way across the map.\n\nSpeaking of combat, this game has the most ♥♥♥♥ poor netcode I have ever had to suffer through in a first person video game. The horror is on the level of DayZ, and I don't mean scare factor type horror. Like the zombies in DayZ, Raptors will teleport around you, at ridiculous speeds, making them the equivalent of a Dragonball Z villain. If no one has fought an Alpha Raptor yet, just fasten your seatbelt for essentially a dinosaur with the Kaioken ability. It even ♥♥♥♥ing glows red, I kid you not. Without having a tamed dinosaur to use gigantic AoE's on their attacks to counter the sillyness of the bad hit detection, coupled with some dinosaurs who will displace themselves to all sides of you during combat, I have a hard time imagining you winning any real fights here in a planned manner. Combat just ends up feeling hectic with no real finesse to it(READ: inconsistent). Look at this video. both showcasing the Kaioken Raptor and the combat. Does this scream fun and exciting? He was the local host with cheats enabled, now imagine that with actual lag/latency and getting mauled to death by it.\n\nStill pounding at the inconsistent nature of ARK here, but another factor is the temperature system. It's absolutely bogus beyond belief. I froze to death while inside a cabin with torches and a fire place while being clothed. How is this possible exactly? Other times my character will be freezing....on a tropical beach, mid-day with the Sun in the center of the sky, while wearing hide armor. Then I will proceed to suffer a ridiculous heat wave, dehydrating my character completely. Being cold conversely means you get hungry often as well, which is a very neat concept...if it was done right. It just ends up feeling comical. I stuffed my face with about 30 slabs of cooked meat overnight during a stay in the cold north due to this system. Essentially I had about 10 dinosaurs worth of meat in my stomach, yet I still found myself getting hungry again because it was <30 degrees outside. Uh, okay. The amount of meat I packed in my stomach would have clogged my colon about 50 times over, and instantly given me gout. I'd be more likely to die from constipation or clogged arteries than the starvation that happens because you're cold. If you're a lowbie or just somewhere without immediate access to meats, you're probably going to go berry hunting and stuff your face with every little thing you can see every 5 ♥♥♥♥ing seconds.\n\nThere's so much more frustrating and inconsistent things I could mention such as the horrendous building placement system, but honestly I am absolutely exhausted. I've tried giving this game a chance, I really did. I tried letting the frustration subside time and again when I died to some random ♥♥♥♥. However...the game mechanics end up being too incoherent and illogical to really feel overall enjoyment in your experience. The amount of satisfaction you'll feel from taming your first big dinosaur is completely negated and dashed by it dying to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat, or overnight when you're not online. The game is also horrendously optimized, and feels like one of those titles you have to drop $2,000+ USD on a rig to comfortably play. And even those monster rigs will likely suffer FPS dips.\n\nCome back when this game is released. Too many issues currently.","December 22, 2015","false","55.0"," 186 of 300 people (62%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","62","186","300","39","11"

This game has a wonderful concept; survive on an island teeming with dinosaurs for you to hunt, tame and ride. And for the most part it realizes that concept well. The graphics and sounds are quite pretty (if somewhat demanding) and it's a fun experience for about half the time.\n\nThe other half the time is when the game falls apart. That video at the top that shows a T-Rex rampage through a gate chasing someone down? Never gonna happen. What IS going to happen is that you and your tribe will spend weeks building a strong base, setting up plant turrets and taming dinos, and when you log out for the night to get some sleep some ♥♥♥♥wit will punch a hole in your walls, kite your dinos to someone else's base so they get killed by that person's turrets, and steal all your hard-earned resources. And more than likely throw them away since this is the kind of asshat who keeps a shack in the woods and only plays to ruin the game for other people. And the game has no way to police these jokers, since (unlike most other players) they dont care about advancing, so they dont have big bases and tamed dinos, and even if you manage to find every thatch hut they have and destroy everything, they'll just laugh it off and start over again since, again, they are only here to ♥♥♥♥ with other players.\n\nThe single player is surprisingly dull; the lack of ai controlled humans to interact with makes the game feel empty even with all the dinos around, building anything beyond wood is pointless as any dinos who could actually destroy a wooden structure wont bother unless you ♥♥♥♥ them off, and without an actual end goal the game gets dull and repetitive quickly.\n\nPVE servers arent much better, with people dropping foundations and pillars anywhere they want to stop people from building, making land impossible to come by and essentially forcing you to join one of the big alpha-tribes just so you can actually play the game. It gets even worse when you try to run a cave, since on PVE people can wall off entire sections of the map and feel confident that no one can stop them from monopolizing resources. Its a disturbing showcase of how even the most whimsical fantasy game stops being fun when it gets too close the real world.\n\nTLDR: Singleplayer is dull, PVE is impossible if you dont wanna be part of a super-tribe, and PVP on an official server just is not fun since every third time you log on you'll be starting from scratch with all stone tools. If there was someone around who could invoke a ban on players whose only objective is to ruin the game for everyone else, it might be worth while. But the devs either dont care or are incapable of setting that up. Don't waste your money on this game, or if you do wait until it goes on sale and play a private server.","March 15","false","202.8"," 353 of 584 people (60%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","60","353","584","49","27"

Playing this actually feels like this is a survival mmorpg. Unlike other survival games where once your base gets destroyed you lose all progress and has to start all over again. (Rage quit)\n\n\nPros\n- Amazing levelling system so even if you die you don't really lose your progress and can still move on.\n- Hard working developers that do updates regularly\n- Devs can add dinos/ big changes without any wipes to ♥♥♥♥ any players\n- Most players are friendly\n- supports single player / pve-friendly server\n- force feed people to keep them unconscious in a never ending prison\n- be a cannibal that attack peope on sight then eat their flesh\n- massive world and unique taming system\n- almost everything is server sided and is almost hackers free\n\nCons\n-Badly optimized but will be fixed soon hopefully\n-Server may crash sometimes which might result you losing all your gear/ progress if you were outside when it happened\n\nthat moment when several T-rex spawns just outside my base spawn killing me all over again were hilarious. would definitely die again.\n\nP.S I would not recommend to go PVP if your going solo because chances are you will probably end up losing everything while your offline.

I mean come on, you have to be patient and give the game a chance atleast a week after release to see the responce time of the devs.\n\nWith that being said, i think this is a fantastic game for early access and ofcorse there are bugs. the biggest thing is the optimization, there is none. but that is a top priority with the devs and they are working on it now. This game is done right with tons of things to do right off the bat. You have to level up to learn blueprints to be able to make things. and it does take a while. its not given to you right away. but when you do level up and unlock new blueprints it gives you satisfaction that you did it.\n\nAfter playing for almost 4 hours straight i can say that this game is amazing with big things to come in the future.\n\nP.S. watch out for dilos or better known as ♥♥♥♥♥♥. they are ♥♥♥♥♥es at low levels. but when you can finaly kill one and tame it and name it tinkerbell and order tinkerbell to attack a mortal enemy they are alright.\n\nEDIT: The overall review of this game has changed to mostly positive, so the first paragraph of my review is irrelevant now","June 3, 2015","true","146.1"," 67 of 99 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","67","99","11","3"

Individuals who have played this game for 500+ hours make the game unplayable as they roam the official servers raiding and destroying player's bases that took hours and even days to build in a matter of less than an hour. If you are a low level on one of these official servers you have almost no chance to rise to the top or even slightly advanced due to your dinos that took 10 hours to tame dying in 30 seconds to a level 120 argentavis or all your resources being taken by high levels with guns while all you have is pikes (being in a tribe wont help as they can 1vsInfinity with those birds). No matter what official server you join it will happen because the high levels believe they own the server and do these things just for sport.\n\nNow you might ask, why not just join a private server or create your own private server to play with your friends without constant harrassment by the people willing or with the time to put hundreds of more hours into this game than you? First of all, unless your computer has a lot of RAM you are not hosting your own server and even then one person might have to have two computers with one of them being able to host the server and the other being able to run the game (both take a lot of RAM and CPU so for many people this isn't practical). You could also join another private server hosted by a third party but there is no gaurantee that it will actually be any better than the official servers and they are less reliable than either a public or private server your friends are hosting. Regardless, resorting to a privite server should not be necessary to enjoy a PvP experiance on ARK as the official servers should provide that.\n\nNow, throughout this review you might be wondering why I haven't mentioned PvE as an option, as in PvE players can't kill eachother. That's because PvE itself has another set of issues relating to trolls who build in places inconvienent to you with the knowledge that there is little you can do to stop them. Higher levels might even troll by building around your small thatch base as you are just starting out. Also, sometimes you want to just enjoy a legimate PvP experiance with other players where the fights seem fair and losing them is a result of your tribes inability to properly strategize or engage rather than fights that were doomed at the start due to a huge level discrepancy between the players in each tribe.\n\nOverall, I think ARK: Survival Evolved has good mechanics and great features that give it a lot of potential, but until more balancing is done with regards to players I can not recommend this game to someone who just wants to have some fun in a short amount of time. Accomplishing anything in this game takes way too much time in proportion to how quickly everything can be killed and destroyed that it just isn't worth playing this game if you can't play it for more than 8 hours a day. I hope by full release next year the game is more balanced, but until then I am not recommending this game as a practical game to play.","August 7, 2015","false","39.0"," 111 of 174 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","111","174","4","4"

So much content and more being put in every week its been game that long been coming. Its an Alpha so bugs are expected and the devs stay on top of them as they are found and very quickly too. they care enough to make new content doesnt crash the game before releasing it unlke most devs out there, much respect for that. Even when u reach the highest level there is just so much to do you never get bored there is more to do. i and those in my group say thank you and keep up the awesome work you have been doing. Plus never give into the wining cries if those saying make it easier thats not why we play Ark we play because of the challenge. Again great job!

We have run 2 different servers we are so into and dedicated to ark and the devs that we have our own equipment and system running our servers and we all put our money together every month to keep it going. We play the way ark it is ment to be played with the pvp elements and stable rules to keep it fun and thrilling! our goul is to have 200+ players online in ark at once in the end just having fun and getting the full ark experience. We as a group are working hard together to make it possible with 10 to 12 tribes of 15 to 20 members each. We even have a ts setup ready for each tribe. Our commitment has no bound to the ark and the Devs. As you can tell, lol! I tell you this so you get the full scope of what this game has and is still becoming worth you time and money!

It has enough content to be fufilling. However, in it's current state, it is unbalanced and funamentally flawed. It's a time sink, and it's not in a good way.\n\nCaves are an interesting feature in the game. You can set up a base, and be nearly indestructible. It's a very strong strategic position, but it makes for a very unfair game. Trexs can hit through walls, killing players and destroying chests and  items that took you hours to make, in seconds. Spiked walls meant to defense against this are worthless. Trexs and large carnivores do AOE damage which hits things through walls. Guns do minimal damage to players, meaning unless you're on a trex, you can't really fight back. You can still push players through walls. You can remove glare using the debug screen. You can remove foliage. All of which provide an advantage for those willing to cheat.\n\nSo far, I haven't had any real pvp experience on a pvp server. What it boils down to is base raids. Players attack eachothers bases when they're offline. I had a tribe of 10 players, all playing for about 200 hours. 2000 hours of total gameplay was destroyed in less than 30 minutes.\n\nI'm really a fair guy. I want to recommend this game, but it's honestly best to just wait until it's balanced. The game will be complete and you'll have a fun, fresh, exploit free experience.\n\nPVE servers are a suitable alternative, but that removes a large chunk of the fun.\n\nThe game is early access, obviously, but I can't justify spending four hours to tame an animal that is going to die overnight. I've avoided that for the most part, and focused on base building. Bases are just as easily lost.","July 9, 2015","false","178.0"," 68 of 101 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","68","101","2","1"

It was well made, visually it looks great, there is a great atmosphere when you are exploring a section of the island you are not aware of, and then some new dinosaur you haven't seen before runs out and devours your face. Its great fun, but here is the downside. (this game is also a must to play with friends, you cannot solo this game. Some things require friends)\n\n- Incredible balancing issues, most servers you will find have "Alpha" tribes. They are large and powerful, and usually dictate rules to the rest of the players on the server. Which if you violate they will destroy all your things that have taken months to stock up.\n\n- In the six months I had played we had a few scuffles with some other players. Although, battles that are shown in the video's in the game do NOT happen. You aren't going to get attacked by some group with stego's and parasaurs, you will be attacked by T-Rex and other massive and hard to kill things. You will also not see yourself get attacked, as most players wait till the other tribe is offline or most of its members are asleep. As their servers are not seperated by time zone, many servers have large alpha tribes of chinese players who play when you sleep.\n\n- There is no defence for when you are gone, you have plant species X (a plant Turret) An automatic gun (which you have to grind bullets for and they are easy to trick and get them to waste their ammo)  Your dino's AI is not very good, there is no leash system to bind them to one place. Meaning that someone can blow a hole in your fence, tag your dino's and run them into the ocean. And boom, 80 hours of real life time... spent taming those. Gone in 15 minutes.\n\n- PVP is more of a.... political battle as no one wants to have their hours and hours of investments killed. So you are very protective of your dino's.\n\n- The island has limited locations for certain resources, like obsidian. Its available in a handful of locations. Which are easy to block off, if you get an alpha tribe lock it up. Forget about ever advancing past a crossbow.\n\n- Time consumption, if it takes 6 hours to tame a battle mount and two hours to farm enough material for a gun. You aren't going to be having a lot of PVP, if you want to raid - you better wait till their offline or you run a big risk of losing your time investment.... Everything takes too much time if you were to focus on fighting anything but wild dino's.\n\n- Hacking. Lots.... of hacking. I've come to understand that they've implemented some new programs which prevent a lot  of what was going on, so this point is less valid now.","April 17","false","551.0"," 68 of 101 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","68","101","5","1"

(I change the review as the game hopefully progresses)\n\nHaving played game for many hours now i experienced more low than highs, as it is the first thing that should be pointed out. While i don't have a high end pc, it is more than powerful enough to handle many of the latest games on 720p-1080p with a decent amount of 20 at it lowest and more than 60 fps and nearly the highest settings.\n\nMy first experience i had on ARK however, after lagging (horribly) on preset settings and without launch option, i had to tweak a lot, the game and my PC's setting to average of 8-12 fps in the game.. and while the ONLY option to actually affect the fps more than 0.10 being the scale resolution i can turn most of the setting to high or epic without losing 1 fps at all.\n\nWhich brings me to PvP, while you can be wiped out horribly before you even started, should you however managed to survive and thrive, everything can be lost over night. Since the game relays on faced paced combat and quick reactions.. if you one of the people with lower fps like me.. there is virtually no chance to survive at all.\n\nGoing from the fps to another issue, random freezing of the game (in the most impossible situations) as those freezes & lags were the cause for at least 90% of my deaths (leaving out the sucides i have to commit in order to be able to log in the next time i get on). Entering a cave is basically impossible, as the fps drops to a maximum of 4 inside of them, and you're dead before you know you were not alone in there.\n\nAnd as mentioned.. suicide, just for the sake of being able to log in the next time.. everything started fine and normal, until one sudden day it kept timing out while i tried to log in.. it was still in a early stage, and it almost drove me to rage quit before asking a friend to kill me, as it was the last resort before demanding a refund.. While that might work, it is still a very frustrating thing to do.. over and over..\n\n\nBUT, that doesn't meant there isn't anything good to say about the game, we see updates with fixes and new content almost every day, and the player community that i've met so far is the best in any Online game i have played so far.\n\nHowever, with that said, the cons outweigh the pros by far.. unless you got at least a Nvidia GTX 750.. or better, in which case most of the stated performance issues will not apply.. but for people not packing a high end graphic card, the games performance will be our worst enemy, and not the Islands predators.\n\n(EDIT #1)\n\nAt this point i cannot Recommend this game for people who just want to casually play, or for people with a low Performence PC. At this early stage of the early access most people with have to put up with alot of stressful and frustrating moments (i know i have) And a lack of content can get boring very quickly.\n\nAnd as i believe the best experience will be once the game sees it's official release.\n\nJust as a Final note, i really want to thank the developers for their dedication and hard work brining a lot of updates (both fixes and further content). But as a player with a not optimal PC setup i also hope for future updates focusing more on optimization and performance, as it is a much needed, as it is a much needed "fix" for many players to keep enjoying the game and help it grow in this early acces stage.","August 7, 2015","false","839.4"," 257 of 423 people (61%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","61","257","423","13","16"

After that you get to spawn into the world, which is always somewhere near the coast of The Island.\nNext you will have to survive by crafting tools, weapons and clothes and eventually start building a shelter/home.\nThe game might seem to have a steap learningcurve, but it is actually not that difficult to figure out how to make the items needed to survive and sustain a fairly good base.","April 3","true","472.9"," 52 of 74 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","52","74","5","0"

Now, as you can see, I have far more. All my experiences come from the 'official' servers. Things are much different in private servers.\n\nI would still say to avoid this at full price. The game is a blast if you enjoy building and taming creatures but is riddled with bugs and glitches. This is also a game that you can't just 'go it alone' if you want to get to the very advanced stuff and still have a life.\nPros:\n-Lots of building and crafting\n-Taming of dinosaurs because I mean really? Who doesn't love dinos.\n-Enough content to keep you busy for several weeks/months\n-Fairly challenging survival, especially at the start. Even now I still die occasionally if I'm not careful.\n-Options of both PvP and PvE servers\n\nMiddle ground:\n-Without help or 'tribemembers' it takes far too long to farm out resources and forget about high level dino tames. Some people can work around this like I have, others might find it a deal breaker.\n-Options of both PvP and PvE servers. This one is tricky, most of the PvP servers have been taken over by 'alpha' tribes that wipe out lesser tribes when they start to get to a respectable size but there are still a few that are ok. However, the PvE servers are so flooded with players and structures that can't be destroyed that you can't get the full feel of things due to dead spawn points and/or missing resources.\n\nCons:\n-Still lots of bugs, the 'reel back' I mention below is still very much in effect.\n-Poor server performance, fps is still low and structures of any respectable size take far too long to load in.\n-No true 'end game' to speak of (yet). They do have boss arenas and such in the patch notes for later\n-The new dino AI is funky and very annoying, making it nearly impossible to tame a high level dino without glitching it into something.\n-Spawns can be difficult on highly populated servers, both for resources and dinos. If a structure is built even remotely close to a spawn point, that spawn point effectively becomes 'dead' with no increase in other spawn points.\n-Spawn points are all set to a standard. For example if a rich spawn is in one place, it will continue to be a rich spawn regardless of how many times the timer pops. There's no chance of a minor or lesser resource spawning.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\nFascinating and probably one of the better open world sandbox style of games. Also the level of detail that is apparent in the skill trees is impressive.\n\nHowever......... The game is not optimized in the least bit. My system easily bests the minimum requirements (and I mean to the point where it's silly to even question) yet my game lags and stutters with a top fps range of about 20 all while having the sound and sky effects off. The real annoyance is what I call a 'reel back' , the game will stop allowing actions for 1-2 min and then basically rewind you to wherever you were at before the glitch started. It's not like I ran into a wall and the game is fixing me since the entire game rewinds: dinos, sky effects, time of day etc etc to where it was only a couple minutes ago.\n\nI plan on continuing my play since I spent so much on the game already but for everyone on the fence it might be better to wait a bit, it is still in the testing phase after all and they're charging almost full game price for it. If things get better I'll stop back by to update this.","October 29, 2015","false","331.7"," 68 of 102 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","68","102","5","6"

Your left arm contains a strange rhombic implant. You are surrounded by a few harmless dinos. It will be short and you will feel hunger and thirst and at night even some freezing. Beat some trees with your barehands and collect some stones at the beach. Every step you take gives you XP and you will levelup quickly. Learn the engrams for simple tools and start build up some primitive hut out of thatch. That's how every story begins.\nGraphics\nAmazing graphics. Ofc everything depends on your rig. But if you use the ShaderModel5 under DirectX11 textures should look like corny sand and living jungle. But In the last time there are unexplainable framedrops and freezes compared to the very beginning of my play. The game (further-) development seems to be running. But the graphics edges makes it still unconvenient to play smoothly. Also it still runs in a weird fullscreen/scaled window mode which bringup several times the windows mousepointer. Real fullscreen use is not possible because the game crashes then. The most visions of your character seem very blurry. Ofc there are sharp textures on dino skins and even lens flares into the sun. But during the daytime change it's hard to compose one full sharpen screenshot.\nGameplay\nIt's fun to play for the struggle of life. Hunger and lack of resources forces you into a very active gaming. Always be aware of attacking carnivores. The Dino AI is maybe the best they can do. But sometimes it's ridiculous how dinos get stuck in the landscape or chasing you til death. The taming of dinos, crafting, and building of houses can be your new best time-wasting hobby. Ofc in the endgame it turns into grinding for some very rare resources and insane requirements to craft a high tier weapon or ammo.\nStableness\nUnfortunately the stableness has changed from somekind of ok to weak. Idk the reason for this but if you follow the development you'll notice many content addings (new dinos, bosses, landscapes, caves, maps) but a hesistating way to announce stableness improvements. Just read some shadow rendering up to 30%. But if I ran shadows on low and the game crashed more often than earlier that improvement is ineffective.\nAchievements\nThis is the poorest part of the game. They are adding slowly achievements which could also make fun to complete the game. Usually most players reached them already in Early Access without unlocking them. But there's no QA on achievement development. Instead of giving an achievement for each dino tamed they use some strange sumup of all initial dinos tamed or killed. The Artifacts gathering achievement was never working and got messedup with adding new caves but also revoking some other artifacts. Short: for achievement hunters it's a nightmare.\nModbase\nThe modbase is amazingly high grown. I would say like in Skyrim. From advanced medieval architecture to Boss taming and Ressource stacking seems each one very useful if you are through with the vanilla game.\nCommon Complaints\nIntroducing Battleeye was a ragequit for many gamers. Didn't know BE before and I wonder why it is so neccessary for the main game if the free PvP mod "Survival of the Fittest" does it need even more. Other complaints are more funny like Why does my Direwolf not lay eggs? or Why did my for 100 hours buildup base get cruely raided on a PvP Server?\nConclusion\nARK is a fun game with very nice graphics. It is still an unique project with lots of potential. But devs have to work hard to give back stabilitiy and deny more disappointments. IMO it's insufficient to just add more content ...\nI recommend playing ARK because not recommending it would be an overreact.","May 5","true","234.6"," 68 of 102 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","68","102","12","0"

The black particles bug being the most prominent, which can cause the game to be almost unplayable at times. This and a LOT of other bugs have been pointed out repeatedly but not been so much as acknowledged until recently when we were told the as-of yet unreleased XBone version took priority.\n\nTo break it down to its simplest form, what is most important to the devs is the money they don't have yet. Once you have paid your concerns are no longer important because they have your money. Currently there is a 5000 post strong thread telling the devs how broken one of their new dino implementations is. The devs have only just now after a month of the thread's existence acknowledged that they did in fact screw up. Lack of communication, trying to direct users to other forums so they can better police dissenters, constant regression of once solved bugs, and general arrogance when it comes to the mistakes they make, makes this games development an unpleseant experience.\n\nIf poor performance, Korean MMO grind, and being treated like a second class citizen once you have handed your money over are your kinda thing, go for this game, otherwise stay far away until at least the game's full release. Even then, make sure all the grind and early access quirks have actually been fixed and not just swept under the rug. There are far better Early Access games out there for you in the meantime.","December 23, 2015","false","339.4"," 69 of 104 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","69","104","4","0"

Not right now at least. It’s a treadmill to nowhere. If you have a job, you can’t play this game. You don’t have the hours in the week. It’s a shame because the idea of open world PVP Turok-reminiscent FPS is really cool.\n\n\nArk right now has some technical optimization problems, but that’s to be expected. It’s in alpha and anybody who expects this game to run well or be optimized, at this stage, is somewhat naïve.\n\nOk, let’s start with the top: The grind. It’s huge. It’s long. It’s cumbersome. It doesn’t take so long to gather various resources, but some combinations make absolutely no sense and are far out of proportion to what you’re making, that it becomes a clear slowing mechanic rather than a compliment to the game. At what point would anybody need to harvest the 40 animal hides to make a single bed? Why the hell do I need 15 hide to make a mortal and pestle? Have the Devs seen a mortal and pestle? Animal hide doesn’t come into this equation.\n\nAnd a lot of this game is longwinded and drawn out to no purpose. Taming dinosaurs – depending on what you aspire to, this can be a relatively painless process, but really anything more than a Dodo or one of the minor-raptor things, is going to take a very long time. Doesn’t sound so bad – you’ve got to work at good things, right? Correct. But your dinosaurs won’t be there the next time you log in. They’ll be dead. At some point, you will have to sleep. When you do, someone will night-raid your bunker, and kill your dinosaurs.  That’s 15 minutes to several hours that have just been wasted. And you will be doing this over and over and over gain.\n\nSame thing with bases. You can spend hours gathering all the resources to build a base, put down a bed, put down a storage container. Log off. Go to work, go to the pub, come back, generally live your life. Log on. You’re dead. Your base has been raided and destroyed. Your dinosaurs are dead. Your storage chest is gone, all your resources are gone. Time to rebuild. Rinse, repeat ad infinitum.\n\nWhile going back and gathering all the resources you will be hot-footing it to the nearest water sources repeatedly because hunger and thirst are a nightmare. Some people have defended this as a great mechanic. It’s not. Not in its current state. You have to eat several hundred berries, or the equivalent of a mammoth, every day, to survive. You can kill so many animals, cook so many steaks, and you will go through them like wildfire. Mashing the E key is not a game mechanic. It’s tedious.  Slow it down and it will become interesting. At the moment, you’re just constantly watching your hunger/thirst drain at ridiculous speed. If that means they have to tweak the gathering values: yes. Do it. People ask what I’d do if I weren’t harvesting berries. I don’t know, play the game? Kill a dinosaur? Kill a player? Build a base? Go get one of the beacons? You know, something interesting.\n\nThe gameplay, collectively, creates a strange emergent nihilist’s paradise. Ark is Sisyphean. Everything you build, everything you gain, everything will be destroyed.\n\nAnd you will push the boulder back up the hill and it will roll back down again. And again. And again. The result is that nothing you do here will matter. Any and all effort you make is wasted. The final result of that is that you end up with a game that is a trolls paradise. See a base? Build a spike wall in front of the door. Is that a narrow pass? Build walls across it.  Did those guys just enter a cave? Quick, board up the cave mouth. You stop trying to play the game to get anywhere and you start playing to game to inconvenience everyone else in a futile attempt to get back at every unseen person who has done the same thing to you while you slept.","August 29, 2015","false","24.8"," 167 of 273 people (61%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","61","167","273","27","15"

I own a better graphics card than some people on here who are complaining about 35 fps whilst I'm getting 25. I'm still throughly enjoying the game. You need to remember that the game has only just came out as Early Access. Day Z has been in early access for like 3 years or something and still isn't optimized properly. This game is being optimized right now so that everyone can play it with decent fps. Also, this game only holds about 2000 players currently which is a major bummer although I managed to get into a server relatively easily, this is another reason why people are leaving bad reviews. You didn't need to buy the game when it only just entered early access, they are obviously adding more servers but needed to release the game on the date they had set.\n\n","June 2, 2015","true","38.0"," 103 of 163 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","103","163","7","0"

Such a shame, One day, hopefully soon, they will get rid of it and use something that actually works. Also the lack of the game having a cancel button for joining a server with mods is annoying.\n\nAlso, you cannot search for non modded servers, and as there is 1/2 the time no indication of it being modded, finding a good unnofficial server can take loads of time.","February 9","false","175.1"," 139 of 225 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","139","225","12","7"

The environment is amazing, the creatures are amazing. It is a ton of fun both from the PVE side of things to the PVP side of things. For an EA title it is one of the best that I have played. In my opinion it is better and more playable than some AAA fully released titles that I have played. I have too many hours in as it stands now and cannot stop playing for long, still.\n\nThe bad.......\n\nYou need a powerful computer to have an enjoyable experience with this game. Do not get it thinking that your midgrade from 4 years ago PC that plays some AAA titles that were developed for consoles very well will play this very well. It will not, Ark will most likely bring your potato to it's knees. The minimum specs for this game will lead you to a bad experience.\n\nThe public servers for this game are pretty lame. PVE servers are for the most part rife with structure spam and griefing. The PVP servers are for the most part dominated by a few alpha tribes. Not to say that either will not be enjoyable, they will for a bit, maybe even longer depending on the tribe you align with. They need more active moderation, which is coming according to the developer.\n\nThe developers for the game are great, releases and new content have come at a break neck pace. With that being said sometimes it seems the important things are not being addressed in a timely fashion. The developers have also not hit a single target release date/time that they have set. Not a huge deal but don't hang your hat on any specific time they set :)\n\nI am recommending the game, but also very serious about the performance issues if you do not have a well maintained powerful system.","December 22, 2015","true","261.5"," 57 of 84 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","57","84","4","4"

I head inland close to a mountain and build there in the forest. Spot is well hidden.\nday4: I managed to tame a sabercat and I traded a saddle for it with my neighbour.

Was fun looting the supply drops but then a player with an eagle came and killed me. I upgraded half of my base with stone, since it wasnt still destroyed because it was hidden. I played long that night.

In pve you either build big, which is boring and takes a long time. Or you hunt stuff and die to bugs. The game lags like hell with my gtx760 and medium/low settings. And there is a lot of desync.

If you have the power to run it. At this current time, and because of Early Access, this game is not optimized. If you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer, you're going to have a bad time, mmkay? If you have an integrated graphics card, don't bother, and may god have mercy on your soul. However, I was able to play this game with low settings on a Nvidia GeForce 650 Ti -- and then it became a whole new game when I got my Nvidia GeForce 980 Ti that I almost cried.\nFun. Well, fun for peopel who aren't lazy. If the first thing you do is download a game called "Survival Evolved". and then login to a server... and then start asking for things, you are not meant for survival. This game doesn't have a tutorial (thank god), and you have to be willing to go for the learning curve. I enjoyed learning to play, and where I am now. There's a lot of different ways to play the game ... be creative, expect death when you first start, punch everything, live on the edge.\nAddicting.\nGood content.\nFrequently updated.\nDecent community, depending on server.\nCons\nCommunication between player base and dev team is poor.  I think the community managers do their best, but if a server is going to restart and you sometimes get no notice, and that causes you to be logged out -- and then you're in the air, you're dead. Additionally, if huge events like a New Years event promise to give you an item -- and then don't because it bugged out on your server, and then there is no annoucement or apology even to this day, wat? Basically, the communication is poor and generally it doesn't matter that the game is Early Access. A game coming out of Early Access doesn't suddenely make people more communicative, if anything, it's an indication of how they will be throughout their existence and right now I find it a bit scary.\nReleases -- and then subsequent game breaking bugs not always being fixed. This probably circles back to communication issues. Any sort of acknowledgement or announcement. I mean, I hate to draw parallels, but WoW at least has a notice board on the loading screen that says, "Hey, we are sorta aware there is an issue-- brb."\nAs of right now, a collection bug that randomly makes it so you can't.. collect things, well, basically, it's been happening for months and months and makes the game at points completely unplayable because you can't collect and build for hours. You'd think this would be higher priority, but again, this probably circles back to communication in a way.\nUsing "early-access" as an excuse for pretty much everything. I mean, really, we get it, early access, risk, but basically you're funding the game through providing it as early-access and you are getting people bug testing for free, etc. There's a lot of gain and back and forth here, so, one again, this probably circles back to communication alleviating a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but that excuse doesn't keep players. I expect things not to be balanced, I expect bugs, but I don't expect ♥♥♥♥ to happen because the Devs can't communicate.\nOverall, fun to play.","January 17","true","260.5"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","34","46","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asoldier/recommended/346110/","asoldier","asoldier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asoldier/","75 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBy far one of the greatest disappointments in gaming.\n\nThis game was preceded by a lot of hype. FPS RPG and Survival all rolled into one? It's true ARK is accurately described as any of these. What it is not is a well-rounded game. You can play a "local" game or single-player, which somewhat defeats the purpose of much of the game's infrastructure. The game was intended to be played as more of a MMO, where 10 or more (servers can have well over a hundred players) can either team up, build on their own, or go PVP and war on each-other.\n\nIt takes a good deal of time just to level up to use engrams worth a damn. Engrams, the "perks" of ARK allow you to build  equipment and refined supplies needed to propel your quest to awaken the brood mother. Unfortunately you will not survive long enough to make use of them. In fact you will die dozens of times just trying to find a suitable place to build a base. Many attempt to build right on the beach, and while this seems like a hospitable place, remember that everyone else spawns on the beach too. If you're playing multiplayer, you're likely to ♥♥♥♥ a few people off. Even if you're on a PVE (player vs. environment) server you will likely encounter resistence in the form of random foundations. Foundations from members not in your tribe cannot be built close to one-another. So if I find your base, all I need to do to keep you from expanding is build a half dozen foundations at the edge of your territory... bam you're screwed. You can try to build up, but remember all a dino or player need do is destroy your foundation and the walls come crashing down.\n\nOn PVP games it's especially difficult to get started. On servers like Skyark.net where the people appear to be friendly at first, you will likely wake up dead with all of your stuff stolen. That's typically how it works. The community there builds a rapport with you, then come and kill you in your sleep. Unlike some other servers you won't find random foundations covering every decent building site, but you will find a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I promise you.\n\nThe vast majority of ARK servers are plagued with skipping / lag issues. Every server encounters a small lag spike every 5 minutes as the server generates a gamesave. This is likely due to some sort of expected memory leak / crash.  Obviously the devs have a few issues to work out.\n\nOn the upside there is a LOT of in-game content, but no story to speak of. In-fact I haven't seen a single line of dialogue in ARK since I started playing, with just under 120 hours in the game. That's a bit frustrating considering many of us buy games for the story. Here we have this giant biome with dinosaurs and information-age tech, oh and dragons, and alien spider-like creatures.... and giant obelisks that do what exactly? Yeah so there's a lot to be desired from the game's story and direction. The game is very playable, but you're going to spend many days more than other games just trying to level and get established.\n\nThe real con of this game is, if you didn't start out early on the server, you're going to get steamrolled by some of the senior players. Even if you have the strongest base possible (a metal base) you will get raided. Explosives aren't too expensive for someone wanting to troll you. The best bet is to build a base out of sight out of mind. Don't use the chat, don't ask for help, don't give up the location of your base, and don't make friends. They are not your friends. They will wait until you're asleep and take all of your ♥♥♥♥. Period.\n\nIf you think I'm bitter or salty, fine... but after you've spent days building a base and find it ripped apart and half or all of your dinosaurs gone/killed.... you will realize I'm right.\n\nThis game was not worth the money IMHO. Uninstalled.\n\n- Bix","October 7, 2015","false","603.2"," 57 of 87 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","57","87","3","8"

My freinds and I built up in a server, but when we logged off, the entire damn server was full. I refreshed for an hour trying to find a slot, and when I finally found one and logged in, I walked out of my base and was promptly kicked off by "fatal game error". Don't buy the alpha until they figure out how to fix this server crap.\n\nUpdated: I kept playing this game to get some value out of it, but the devs in their wisdom decided that if you get stuck in a design glitch, you should be forced to wait 45 minutes to die before you can play again. Not 45 minutes logged out of the game, 45 minutes logged in. There was once a suicide command, but they took it out. When asked why, they replied with a video of 127 hours. This would have been a funny joke, except for the part where their desire to maintain reality essentially just translates into laziness. They haven't gotten around to fixing glitches yet, but they want to claim reality. In reality, I would have crawled up like god damn emperor Kuzco and Pacha. In their version of reality, I can jump up and down and slide down the inexplicably slippery rocks, but I apparently can't climb up the obvious hand holds. I also can't punch the rocks around me until I die, because apparently, while most rocks are real, these are magical ghost rocks that I can't punch, but can still hold me in a crevice. Did I also mention I've fallen into these inescapable ghost rock crevices on 4 separate occasions? No, well yea, apparently the map loves those. If you're going to do an alpha, make reasonable ways to get out of glitches.\n\nFurther edit:So my freinds kept playing this game, and I was dragged along with them. After a month, I say this game is broken. First off, the game developers seem to have this philosophy that everything should take a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time. It takes about 9 ♥♥♥♥ing hours to tame a t-rex. Now, that's ♥♥♥♥ enough already, but then they decide to give you basically no way to defend it, so all the time you put into it goes to waste. Worsen that with the fact that the chinese always seem to have 10 billion resources in the game, and your life becomes unbearable. You make something, and the chinese blow it up for no good reason. I like PVP, but the ridiculous amount of resources the Chinese have because of how long they dedicate to the game just makes it impossible to be a casual player.

Keep in mind that this is early access and I do recommend this game. While I find this game enjoyable, they still have a lot of work to do, and when they fix some of the major issues, this game could be one of my favorite games.\n\nPerformance:\nThis game is extremely laggy for no other reason than it's poorly optimized, if it is at all. I have 8 gbs of ram and a decent internet connection and can run most games on high graphics. I have to play this game on low graphics in order for it not to be a chugging mess. This problem is exacerbated since the world has so much going on, with there being so many plants and rocks and destuctible stuff just lying around, it makes the lag even worse. Even with everything on the lowest settings, there are times when it will have a severe lag spike that lasts for several seconds.\n\nVisuals:\nSince a lot of people have to run the game on low, let's start with that. It's aweful. Everything looks as if it's made of putty and it looks like it was colored by kids using water colors. If you can run it on medium or better, you are in for a treat. The difference between low and medium is huge. The game looks beautiful on medium, the models look great and the colors are a lot crisper and more vibrant.\n\nDinosaurs:\nYou have the famous dinos as well as some cool, but more obscure dinosaurs and they plan on adding more in the future. I don't really have too many complaints in this area and can only wait to see what they add in the future.\n\nBugs:\nOne of the dinosaurs is a large bug that looks like ants with wings. I feel that they should be nerfed as they are currently really strong and can easily kill anyone who isn't prepared. They attack in groups of 3-6+, have a poison that gets rid of your stamina so you can't run away, do a lot of damage which quickly adds up with an entire swarm of them attacking you at the same time, and the worst part, at least for me, they often cause a lag spike that completely freezes the game for 5+ seconds. When you see them ahead of time, there isn't lag, but for some reason if they pop out of nowhere, the game would just completely freeze. I had this happen two times, both times it was only because I had some of my dinosaurs with me so they were able to kill them, but it was close and I barely had any health remaining when my game started working again.\n\nTaiming:\nThis game uses a very interesting method to taim dinos. You have to knock them out and then feed them either meat or berries/vegetation, as well as narcotics or narcoberries to keep them unconcious. It's odd, but I think it's a cool little system. The problem I do have with the taiming system is that even the weak, basic dinosaurs take a while to taim when they get to a high-ish level. If something is level 60 or over, it will likely take at least a half hour to taim it. A level 120 Bronto, currently the longest time to taim, takes about 3 hours with the best food possible, which is extremely expensive and time consuming to make, as well as having a short lifespan before spoiling, and with regular berries, it takes over 14 hours to taim it, assuming someone doesn't come along and kills it or it runs out of food and rapidly loses taiming progress.\n\nSound:\nThe game sounds pretty good and they have been adding to the sounds the dinos make. The crafting sound is annoying, it sounds like a metal hammer tapping on a metal table. Normally it's annoying, but tolerable, but with things like arrows which get made in less than a second, the nonstop barrage of sound is enough to drive anyone insane. There really should be a slider specifically for the crafting, since at the moment it's in with the sound effects, which includes all of the dinos and other things I do enjoy.\n\nBuilding:\nI have a love-hate relationship with the building system. It isn't all that restrictive, while at the same time being realistic. You can build large structures, you can build on special platforms on some of the larger dinosaurs, and you have to add supports to your structure, you can't just have a massive building floating in the sky and supported by one foundation on the side. That being said, it uses a snap system that is atrocious. You can't rotate objects with a key or anything like that, you have to finagle your mouse in just such a way that the game finally gives you the orientation and placement you want. Fences are especially bad since they have to be connected to work and can rotate 300 degrees when you're trying to place them, and for the most part it will jump from one extreme to the other with it being very difficult to get it to go straight or make a 90 degree angle. Slopes, sloped roofs, etc. are a huge pain since they're almost always ridiculously oriented and will only go the way you want if you move it into a very tiny window. You better have surgeon-like precision or extreme patience if you plan on building anything.\n\nThat's everything I can think of for the moment, might add more later. With all of its faults, I do enjoy it and suggest that even if you don't want to buy it now, check it out when it is fully released. As long as they don't do a massive overhaul and completely change the entire thing, I can see this as something that will continue to be fun and only get better over time.\n\nDino AI:\nThe dinosaur AI is extremely annoying when it comes to following you. They will get stuck on every tree, rock, and dinosaur in their path. They won't try and go around it even if that means moving three feet to the left; they will just continue to walk into it until you walk behind them so they get unstuck. You have to be extremely careful or you will lose your dinosaurs. Your dinosaurs also won't be able to walk through a door 90% of the time. I have had the dinosaurs walk up to the door and then decide to just walk right and get stuck on the wall. These weren't big dinos trying to walk through a small door, these are dilos who can easily fit and sometimes do, but getting them out tends to be just as big of a hassle. The flying dinosaurs are horrible when they are following you. They will circle you at head level and bump you, go in front of you, etc. This makes it annoying to walk with them following you, and even more annoying if you are trying to attack a different dinosaur, as they will get in front of your attacks. Smarter dinos would be nice and far less frustrating.\n\nTemperature:\nA great idea that was poorly implemented. You get hot or cold depending on your surroundings. If you're hot, you have to go into water or shade and stop moving to cool down. If you're cold, you can carry your torch, stand next to a fire, go indoors, or run to get warm. The problem is that there seems to be about a 5 degree celcius range in which you aren't overheating or freezing. These statuses will affect how fast your stamina and food/water drains, at least as far as I can tell. Most areas of the island are either too hot or too cold, and it's annoying trying to remain in the small range that's fine. Armour adds hypo and hyperthermia resistances, with most armour making you more likely to overheat and offering protection from the cold.It's a pretty small island and yet the temperature ranges from 40+ degrees to 0 degrees and below just by going from the south side of the island to the north side.","October 15, 2015","true","45.0"," 71 of 112 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","71","112","2","2"

I have spent a little over 100 hours and I can say most of it has been a pleasant experience. In my opinion when people market games as "Survival" I think it's misleading. If you want a survival experience you can load up single player and enjoy. When it comes to multiplayer it becomes more about reaching optimal strength and stamping out any opposition. Take DayZ and every other zombie survival game out there. The difference between ARK and these games is the time it takes to reach optimal strength. In dayz it can be done quickly, but ARK has a leveling system. Now ARK's system isn't inherently bad. I actually enjoy it more than the others. It has a level system and when you level up you get a certain number of points to put into this long list of fun crafting items. It takes time and this kind of system is good in a way that it gives people goals. Unlike DayZ my interactions with players my level was more than a bullet coming from the tree line. Most were friendly, helpful, and didn't try to kill me on sight. The problem begins when the players who have already reached optimal strength, and there isn't anything to do other than raid and kill, find your base. They will rain down upon you with a force that will make your head spin to which you have no chance of defending against. In Dayz a well placed pistol shot can save you from the man with the assault rifle. In ARK you can do little more than stand and watch as the man with a level 220 T-Rex demolishes you and your base taking all your items with him.\n\nAnother problem I have with this game is the taming. Now before I continue I understand that this game is Alpha and subject to change. I am also aware it's going to have bugs. With that being said I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I have to sit at my computer for 6 hours to get a decent Dino tame. Some of the best tames will require you to watch over it for 10+ hours. Now this wouldn't be to much of a problem if it wasn't for how easy it is to lose them. Not only do you have to worry about other players killing them while your logged out, but with the current amount of bugs its not even worth it. Call me unlucky but I had one Dino get stuck in a tree. I tried to cut it down and release it only to have it thrown into the air and out of sight receving a death message shortly after. Three hours wasted. Just today I tamed one of the flying creatures and was flying through the air only for it to get stuck in mid air and not move. After it ran out of stamina it ejected me from the seat causing me to fall to my death. After searching for it for almost an hour I was greeted with the death message across the top of my screen. Six hours wasted. I have also had multiple Dinos die in between 15 min server restarts. Now some people may enjoy this because they feel its hardcore, but for me i would rather put that time somewhere else.\n\nThis game also suffers from horrendous lag spikes which seems to only happen when your in a serious situation that can get you killed. Apart from that it has poor optimization. Now I don't have the best computer in the world, but I can play more recent games such as Fallout 4 and Battlefront on max settings. I can't even play this on High without suffering huge frame rate drops. I can't even start the game up on full with 8 gigs of RAM. When I launch it I have to put it on the low memory option. This is the first time I have ever had this problem when playing a game.\n\n\nIn conclusion the game can be a lot of fun. I have had plenty of laughs with my friends. If you enjoy this type of gameplay and can cope with these issues then by all means purchase it and have fun. Its not how hard it is to build up in this game that bothers me. Its the soul crushing feeling you get when you lose everything. Especially when its not even from a player. I'm sure a lot of these problems will be fixed when the game is finished, but as of right now I can't recommend it","November 20, 2015","false","237.0"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","40","58","0","1"

This game is WAY more polished than most games I have played in recent memories.  Especially in the survival realm.  Great promise with this game, and if you're like me whose enjoyed 7D2D, Rust, DayZ even with the bugs, this is another one to chalk to the list.  Enough people get into the Pros/Cons, but I would rather just say that you will enjoy it.\n\nThe sad fact that people STILL cannot understand meeting the demands of opening day and server hardware/OS spin up times baffels me.  Blizzard still struggles with new content release days, and you expect an early access game to flawlessly execute, when tens of thousands are looking to join in and play?\n\nEither way, great game! They do not deserve to be voted so low in the recommendation scale at this point, but I know that this game is capable of raising back to the 95% it once was.

Probably because I hate people.\n\nPositive:\n+ Rather big and beautiful open world with pretty top notch graphics\n+ Large variety of Dinosaurs\n+ Really, just Dinosaurs is a plus on it's own.\n+ Lots of crafting options (on paper)\n+ Ability to tame prehistoric animals to mount or even create your own horde of velociraptor Minions (though the latter proved to be rather ineffective. Should have gone for T-Rex army straight away maybe)\n+ Adding Dragons to a game has never been a bad decision.\n\nNegative:\n- This game's core mechanic is based on grinding. You will always find yourself to have a shortage of materials which will have you running from Point A to Point B multiple times. Said shortage of Materials will still not prevent you from probably always being on the verge of your weight limit in earlier levels without mounts.\n- Early levels are very, very tedious.\n- Vague spawning points, makes finding your friends in the world pretty tedious as well.\n- ANY Interaction with Dinosaurs (from fighting to taming) are VERY anticlimactic if not downright boring. They're basically just autoattacking mobs that barely pose any threat later on and taming is basically just beating them up, feeding them the right poison and waiting up to mutiple HOURS (even on so called "Highrate Servers"), hoping that the paralyzed Dinosaur is not attacked by another Dinosaur in the meantime. You can guess how inconvenient that is if said Dinosaur doesn't happen to be right in front of your camp.\nIf you expect something as indepth as Monsterhunter you will be disappointed.\n- No real "secrets" to explore. You've seen one location you've seen them all.\n- Despite beautiful lighting effects and overall above average graphics most things look very plastic. Not that it matters because:\n- Anything beneath a GTX 970 will not allow you to see said beautiful graphics anyways. (Note: speaking merely from personal experience and that of friends, appearantly some CAN enjoy better graphics with weaker GPU)\n- Animations are pretty janky and awkward, but I think that's kind of how these games usually are.\n- Obvious obligatory glitches/and bugs that come with the burden of early access and/or open world games.\n\nShort answer: Do you like Minecraft, or genrally games with no story or goals other than those you set yourself? Go ahead.\nIf you're like me and want to keep the interaction with other human beings to a minimum then you probably should stay away from this game.\nI want to stress out though that even though I did not enjoy this game, and even though I am no fan of Early Access, this is one of the better, if not one of the best, examples of it considering you do get pretty much a full game for a relatively reasonable price.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPOST REVIEW EDIT:\n\nSo I got a few issues people addressed in the comments, the minority of them were actually nice. Taking all the criticism I feel like changing my review up a little, one that is in perfect accordance to their views and I'm sure will satisfy everyone:\n\n"Why Arc is the best game ever and has absolutely no fault."\n\nThis is the perfect game. If you ever played any other game in your life you've wasted your time by not playing Arc. It's got everything, Dinosaurs, Dragons and Bugs.\nIf you do not like this type of game then your opinion is completely wrong, you haven't played long enough. 12 hours? Pfff, what are you, this is only half a day, or if you're someone who actually has to WORK to pay your rent SEVERAL HOURS IN A WEEK. But how would you know right? You don't like Ark so you're probably someone who lives in his mom's basement.\nHow can you possibly know if this game is good until you've invested 100+ hours of the little free time you have in a game you don't like?\n\nJokes aside the only point of concern I am willing to address is the single player part.\nI felt it was neccessary to point out that "if you don't like multiplayer you should probably avoid it" because of course you can play it alone, but for the game is primarily designed to play with other people, it's where most of the fun comes for most people.\nYou can play Chess alone, you can play Monopoly alone, you can even ENJOY playing alone, but it's likely most won't as much as if playing with other people.","February 8","false","12.4"," 442 of 764 people (58%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","58","442","764","117","57"

You arrive, you (mine)craft yourself some equipment and you survive everything the island throws at you. Taming a creature was grindy, the higher up the food chain the longer it took (A Spinosaur could take from 3 hours to 20 hours), new taming methods emerged speeding up the process.\n\nWere you to play on a PvP server you would also have to worry about other players attacking/griefing/robbing you.\n\nAll in all it was an interesting experience that, with frequent patches, began to refine and improve over time.\n\nThen came some heavy-handed changes, for me they were the infuriating "forced" passive tames (rather than optional) where you had to spend hours sneaking behind creatures and feeding them one item at a time, The increased cost of behemoth gates, the even more ridiculous taming times (A Quetzal can take over a day with regular meat)\n\nIt almost feels like old days of playing Super Smash Brothers, remember the kids screaming about not picking items up and always playing "Final Destination"? Now imagine that they became developers.\n\nNow, I am not calling the developers childish, but their heavy handed "You are going to play the game our way" and catering to the "get good"/"I want to feel scared"/"Deal with it"/"CHALLENGE ME!" crowd seems toxic.\n\nOn a personal note: Bring back the river lake north of Cragg's Island!\n\nIn short, a good game that is going downhill, buy only if you and your friends are starting a server or find a decent private server well away from the dev's machinations.","January 7","false","387.8"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","27","36","0","3"

I bragged about it to my friends, wanted them all to join in and have fun. This was all before WildCard began their descent. Hackers seem to be in high abundance, using aim bots, dupes, ESP, etc. I have been to quite a few servers and had to leave due to these blatant hackers. However, those are not even the big deal. If you are a new player, forget playing on the official servers. Every single one is nothing but politics. Ever since the Gigasaur was released, the tyranny of most tribes has skyrocketed. The Gigasaur was one of the worst releases ever made, being far too overpowered for people to counteract. T-Rexes were enough, bu that is just my opinion. If you do decide to get this game, do not play on Official servers. They are a waste of time, and there are no admins to kick or manage griefers, hackers, or trolls. Some of the servers will even kill you the moment you join just to make you leave the server.\n\nIf the hacking issue is resolved, if the Gigas get a huge nerf, then the game is headed in the right direction.

However, it is not enough to balance out the serious problems with player security.\n\nI've had moments where I build something, spending hours and energy harvesting resources to make the tools > to harvest the resources > to assemble the parts > to build my dream home.  Only to have someone on or groups of raiders come in and destroy everyting I've built and robe me of everything I had.\n\nWorse still is when it happens while you're offline.  You log off from the game, you are helpless.  Anyone can mug you in your sleep or murder you and take your stuff while they're at it.\n\nEven the Tribes (ingame guilds) are not safe.  Anything you build belongs to them, including any tamed mounts.  So if anything you build before and after joining a tribe is theres, when you're kicked out you are left with nothing.  More wasted time and energy only to be screwed over.\nIt's more heart wrenching when you find out someone conned their way into gaining Tribe Admin rights, kicks everyone out and takes apart everything they had built.\n\nSo in summary:\nPros:  The game is gorgeous.\nIt's fun to tame, fight and survive in a jurassic world with dinosaurs.\nCrafting new items as you progress along the way from a wood home > solid metal.  Crafting weapons from a spear > Rifle > Auto cannon > and full body armor.\n\nCons: You die, you lose everything you had on you before.  If you can't find your body and recover it in 15 mins, it's all gone.\nYou get a sense of paranoia 24/7 from other gamers.  You never know who you can trust if they'll just robbed you while you're offline.\nAnything you build can be taken away or destoryed without giving you a chance to defend it yourself.\nGetting mugged and raided while offline just spoils the fun in the game.\nYou'll spend hours a day in a week on something, only to log back on and find it's been taken away by someone else.  The only thing you can do is sit there, ♥♥♥♥ and moan at the loss of your time and energy.","October 4, 2015","false","297.2"," 103 of 171 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","103","171","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SocialLube/recommended/346110/","SocialLube","Sion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SocialLube/","50 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSome background: I've put just over 1600 hours into this game. I ran the strongest tribe on a Public Server.\n\nThe game was very fun at first, but once you hit level 20-25 (which doesn't take long at all) all survival aspects of the game are gone. There's no longer any struggle to survive, chances are you might find yourself dying on purpose to fast travel, etc. After the survival aspect is gone, all you have left is building (which is very unintuitive in ARK), dino taming, and feeding your herd of dinos. Ok let's move on to pros and cons overal.\n\nPros:\n+For your first day or so, this truly is a fun survival game.\n+There is a lot of variety between the dinos and reasons to like/use most of them based on preference (I was the Argent King of the server)\n+The island is really nice with a lot of unique scenery.\n+The map doesn't tell you where you are, you have to figure it out (this might be a negative for a few).\n\nCons:\n-THE GRIND!!!! (Everything is a grind. You need to Grind mats to build/craft. You need to grind food for dinos. Taming is a grind of spending hours looking for a dino you want with a decent level then having to baby sit it for the next 2-6 hours or longer).\n-Lack of Dev response with problem players. (A single player can really damage the server by building on area of high metal spawns, building around someone else's base, players dropping foundations everywhere which kills the spawn of anything including dinos and mats for 75 meters) I have seen Dev response take upwards of a couple months, which by that time the damage is done.\n-Once again, going back to griefing, there's no way to deter or retalitate.\n-Raising baby dinos.... my experience of hatching a Giganato baby and raising.... I had to stay awake approx 32 hours and babysit it so it didn't die.\n-The events in the game are generally pretty poor (but at least they do events I guess). The events generally spawn an uber dino such as the Dodorex (which I almost solo'd, but ran out of time, most people didn't want to risk a dino or two).\n-Server lag. Server lag is really really bad on public servers. You'll experience 5-10 minutes of rubberbanding per hour (I have an excellent gaming rig and internet connection, it's actually server side lag).\n-Dino claiming. Dinos have a timer where if you don't play for a week anyone can take them. This has lead to dino populations on servers going through the roof (since people never risk there dinos or kill them off) which leads to more lag. Also the other part of this issue is when a new player gets a lot of max level dinos and builds everywhere (because they're unfamiliar with an area, get lost, etc etc) and blocks tons of spawns.\n-PvP virtually every server has one major tribe which controls the server. And over multiple servers I've never seen the power shift. Nothing Like having your base wiped EVERY time you log off, so you can't fight back.\n-Also there is no 'end game'. Eventually the onyl thing left to do is feed your dinos so you don't feel like you wasted your time taming them. There is no challenge mid to late game at all.\n\nThere are a lot more negatives, but they're mostly minor. I put a lot of time into this game, I really enjoyed it at first. But it's terrible performance and grind are enough for me to say, stay away.","January 28","false","213.0"," 105 of 175 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","105","175","12","27"

They cater stat balances to fit PVP and hard core survival "DayZ" difficulty standards, which may sound appealing to some sadists out there, but for the rest of us who just want to have a cool dino game to play, this has become almost the bane of all dino games, encouraging higher and higher levels of effort and lower and lower levels of yeald.\n\nWhen I say the game runs bad, I mean its not made well, not that I cant run it well, no one can. its the only game in my library to stay below 20fps, on any settings, highest to lowest makes no difference, and its not a cpu bottleneck as this is occuring on an i7 4790k OC, and take up a whopping 9GB of my 16GB of ram. All I have seen is a drop in framerate in their few "performance" and "optimization" and I doubt it will end up being well optimized by the end of its EA.\n\nYes it looks super cool and a lot of people are playing it right now, but the player count is dropping like flies and for good reason of the devs constant incompetency, and turning a fantastic concept into an unfun chore. Do not buy this game if you are looking to play a dinosuar game, it is strictly being developed for the sake of the PVP "league" or "tribe" mentality and anything that once existed for the sake of ones own enjoyment in the experience has been nerfed into uselessness.","January 5","false","758.3"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","0"

There where some people buzzing around it, I was a bit afraid of them because I didn't want to get killed nor to have my new hard worked house destroyed but thank god nothing happened! :)\nSome hours later while I was gathering more materials another player  approached me and said : "If you don't speak with your mic I'm going to kill you!". Fortunately I had my mic on and told him to calm down and to leave me alone!\n\nLater that evening I logged in again but I had to change server because it was full. The bad thing was that I had to start all over again, the good, my brother bought the game and wanted to play with me so we started to play but first we had to find each other!\nAfter 2 minutes of asking each other things like "where you at" or "I can see this what about you" I found him! We where both happy and running toward each other until we banged our heads and my character fainted, yes, FAINTED!\nAfter I regained consciousness, we started farming materials in the middle of the dark knight, we could barely see anything!\nWe builded our house, hunted for food and encountered few people. One of those was a weirdo outside our house, he wanted to enter in our house at all costs otherwise he would have destroyed our door but I told my brother to don't mind him, it was a lie. We then had to go out and he was still there. He stood near our fire for minutes and after a while he started attacking us but my brother acted quickly, he attacked him with his axe and the body of this person was literally rolling down in the sea with one hit! Yeah he died! R.I.P.\n\nThe second one was a lvl 52, he was friendly but cheecky, why? Well he invited me and my brother to join his tribe, spoke with us a bit, the tribe welcomed us but then one lovely thing happened. While we where expanding our house, I noticed a message "You can't build nothing near the house of another player", I was a little bit shocked and tought that's my house why I can't build near it?! Then I saw that my house was now part of the tribe and that they kicked both of us out. In other words they stole it from us!\nBeign new players me and my brother without knowing it learned a lesson, don't trust no one in this game!\n\nWe then had to made the sad decision to destroy our house, we didn't want to leave it the hands of those thieves!\nAfter destroying the house we departed for another adventure and started building another house somewhere far in the woods. It is nearly done, just the roof to complete and some inside stuff.\nNow after logging out, both of us, are going to sleep hoping that our house will still be there tomorrow.

You're never full or hydrated, dinosaurs that give the basic materials you need range from lvl 4 - 120, and the ones that you encounter will fall into that range, so yes, you will get destroyed by a lvl 80 bug and lose all your stuff.

Picture a game where you've spent months of time Taming, Developing & Working on your own Dinosaur only to have someone else completely rip them apart by arbitrarily lowering their hard earned stats..

They recently nerfed dinos by as much as 1000%. The game just became a lot more grindy, a lot slower paced, and a lot less fun. They demolished any semblance of progression with dinos, removed any incentive to breed dinos, which was a really awesome system up until dinos became essentially glorified pets; there for mere aesthetics.\n\nThey fixed the gathering rates, but the HP and DMG is still nerfed heavily. The 1000% nerf I mentioned was due to dinos gathering rates being worse than a player with a metal pick/axe. Not only were they useless gatherers, they had so little HP that players with longneck rifles could one shot many of them. This happened on tons of servers, people lost dinos that they had bred and leveled quite a bit.

Another thing, after all those optimization updates,the game still is not playable enough for most of computers, if you want to play with normal launch mode you need at least a gtx970 or r9 280 minimum to play on medium settings at a wonky 60fps ish with many fps drops to 0 because of poor programming. They made updates to fix bugs and still,the same bugs are still happening,Dino's,eggs,characters falling under map,Dino's dissapear for no reason and comes back several days after loosing it. Still several game loading issues even after updates. At the moment,they balancing the Dino's and they are making them really nerfed. In fact, a Rex can't kill a small fish or a dodo bird under 3 hits, Dino's that are good for harvesting have been nerfed too,you will harvest faster by hand and the HP of the Dino's have dropped about 75% making them weak. If you plan to play on official servers only,don't get this game at all,it will take you hours to tame a single dino,you will need to stay next to a dino to protect it from other Dino's for hours and hours feeding it until its tamed. To level up it will take you weeks and months depending you want to play everyday all day long or play couple hours at the weekend and if you only play at the weekend couple hours...you don't want to be in a official server. The game is popular because of single player and unofficial servers and still,when they update unofficial servers crashes really often and nothing is really stable,you can loose all your Dino's and need to wait for rollbacks. Bugs,lags you will encounter,not fun at all. There's a limit to loose what you did in a game,there's a limit to make changes to the gameplay, and Studio Wildcards did pass this limit.\n\nEdit: In the game trailer (from actual gameplay) they show a T Rex break into a dino gate by running thru it. First, that's false advertisement since the game is physicless ,Dino's can fall thru foundations,ceilings,ground. You can have dino heads thru walls too,if you wipe the tail of a bronto it will go thru anything,rocks,trees,walls without any collision . physicless. There's anlot of work in this game with around 30-40 Dino's to be added and they mostly add 1 ish per week,the game won't be done at release date and I'm ready to bet on that. Beta version need to be release like right now to start the optimization because that part takes time unless they think that dx12 will cover all their bugs,glitches but its not the case. They can't even run dx10 properly,imagine the work left for dx11 and dx12. If they think that it takes minimum requirements a 970 to play the game they must be drunk. Graphically on low it hurts your eyes,there's games out there that even on low, still looks OK but not ark and still,it doesn't run as fast,the game is just a map with tons of AI,nothing else and its physicless so not to demanding for a CPU.

Currently, it's optimization is pretty bad which means you need a high end system to play on high or epic graphics and even then there are reports that the game won't get past 30 fps. The devs have been working hard and there are multiple (small and large alike) patches every day. Seeing how fast the patches are rolling out, I have good hopes for this game. But, as with every Early Access title, time can only tell.\n\nThe atmosphere is really something. The dinosaurs that graze quietly, the sunbeams flickering through the trees, the sound of waves gently breaking on the shore, it's a sight to behold. That said, it can turn around in no time as there are some really ferocious beasts that see you as food and won't hesitate to hunt you down.\n\nPlacing constructions is similar to most of the survival games out there. You gather the materials (wood, rocks, metal, thatch etc.) and craft them into the appropriate item and place them. However, learning recipes is a little different as each time you level up you gain points. WIth these points you unlock recipes. Leveling up goes rather quickly in the beginning and happens very passively by simply moving around, gathering materials, killing dodo's etc. Within no-time you have enough points to unlock all the recipes for an entire shack. As you level up more advanced recipes become available, for example, you start with a shack made of straw, when you leveled up enough you can unlock wood, even further you can make constructions out of metal. This goes for weaponry and clothing as well.\n\nOnce you are set and have some weaponry you can hunt and tame dinosaurs. The taming process is pretty aggrevating at the moment but I'm sure that gets balanced over time. Once a dinosaur is tamed you can ride it and it levels up much like yourself.\n\nThis is what I've experienced so far and will update this further in the future.","June 5, 2015","true","37.4"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","72","28","39","18","0"

Sometimes an update causes incompatiblity issues with mods, sometimes it just gets corrupted, and as such can get extremely frustrating having to deal with the problems.\n\nThe problems with the game are mostly balance issues, some dinosaurs are way too over-powered (Giga for instance).  The game also suffers from alot of weird deaths, you'll die...alot - sometimes, its your fault - other times its the games fault and you'll also lose alot of tamed dinosaurs the same way, heck I've lost a dinosaur to committed suicide by getting stuck on a standing torch...yes, the artifical stupidity is that bad sometimes.\n\nMore issues revolve around the placement of structures,  I get they went for simplicitity but sometimes, you just need better options to get the job done.  A prime example here is the power and cabling system, which is atrociously bad and really needs a major re-work, even with mods - its still a FusterCluck of a mess and something that the devs should really consider with a future patch.\n\nMods are a huge help to the game, but again - any modder will tell you that using them is at your own risk - which leads me to another issue, this game is still very similar to a roguelike, since its entirely possible to lose every single item your carrying when you die, sometimes when messing around with mods - those can even erase your character and force you to respawn, thus losing everything which can be very punishing when you lose everything to something that isn't really the players fault, sometimes dying due to a bug for instance.\n\nDinosaur taming again, since Dinosaurs are the main focus of the game and taming them as pets would be something enjoyable, but even this aspect of the game isn't without issues.  The requirements and even taming timers, especially the timers can be brutual - imagine spending countless hours, real time hours trying to tame a dinosaur? I'm sure some veterans could share many horror stories of the hours wasted taming - surely a better system could be done rather than spending as long as 24 hours taming something?   Sure, you could always play single player and greatly speed up the taming process, and even some private servers have increased taming speeds but not all.\n\nNow, for the positives - the game looks amazing, great flow and great potential once they can really work out some of the bugs and problems,  ARK 2 is something I would be invested in too if that ever saw the light of day.   Especially if they could get a better co-op system in place, rather than having a useless tethered helper on a non-dedicated server.\n\nI think ARK: Survival Evolved shows alot of promise provided they keep it in development and work at making the game more stable, more optimization and re-work some of the areas of the game where it fails, such as electrical cables.\n\n* Update 3.29.2016\n\nUninstalled the game, had enough of the unstable client and waiting until such a time when the game is fully released and more stable.  Mods is the best way to play, and unfortunately then can make the client even more unstable especially each time a new patch is released and practically breaks every mod.\n\nPros\n\nGreat Atmosphere\nGreat Graphics\nDinosaurs look realistic\nMod Support\n\nNegatives\n\nMany bugs and glitches\nElectrical cable system is bad\nWay too easy to die\nTamed Dinosaurs have bad A.I\nTerrible multiplayer\nUnstable and prone to hard crashes","March 13","false","138.2"," 134 of 228 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","134","228","10","6"

I don't know who was smoking what with this stat nerf, but they need to fix this. Goodbye Ark, at least until someone realizes how stupid of an idea this was.\n\nThis is so long I had to add it to the review and not in the comment section, but it does include some specifics as to why I gave a negative review.\n\nTo Bigmac; first off, nothing I said was anything but an opinion, so it by definition can't be false. Second, it's not hateful, nowhere did I add anything into the review that indicates any form of hate, just that I disagree with this particular update and that I would no longer recommend this game. Now, let me explain why I disagree with this stat nerf, and why I think implementing it was stupid. I love the game as a whole, but I strongly disagree with the methodology the devs are using to balance the games mechanics. This is a development game, true, but it is also a development game that people have paid for and have put 100's of hours into. People have gone to great lengths to build what they have and tame what they have and this patch ruined much of that. For example, I have a high lvl scorpion that I had tamed to knock certain things out. I had its damage at about 800%. Scorpions do 3x torpor to their damage over a 10 second period. Their base damage is 15. Now, it had very low damage when tamed, even though it was high lvl. That wasn't a problem at all, until this patch. It used to be a 10% gain on damage per lvl, so since I started out at 200% damage, I gained it at 20% per lvl. That's slow, but I only needed it to reach a certain point. Now, because it had low base damage, it has roughly 240% damage. I can't get those lvls back and even if I could what was once a useful creature would be worthless no matter what I do with it. This was a 120 scorpion. Now, scorpions are easy to tame so finding another one with better stats wouldn't be a huge problem, but there is nothing I could do to get one powerful enough to do anything close to what I wanted it for. That isn't my only useless creature now, it was just my hardest hit one, and it lets me easily explain the problem I have with the way they did the nerf. By nerfing the per lvl stats so much they made any and all choices made on certain creatures lvl's worthless and they limited the kind of customization allowed per creature. Your points now matter less, there is less progress to be had. I dislike any changes that limit what kind of builds or the degree to which your decisions matter. A better route would have been limited the max gain per lvl per stat, or dimishing returns with some possible base stat adjustments in either scenario. Even better yet they could, and should, and adjusted wild dino stats up rather than take tamed ones down. Many people within their playerbase feels, rightly, betrayed by this change which so adversly affected their hard work. This game is still in development, but since they have opened it to the public and since the public has largely funded it's progress and has largely affected the design of the game, they should be a little bit consious of how their actions affect the playerbase. I would not have been so short and harsh with my review had there been a "hey, we're nerfing stats, this is what we plan to do" post a week ahead, or if they had bothered to give players a chance to reset their creatures stats to accomodate the kind of change, or if they had considered any of the specific scenarios accompanying the update at all. Very clearly they had a vision for the game, overshot what they intended the balance to be by not analyzing their own mechanics properly, and then decided to bring it back and start from scratch on what their intended path was completly lacking any perspective on their playerbase. And to make that entire plan worse they didn't properly analyze the changes from this patch either. Why do I say that? Gathering rates, specific balance problems, etc. These are things that should have been included in the base patch. Not 3 or 4 patches after. There is still no method for alleviating many of the problems, which shows that the patch was poorly thought out and rushed, aka, stupid. I dislike any game devs who show a lack of regard to their playerbase. Last group I saw that did this was Bioware (admittedly this was probably more of EA's fault) with SWTOR. They didn't at all consider the fans of their series. And that is the same mistake that the devs of Ark are making. There are thousands of people who love this game, myself included, but I refuse to play a game with devs who put so little forethought into what they put of particularly as it applies to their players. If they fix it, I'm back and a fan for life, provided they learn from this mistake. I'm not a "3 strikes your out" kind of person; they fix this I'm back. They make one more mistake of this kind and I'm gone for good.","January 5","false","538.3"," 52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","52","82","2","1"

Optimizations and balancing are tossed aside for the next coolest thing, with retention and replayability being destroyed as brutally as your first house. And this is without even daring the official servers. Oh yeah, and there is a single dinosaur that breaks the already-fragile balance of the game.\n\nWhy this is a bad thing: Ark is an example of quantity over quality with it's purchases, it is (unfortunately) probably the best in-depth dinosaur game out there right now, and Studio Wildcard knows this. Although I call it the "best", that does not mean I call it "good". Because of the entire lack of competition, the standard is set painfully low, and you'll quickly feel that pain as soon as the game starts. If you really MUST buy this game, get it while it's on sale. And don't play on official servers, make one with your pals.\n\nWhen it might be okay: Like any game, if you have some good friends along for the ride and some handy console commands to hammer out any unfair moments and balancing, things will go much better for you. Don't let Studio Wildcard tell you how to play. When the game does run properly, it can be a decent adventure, though the effort required to do so is far from worth it. Try another cheaper, more well-received survival game for now.\n\n::TLDR:: Studio Wildcard is surviving on a hype wave because it's doing something somewhat different, much like the original Alone In The Dark. And much like Alone In The Dark, Ark is an interesting concept being handled by a team that clearly doesn't know what they're doing. Oh wait, FOUR teams it says.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charzinc/recommended/346110/","Charzinc","Charzinc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charzinc/","4 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile it is true that the devs have worked to correct the imbalance patch 231.0 has caused, some serious issues still remain and a couple more have been added. Tames can no longer one hit wild dinos which would be great, except for the fact that they are very low lvl wild dinos. (Lvl 20 for example) And alphas are nearly impossible without a giga, which again wouldn't be bad except that it takes an insane amount of resources to even begin to tame one, which most tribes simply don't have. While I do agree that the game needed to be balanced, doing it in such an extreme way has alienated most of the players.\nWhile I can see the need for balance and getting rid of op tames, I can't agree with tames being weaker than their wild counterparts. Why? Because a tamed dino is a trained dino. It is trained to be better at resource gathering/fighting. While I don't think they should be able to one hit high lvl dinos or go after alphas solo, I personally can't agree with them being weaker than everything. It removes a great deal of realism for me.\nThen there is the most recent nerf to the turrets... Again while it is great that your favorite flying mount can no longer be one shot out of the sky, defense against wild dinos/hostile players and their dinos, is now almost non-existant. In a pve server this wouldn't be as much of a problem, except for the fact that alphas can still spawn inside your base and the turrets can no longer kill them before they kill all your dinos, but most official servers are a mix of pvp and pve players and tribes. This means that players have no real means of defense any more. Against either wild dinos or hostile tribes and their tamed dinos. Meaning that raiding and entire tribes being wiped will happen more often, again it wouldn't be bad except that it will be smaller tribes that get hit the most often, larger tribes can easily add more turrets to make up for the nerf.\nThen there is the lag. It's always been bad, but now, for me at least, the lag is so bad as to make the game almost un-playable. With wild dinos still slightly op compared to our tames...the last thing you would want is lag that is so bad your character freezes.\nIn short, the changes can be good, however, the way in which they have been implemented was very poorly thought out and ignored problems that have been in the game for months, while adding others.\nWhile I do understand that this is an early access game and that there will be changes, the point of any game being early access is to involve the community in helping to shape the game. I personally feel like the developers didn't take into consideration the backlash that it would cause, and now although they are taking steps to fix it, communication is still somewhat lacking.\nI will wait to see where the newest changes will take the game, I'm not ready to give up on it yet. But for now I don't recommend this game, because of the current issues with it. I will trust the developers to come up with solutions for these problems, but for now it isn't worth purchasing.","January 5","false","054.1"," 58 of 93 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","58","93","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bayouweapon/recommended/346110/","bayouweapon","Niflheim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bayouweapon/","53 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have over 800 hours into this game, just to start.\n\nMy tribe and I worked diligently from scratch on an official PvP server and through the combined effort of our hard work rose to the position of an alpha tribe. No one had any complaints about the progression of the dinosaurs, everyone got along, the server progressed very well with the population almost maxing out daily with friendly people still willing to raid and engage in PvP.\n\nThe recent nerf on dino stats has eliminated that. Most of the players have quit and refuse to play until the issue gets resolved, which Studio Wildcard is largely turning a blind eye towards. As of this review they have again "balanced" some of the issues such as utility dinos not gathering enough materials to make a difference and rockets being far too overpowered. they've also reduced player damage.\n\nI understand they want to make the game more challenging, and that's understandable. It's also a game still in Alpha and has still a long way to go before it's officially released.\n\nAs of now however, many issues are still at large that will take them time to correct but make certain elements of the game worthless. For instance, with the nerf, any flying dino will most likely not have about 2k HP, making it extremely vulnerable to turrets which deal eight times the amount of damage to flying dinos and four times to others. This adds up to 70x8=560 damage per bullet. What this means is that if someone sets a turret up suddenly in the trees or hard to see area, your bird will most likely die, assuming you spent two hours kibble taming a level 120. Two hours gone in four bullets.\n\nAnother aspect they've broken, which means a lot to players is the breeding element of the game. It used to be you could spend hours carefully selecting and breeding dinos to achieve the best stats possible to see its true potential, which is of course gained mostly through levels. This is now totally worthless with the nerfed level scaling. The reason being any dino you now breed will be essentially the same as any other dino of the relative level, an example being a level 200+ Ptera will essentially be the same stats wise as a kibbled 120. All that hard work of breeders over the past few hundred hours? Wasted. A slap in the face.\n\nPeople have complained about tamed dinos being too strong compared to wild ones, which is understandable. A rex with 2k% damage killing a bronto in one bite is a tad unrealistic. But these people also seem to forget that you're also a random person who is most likely a black disproportioned midget stranded on an island created by aliens inhabited by dinosaurs and Raptor Claus dropping gifts.\n\nThat being said and politeness aside, anyone that played on a PvE server complaining about the difficulty level should be aware that their crybaby hugbox mentality is the very definition of irony. It's like going to a public swimming pool then sitting in the kiddie pool complaining the water isn't deep enough for your liking, causing the staff to pump extra chlorine into the water. Now everyone suffers. Thanks.\n\nTl;dr: Wait until a later date and see if the Devs actually listen to the 90% of the players against this update to buy this game.","January 6","false","069.2"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","44","68","0","0"

I love dinosaurs and I've always liked knowing about them so for me this is an interesting take on the subject plus I'm having fun while we are at it!\n\nI would not reccomend this game YET because I think the game is just not optimized at all and they should have more people working on the optimization team than on the "New Content team"\n\nI mean, I love how often this game is updated and the ammount of new content and tweaks made me love this even more! I don't really care if the game has to look like clay to be able to get 45+ fps constant (all the friends I play with have 980ti's or FuryX's so they kinda don't have that problem) but when you make a game, your priority is to get A LOT of people to play it (Devs forgot that not everyone has a 980ti with 32 Gb of Ram and a i7 5970x with 1tb SSDs) and if most of them are not able to get a good gameplay experience your game is going to fail sadly.\n\nI love this game and I know this is alpha-stage but come on devs! GTA V looks gorgeous even on low with medium settings there and you can play it with "Regular joe Hardware" (Laptops with i5's and GT840m's), You shouldn't need to have a 1.6k system under the hood to be able to run this amazing game.\n\nThat's the problem they need to solve to get even more people to play this.\n\nSadly I would not reccomend this game on its actual state.

I play on server 307 and member  of the server proclaimed Alpha tribe of the server. This game can be anything you want it to be.

I've seen everything from political debates on server rules then rules put in place for the betterment of the server it's self. I've also seen random acts of terrorism and griefing and salting (building structures with the intent of just blocking resource spawns). The developers have worked hard to get content out and holiday events to spice up the game. I've seen the devs listen to the community on what they want. Some might have effected me negatively but ultimately they listen to the fans. I'm extremely  excited for the offical release of the game and what they might do before then. I'm not how sure it is but there is a rumor that shortly after the offical release they will start work on a full expansion including increasing the size of the island or making another island that altogether which you can swim of fly to.

Is. A. Gigantic. Time sink. Meaning it's ♥♥♥♥ing boring.\n\nWant to  tame dinos? Don't make traps or cages- just pump that sucker with more tranquilizers than you can even imagine from specific ammo types and when it finally gets knocked out, just shove literal tons food down it's throat like no tomorrow, but wait!\n\nSit there and watch two bars go up and down for HOURS because you need to make narcotics to keep it knocked out and if you don't know what food it wants/likes, good luck, it will be kibble, and not just any regular kibble- kibble made from a specific dinosaur egg that you have to wait to get for hours, days even, to get. It won't help much, because it takes a LOT of kibble, so you have a vicious cycle where you need eggs to make kibble, but need specific female dinos to drop said egg after a terribly long time to tame dinos that drop a different egg. There are certain dinos you CAN'T tame with violence, so you have to sit there, for hours while a bar fills up, but the stakes are higher! because some of them will attack or run away if you get too close or don't have bug repellant on, setting up very pleasant fiasco where I was taming a giant bat flying into every wall it could with prime meat that spoils really fast, but I got too close and had to kill it because it nearly killed me in a few hits, I'd kill to do that again!.\n\nIt gets better if the dino has a high level, the higher the level, the harder it is to tame, which means more time and resources you have to waste, that might make sense, but if I have to sit out in the open for about 6 hours while taming a Rex surrounded by things that want a piece of it's giant behind, I won't have any of that crap.\n\nWant to make elaborate houses?

For an Early Access game and for that matter a full release it has an unbelievable amount of content. I have played nearly 40 hours already and I have barely scratched the surface, I have explored about 5% of the entire map and about 1% of Game content. The level up system is fantastic although I would love it if there was a way to reset your engram points. The devs and staff are insanley active everywhere and deliver patches at an insane rate. I would fully recommend this game to anyone, it is well worth the money it costs and you will not find a better survival game anywhere.\n\nEdit: 22/06/2015:\nAfter playing this game for a bit longer, I would have hoped by now that optimization would be a higher priority than it currently is, on Medium settings with a GTX 970 I cannot get above 30FPS @ 1440P and above 40FPS @ 1080P unless I turn the Resolution Scale down, which makes the game look absolutely garbage.

Unlike many of the videos you see online, all my time has been spent on Official PvP Servers only! Was a bit rough in the beginning, getting wrecked daily by the local Chinese tribe, however, our server got fed up with it and revolted. Using their own tactics against them we hit them relentlessly until we were able to capture their "leader" and kept him narc'd for a few days. Slowly they left, and since then any time we get more on our server, we squash them with extreme prejudice and let them know that they're unwelcome on our server. the PvP aspect and potential of the game is exciting when you can get it, but most of the time you're either on one end of the spectrum or the other (meaning you're easily overwhelming your opponent or getting overwhelmed). There is the rare occasion when large tribes get to go head on, but once you've cleared them all on the server (and most tend to leave when they've had their @$$es handed to them) the official pvp servers can get stale and boring. One thing that I've been happy with is that the devs come out with new content all the time, which has kept a lot of my tribe members interested and sticking around. Hopefully we can get more pvp'ers to come by and call our server home!","November 13, 2015","true","716.6"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","37","56","4","0"

Ran one of the top 10 servers in the world for Population. This is post is purely for feedback to the devs and those who wish to purchase the game.\n\n\nPros:\n\n* Dinosaurs\n* Fun survival aspects\n* Several tiers of tech\n* Nice scenery if you can afford a 4000$ gaming PC\n\n\nCons:\n\n* 1) Constant bugs since release\n* 2) Constant crashes in almost every aspect of gameplay (PVP is almost completely useless due to the crashing). Devs refuse to aknowledge or fix any of these bugs.\n* 3) Mass forum bans from the moderators. No matter how innocent the post. the moderators will ban you over and over again (was once banned for politely asking another player not to plagiarize my server ad he stole word for word lol... Thanks for that moderators). The majority of the people posting on steam are banned for any and all reasons.\n* 4) Worst ETAs i've ever seen. Patches are pushed back and back and back. Patches due to release on specific days are pushed back 14-20 times causing mass confusion and problems for server admins. People always argue that ETA are ETA. But the way to do ETA properly is to Figure out what you want to release in the patch, test it out, Then once it's ready and finalized give an ETA (will release patch at this time. And BE ON TIME!!!). the community, especially the admins will love you for it. I'd rather wait a day or two and have it release on time so i can update my server on time instead of staying up till 7 am in the morning to make sure my players can play.\n* 5) Patches are NOT tested at all before release. Causing mass Wipes and critical bugs(swamp biome anyone? Invisible buildings anyone? lol).\n* 6) Mass Hacking. No Anti Cheat what so ever.( yes it's coming. But it remains to be seen if it will actually work) Devs make a lot of false promises.\n* 7) False promises. Devs promise one thing and never deliver. (1 of many examples; DirectX12)\n* 8) Updates are almost always new dinos. there are 50+ dinos now. Most of them utterly useless. while it's great to have diversity, the map is overflooded with useless dinos. Make a bigger map of thin it out. No new tech, no diverse new gear(1 best gear for pvp, 1 best gear for cold..), no new game play. You can play the game for a week and get bored because of the lack of content.\n* 9) Too easy to greif in the game. PVP has not been thought of very well. This gives admins a hell of a hard time upholding their rules.\n* 10) Guns are Underpowered and unbalanced. A sniper does less damage then a pistol lol.\n* 11) Major rendering issues. Have a base more then 6 tiles? Youll come within render distance and see EVERYTHING inside!\n* 12) Dinos constantly disappear and vanish without a trace. Dino pathing is ridiculous! Needs a Major overhaul.\n* 13) Developers RIP off mods, give the item a new name and claim credit for it(industrial forge? Industrial cooking pot?).\n* 14)Developers are more obsessed on Hacking infested contests (survival of the fittest) and blowing away money to cheaters instead of focusing on the game.(this really pisses me off).\n* 15)Coding needs alot of work server wise (people cannot find server on servers list, mod downloading issues etc).\n* 16)Almost every single Admin command is corrupted and will glitch your game (force joining tribes, kill all wild dinos = crash etc).\n* 17) Community is constantly ignored and treated like ♥♥♥♥ by the admins. Especially One Dev that starts with the letter N. I won't name him to not break any rules.\n* 18) 2500$ gaming pc and Can't even run on full settings. Game is very poorly optimised.\n* 19) It takes 30+ hours of non stop feeding to tame high level dinos and breed high levels dinos(officials).\n* 20) Devs Repeatedly Add unbalanced dinos which ruin the entire game ( Godmode GIGAS that can destroy entire bases and 50+ dinos in 2-3 bites? WOW!)\n* 21) Devs try to balance dinos by making them weaker then a ♥♥♥♥ing dodo bird?. Seriously? Absolutely no pre testing at all. Just another attempt at forcing players to grind for hours with Really weak dinos. this is not acceptable. Everyone has jobs, everyone has ♥♥♥♥ to do. Nobody can spend 10 hours grinding for 1 dino. That's not realistic. You're losing alot of good players because of this ideology. Grinding for hours doesn't mean skill.\n* 22) Takes hours and hours and hours of hard grinding just to build a small base on official servers.\n* 23) Several tiers of Tech is a good idea, but it was badly designed. Most people i know go from wood or stone to Metal because there is no point in the other tiers (waste of time).\n* 24) Lack of community support regarding bugs. I've personally put in over 30 threads regarding issues which were all ignored by the dev team. Put a list of bugs you are currently aware of on a STICKY thread that way we know which to report and which not to.\n* 25) build your base on a beach? Which 80% of the people do. Fresh spawns will almost always spawn inside your base.\n* 26) Dinos falling through the world\n* 27) Supply drops spawning above caves, or inside mountains.\n* 28) Outdated supply drops for over 7 months. Supply drops are a big part of the game.\n\n\nTo Conclude. Ark is dying. It doesn't even have close to the same amount of POP we had 4-5 months ago. For example; only 3 out of the 200 people on my friendslist who used to play no longer play ARK. the most common reasons are 1) They cannot play due to the  bad optimization of the game 2) It's boring 3) Tired people greifing their hundred hours of grinding and hard work. In my personal opinion, everyone has moved on including the Devs. Devs have all but given up on the game now that they have raked in millions. The updates are slower and keep getting pushed back months after months after months. Promises made 5-6 months ago are pushed back till late August. Devs have made poor decisions regarding the way the game should have been built. Survival of the fittest? Great! Add that as a DLC or Free content after you've finished the core game. Instead of wasting weeks of development time on Dumb tournaments full of cheaters and corrupt players (Most of you know what i'm talking about). Further more, i appreciate that the devs release Q&A to the public. That's really good on your part. It's a step in the right direction. However,  i'm appalled at the moderators for mass banning people on forums, reddit forum etc. Calm down and Stop with the power trip. The community is here to voice their concerns. You can't og off banning people for no reason. Half the threads on steam are locked or banned because the devs don't want us talking about main issues (even those posting innocent comments get banned from people who abuse the report button a.k.a Spectre_06 Ertosi). The developers have made it very clear they do not give a ♥♥♥♥ about their community leaders. While ark is a fun game to play, it has too many problems and too many obstacles to overcome. The way that the population has been declining has proved this.","February 3","false","692.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

Up until patch 231. Why did the devs do this?!? My best guess is for money, because no one would blanket nerf all tamed dinos in a game that is about dinos not only to harvest and farm to build but to use as protection and to have an advantage over PvP and wild dinos. The devs have proven that its to get a new player base because of the blanket nerf, then not only screwed up the game for many servers, but decided that a huge blanket nerf is better than slowly rebalancing with even decent priorities.\n\nI couldnt be more dissapointed in a game that I have been waiting almost a year for it to be released and spent hundreds of hours on in support of the game.\n\nIf you wanted a bigger playerbase you shouldve had better priorities and fixed things like optimization for lag and graphics, or at least test the blanket nerf to see what problems couldve occured.

I am a customer of ark survival evolved, and have nearly 900 hours logged into the game now, however something happened earlier in the week on OfficialServer363 that makes me contemplate my choice in playing this game, and I want to make sure other to-be customers know exactly what they pay for when they are purchasing the game. So basically, our server was invaded by a group of chinese hackers, and we took numerous footage and sent it to the devs in any way we saw imaginable, and in the end, all that happened was a verbal warning given by the devs to turn of hacks, and nothing else. I am going to send you the links to our evidence, and even the devs response so you can see for yourself the injustice committed and so that hopefully you can spread the word so that maybe the devs will be forced to do their job.\n\nEvidence: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BxSn3VXgsurqTPNM1BzNHVlUjQzVGM   (On this drive, you will find various videos and screenshots of the hacking in action, and even at one point they openly admit to hacking in gen chat)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/346110/discussions/0/451850849193957194/\n\n(This is a link to a steam discussion from people on our server, even those who werent in our tribe complaining about the hacks, and the lack of response from the devs, it was locked by nubsly, a dev, and was responded to by TheRightHand, another Dev, saying they will investigate further, but that hasnt happened, and I dont really see how any more proof, or investigation is required)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8vWC8gPd4o      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5dR6gDhoIA\n\n(these youtube videos are us recording the chinese stream on http://www.huya.com/32386092and http://www.huya.com/heimo  you can clearly see the chinese esping, and accessing their hacking menu to enable aimbot, and even glitch under the map at one point)\n\nhttp://postimg.org/image/g6w83z7ut/\n\nIn response, a moderator spawns a dragon and flies to their base, only to give them a mere verbal warning\n\nFinally, we have attempted to share our story on reddit, and it was picking up steam and the youtube video was gaining increasing views and attention, however a moderator from https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/ ended up deleting the post.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for the length, but I encourage you to take a look at it as it shows a clear injustice done to us, a tribe who spent weeks gathering, farming, and taming, only to have it all taken away from us from a group of hackers who are to this moment unpunished for their cheating. We went through all the official channels, sending numerous emails and filling out multiple reports on surivetheark.com without any real response.

I understand its early access but to completely dispose the dynamics on which they relied on for 6 months due to "balance" is completely rediculous. The argument they favored in simple terms was "these people play more and are therefore better than me, something needs to be done." They must have hired a bunch of millenials as interns because apparently this is now valid logic.

You can't even move character to a PvE server unless the server you're on supports it (Official ones don't seem to have it enabled) so you have to start a whole new character again for each server, which means all those hours of grinding becomes completely pointless (Not even talking about inventory, even just levels/XP/engrams would be helpful). There needs to be a better balance between PvP and PvE that isn't so black and white and PvPvE servers and servers which don't allow transfers need to be better marked. Oh, and all those fancy technologies you see? Good luck getting those any time soon without grinding half your life away.\n\nIf you can spend copious amounts of time dedicating yourself to this game, work in a large tribe, only care about private/local servers or can transfer your character around to different compatible servers then you can negate these problems, otherwise, it's just like any other persistent survival creative open-world game on the market, in that your progress is consistently wiped away making it an excercise in masochism.","June 19, 2015","false","118.8"," 133 of 229 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","133","229","7","7"

No seriously. This game can be very frustrating but also very enjoyable. It clearly has potential but the developers are focusing too much on content updates and not on bug fixing / balancing / optimization. So you should probably wait for the release (apparently in June). I know it's in alpha but this doesn't change the following facts:\n\nPro:\n+ content (many dinos, items, biomes)\n+ standard map is big enough for many players\n+ multiplayer\n+ mod support\n+ dedicated servers (free server software; also linux compatible!! :) )\n+ good graphics (if you are able to run it on high and don't need many fps..)\n\nContra:\n- very bad performance (!!)\n- mostly content updates (optimization updates are postponed very often)\n-> high hardware requirements (client and server)\n- random crashes (client and server) -> can lead to rollbacks (very frustrating)\n- unbalanced pvp / dinosaur stats\n- dying because of fall damage can bug away your corpse\n- many collision problems (corpses can desync)\n- dinosaurs and players can get stuck easily in trees, stones and other dinos\n-> dinosaur could be killed\n- rubber banding problems (on every server I played on)\n- buggy building mechanics/system\n- "strange preferred kibble order" (kibble is food for faster taming made of other dinos eggs)\n- minimalist character customization\n- bad dinosaur AI (terrible path finding)\n- strange climate/temperature zones\n- extremely grind-heavy\n- dinosaur will lose gathering abilities when going to the coords 50|50\n- dinos can attack you and your structures through walls\n- you can glitch through walls/foundations when logged off\n-> if your base is on water, you'll drown\n- bad lightning system\n- taming and breeding system needs to be redesigned\n- way too many dinos gather berries (very annoying when farming wood, flint, ..)\n- tamed creatures could walk through fences/walls when wandering\n- BattlEye\n\nNotes:\n- Early Access, but thats not an excuse for everything - I just state how the game is at the moment. If they want to release it in June, they have to get things together..\n- sometimes it's hard to identify the colors of beacons from far\n- creative mode would be nice\n- huge xp amounts are needed in higher levels (65+)\n- more inventory managing shortcuts/options would be nice\n- more control over tamed dinosaurs\n- you need much time if playing with default multipliers\n- server administration/management has to be redone\n- UI has to be redesigned (engram points tree, everywhere are long float numbers, weight indicator, ..)\n\nMy Setup:\nOS: Windows 10 Pro x64\nCPU: Intel Core i7 3770K @4.2GHz\nGPU: Sapphire Radeon HD 7850 OC @1000Mhz\nRAM: 4x 4GB Corsair Vengeance LP (1600Mhz)\n\nEDIT: Wow, the release date was moved by a half year.

I picked this game up a few months ago and haven't been able to put it down since. If you enjoy survival games with tameable, rideable, dinosaurs, this is what you're looking for! Singleplayer can be challenging; be sure to adjust your server settings to fit your gameplay. If you want to level faster, gather resources faster, or be stronger then the dino's, set it up before you load up your game!\n\nThe point is to level up quick, find a nice spot to build your necessary items to gear up, then start taming to make life easier and more fun! There's special caves to visit to find artifacts, which can be used at one of the three Obelisks to summon... DUN DUN DUN the final boss of the area. It's really quite fun. Either Singleplayer or Multi, this game is really fun and addicting!\n\nThis game can also be taxing on PC's. I myself am using an 8 year old PC, but Ive tweaked it so I can play and enjoy the game fully.\n\nIt's all about the settings in-game, as well as running ARK with 'nomansky' or 'no sky effects' and 'low memory 4gb'. You can get both of these settings turned on at the same time by going to your\n\n- Steam Library, right click ARK, go to Properties, General Tab, Launch Settings, and in your settings put -USEALLAVAILABLECORES -sm4 -d3d10 -nomansky\n\nThis will launch your game without sky effects and low memory settings. Now, for in-game settings.\n\nIn-game -\nSet ground clutter to 0.\nSet sky effects to 0.\nTurn Resolution Scale all the way up.\nIndividual settings will be up to you and what your PC can personally handle. Like I said before, I have an 8 year old computer, so these are my settings -\n\nRun in WINDOWEDFULLSCREEN [still looks full screen but runs with way less memory usage]\nWorld Buffer - Low\nView Distance - High\nAnti-Alias- Medium\nPost Processing - Low\nShadows - Low to Medium\nTextures - High [If stutters are terrible, Medium]\n\nFilm Grain - Check\nHigh Quality Materials - Check\nHigh Quality VFX - Check\nAll others - UNCHECKED, unless you can run them [I sure can't without a massive stutter!]\n\nRun your game. It should run fine, but not look super awesome sexy. I have videos of my ARK gameplay uploaded on my youtube channel. You can check these out and see if this is tolerable for ya!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUriJJvdXjkWneOEzVh0A9Q\n\nI hope this helped someone! Come enjoy ARK!

The Devs have decided to unleash  a "balance" update that has severely broken the game. As it stands, patch 231 has effectivaly killed 90% of the fun and has left every tamed dino completely useless. Taming dinos is now just for cosmetic reasons or your own personal goals. They serve no purpose at all after the nerfapocolypse. They literally reduced their health and dmg by 80% which effectively kills all utility of said dinos.\n\nI know this sounds like a rant(definitely a bit of truth in that) but I assure you, once you log in to the game and see how long it takes to tame high lvl dinos and then see how easily they get killed or how long they take to kill/harvest ANYTHING now, you will see why I cannot recommend this game any longer.\n\nJust a quick example to end this update: Before the nerfdate, there were huge mammoths and massive spiked Ankylos that you could spend hours (Like 9hrs per dino if you didn't have kibble) taming so that you could effectively gather materials for building and crafting....you now gain more mats per swing by HAND with a pick or axe then if you ride a MAMMOTH into a forest and mow down trees!.... and that tamed MAMMOTH can now be killed by a wild pack of compys...which are maybe the size of it's toenail!......\n\nI'm actually moving on to other games for the time being in hopes that the devs will realize how bad they screwed up and revert the changes. Until then, this game will get a thumbs down. I really really hope they fix it soon.\n\nEnd Update\n\n\n\n\nReview:\n\nOk, first things first.. The graphics are the best I have ever seen in a game and the fun factor is immense! Finding and taming dinos is a blast and building customization is damn near limitless! From the moment you land on Ark, you're immediately immersed in a beautiful, yet extremely dangerous world. Naked and without any shred of knowledge of where you are or how you got there, you must move quickly to start gathering materials that you'll NEED to craft and create tools, weapons and structures to help fortify yourself against the many dangers on the Island.\n\nThe building portion of the game is pretty good and offers quite a bit of freedom to players as far as build complexity. There are tons and tons of options for building and customizing your structures so that you can create a personalized base for yourself and your friends should you choose to join into a tribe. Evetually you can even harvest berries to mix and make paint for your structures!\n\nWhen you finally get a safehouse built and some food in your belly, you may find yourself wanting to check out those dinos that are literally just outside your door. The dinos are very well done,  their life-like movement, stunning textures and awe-inspiring sounds will definitely have you feeling like you're in a RL Jurassic park! You will not be disappointed when you get the courage to go exploring either. The island is fairly large and considerably well populated with unique textures, caves, rivers, forests, beach and of course snowy mountains! You'll never see an area that looks like somewhere you have already been, well unless, of course, you actually have already been there. :)\n\nIt is still pre-release so there are definitely a lot of bugs and unoptimized code. It takes a decently powerful machine to even run the game on medium settings atm because it's still early access but I have high hopes that it will improve in that regard when it's closer to release.\n\nYou'll notice that I mention how beautiful this game looks but I must inform you that I am running a GTX-960 OCed to the max with an I-5 running @ 4Ghz and still only getting around 20-30fps on high settings. This setup has run every other game I have played on Ultra with np whatsoever but it will not handle epic settings on Ark in it's current state. Just a heads up to anyone thinking that they will be able to run this game on their laptop and have it be actually playable.\n\nAll in all, this is by far the best game I have played this year and I would highly recommed buying it!","January 5","false","983.3"," 47 of 75 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","47","75","2","1"

Last few patches indicate thou that developers are not taking in account their players opinion at all. Specifically the last patch that nerfed all tamed dinos made them completely useless. This is now a game where you can tame dinos, but really don’t need to because you can’t even feed them and they are only OK for transportation.\n\nThere is an anecdote circling around that developers themselves don't have clue about their game because they needed to spawn compasses to find where they are in one of their videos. On the other hand someone who played the game since release knows every stone and every tree and can find a way home blind.\n\nThe game already had massive time sinks that could destroy your social life entirely, now its 80% worse because of the last nerf. Whole community forum is telling developers that they need to fix it but there’s no sign that they are aware of how many people they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. It used to be that if you put a lot of time in finding a good dino, tame it, and level it up, you were rewarded with faster harvesting, better pvp capabilities, and even partial safety. Now there is NO reward for your time investment at all!\n\nSince yesterday, this game is only playable on a private server. And private servers just don’t cut it for hardcore players for reasons we all know.\n\n14.1.2016 Edit:\nThey increased the resources gathering so that dinos now do get more resources than manual tools. The difference between tames remain too small to justify a lot of the game mechanics like cooking kibble for faster taming or breeding. They removed a damage multiplier for birds and made them OP again. Nobody I talked to understands why would they do that. It is a trend, they fix some things, they break some things. Majority of dinos remains useless and reward for player effort and knowledge of the game is too small.\n\n17.2.2016 Edit:\nBreeding remains unrewarding process, we'll see after the next update that is supposed to bring some new breeding features. Farming is kind of OK because the multipliers compensate for lost melee. Killing wild dinos still does not provide any real challenge, and the way dinos scale makes most of them not worth the tame. For pure DPS in PVE you would use giga and for PVP you would use mostly quetzals.\n\nThey did another major stupid change: they made not-mounted dinos immune to minigun turret on PVP servers which is the biggest fixed gun in the game. Someone wants to gun you down with this DPS monster, just dismount and your dino is in god mode, seems legit.\n\nLast but not least, I am losing hope in this game ever performing better. When you have a lot of dinos and huge bases your FPS can go down to 5 6 even with the latest PC build. Outside of big bases you can enjoy the nature at 60, 70 FPS even more with certain settings, but once in the base, setting all to minimum, doing all online tricks and fixes, nothing will keep your FPS up if you have a mega base with 100s of dinos.","January 5","false","321.9"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","32","48","4","1"

Loved the concept of a survival game without zombies this time. Creator of the game have done really nice job in 2015. But I don't know why, in 2016 they seems to had a massive hangover, and decide to nerf the game as hell. Seems like people who come new to the game, can't handle the fact there is powerfull dino on server. Maybe, but people... Learn to play game, it's a survivor.. Survive. It's not The Sims. Don't ask developpers to low the game stats just for making the game simple. Or play PvE.\nNow this game it's just about farming like hell just to feed some crap dinos, taming everytime cause they can die against crap wild dinos. I'm sure if my grandma come to play to Ark she can survive better alone than people who asked to low this game. I restarted 2 times on different server, learned all to play by myself and in tribe too. Farmed like hell, being wipe and everything. Don't cry like a baby, survive.\nIf I wanted to play Sims I just buy The Sims. I don't want to pass all my time on the game with crap dinos who take more than 8 hours to tame and who going to die with a grenade anymore.\nI don't recommend this game, unless you want to lose your time and be frustated by all the work you do for nothing.

DayZ Standalone runs better than this. The ingame settings state you need a Titan X to play the game at max settings, is this a joke? And the lowest settings look like something from the PS1 era. The whole game is a big joke right now.

It's a lot like Rust, like A LOT. It's got the same concepts for resource collection (e.g tree cutting for wood, mining rocks for stones and flint etc.) but it also has many differences as well.\n\nBefore the pros & cons list shows, I want you to know I have a decent computer system that can run this game no problem. The fault for low FPS is no fault of my systems, it is of the games lack of optimization. My hardware is listed below.\n\nProcessor: Intel core i5-4690k @3.50GHz\nGPU: EVGA GTX 970 Superclocked ACX 2.0 4GB\nRAM: Kingston HyperX 8gb Beast 2400MHz\nMotherboard: ASUS Z97-P ATX\n\nPROS:\n\n- Graphically, it's gorgeous (currently very poorly optimized but it is #1 on their agenda to fix!)\n\n- DINOSAURS!\n\n- It feels like a true survival game, you have to keep an eye on everything that is going on. If you don't, you're f*cked.\n\n- It's frightening as sh*t, night time especially. You do NOT want to travel at night without a friend or torch... trust me.\n\n- Tribes! It's a great way to make groups with friends, currently a little buggy here and there but being worked on!\n\nCONS:\n\n- FPS Issues/Poor optimization: The game can at times be so laggy and jumpy that it is impossible to play and react to events that occur. For example, fighting a dinosaur at times can be a true pain because of the annoying framerate drops I get due to the lack of optimization in the game.\n\n- The UI just feels super clunky and cheesy... It's just how the text is highlighted with glows and outlines really. It makes it feel an awful lot like a childs game where the text is made pretty and colourful and uses a crappy font just to keep your attention on it.\n\n- NPC (dinosaur) behaviours are rather odd... Some dinosaurs seem to want to fight you for no reason, and others ignore you completely even when provoked. This is something that will be improved over time as a project this large isn't something that can be fixed and done in days or weeks, It takes months and years.\n\nHonestly, this game is so worth buying. I can't recommend it enough... sure, it has its issues now but it's an early access title for god sake! What do you expect? Obviously the optimization and servers lacking places is an issue which will put people off, but in time it will improve! People really need to stop expecting these early access games to be polished and done upon release only to be disappointed and give it a bad review because of it.\n\nARK: Survival Evolved is a true joy to play, it's the survival game I have always wanted and now I can spend so many more of my days buildings a base with my tribe while we tame exotic dinosaurs and hunt our prey, whether it be dinosaur or other survivors...\n\nARK gets an 8/10 from me, It would be 10/10 but the optimization holds back the score due to it causing the gameplay to have issues as well. Once improved, I will edit this and give it the 10/10 it deserves because the developers are the best I have ever seen.

I have tried to play this game everyway there is to play it.  The only way to be successful on this game is to start playing after a fresh wipe, have no life, dont mind being a slave to the e key and have a Large group of friends just as dedicated to have no life as you.  Or Join a mega tribe that is already extablished on a server and play with a bunch of D bag guy that you dont know who would destroy you if you didnt join them.  There is absolutely no way to be successful on this game even with a group of 3 very dedicated players working day and night on improving your base and making weapons and farming oil and yadayadayada.... a Big well established tribe of guys you only want to steal your fun and hard work not even your loot will come and wreck you and all your bases in under an hour.  I have tried going nomad and caveman style fighting the mega tribe with bows and arrows and even gun i can manage to craft with having no real base to speak of.  It goes ok for a little bit and have fun til they catch you and litterally imprison you for DAYS.... they had 4 guys in their tribe dedicated to keeping me sedated and fed and watered and imprisoned for literally a week.  So these major balance issues make the game extremely unfun in the long run, I find myself really unmotivated to try and rebuild after the 8th time being wiped out.  It takes way too much effort to build anything worth building, it takes too little effort for your enemies to destroy it all and I dont want to be forced to play with the same type of guys who wipe me out by joining them just to enjoy the end game.\n\nI love this game but i gotta give it a bad review til they fix the serious balance issues and make the game playable and enjoyable for smaller groups or the nomad player.  Progress is impossible without a megatribe of at least 10 guys who are organized and dedicated at least 10 hours a day to this game.","July 5, 2015","false","122.2"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","29","43","4","0"

Awww, come on, can't I just let the review section rot in insensability? For just a while? Okay, fine.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know this review is a little bit late, but I wanted to wait till after all of the hype, arguements, and poor optimization. So, I waited two weeks (and it was a great wait, considering the reward). Off to the review!\n\nGameplay: I just can't stop playing this game- it's too damn fun. To put it short, there's an extreme variety of gameplay to suit all the needs of your tiny attention spans. Whether you want to build an army of ♥♥♥♥♥♥aurus-rexes to conquer the  ARK and claim it as your own, build a magnifecent castle for all to see, or just annoy the hell out of other 'specimens', it's all up to you. In that way, it's like minecraft. But it's also like the traditional survival game, forcing you to use your wits and your reflexes to survive on your own(or with your friends/enemies) against the elements(and dinosaurs). And last of all, it's like an RPG. The progression is what truely sets it apart from other survival games. It's really the first game I've ever felt like I was actually learning something. Not even The Elder Scrolls could do that for me. It's the variety of choices, the way it forces you to use your wits, and its progression that truly makes it one of a kind. 10/10\n\nGraphics: Is there really anything I have to say for this? It looks stunning, and I've never had a moment when I was pulled away from the game just because it felt 'plasticy'. 10/10\n\nOptimization: Okay, this is the one thing that ARK did poorly on... While it runs great on my machine, I'm sure people with lower end PCs will have to severely sacrifice graphics to play the game. And I'm talking dinosaurs that look like they came from 1920's. I'd say anything below a medium quality gaming PC just won't cut it, at least for now. Note that they are improving the optimization over time, so I would recomend looking at other reviews to be sure that you can't run the game. 5/10\n\nOriginality: One of the most refreshing games in the survival genre is what this is. Instead of saying "This is a multiplayer game, so let's forget about survival" they went all out and gave it a ton of survival features. At first I thought it was going to be rust with ♥♥♥♥♥♥auruses, but it wasn't. The emphasis on survival, cooperativity, and progression was so original that it blew me away multiple times. I will give this a 9/10 though, since the survival genre isn't the most original thing in the world. 9/10.\n\nSurvival Aspect: I like to do my specials on what the game tries to succeed in, and you'd be damn right if you think it tries to succeed here. The survival is extremely realistic, and makes you use your wits to survive the ARK. It's a great experience that I recomend trying out, if you have the guts that is :P. 10/10\n\nThat's an 88%, or an 88/100 in total. That rounds to a 9/10, so better than most games can do. This is an experience I truly recomend trying out.\n\n","June 21, 2015","true","131.6"," 61 of 101 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","61","101","8","0"

I feel like now's the time to review it, though.\n\nRecently, some changes were made to the stats of our tamed dinos. For example, damage and health was nerfed. Quite much.\n\nNow dinos are just as weak, or even weaker, than their wild counterparts. Dinos that I have spent many hours taming and then weeks leveling.. They're all weaker than their three minute old wild counterparts. Something that spawned in a minute ago can destroy what I've spent hours and days achieving. Then what's the point in taming, if I'm going to loose whatever I've tamed? I see none.\n\nAnother point that bugs me is the way they handled our money. I paid for the PC version, and the devs went and made an XBONE version instead of focusing on making the PC version run decent. The XBONE version runs two times better on two times worse hardware. The game still has horrible optimization on PC. Horrible. A 970 or 980 should be able to play on at least high without having to play in 10 fps. There's games out there that both look and run ten times better.\n\nA third complaint is the occurance of hackers. They're quite literally everywhere. They ruin many official servers, making them impossible to play on. And the devs don't care at all, either. You can send as many emails to them as you want, it will make no difference.\n\nI would recommend this game if it weren't for the above problems.

Our server is pretty much a standard server other than the day/night cycle.  This means that the tame times on the dinos was what the dev's left it at.  So you are looking at a 3 hour tame for a T-Rex, which is a long time.  Now after the patch the tame time vs. what you get after taming is no where even close to being balanced.

Then the game was unplayable, but every day the devs worked really hard to fix the problems. They continue  to update and enhance on a regular basis even now, with quality content and improvements. The game itself is tough, it doesn't hold your hand and it's a lot of trial by error and dying when you begin. As you level you start to tame more dinos, improve your buildings improve your weapons. Everything makes sense as you work towards the next tier of items. I totally love the design of the dinosaurs, keeping it very authentic to what our fossil records show. Nothing beats starting and having your screen shake as a giant brontosaurus walks on by. If you  wanna Play a fun and tough survival game with DINOSAURS, and you don't mind early access this is the game for you! Especially if it keeps improving the way it is now.","November 11, 2015","true","600.3"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","30","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003778064/recommended/346110/","76561198003778064","Verdict","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003778064/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI am a 30 year old father of 2 and husband. Just letting you know to give some perspective before I review. After 451 hours invested in ARK I have decided "I'm done" for the last time. I have been playing hundreds of different games of all different styles, genres and difficulty levels since I was...i wanna say 4 years old? I have never hated a game more than I do ARK: Survival evolved.\n\nLets start with the positive ehh? Theres a lot to like and i can see why its so popular for sure. The game is graphicly phenominal at maximum settings.\n\n-Really breathtaking, If you have a high end gaming rig I can see investing money just to check that\nout! Seriously! Beautiful!\n\n-Its fun playing the game and dying a bunch, leveling up, learning how to build new things, and taming dinos.\n\n-The stats and build you chose has a real impact on what you can and cant do, as you get further in the game you realize that points carelessly thrown into health, melee damage or speed could be more useful in carry weight or fortitude or oxygen(which is manditory if you want to progress into underwater exploration). some stats are still useless though *cough*food*cough*.\n\n-Theres a lot to be said for the potential social aspect of the game, you can make a lot of friends in ark, weather you're friendly and peaceful or a jerky raiding D bag, you can easily find people with common interests, and you will need to in order to accomplish anything of significance.\n\nNow for the cons.\n\n-Time consumption. my god... the words time sink just dont do it justice! people spend THOUSANDS of hours playing this game and many of them havent even seen everything ark has to offer. they get hung up farming materials to build the endless number of things you need to protect your base or breed/tame dinos. I personally have neglected my home life and family getting sucked up in ark things. which brings me to my next con.\n\n-Chores. this game literally has chores, that you have to keep up on, every day...if you dont want your things to all die off or get stolen. if you are in a large tribe the load is lightened but this is SERIOUSLY time consuming if you're solo or in a small tribe. If bob forgets to close the dino gate or forgets to refuel the power generator before logging out you're probably losing a lot of stuff.\n\n-PvP. It drives the game! its fun! its imbalanced. the game rewards the strong and punishes the weak. raiding mid level tribes while theyre offline is the most efficent way of getting things you need to progress your own base. this promotes people to crush hours of time investement of everyone weaker than them, simply becasue theyre tired of farming materials. The strongest tribe on the server is probably going to remain the strongest tribe forever once they wipe out all the runners up a couple times and steal thier supplies. Theres tons of exploits and lag spikes that make pvp feel kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Dinos(taming). They are fun to ride and are ESSENTIAL for you to run a proper base. That said, why do they take hours and hours to tame? Literally, taming work or hunting dinos can take anywhere from 40 minutes to 4 hours depending on what kind of food you're giving it. This is time that has to be spent babysitting a stationary helpless beast in the middle of a swamp or jungle or ocean swarming with preditors that will eat it the second you look away.\n\n-Dinos(care). The AI is the real problem here. The dino AI takes over whenever you're not riding a dino and it can be given commans to follow you or sit still and seperate commands to either defend themselves when attacked,Attack your target, or sit and do nothing. There are many overlooked problems with these basic commands. Dinos defending themselves will be lured into the middle of nowhere when the attacking dino flees for its life, and it wont return to base when the thing dies... it just sits in the middle of the wilderness waiting to die untill you log in and realize its not there and fly out to try and find it and sometimes waste hours doing so. Dinos will attack things that are much much much stronger than them and get slaughtered, unlike wild dinos they wont even try and escape when weak.\n\n-constant loss. Threre is no avoiding it, sometimes things die.  If you're carless, or simply unlucky, you may lose things on a regular basis. dinos,gear,structures. Its all pretty fragile TBH. Everything you build or tame or gather in ark is a time investment and often its a massive time investment. When you lose things it really sucks...\n\n-BUGS. there are far too many bugs and glitches in ark to list here. yes it is early access(despite the fact that its a year old) and yes some bugs are to be expected in any game you play. The problem is nature of most of these bugs gets things destroyed and killed on a regular basis. I think i have lost many more dinos and items to glitches and stupid AI than I have to poor playing or rash decisions. tons of glitches are well known by wildcard and they are "waiting to for full release to resolve them". Dont even get me started on the way some of these glitches are exploited by players!\n\n-Lag. all of the server rubberband lag. badly. some worse than others. but its a real annoyance.\n\n-Addictive. yes this is under cons. If you have an addictive personallity, this game can be literally harmfull to your health. There are ALWAYS more things that have to get done, always promises of new things in the next patch and your tribemates "really need your help" to accomplish the next landmark or goal. This game demands your constant attention and upkeep. even after you lose everything to a raid! Your tribemates want revenge and so do you so you build it all back up over again cursing and swearing the whole time over all the stupid annoyaces of loss and glitches and lag. This game eats your time like no other! it slaps minecraft or WoW out of your hands and says NO ♥♥♥♥♥! THOSE PLAYERS ARE MINE NOW! It grabs hold of your eyes and force feeds you its ♥♥♥♥ until hours later, you realize what youve been eating... and you feel sick.","June 4","false","451.3"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","21","30","5","6"

On PvP servers you get trolls having a laugh harrassing the lower levels, so you can't play on there without an extraordinary amount of patience.

It's enjoyable when I play by myself, or on a friend's private server.  That's the only way I can enjoy the game.

Thank you wildcard for making a great game. but your last two major aditions to the game have killed it for me and my friends.","January 5","false","220.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I was lucky enough to find a great server my first pick, and its been the only server I've played on for all those hours. Great community. Terrific game, basically everythingg you've ever wanted in a video game. There's so much I want to say about the game, I just can't put it into words. One thing though, this game is very time consuming, taming dinosaurs may take hours depending on the species and level of it. Many times you may get raided or simply walking around, and lose the dino you just spent hours taming. Or even spend hours building a perfect castle that you've always dreamed of making, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that you shouldn't take pride in having/owning those dino's or structures. You should take pride in seeing them being built or tamed, and enjoy every second of gathering the resources to do so that way if they get lost, you're not too bummed out about it, because I'm telling you, you will lose certain items, dinos, or structures and it's going to suck. Just don't get down about it, don't be scared to get back up a keep going.\n\nWildcard is really offering something different with this game, and they do their best to give new content and provide the best experience. I've definitely caught myself and friends saying, "damn this lag sucks" or "why is this thing glitching" or just generally something weird happening, you have to remember IT'S AN EARLY ACCESS GAME, it will not be perfect, but it's damn near it.","November 24, 2015","true","284.7"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","26","40","4","1"

There will be bugs, optimization issues and server problems. What you do get is a glimpse of an amazing engine (one of the first games with Unreal 4) with the survivor element that includes many differernt types of dinosaurs.\n\nMy experience with the game was only on a private server because coming from the software development world and playing day 1 release of popular MMO's, you sure as hell can't count on playing the game on an official server.\n\nServer hosting was fairly simple after the devs communicated instructions with a few hiccups. For some reason there is region locking on private servers which makes it a little difficult for friends to join unless they use http://arkservers.net/server.\n\nAs for the game, I was fairly impressed with the amount of content and quality for a day 1 alpha release. We did not run into many game breaking bugs other than graphic laggyness with some options.

It really is. Excellent modding support, beautiful graphics, loads of fun to be had.\nI played both on official and unofficial PvE servers, played co-op PvE with other tribes collaborating together to improve our Ark life, et caetera.\nThe ONE gripe I have with the game is the lack of experience of the developer (Studio Wildcard) from a customer interaction standpoint. Their patch notes are spartan. Their ETAs are hit-and-miss numerous times. Their overall customer interaction is slim. It looks like they focused purely on development and forgot about this customer interaction vital component. The result is a series of patches and events which antagonize and polarize the player base - showing a certain disconnect between players and developers.\nWhile a month ago I would have recommended this game wholeheartedly, the introduction of the Giganotosaurus, the Winter Wonderland event, the Industrial Cooker debacle, the Raptor Santa event and the Ball Drop event, topped of by patch 231.0 (which shortly put is an 80% nerf to tamed dinos health and melee damage) have changed my mind.\n\nI understand this is an early access game but the changes introduced and not-so-well-thought-out in-game events force me to make the following recommendation:\n* Add this game to Follow\n* Add this game to your Wishlist\n* Buy it 6 months from now or if there's a huge discount (50% or more)\n\nOr if you decide to buy now, for the love of God, please don't invest time in playing the game on an official server! Not because they're bad (the server I play on is awesome from a player population perspective), but because unexpected large changes to the game core (such as patch 231) can only be mitigated on unofficial servers through setting editing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hapadura/recommended/346110/","hapadura","Postfix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hapadura/","566 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe bad:\n\nArk is currently a big Taming Dino Simulator. The problem is that the "tame" is the central aspect of the game, at least on PVE Servers, which makes the game boring after some time, you need to spend hours to tame, even small dinos. In my opinion it needs serious improvements on the taming system.\n\nYou can spend some time building structures, but isn't really fun because even simple walls need lots of resources, and if you don't have a mammoth, forget it. There are no real threats besides the dinos themselves, and once you are established enough in a tribe, leveled up to the max level and learned most of the engrans (skill crafting points) it gets really boring.\n\nPerformance is not good, and you better have a good nvidia card, unfortunately. But they are fixing and optimizing, slowly, it was worse a few patchs ago ( currently on 187.21 while writing this review)\n\nThe good:\n\nThe game has astonishing visuals, the dinos (in spite of bugs, and ragdoll issues) are cool, and the craft system is ok. It is actively being developed, the devs are very present (even on servers, they actualy join and talk to players), and has a long way to grow and fix. Everyone will probably enjoy the game, even on the current alpha stage.\n\nI recommend this game, if you fit in one of the follow:\n\n- You have TIME to spend, or join a large tribe that help you with long tames (over 2h)  if you have to go off, otherwise you will be frustrated.\n- Play local where you can tweak the taming time and use cheat mode if you must.\n- Play on Unofficial servers (with modds that change the taming time)\n- Don't care about the whole taming thing :o)","July 20, 2015","true","786.8"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","0"

Up until this latest patch. The devs decided it would be a great idea to take the main aspect of this game (taming and raising dinosaurs to fight for and serve you) and nerf them into a pointless existance. Don't even bother taming a dinosaur in this game at this point unless it is for transporation or to help gather. The hours you spent doing that could be better spent on grinding materials to make firearms to kill the other dinosaurs. Nothing like seeing hours of work poured into a game to tame and raise a dinosaur, level it up to level 150 only to watch a level 50 wild dino kill it.\n\nThanks for ruining the game Devs. Our community had planned on a pvp day and now that's in shambles until you fix this game you have ruined and broken. If we're going to run around with guns to shoot at people I guess we might as well go play CoD or something.","January 6","false","213.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It's not exactly common, but it happens.\nWonky hit boxes.\nStupid AI (Trikes are some of the easiest things to fight).\nSlow tames dinos.\nEnemy lag - it's really hard to fight enemies because they'll lag behind you, beside you, 10 feet away from you, etc).\nThe occasional crash (only once).\n\nNow that that's out of the way, I can go on about the good.\nI can pretty much sum up everything I like about this game with a story:\n\nI have a little house on a hill. It's nothing special, but it's home. After taming guard-dog-like fat people killers, a Ducky, and an Earthwalker, I decided it was high time I explored the cast island.\nI knew where I was based on pretty easy land marks (maps don't have magicl GPS system that lets you know where you are. You have to figure it out yourself), and I kinda knew which direction I'd go.\nI didn't know this at the time of setting out on my adventure, but the coastline breaks off into a river that makes a huge circle around my home.\nAnd lucky for me (foreshadowing alert), I recently got the the level at which I could craft a bow and arrows.\n\nI set out to my adventure. I've gone out pretty far before, and my dinos are usually able to fend for themselves (by that I mean stay out of sight from predators, and unfriendly neighbores. Seriously, the place I set up shop in is pretty safe). I didn't look back, and didn't take any of my dinos with me (because they're too slow)...\nA few miles into my journy, I discover the river I mentioned earlier, and decided to follow it - crafting arrows along the way. I got another level up, and was able to put points into a hide shirt, which would also come in handy, granted not as much as the bow.\nI stupidly head inland, because I see supply crates out in the far, far distance. I've gotten some pretty neat stuff in them before, and I wanted to go exploring, so I thought "why not!"\nHow foolish. If I'd have known about the tribulations I'd face on the path, I would've stayed home, and prepared longer.\n\nRaptors, and Dilos slain in my path, I reach on supply crate drop point, just to find that it led to nothing. Either it was glitched, or something, I'm not really sure. I just knew I was jipped.\nI set out to another supply crate in the distance, heading inland even more...\nI reach this supply crate with minimal resistance. The usual Dilo, and Dodo (which I must kill... every... time), but nothing serious.\nHowever, to my dismay, I find I must be level 25, which is a bit too high for me.\n"Shoot." I whisper to myself. "Oh well, at least there are plenty more supply drops out in the distance. I'm exploring anyway, so I might as well try to get some loot out of it!"\nThe third time's the charm, right?\nI cross over mountains, and bodies of water, being careful not to fall and break my femers. Eventually I clime a mountain, and can see the supply drop just maybe a few yards ahead of me. "Won't be too long now!" I say to myself, ignorant of what lay just over the hill.\nAs if alluding to my future danger, I look down the mountain, and notice a carno mauling some poor animal. "Glad I'm not down there." I remark to myself.\nI climb over the mountain, and stop in my tracks, as I notice another carnotaurus just sitting there, as if waiting for me. I could feel it gravitate toward me, and I somehow knew I'd have to run from it through it was just barely far enough not to notice me.\nMy heart jumps, and I strafe off to the right, behind some boulders in an attempt to avoid it. I go behind another hill, and turn around facing the supply drop in stupid confidence that I dodged the carno.\nI take a few gleefull steps, and then I hear it. The ground begins to shake, and I can hear its dreadful rawrs. I turn for a split second, and notice the bull-like dino sprinting for me full speed. I turn and bolt, thanking my past self for putting so many points into sprint speed. However, I was apparently not fast enough... The carno takes nips at my back. I almost give up hope...\nThen, I notice I'm headed straight for yet another carnotaur! Nowhere else to go, I run past him, and head straight for the supply drop. There's no where else I could think to go... Allthewile, my back is being torn apart by the 2 carnotaurs - and 1 dilo.\nI make it to the supply drop, which (quite importantly) is surrounded by very large boulders.\nThen, I see it... A crack in the boulders, just barely big enough to fit myself if I crouched.\nI took the chance, and ducked under the boulders. Thankfully, the carnos couldn't get to me, but I remembered how presistant the AI is.\nI drew my bow, and did the only thing I could.\nI shot the first carno in the legs repeatedly. It just didn't want to go down, but it had to. I had to make it.\nAfter nearly half my arrow supply, the first carno dropped dead. My heart jumped with joy, but there was still a carno and a dilo left.\nThe carno went behind the boulder I hid in, and I peaked out to notice that the little dilo was attacking the carno, but the carno quickly drew its attention back to me, and I cowered back into my hole.\nI shot it with my bow, and watched as the dilo attacked it.\n3 shots left, the carnotaur fell, and all that was left was the dilo. So I went out and speared the mother humper.\n\nVictory...\nI carve the carno (the first one's dead body I guess flew away), and set out on my adventure again. The supply drop was sadly destroyed in the scuffle, but that's ok, because I lived.\nI continued around the river circle. Seeing, and avoiding many T-rex, and carnotaurs. At one point I cross the river, and look back to notice 2 tyrannosaurus attacking a herd of triceratops.\nI wiped the sweat from my forehead, and continued on my exploration.\nMiles late, I'm nearing home. I see a 20 foot crock sat up on the riverside. It turns to look at me, and I decide I'm gonna go the other way. So I turn, ready to dash, but I see a T-rex in the distance. After quickly scoping out the area, and potential ways around the T-rex, I say to myself "I'll take the crock."\nSo I juke it, and run into the river (which was probably not the best idea). It nips my feet, but I make it to the other side. I climb a mountain, while it chased me. I turn around to see that it's stuck trying to climb the mountain, so I shoot it with my bow, while some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a raptor runs by (not even helping) and steals the supply drop that was literally maybe 10 feet behind me.\nI sigh, but I kill the crock, and decide to make my way around the T-rex on the opposite side of the river.\n\nI continue on my way, afraid anything will try to attack me. At one point a dilo sneaks up on me and sprays me, and I (obviously) freak out.\nStill killing dodos like it's my job, I treck on. Miles pass. Dino faces come and go. Some kind, some apathetic, and some I'd prefer not to see again.\nEventually - and I mean eventually, I find myself in familliar territory.\nI run back home full speed! "I can't wait to see Jaggi (my male dilo), and fluffy (my female dilo), Tricky (my trike), and Ducky (my parasaur)!"\nI make it home, and see my dinos, but... I'm different now. I feel like I've grown. As if a part of me went into the mysterious beyond, but that part never came back home. Instead a new me came back. One with more experience. One with more gratitude for the simple things.\nI tend to my dinos, who I missed so dearly, and went inside my little shack to celebrate my return.\n\nA night, and half a day pass by, and I'm satisfied with adventure for now. My dinos are happy, and I'm feeling refreshed, and ready to begin another progressive day of hunting, gathering, and building.\nThen...\nThey come...\nA naked man, and a man dressed in leather.\nI come out of my shack to see that all my dinos have been slaughtered. Enraged, I draw my spear, but they kill me.\n\n10/10 would recommend.","June 12, 2015","true","076.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","14","19","5","1"

Don't get me wrong: this game is great fun at times. But it is also grindy as hell and requires an immense time committment. And yet all of that time and effort can be wiped away by some no-lifer who is online 24/7 who gets off on making other people miserable. The devs and admins, put simply, don't care that one tribe can literally make an entire server unplayable and destroy thousands of hours of player progress.\n\nAnd while it is true that one should expect PvP in a PvP game, when it crosses the line into bullying, then it drains all the fun out of it. Even if you get someone banned by the devs when they cross the line, they just make a new account and keep going. Under circumstances like that, i'll make more productive use of my time banging my head against the wall.\n\nDon't play on official servers. Play on private servers with active admins who don't let people ♥♥♥♥ people, and then keep ♥♥♥♥ing them again and again in order to make others miserable. If you can find a good one, then you can probably have an awesome playing experience. But, because my review concerns the official servers the devs run, this game gets a negative review because that aspect of the game isn't worth it at all.\n\nThe game is great.

I won't spend a ton of time dishing out insults.  The game is beautiful, the concept is excellent, and has been extremely fun.  The problem comes in the last few patches.  In 231.0 they put out a massive dino nerf, that unfortunately, made about half the island dinos obselete.  The tamed dinos were indeed too powerful, however,  I feel that the nerf was not well thought out and done in haste.  Currently, if you run into an alpha or a giganotosaurus, you're going to die.  If you have any dinos defending you, they're going to die, then you are.  In general, good luck surviving if you're a new player.  My suggestion at present, would be to wait on the game for a few months, maybe 3 - 4, then check back to see if the balance issues have been better worked/reworked.","January 7","false","986.8"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

The game is fun when playable. However there are alot of server issues with the game in its current state where the lag spikes can get you killed in more ways then one, for example i was swimming the server hit a huge lag spike my character then was dead by the time the lag subsided from drowning , another time i was out harvesting items to build my house when yet another lag spike reared up and i was attacking my a group of raptors and by time the spike went away yet again i was dead.\n\nOther game breaking issues that still havent been fix are the fact the dinos can kill you through walls inside your house when your not there then when you log in your house is not destroyed but youve been killed, in my case this has happened 3 different times on one very fustrating occasion i logged in to being killed and having all of my items missing from my house even though my house was still intact so i was apparently killed through walls and the dinos destroyed all the items in my house not anyone else as this was a PVE server and not a PVP server. And today i logged into having been killed again by dinos but to top it off my home was filled with rocks to the point I couldnt enter or exit or get to my chests to create a item with which to break them with.\n\nIm tired of seeing these developers adding in new content while failing to prioritize the game killing bugs like the ones mentioned above. these devs are not addressing any of the major issues instead they keep pouring in more and more content ( which is good for a finished product) , but in this case they are not holding themselves up to a level of detail that I myself would claim to be professional, the content adding should be halted until they have the major issues fixed.\n\nIf you dont care about losing hours of work or dying in your home from dinos that seem to be like casper the ghost and your not easily fustrated at things like that then this game maybe fun for you, if your like me who has PTSD and gets upset because your dying from random things like server lag and dinos that go through walls then i suggest you save you money and spend it else where on a finished product that has good reviews.\n\nthis game has good reviews but to many are fan boys who adobt games early and can find no flaws or just dont care that there money is spent on good quality products so as of now i cannot recommend this game knowning that is has major issues that alot of people are not addressing.","July 16, 2015","false","24.0"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","0"

Of course if you go into a PvPvE or PvP server you're going to get raided, its part of any survival game... Survival of the fittest right? Your experience and the raids soley rely on the community, I play on a server where we rarely get raided by people and we developed a "Trade" system, which helps out a lot especially if you're starting off. Simply put this game is 9/10 simply because of the few kinks and twists here and there. You shouldn't let the community bother you or affect your thoughts of the game itself, the community can never be fixed unless you play on a server that fits you. I've played on a few servers, and they are not all bad, you have your griefers, and your raiders that try to screw you over, but if you get a tribe going you will be ok.\n\nThe Dinos are state of the art and make farming hell of a lot more fun, sometimes I log back onto my cabin with Carno's or Raptors around my area, but thats fun for me and more needed resources, everything seems pretty balanced out, but of course the developers are still doing some tweaks to make it even more fair between PLayer+Dino v Whomever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/346110/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBelow you'll find a written and video impression of the game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4RI1bGPbtc\nArk is an open world survival sandbox with dinosaurs in Early Access. Though there have been others with a similar concept in the past, Ark is by far the most ambitous of the bunch.\n\nIn Ark you have your usual tasks from the survival sandbox genre. You run around gathering simple materials such as rocks, and wood, and from that you'll make your first simple tool. From there you can start crafting some simple structures. It's pretty usual stuff for the genre, but Ark has a few tricks up it's sleeves to set itself apart. There's a large focus on training dinosaurs in this game. Once trained there are a nice few things you can do with them. You can sadle them up and ride them for more efficient transportation, have them follow you like a watch dog, and even mate them with others. You can raise an army of dinos who will follow you into combat while you mount your favorite one. It's even possible to mount teradactols, allowing the player to experiance flight!\n\nArk also features an interesting progression system as well. Each level you gain you'll be able to level up one of your main stats and be rewarded points that go towards unlocking more advnaced recipes. Crafting is on a progressive scale, much like your level. As you gain higher levels, more advnaced recipes will become available. It's a nice system, as it gives the player a sense of progress and something clear to strive for.\n\nThe graphics are quality as well. The game features extremly high fedelity enviroments, with great looking textures and models, highlighted by some amazing lighting and effects. The sound design is also quite nice with believable roars from the dinos around you.\n\nThough Ark has a ton to offer even in it's early access form, the game isn't with out problems. At the moment the main concern is performance. Due to the game's extremely high fidelity, the game doesn't run very well on low-mid tier machines. I had to fiddle around with the exe file and a bunch of Nvidia setting to get even 20 FPS out of the game. It has been making incremental improvements, but the majority of the problem still persist as of this impression. Another critique I have is Ark could use a tutorial. I didn't have too much of an issue jumping into the game, but only because I've played my share of survival games. For those who are new to the genre, Ark does nothing for those players. There's no tutorial, no guide, not even popup help tips. It just throws the player into the middle of a jungle and hope for the best. Hopefully a proper tutorial will be added before the release of the game out of early access.\n\nOverall Ark is an extremely enjoyable survival game that puts the dinos in the fore front of it's features. The game is ambitious and the content feels very satasfying. It just needs to run smoother, a LOT smoother.\n\nPros:\n- Dinosaurs are varied and intrical to the game's design\n- A pile of content right from day one!\n- Enjoyable progression system\n\nCons:\n- Performance needs a major overhaul\n- No tutorial for new players","June 13, 2015","true","46.2"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

A diamond in the rough, yes she is a bit unoptimised at the moment, but people with crap computers I know can run it just fine, if you can run a game like star citizen chances are you can run this game in its current state without any problems, people who complain about perfomace issues are justified but half of them dont have computers made for this level of gaming or they just arent working properly. (I saw a post about a guy complaining of bad fps with ddr2 ram in his computer...)\nAs for the game itself, the constant updates and development makes space engineers weekly updates look like the devs are being lazy. The future plans open this game up for much then just a game, a total experiance worth being played for a long, long time to come.\nPlayers who complain about being raided are justified but there is also more to that side of the story, proper base location can be vital to staying alive offline (dont make a thatch house in t-rex terrortory and expect to survive.)\nPVP is a choice not a required thing, server choice is key and if you dont like it well then guess what... ARK lets you pack up your dinos and charicter and leave, a feature that I wish was in every game.\nThis game has so much content, detail, dev support, updates, replayibility, imersion, excitment and fun in it that the game keeps you coming back for more again and again. You get borred of it, come back a week or two latter and now there is 10 updates of content waiting for you.

This has been said by others, but what game in beta has seasonal events and tourneys where money is a reward?\n\nOverall, it is a great game with fun concepts but like most online games that try to have PVP and PVE in the same build, it does not work perfectly. It is a survival game where you can tame dinosaurs to help you survive and thrive. A great draw since who doesn't want to tame and ride a dinosaur!?\n\nMany of the dinos have specialties to help gather resources and protect yourself and your other dinos. It helps reduce the grind required to build something large or gather resources in hard to reach places and environments. I loved the natural progression of that idea, where you could jump from collecting by hand to using a dino and it kept the game fresh for me.\n\nNow, I only play PVE on a private server and will never play PVP on this game where grifers will live to destroy what you have built since nothing is protected when you log off. Anything and everything you own is open for theft and destruction while you are offline, so I hear you need a large tribe that is very active or get used to restarting from scratch quite often. Doesn't sound fun to me.\n\nWhile I do like the game, I am hesitant to recommend it as early access with the recent changes. I agree that the tamed dinos were over powered and could have used a tweak, but to make them not much better than an equivalent wild one when you have to invest much in time and materials to tame them? That I cannot agree as a good course of action. They are sucking the fun out of the game, which happens all to often while trying to balance PVP and PVE together. It doesn't work, you can't make everyone happy, so you end up making everyone miserable. To tame and breed dinos is a HUGE investment of time, so when there is minmal reward who will bother?\n\nI'm sure the developers are trying to make the best game they can, but I dislike any game that is less fun to play and feels more like a job. That is the direction ARK is headed in my opinion.","January 7","false","235.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

(You know people that have school and jobs and stuff)\n\n2.\nI had read in several reviews that the multiplayer is really bad.  Personally I did not have much experience with interacting with other people when I played this game.  However I did notice the strategic placement of pillars, clearly meant to prevent others from building there.  Other reviews also said that the Alpha Tribes pretty much control anything and make it impossible to play without joining them.\n\n3.\nI felt that most of my time playing this game was spent waiting for loading screens because it crashed what felt like every fifteen or so min. (Keep in mind I last played this in January 2016, so I do not know what changes might have been made.)\n\n4.\nOne reason I stopped playing this game was that, on top of frequent crashes, I found that the fps I recieved was not ideal for continuing on with the amount of effort required to play this game.  I recently looked at the requirements and it shows a processor that is under mine and a graphics card that is signifagantly lower, (GPU w/ 1GB ram VS GTX 960 - correct me if I'm wrong.)  This seems frustrating due the fps that I recieved.  (I also have a Pentium Anniversary Processor which is overclocked to 4.0 Ghz.)\n\n5.\nThe game just drops you into areas with REDICULOUSLY hard dinosaurs.  The way the devs did their game is very interesting and kind of cool, but this also leaves a HUGE learning curve for new players.  (especially with the bigger tribes hogging all the land or killing a new player while they are away.)  I feel that the game should give more breathing room for new player to develop instead of sticking carnivores literally on the beach.  (I can't even imagine what it is like further inland. - and no, i have not gotten that far)\n\n\n\nOn the subject of tribes, I was actually lucky to have found a really nice guy who actually began an all noob tribe. (The server I was on actually seemed very nice)  We had a blast and genuinely helped each other out.  However, reading other reviews, it sounds like this may be a difficult thing now.  I don't like to hear that other players are being treated so poorly and I think it takes away from a game signifigantly when the players are not friendly to each other.  Considering everything, I find myself not recommending this game.\n\nP.S.  -  Please, go ahead and tell me if there are any new updates that improve performance as I have not played in a while.\n\nPROS -\n\nGreat Graphics\nGreat Machanics\nInteresting World\nCool Wildlife\n\nCONS -\n\nAbuse of Tribe System\nLow FPS (as of January)\nCrashes\nSevere Difficulty (T-Rex , Spinasourus Rampage upon spawn)\nREDICULOUSLY long taming time\n\n\n\nI could probably say more, but I'm gonna leave it to that.\nI am not a regular reviewer so sorry is my formatting is a little wierd.

The performance is better than it originally was but still needs work and requires significant tweaking. There is a LOT of content and things to do which makes it interesting. A lot of my friends love this game and with over 1800 hours on RUST I was looking for an alternative and tried this again. Initial 25 hours to level 15 is a key milestone due to the access to certain crafting items (wood structure, bow and arrow, growing crops). I had been raided every day due to thatch doors and finally got everything wood today.\n\nStory: Was on my last gathering of berries and stone while collecting poop for fertalizer for crops and something very unexpected happened. I had just minutes before read about the largest dino on the island and it was in front of my face. Not sure if it was going after me, I stopped and hoped it "wouldn't see me"... It went straight for me and it insta-killed me! Ok, cool, fun, crazy...Wouldn't expect less. I was hopeful I'd be able to get my stuff back so after I respawned and mentioned it in chat, this group called Verra (OfficialServer1) said it was them. I now assume I won't get my stuff back so I return to my base only to see that they have immediately started tearing it down...\n\nBase was completely wiped off the map in 60 seconds with one person using a Gigantosaurus. No ♥♥♥♥s given. Quite possibly the most OP thing I've seen in any game ever. I understand it's the biggest dino... I'm not sure what the devs could/would change to alter the outcome of a situation like this. I was told to start a new character on another server by this Verra group - I imagine it would be the same thing with a different group on another server. I suppose this is worse case scenario but I've been on the fence about this game for a long time, this just puts me back over the fence for now.\n\nThe bad performance and extreme roflstomp lead me to not recommend this game at this time.\n\nEdit1: PC SPECS: CPU i7-5960x 8 core, GTX 980 ti 6gb, 3440x1440 LG Ultrawide IPS monitor","March 29","false","92.6"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","20","31","2","0"

The optimization needs a lot of work as a lot of people have said, but I'm running a GTX 650 Ti with low/medium mixed settings and hitting 15 FPS at worst, 25 at best.  You're going to hear some people claiming it's unplayable and that's fine, but it really all depends on what your idea of unplayable is.  If you NEED epic graphics at 60 FPS and 1080p, wait for a bit.  If you can handle medium graphics at 30 FPS, come and get it.\n\nThere's a few lag issues right now with community servers, but that's being worked on.  Game received 5 updates since release, and there's been a noticeable improvement in performance and connectivity.

This this just another developer who worries about how good the game looks FAR before they at all give a crap about performance, and make it pretty clear they can't even comprehend the idea of a 'weaker specs' computer.  It's a trend that I'm getting steadily more and more annoyed at, and ARK's developers are just the latest offenders.  They care about the game drawing people in by its look and spectacle, and while there is likely a good game behind it, all the glitz makes it impossible for somebody in my position to find out.\n\nEven if you have a great computer and you can run this game no-problem, wouldn't you like to see devs start caring about performance more?  You probably have friends you want to play this game with, but who can say if every one of them can run it?  There's many reasons why this practice - spectacle over performance - has got to stop.

Not only does it allow for players to build their own bases, create their own clothing, and truly survive with dinosaurs prowling at your front door (if you built one),  it lets you build your own guns, explosives, and tame your very own Monster-Saurus-Rex!\n\nBut this game has a lot of draw-backs. The very first is that it is, in it's very basic form, tedious. For all of the hours I've logged, I'd say about 20% of them were interesting or exciting. The rest were me collecting rocks on the beach, or trying to find a server that didn't have some jerk with a machine-gun hunting down level 1 players.\n\nSure there are PVE servers, but not having anyone to fight takes literally all of the fun out of it. Who's going to blow open your compound and let loose a swarm of angry raptors? Not the enviroment. So you're left with two options; find a community that doesn't suck out of the sixty to seventy thousand servers out there, or find some friends who have the ability to host a server, and hope they have the money to support it for a while.\n\nWhen you really get into it, it's a great game with lots to do and really interesting technical abilities. But until you REALLY get into it, it's the most tedious thing to do, and that's why I can't say it's worth a buy.","February 26","false","125.3"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","37","63","6","0"

The balance between time investment/work and reward has been completely screwed up. You will work weeks if not months gathering everything for your perfect tames (depending on if you get help or not), you will then spend hours or even days searching for said wild dino at the perfect level with the perfect stats, then spend a few hours staring at it while it actually tame. Followed by spending a few days or more hunting wild dinos with it to level it.\n\nOnly to have it die to the first random aggressive alpha rex that the server decided to spawn in aggro range from you. With the exception of the currently overly overpowered giganoto (which has been a huge problem since it was added as far as im concerned), no dino can hope to defend you versus the random number generator anymore.\n\nDon't take it the wrong way, the game is still great, just dont invest time taming dinos or building anything unless the actual action of building the base / taming the dino is what you enjoy. Spending an hour on a dino to lose it in 2 seconds is "ok" but spending days on dinos / base to lose it in a few seconds because you were unlucky, is not.","January 6","false","391.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Many people who meet the requirements to play the game on High (such as myself) are still having difficulty running the game at Medium or even Low, sometimes. Night is either 100% unplayable, or "just fine" depending on who you talk to, apparently. However, I see a lot more evidence of the former than the latter. Which isn't helped by some people reporting it's based on your settings, especially given the above.\n\nThe game honestly makes me rage a lot, because it's so full of incredible potential and insofar as I've observed it hasn't met any of it. It's got tons of great concepts that're poorly implemented. You can go from normal, to freezing, to roasting in a matter of minutes while standing perfectly still. Even better, you can return to normal by taking a few steps to the left. Raising dinosaurs? That'd be so cool if the eggs or babies didn't die 98% of the time. Rare and powerful Alpha dinosaurs which lurk inland? Might be neat if they didn't randomly come to the beach and troll you at least once a real life day, and incidentally kill all your dinosaurs and destroy your base making you start from scratch.\n\nIt honestly feels like the official screenshots are doctored compared to what I've seen in-game with the settings on High. I had two boulders next to each other where one wasn't even textured and the other was something I'd expect to see on Low. The way the explode and rain down on the encampment below was especially realistic. Kinda like when I fell through that mountain or saw a dinosaur climbing up a hill that wasn't there.\n\nYou know, I see a depressingly large number of people apologizing or defending the game cause it's Early Access. However, since it's $30 and they're even holding a tournament with the game, that doesn't sound like a game that's still in beta or even alpha, now does it? No, unless we lay criticism where it's needed the game won't improve. Of course, since the developers are more interested in adding more and more content instead of stopping and fixing what they have, it doesn't seem to matter either way.\n\nThe steep price, the myriad performance issues reported on multiple sites and forums, and hell even a sizable portion of the community are all firmly telling me not to recommend the game at this time. Not to mention my own personal experiences with the game itself. It seems like every day I log in, stuff goes wrong. No, the game just doesn't feel like the screenshots watch you to believe the game is like.\n\nI haven't even discussed the game's "difficulty", but that's a whole other subject and there's far an awful lot of people in the community who get very touchy if you start talking about the balancing issues. I'll probably get a number of comments and downvotes just for this final paragraph, but since this is meant to be a multiplayer game then the community also a part of the experience.","October 21, 2015","false","226.6"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

The devs are update-maniacs - really, i can't image how many talented guys the have in their team, but i can tell you that they do a damn OMGooood job!\n\n---\nAs a beginner, i would absolutly recommend a PvE server to start up with. At least as long as you got lvl30+. Transfering your char between servers isn't hard but fair. Even from pve to pvp should work (if the target server allows it).\n\nWhat i did has been a lucky accident. The first server i joined is named "... PVE ..." but i soon (still too late) recognized it has the PvPvE rules. I thought i will go to an other server but...\nPpl who join this server may belive it is pure pve. They want/try to live in peace with each other and survive against nature.\nStill, sometimes there will be the one who belives he has to be a nasty thief and steal from unprotected places.\nI love those guys and would miss them on a pure pve server! Peace is awesome, but the feeling caused by the question "what if someone tries to..." - guess you know what i mean?\n\nGood thing is, most of those bad guys are low (hardly mid) lvl and not really organized. They may manage to kill a weak watchdog (big mistake, the owner will get a msg with the killers name if online) and break through a wall to get some goddies. No worries, as soon as the owner recognizes it he will shout and everyone knows that there is a thief -> hurray, action!\nAs time goes by you will know the map and most of the bases and ppl living there (or at least some names). There's a realy big chance to identify the thief because ppl like this kind of action and will help to get him (and, if finnaly found ... pull of his pants!)\n\nI don't know how it is handled on PvPvE-named server (anyone could tell me?), but this is how it should be in my opinion =)\n\nThere's so much i could tell about the game... just try it out, you wont regret it!\n\nAs a just for fun (still perma) player, let me tell you, ark is one of the best games ever made!\n...so far, it's still in EA -amazing~~~\n\nHave a good time!","June 26, 2015","true","757.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Definitely worth checking out.\n\n\nFull Review:\n\nArk: Survival Evolved is another early access title that appeared out of  literally  nowhere (the first one being theHunter: Primal) and yet again baffeled me and many other dino fanatics as to how awesome it looked. At first, I was taken back a little due to it's striking similarities with The Stomping Land (and we all know what happened to that atrocity) and I really doubted it would be any better. As it turned out, the Developers of Ark were right on the community's side, as they themselves were upset with The Stomping Lands as well, and motivated them to make their own game better and more enjoyable then it's predecessor.\n\n\nArk starts off with your character (male or female) is stranded on a mysterious island, naked and equiped with nothing but a mechanical gadget wedged in his/her arm, also it proves to be very uncomfortable as the intro cutscene depicts your character trying to scratch it. Your goal is to hunt for resources and attempt to survive blah blah blah...\n\n\nAs you may already know, there's dinosaurs. and lots of them. Also you can tame and eventually ride them. Making your dream of owning a pack of tamed  velociraptors  Utahraptors possible (admit it, you know you want to). So essentially as soon as the servers went up everyone frantically went on an arms race to see who got the biggest dinosaur on the block first, then brag about it to all their comrades in the neighborhood, and preferrably maul them before they rise up and overthrow you for who has the biggest  dild dino.\n\n\nWhen I first got the game however, I was already noticing some very major flaws. First off, there wasn't nearly as much servers to hold the total amount of players currently in game. Secondly, there was no singleplayer initially. So there would be a massive waiting line for a server slot to be open. Normally with many other early access titles, this seemingly "easy fix" would take days, maybe weeks to finally be addressed by the devs, and the community would be long gone by then. It took the devs of Ark less then  12 hours to add 300+ more servers and add a singleplayer mode  next day after the inital release, and they didn't stop there. I swear it was almost every few hours a new patch came out, addressing many bugs people were finding.\n\nOne of the major big things about this game is the fact that once you get into it, its hard to quit for long periods of time. I come back almost every day to check on my dinosaurs and to see who's moved into the neighborhood.\n\nAnd preferrably maul them.\n\nViolently.","June 12, 2015","true","327.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

You could be so much more.\n\nHere is a game that clearly WANTS and ATTEMPTS to surpass the current survival genre. It has has dinosaurs, it has a permanent leveling system outside of the perma-death. These are two grea things, but what is it missing that caused me to give this game a thumbs down?\n\nThis game has absolutely no player SKILL. I don't improperly capitilize words lightly. Here lies an incredibly deep game, with an icredibly basic combat system. You left click to attack. You left click to attack with all weapons. The shield is useless, there is no dodging.\n\nIn a survival game, the goal is usually to explore and survive. In Ark, it is to hermit for 10s of hours of gameplay to survive. I had achieved hide-level armor and level 20 weapons. Yet, the second I landed my Pterodactly in my 3-real-life day safe zone; it was assaulted by 2 raptors that killed it in 10 seconds. This is a beast I had to stand and NOT PLAY THE GAME, but simply "tame", for 2 hours to acquire.\n\nThis game should have a monthly fee, because that is what its gameplay mechanics inspire. A game that puts real-world time requirements on basic gameplay mechanics.\n\nIn the end, it's a great game, but only if you willing to desregard the rest of your free time.","March 27","false","25.3"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","20","32","2","11"

For now, I've played 600 hours online and approximately 250 hours full offline. I'm not a professional but I've never got killed on a server by other players when I was online. I would like to share some of ARK's worst parts:\n\n1. ARK: NO Survival Involved\n\nARK isn't a survival game, once you create and try a few stuff + read the wiki the game becomes easy. There is no challenge in this game: the dinos AI is bad, the boss is weak. There are only tank enemies with buffed attack damage. Only casuals die often in this game, "experienced" players mostly just runs away when battle comes and they hide in the grass like scared rabbits... PvE(Player versus Environment) is mostly boring and the same as you playing offline except you depend on the ping. PvP(Player versus Player) is mostly just griefing: they will just harrass you from a safe distance. There is this "Fair Raid" phrase, when you got attacked only if you're online, but most if not all the time they'll just watch you and your friends to go offline and it doesn't matter how many turrets or x plants(ARK's automatic defense system) you've, they'll just throw C4 or shoot grenades on your base and that's the end. Dinos are worthless when they don't have riders - they'll just entice your flyers and grenade the others. That's PvP - you can loose hundreds of hours of work in a few minutes and it doesn't matter if you're a skilled survival or not. ARK is too EASY to be a SURVIVAL game and too UNDEVELOPED to be a STRATEGY game while it's trying to be both and failing at it.\n\n2. ARK: The Dino are Fusioned!\nThis game is full of bugs and the developers don't care: they just add new stuff slowly and fix nothing. You'll often see dinos fusion and then they won't be able to move... They'll stuck everywhere + their AI is pretty bad at pathfinding. A few times happened that I tried to swim out of the water and my dinos followed me and I was slower so I BUGGED IN THEM and I almost died in the water because I was in to the dino... Anyway, even if they give a patch which supposed to fix a certain bug it won't work because they didn't even try it... The same with new features: 1. they create the xxx patch; 2. they create the xxx.1 patch because an obvious thing doesn't work and they 'fixed' it; 3. they create the xxx.2 patch because they didn't really fixed the problem, just partially; they create the xxx.3 patch because they need to fix another thing which was fixed in xxx.1 but they accidentally removed it in xxx.2; they might give out xxx.x patches later if there were more "feature"(mostly these features are pretty useless, they just suspend the important things and create more secondary things).\n\n3. ARK: Timewasting Evolved\nCompared to how hard to get someting in ARK it's way too easy to loose it. There are plenty of time-wasting features like taming dinos(sometime it requires  8-9 hours and you need resources which might take 20-30 hours to get - and you'll loose this dino by a ridiculous accident or a headshot...) and gathering resources - some tools require an impossible amount of resources to make people feel like they play this game for fun but it's mostly slave work. You'll often find yourself in the need of cementing paste and then you'll need to kill trilobites and harvest rock - yes, you'll need to kill insects(for chitin) and harvest thousands of kilograms of stone to create an assault riffle... Seems legit. Or you can get a frog(beelzebufo) to kill the insects for cementing paste and chitin but this frog might die from insects...\n\nAfter all these rants this game might be still good if you play this on YOUR server with YOUR friends if you can ignore the bugs and install some mods which could introduce some useful mechanics. But if you think this game is about to play and fight with extinct animals you'll be disappointed - they're just mortal tools like in the flinstones and the only things matter there are the weapons.","April 11","false","706.2"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","20","32","3","5"

But this is about the same as every other survival game, just with more creative building on the side (but nowhere near the level of Minecraft, but it is still an early access game).\n\nPROS\n- Tries to break the survival game boom mould with the ability to tame the wildlife, allowing you to take them out on hunts, help you scavenge materials, ride them to explore the small island, or just be beast of burdens because you're a bully.\n- Able to create tribes, allowing you to join fellow players in jolly cooperation, or to just be ♥♥♥♥♥. I don't know, each tribe has their own goal, and some of them are odd. But thats more dependent on the community than anything else.\n- Constant updates, its not crazy to see this game update every day, some small, some sizable. The development team has put a lot of hours into working on this. Not to mention money, as they now offer a $100 USD bounty to finding bugs or exploits and reporting them.\n- Simulates the real life necessities as much as they can. You need to eat, drink, um...poop, etc. But for some reason you don't need to sleep, but I guess you can when a jerk knocks you unconcious and now you're forced to look at a black screen.\n\nCONS\n- When you logout, your character is still in the game, making you vulnerable. Someone can come and ruin your day when you come back, or a part of the wildlife decides to spawn somewhere to give you the finger. Its an infuriating thing that is only added up still requiring you to eat and drink, even when you're offline. The later necessity is slightly remedied by having that process drastically slow down, but will still require you to come back online here and there.\n- Building materials required to create things are incredibly exaggerated, 60 pieces of wood when you gather at a speed of 1-3 at a time to create one piece of wall? At this point it becomes more of a hassle when you have to do an eventual structural upgrade, causing it to feel more like a chore that doesn't really feel like much of a reward.\n- The aforementioned taming process is poorly done, you simply knock the wildlife unconcious and shove food in its mouth while keeping it drugged. How does that make sense? Someone knocks you out cold and shoves food down your hole so that when you wake up you love them? You try to sell that to someone. Oh, did I forget this process can sometimes take HOURS? That's right, you sit there for hours to make sure its still out cold and force feed it while protecting it from any danger. You'd need to have a lot of freetime to enjoy this game.\n- A level system that is something different for survival games...but half of it is poorly done. Instead of simply crafting the items when you have the materials, you have to know the recipe. Makes sense, right? But only until you realize you have a set amount of points per level to learn these recipes, forcing you to make decisions. Do you want to be able to hunt? Or do you want to have a home? Maybe you just want to gather stuff? WELL TOO BAD, its behind a certain level requirement and engram points to learn the recipes, making this game tedious for those who don't have a lot of free time.\n\nThis game is definitely getting a lot of attention, attention that I think is a bit silly, look at other survival games that made a big splash on Steam before, what happened to Day Z? Arma 3? Rust? The Forest? This is simply just another flavour of the month survival game, and while the development team is putting a lot of work into it, I don't see it lasting for too long. My only deep regret is that I put $30 on this due to a friend'a recommendation.","July 15, 2015","false","28.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Strongly recommend playing the game on a private server with enhanced resource gathering and taming speed.  Game still needs a lot of work.  The bugs are numerous and the game's performance (both server and client) is very poor.  Hackers and cheaters plague the game and have ruined many servers.  I would not recommend the game in its current form as it is far more likely for you to fall prey to poor game mechanics, poor game performance, and bugs than to anything else.  Don't bother playing solo on an actual server.  You stand no chance.  Play singleplayer.  The game caters to 10-20 man tribes far more than the solo player.\n\nThat being said, I enjoyed my time in Ark and fully intend to revisit it when they are done with it.  This may just end up being one of the greatest games ever made when they finally finish it.  I look forward to the day when the game mechanics are just as smooth as the server performance and the framerate.","February 27","false","587.3"," 30 of 51 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","30","51","3","0"

I'm giving it a YES vote because of the concept and the numerous updates and patches from the dev team, but be aware that the game can be quite frustrating to play in its current state.\n\nThe live servers feel like they should be live public test servers at times as the game isn't fully optimised. This results in a lot of issues with rubber-banding even on the best of Internet connections, not to mention the rollbacks that occur whenever a server crashes.\n\nThe PvP in this game quickly descended into a grief-fest, so play that at your own risk. PvE is where I've spent the vast majority of my time in game and it's been quite the fun experience, all told, despite the frustrating rubber-banding isssues.\n\nThe game's key feature - the taming of dinosaurs - really seems to be only for the most hardcore of players simply for the fact that it can take hours in real time to tame a single dinosaur. Yes, HOURS. In that time, you will be running around collecting berries (for taming herbivores) or killing other dinos for meat (for taming carnivores) while also ensuring they stay unconscious by using narcoberries or narcotic paste. Even with multiple people doing the farming, the process still takes a ridiculously and unnecessarily long time. And while you're doing that, you also need to ensure that no other dinos or players come along and kill the dino you're trying to tame. Yes, even on PvE, people can kill dinos being tamed.\n\nAnd heaven forbid if the server goes down when you're minutes away from taming a T-Rex that you've spent hours taming because when the server comes back up, the dino being tamed is gone. Not just rolled back like everything else, it's completely gone. Talk about frustrating!\n\nI'm really hoping that this is just the first iteration of taming and that it will be revamped and revised as time goes on, because if they want people to keep playing the game with the hope of taming a favourite dinosaur, they can't expect those people to devote hours at a time to just berry/meat farming in order to get one.\n\nAll that said, there is still a lot of fun to be had. Riding around on the back of a raptor or soaring through the skies on a pteranodon are definitely highlights, as is the sheer terror of running from not one but two spinos!\n\nI really hope the optimisation and rubber-banding issuess are resolved with quickly so as not to detract people from playing the game as is, because there's a lot of gems of fun to be found beneath its unpolished exterior.","June 23, 2015","true","88.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Woah, hell yea, I've got DayZ (26 hours), H1Z1 (18 hours), thePrimal: Hunter (2hours), I spent just a little time on them, not only because of FPS drops, since I have it on ARK too, but game wasn't that fun at all, it may be just me but I didn't feel like they're worth the time you spend, however ARK is, been 3 weeks that game got released, already 100+ hours, even that I'm busy, working, going out and stuff, woah I made 100+ pretty quickly, I run my own server ''[EN/TR] Survivors Land'' so that's where I play, It's hosted in Germany by Nitrado, so what else can we expect? Other than free skins we've got, no in-game payments, and even gift for those who were let down by Stopming Land they got extra good skin, game is going to have approximately 70+ Creatures at Launch (June, 2016), but is that it? Does everything end on June 2016? No, remember this game made them Millions of Dollars in very short time, It's coming to Consoles, also Mac Linux at June 30th, It'll be ready for Steam Consoles (SteamOS) since it's same as Linux on November, they're going to keep game updated after launch, we may see even more creatures after launch, so what kind of creatures do we have? Let's say every kind of it, Elephant type ones, good classic famous Dinos, Spiders, Bats, Megalodons, we're going to have Dragonfly soon, and even more, now lets talk about bosses, there's Broodmother a boss that splits venom and web and ofcourse smaller spiders, in reward you get xp and stuff and Broodmother Flag, which you can place at your base and show-off that you defeated Broodmother, there's also Dragon coming that can breathe fire but what's good about these? They're not around the map, you can only spawn them on Obelisk, something like High-Tech you can see them In the sky, to spawn them you just go below there, you don't have to fly, you'll need to collect some stuff from caves to spawn them, so It's hard to do that and It's unbelievably hard to kill them, so you won't see them anywhere else except where you spawn them.\n\nSo why 10/10? Honestly I've been waiting for Dino game for Long time, but this one, was better than whatever I have imagined before, It has all goods, I really don't know what to say about Cons, I just love everything in this game, and It's Early Access, It's getting better and better, every week we get a good updates with new stuff, this is amazing!","June 26, 2015","true","521.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

I have played on PVP servers, PVE, Survival of the Fittest and single player on a variety of difficulties, and tried nearly every mod out there to make my experience with Ark better. While I adore the core concept of this game, it's slowly losing it's appeal. The devs have little-to-no interest in fixing game-breaking bugs;\n\ni.e -- the level 120 spino that you spent hours taming? yeah, it just fell through the map, oops! Oh, you were attacked by a dino and fell through the map and lost your entire inventory of mastercraft riot armour and gear? that's too bad! Your level 240 quetzal randomly got stuck in midair in an invisible barrier and there's no way to get it to move again? Aww, so sad.\n\nWhile I understand  this is an alpha game and bugs are too be expected, the purpose of an alpha is to find the bugs, report them, and then the devs are supposed to fix them. They haven't even ATTEMPTED to fix these. Instead they released another stand alone game, released it to console, and have the time and money to add new dinos and content every 2 weeks.\n\nPlaying in single player I've never experienced lag and I usually have about 90FPS. However, once I switch to a server, even a locally based one with good ping, lag spikes occur every 15 seconds, rubberbanding, crashing, and 1FPS is all too common.\n\nI can't complain about the player base because, well, it's people. They're in every game, both the good and bad ones.\n\nThe devs are all to excited to add new content but if you even complain once about the bugs on the forums, just wait for the ban-hammer.\n\nAlso, THE PATH MAPPING, ARGH! It's not really that difficult to map AI (or at least I assume since every other game on the planet seems to do fine with it) but good luck walking your dinos on "follow" any where because they WILL get stuck on every rock and tree.\n\nWith every "large update" this game receives, I lose more faith in it. If the devs actually fix some of the major issues people have with this game, I would come back in a heart beat. However, as it stands now, I just sit here and stare at the game and think "why even bother?"\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, it's so poorly optimized that I had to replace my 6 month old motherboard because this game fried it. It's happened to many people with a few hundred hours played on it.

You basic start is going into a server (for this sake it's a NORMAL EXP/GATHER server) you realize the game looks very pretty. Graphic wise the game is amazing.  You start gathering materials then get killed in pvp by someone on a dino. After a lot of trail and error you will come to realize the pvp is broken. People who have been on the a server for any point in time longer then you will destroy you your dinos and your base repeatedly because of a broken leveling system. As you level you are able to build new things and tame new dinos, and it's sounds good in theory, but you will never harm a metal base and they will wreck you wood/stone base with just a few grenades. Which comes to another problem. The time it takes to do anything. You pretty much have to no life this game hardcore. crafting recipes cost to much, you gather to little, and dinos can take up to 4 hours to tame. It makes losing your stuff in a 5 min period that much worse. You are pretty much required to tame dinos if you want to be useful in anyway, and the taming is ridiculously dull. Beyond the long taming times, the actual way to tame is actually bad. You just sit there looking at numbers keeping the knockout meter up by force feeding it drugs. When it comes to the building in this game, it's generic.  Every house comes out being a square as there isnt much customization other then just changing the color of the wall. You are also forced into a tribe, since your not able to learn every engram (The talent system for learning new crafting recipes). This forces you in with total strangers if not with friends who will steal or cause wars on your server getting you wiped. Overall the biggest problem with the game is that everything feel like a chore. You have to log on as often as possible to just make sure your alive, your base survived, your dinos are fed, ect. It almost feels like it's a forced way to get you to log back into the game. TLDR I do not reccomend this game, it is just a lot of hype.

Although the game has over 400 official servers there are almost always less than 20 people on each one.  The reason for this is that every official server is dominated by a single tribe that wipes out all new players.  There is literally no way to level and get started since anything you build will be wiped by the dominant tribe literally daily.  Even if you want to avoid pvp, every location that might be fun to build on a PvE server has had the major tribe drop construction in those locations which prevents you from building.  The game mechanics seem fun; but again, you will never get the chance to tame dinos for example when someone will kill them daily whenever you log off.  Having tried multiple official servers with the same result I can only express disapointment with this game and with humanity.","May 13","false","337.3"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","33","57","3","0"

I have a very decent iMac computer with 16gb Ram, 3Tb Hard Drive, and an 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780M 4096 MB graphics card. This game, after installing, would constantly freeze up when I would select anything from the main menu. For example, I tried to go into the settings to adjust the resolution, and after the menu loaded it would freeze and lock up, with the only option for me being to Force Quit the game. This also happened when I tried to play it in a window and just go straight into a local game.\n\nSo, despite my hopes, i cannot even get the menu to operate smoothly, so I'm not sure where to go now... as the developer, the website, or steam support cannot be contacted about the issues in the game.

The crafting system may not be to everyone's liking and i'm not sure if it's possible to acquire everything in a singleplayer game just yet, but for what there is, it's certainly enough to keep you busy. A couple of notes for new starters:\n\n1. Try not to build anything you'll use too close to the water - having a large alligator decide to come out of the water to patrol right where you are and proceed to destroy stuff as it tries to kill you is not fun!\n2. Aim to build a bed as quickly as you can - It acts as an anchor point so that when (not if) you die, you won't spawn a mile away and have to trek past a t-rex or some other nasty in order to reach safety again.\n3. Upon said death, like most things, your previous body will start to decompose/spoil usually around the 10 minute mark. If you can't get back and loot your ex-body by then, all the stuff you've crafted/gathered will be lost!. Try to remember where you are when near death so that it'll be easy to find your body.\n4. Punch trees/driftwood to get thatch and wood, then make a pickaxe. Use a hatchet on a tree for more wood, use a pickaxe for more thatch (stop using your hands by this point, no point lowering your health for a dino to munch you easier).\n5. Nighttime is extremely dark!, either hole up safe, or if you must go out, make yourself a torch so you'll actually see raptors coming to get you before it's too late.\n\nDon't be expecting to be able to make guns/tame a t-rex straight away as certain things will unlock as your get higher levels, not just different materials. Overall it's definitely been worth the money so far.","June 3, 2015","true","28.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irg_transient/recommended/346110/","irg_transient","FireByNight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irg_transient/","65 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI am recommending this game because I see the potential in it, and even with the numerous problems it is currently suffering from, it is a lot of fun. Unlike most reviews, I am going to start off by listing the issues that I personally have with the game first. Keep in mind that this game is in early access. When purchased, you should know and acknowledge that there will be bugs, and things will be broken. Afterall, that is the whole point of the game. Also, for the sake of comparison, at the end of this review I will also list my PC specs so you can get an idea of how your computer may run the game in its current state as well.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game has been horribly optimized. The ARK dev team has already ackknowledged this, and they stated that when they initially developed the game, their focus was on content, with optimization taking a back seat until the launch of early access. As of right now I am forced to play in 720p on the lowest graphics settings and I still only get around 20-23fps. If I jump to medium on 720p I drop to around 9-10fps. This is probably the most irritating thing about the game as it currently stands.\n\nOk the game also suffers from absolutely horrible loading times, it probably takes a close to 2 minutes for me to load up the world, and it literally uses up about 90% of my CPU while doing it. The reason that a lot of people think this is happening is because the entire world is loading at one time, and then it remains loaded. ARK is collectively close to 70 square kilometers I believe so that is alot of foliage and textures constantly being generated, which would also explain the terrible fps.\n\nI have not tried to join a server yet, but I have attempted to host a server, and whenever I do it maxes out my computers memory and the game crashes leaving my with the cmd prompt up.\n\nGraphics on low are really really bad, even for low. ARK has acknowledged this and said that they will be fixing it.\n\nNow I know that I listed a lot of bad stuff right off the bat, and im sure you are thinking, why in the world does this game get a recommended rating? Well let me list off the things that I really like about the game, and the things that give me hope for it.\n\n1. The game has been out for less than 2 days and they have already released 7 patches for it. This team is obviously dedicated to making this game good and fixing the issues already at hand. I think back to the only other time I have gotten an "early access" game which was cube world, and that developer never released a patch, so the fact that they have already done 7 should be acknowledged.\n\n2. Even on low graphics settings this game is bringing out my inner child. Every time is see a dinosaur I just have to stop and look at it. They did a really good job of making you feel really small and insignificant when you start out. And let's be honest, in a world of dinosaurs, thats the atmosphere that should be set.\n\n3. the overall game mechanics (minue fps) are actually really fun. The hunger and water is easy (maybe even to easy) to maintain, and the leveling system is really cool. I also really like that the inventory system is weight based instead of quantity. Makes it easier to travel around. Also, one thing that I have never cared for with survival games was the aspect of when you die you are done. I really enjoy that they give you a choice in this game.\n\n4. ARK team has already said that graphics and optimization are their top priorities, and they plan on significantly improving within days- a few weeks. Even if you can't open it now, with the 17% early adopter discount, I would personally be willing to wait a couple days to possibly a week or 2.\n\nSo yeah, overall this game is broken, and if this was a full $60 game I would say that there is no way anybody should consider purchasing it, but for what it is, and where it is in the development process, this game has so much potential and could genuinly be the first really good dinsaur game we have ever seen.\n\n\nMy Computer.\n2 gb ddr3 780mhz GPU\nintel I5 4690 3.5ghz\n8gb kington ram\n1tb 7200 HDD\nZ97x gigabyte motherboard.\n\nHopefully that will give you an idea of how well your computer can run the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImANoodle/recommended/346110/","ImANoodle","Noodles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImANoodle/","246 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a great game for people who are into survival games like Rust or DayZ. The only thing is there is so much more to do in this game. There is an actual leveling system where each time you level up you can increase your health, stamina, O2(how long you can stay underwater), food, water, and the list goes on. There is also a character creator in which you can choose your gender and customize the size and looks of each of your body parts, which has already led to horrifying characters being created. Anyways, each time you level up you get things called engram points, which you can put toward blueprints that allow you to be able to craft stuff, like torches, campfires, hatchets, guns, bows, slingshots, and things like that. But to get guns you have to be a really high level and play the game a lot, which is a good thing because this game shouldn't be a gun fest like most other survival games. So seriously, if you're really into survival games, get this. Even though you might have a little trouble joining servers at first, it'll be worth it. And you'll give the developers an extra $25 to put towards the developing of the game.","June 5, 2015","true","714.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It makes me sad that these virtual animals I loved will just starve to death now after 100's of houring going into them.\n\nThe 231.0 nerf was the point at which point the developers showed a complete lack of experience by connecting the world "rebalance" with an 80% nerf that made all the time and effort put into this game evaporate.\n\nTamed level capped dino's = don't bother just a liability\n\nWhile there have been some adjustments since the 231.0 patch they are only returning slight amounts of what was taken back to our combat dino's.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elmoailos/recommended/346110/","elmoailos","Ailos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elmoailos/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game had potential, and about a year ago, the update cycle made it feel like this was an active Early Access project that was destined for greateness. Alas, it seems that only Goat Simulator has been able to reach the finished stage whilst carrying the survival title.\n\nThis game's current problem is that it rewards people with no jobs like no other.\n\nThis game can be fun still if you're more into pure PvE, but understand that it will get grindy fast. There's private servers that will fix that but then that kinda takes the challenge out of it.\n\nIf you're looking for an element of PvP to try and make it more challenging, you have some options but none are very good. The official servers run pretty terribly - as in laggy, stuttering, and generally feel like they're on a toaster. There's private servers and a lot of the time the private servers outperform the official ones.\n\nPrivate servers often also have mods that help with some of the games' inbalances to some extent, but I don't think I've yet seen one that addresses the core issue of this game. If the server is populated, you'll likely get crushed by one of the established tribes as soon as any newbie protections the server rules afford you expire. Or if you show up with enough friends you might be able to develop your tribe up quickly enough to be one of those powerful established tribes. And then at some point, you'll encounter someone who plays 20 hours per day and has way more weapons and explosives than your tribe would ever have the patience for and you get wiped off the face of the map pretty quickly. At best it gets grindy and boring and at worst it can get really infuriating.\n\nA year ago, the frequency of new content and updates was so high that it felt there were significant new changes and mechanics introduced weekly, daily even, and it made it kind of exciting to open it up every night. Today, not only has the pace of content slowed down, but even the bug fixing hasn't really been a thing for them. Things clip, warp, teleport, and can generally become bothersome to deal with. All this sacrifice for what? To allow resources to develop this game on Xbox. That's great and all but that decision has sacrificed what was one of the strengths of this studio in favor of attemptint to pursue a larger audience... but the problem is that as little as PC gamers tolerate bugs, console players tolerate them even less; so in pursuit of a larger audience, the studio has lost its ability to actually complete the game. And that sucks.\n\nBottom line is that I will now no longer buy another early access game because of the frustrating experience I've had with thsi one.","May 28","false","333.1"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","16","25","3","1"

I've seen a lot of reviews saying how bad the online is (raiding, griefing, etc.). Sure I agree it can be really annoying and you want to rage quit often when it comes to the Offical servers where it's always full and you have the people who like to do the low blow of raiding while you're offline. But there is more than one way to skin a dilo, find an unoffical one, or maybe start your own, AND there is the option of playing single player...

I will update closer to final release!\n\nEDIT: Be careful with this developer and the game, reasons are simple they are liars and Stomping Land.... The reason they lie is easy, they said that the game works great on both AMD and Nvidia, they said they do not choose sides or partner with anyway, yet back in June or July hey partnered with Nvidia... That is not something that happens in a day or weeks, that is a long process and that is why the game works better on Nvidia and ♥♥♥♥ed for everyone else so bare that in mind when playing or considering buying!\n\nSo the game is about survival, taming dinosaurs and living out trying to survive and harvest items to build. There is no terraforming in this game, only destroying rocks, trees etc, everything above ground!\nAlso the game is designed for Nvidia and you can tell that with AMD cards.... Serious lag and under-performance while I write this article.... I am able to play all my games I own on max graphics but this game struggles even at medium. For that is loses a massive chunk of respect for me not making it fair like AMD do.\n\nThe audio: It is simple hack slash, swing, swoop, dinosaur noises, birds tweeting etc and the ocean sounds cool.  What do you expect from a survival game on a tropical island?\n\nThe controls: These are still being worked on and upgraded because only recent strafe was introduced,  it it is massively better now than then and the character handles extremely well with the redefined controls now... Positive.\n\nThe graphics: Well, as you can see from photos they are most likely ultra which are Titan graphics or more.... The game literally runs better on nvidia than AMD and the game right now as it speaks only supports single graphics cards, and is seriously unoptimised, seriously no matter the graphics setting it will lag, but then the game is early access and that is too be expected but not this bad.  If you can get above medium then awesome because you will enjoy the game just on the visuals.\n\nThe game as it stands:\n\nIf you take out the insane lag, the unoptimised, the stupid errors and bugs in the game, the insanely long loading times. And whatever else I missed, you have a solid core base building survival game with dino taming.... The developers are probably the first I have seen releasing patches every single day and listening to what the community has to say, seriously every day patches and trying to fix the game, just my only issue is the nvidia thing and that is it.\nThe game has some amazing features and the fact it has no terreforming is a little off putting because it would be nice to build under ground.  You can tame almost every dinosaur in the game from a megladon to a dodo... Pretty cool, you can build some amazing bases while running around getting supplies and being chased from raptors or whatever else wants to eat you, you can name and ride dinosaurs... The game really is a lot of fun, and when you get friends playing the game and you all join a tribe, then the became shines even more.\n\nIf you love survival, base building then this is the game for you and then add on top of the ability to completely knock down emigre forests and clear entire area (it does reload when you leave the area and back in) and taming dinosaurs, then this is the game for you even more.\n\nWould I recommend?\n\nYes and no, sadly there is no option to select this.\n\nYes, because of all the above.\nNo, because of nvidia only, serious unoptimised and no terreforming!\n\nOn that note I will just vote yes!","July 15, 2015","true","125.1"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","18","29","4","3"

Don't let the (currently) Mixed rating fool you. The game is much better than that. My only warning is that if you are the kind of person that NEEDS 60FPS on every game you play, you may want to wait a week or two to let them work on the optimizations a bit more. They've stated over and over that getting the game optimized is one of their main focuses of the EA shtick. So, this being said, my personal thoughts:\n\nPROS:\nDinosaurs everywhere set on a gorgeous island.\nExtreme level of body slider customization allowing you to make your preferred ideal survivor.\nYou can punch Raptors in the face.\n\nCONS:\nAfore-mentioned dinosaurs everywhere set on a gorgeous island will likely result in you face down in the dirt...again.\nEqually afore-mentioned bodysliders result in some true horrors shambling about most servers. I'll admit, I'm guilty of my share of top heavy ape people.\nAfter punching a raptor in the face it will likely gouge your eyes out and eat your liver after selling your kidneys on the black market. They also tend to run faster than you...\n***Also, crafting recipies are locked behind a levelling system so there IS bit of a grinding element to it. Fortunately, pretty much everything you do gives xp. On top of that, there will be a way to transferr your levelled characters across official servers or some such plottery. Details are forthcoming on the boards I hear.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nWIth the devs hammering home the fact they're focusing on making the game run smoother for everyone, as well as future workshop support for MODS, I can't recommend this game enough for people who either want more than other survival games offer, or just want to kick dodos and ride a Pteradon throwing poop at a T-Rex as you fly overhead.\n\nJust remember: EARLY ACCESS means there's still work to be done.

With new content coming out weekly the devs should pat the selves on the back.\n\nSo what is this game, Imagine waking up on an unkown island on the beach. No clothes on. No food. No where safe from the multitude of beasts you will encounter.  The first thing you need to do is to collect resources to make your tools, a campfire and  clothes. without clothes you are more susceptible to the elements and attacks. once this is all done  you will need to create a shelter and then you must upgrade this shelter or move on and create a better shelter, as most usually do. then you can try establishing contact with the others on your server to join a tribe. once within the saftey of the tribe it is easier to create your base as people pool resources and knowledge. taming dinos to go hunting and farming to upgrade your base and your equipment and wepons. this is the absolute genius of this concept it is survival 101.\n\nThere are a few types of severs you can jointhe main ones been  PvP or PvE.\nPvE is for the guys who prefer not to fight other players. Im not saying they are cowards or anything just not my cup of tea, or thats what i use to think but im getting on to that.\nPvP this is for the purists the people who want a better experiance feeling a real challange against other players. saying that pvp is broke in this game it is a crying shame that the devs have allowed this to happen.\n\nHere is the gripe with PvP with this game. Imaging creating a base, working tirelessly for hours upon hours gathering resources, training dinos ,  making equipment. i am talking aboout days of work, your base is the strongest it could be. you go to sleep and the next day to your despair everything you worked for and i mean everything is gone and raided somone has come in while you were not log in killed your dinos took all your resources and destroyed  your spawn points, and in some cases decimated the entire base. thats 5 days of your hard work gone its frustrating and many people quite playing after that. this is how the game is annoying gamers. this is not PvP its really PvThePersonWhoIsLoggedOff.\n\nSo here are some solutions -allow a tribe to make 1 single sturcture impenatrable no bigger than 15 cubic build units.\nmake birds die on 3 hits from a person who its carring in its claws .\nother suggestions i would make\ndo not allow structures to be built with in caves as it stops the progress of other players.\nintroduction of the skinning knife and hammer.\nnew resource of bone from animals to in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥e a new teir of tools and basic wepons\nnew resource of wool or fur from mammals to add new tier to cloth.\nintroduction of crytaline metal for structure and equipment.\nablity to make leather with hide and oil.\nintrodution of back packs with diffrent levels to carry a set number of slots for tools and resources.\nupgrade spots on dino saddles and clothing  ie more storage/ more armor\nglass window to be made from crystal and stone.\nwork stations upgradeable and degradable as they are been used.\n\nAll and all this game is great but i dont think ill be playing it for a while, as been raided and losing 5 days work has left this gamer with a bad taste in his mouth.","July 7, 2015","true","089.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

I gave him a wide berth and made my way down the beach.\n\nManaged to craft a some tools before I was killed by a dillo. Round 2 - after finding a nice location and awaiting some friends finding me I did some harvesting, crafted some primitive tools and created a rudimentary shack before being murdered not by a dino but 2 dudes wearing akubra hats and armed with axes. They broke my wall down and hatcheted me to death!\n\nRound 3 I found myself trying to make my way to a lat and long given to me by a freind who, in his efforts to find me had linked up with and joined the Dothraki tribe. Needless to say I did not make it before being eaten by a raptor.\n\nI went into this game after reading alot of reviews and comments about issues not expecting a huge deal on its first day. While I know others did have issues, I found gameplay performance to be smooth and the graphics are very nice (if not heavy on your card). Despite the odd gfx glitch or lag spike, my experience was fine, and I found myself drawn into this world completly much like how Rust did when it first came out.\n\nThe Inventory and build system still need work and is a bit clunky plus many of us still have no idea how to properly tame a dino, the process seems rather mysterious, so that is my mission tonight in my next binge on Ark.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andysharman/recommended/346110/","andysharman","AndySharman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andysharman/","111 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo as you can see from my playtime, I've played a LOT of ARK: Survival Evolved. Considering this is early access and just the beginning of it, too, the developers have done and continue to do an excellent job producing an excellent game. With almost daily updates and new things to build/do in almost all those updates, this game is a prime example of how Early Access should be handled.\n\nAs of writing this review, there are still several issues which should be addressed. On the official PVP servers, the taming times take far too long. The AI on the dinosaurs is also rubbish and they basically struggle to defend themselves from players. What this means is that your T-Rex which takes several real life hours to tame is basically going to last you about 2 days, maybe 3 on average before some griefer comes along and wipes out your collection. This makes taming a waste of time.\n\nSome guy came to my base, wiped my Trike and Scorpion in less than 10 seconds with his T-Rex. I followed him, waited until he got off his T-Rex, aggroed it and jumped off a cliff, to which the T-Rex followed me and drowned. It was level 50+ too. A complete waste of that players time.\n\nThe best way to Survive on PVP servers is to group up with a lot of people who are well geared in good bases and usually have many people online at once. The problem is that many tribes don't recruit because players are known to sabotage tribes they've joined or tribes don't want to risk someone causing their collected dinosaurs to die, lose gear etc. Which is understandable.\n\nBasically, don't PVP in this game. Not yet. It's incredibly imbalanced and it takes far to long to accumulate any sort of viable defence, which can then easily be wiped out by better players. If this isn't an issue for you, though, and you don't mind wasting hours taming dinosaurs and building bases only for them to be wiped out while you sleep/work/do something other than play ARK, then you'll enjoy it.\n\nPVE wise, the game is great. But there's also that issue of "... now what?" once you've built a strong base and collected an array of dinosaurs, because there's nothing to be fearful of PVE wise and there's nothing to do with your dinosaurs once you've built your base. I suspect this is also why PVP is so brutal, because there's not much to do once you've got a metal base and guns, so just go raid the bases of those who aren't at your level yet.\n\nOverall, the game is good, I recommend it and has a ton of potential both now and in the future. If they can some how balance PVP or offer more to do in PVE mode, then the game will go up in quality.","July 9, 2015","true","777.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","2"

Tried like everyone else to get a Steam code. The event was pretty difficult in that sens, since you had to keep that code for 4 hours before it was revealed to you. Other players could steal it from you anytime.\n\nAnd here comes the first problem of one of the game modes - PvP: high level players rule the landscape, kill everything that moves and steal everything from you. You don't stand a chance. Advancing in levels is difficult and takes a loooooot of game hours.\n\nBut the biggest problem is the lack of optimisation. Don't trust the system requirements listed on the store page. Chances are with that configuration that the game won't even start. At the time of writing, you need a hell of a gaming PC to event get medium settings without lag. My configuration:\n\nAsus ROG G75-VW gaming laptop\nProcessor i7 @ 2,3Ghz\nVideo: nVidia Geforce GTX 670M 3GB\nRAM: 12GB\n\nHad a hard time playing with the constant stuttering on medium settings (which look pretty ugly). High settings is unplayable.\n\nSo, optimisation is non-existent. If you don't have a monster gameing PC, don't bother playing this game at it's curretn state.\n\nThen there is a total lack of balance regarding gameplay. Food and water drop like crazy and you basically have to farm for resources the whole time. You have to tape down the use key and just move along the landscape to get by. Goat Simulator's Goat Z DLC was making fun of Survival games by having to eat every 10min. Now I know why...\nFor new players it is really difficult to advance, since every higher level player can kill you in a blink of an eye. The numerous creatures on the map will do that too, and you can't do anything about it. Running is not an option since everything will outrun you. Armor and weapons are not an option since you must advance in levels to learn to craft them. So you die and that's it. A couple of hours of gameplay thrown out the window and in vain. Not much fun in that,\n\nIn conclusion, until the game gets a serious optimisation fix and a total rebalance of it's gameplay, I would not advise anyone to buy it. It is a great idea and will surely become much more interesting in the future, but at it's current state, there was no fun in playing it, at least not for me.","September 6, 2015","false","4.3"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","0"

I know their are probabaly a ton of complaints on this and I'm won of them because seriously the lag is just ridiculous! You need to optimize your game better especially for players who have lower end computers! Until this issue is fixed I wouldn't recommend this game because its not worth to  buy it only to have it be unable to play thanks to lag.","January 7","false","2.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The game is not optimized yet so no need to tell you it looks awful unless you have a 1000$ video card. I hit 60fps on any game at max settings but on this one I manage to reach a borderline playable 30fps at medium settings... In the very little time I spent playing I encountered some pretty big graphics bugs and also gameplay bugs where I had to restart the game, like not getting loot when hitting a tree or just being unable to hit anything. There is also the part where you get killed 20 times literaly while spawning, or the part where you try to get your items back from where you got killed but the stupid dinosaur that killed you is still standing right on it.\n\nSo yeah, will definitely take time to enjoy and explore this game when it's bug free and optimized.","March 24","false","272.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

In most cases where there have been negative recommendations it's usually been due to 'personal feelings' guiding the typist.  Although I do not hold any official title in the gaming world of critique, I do believe that the facts should be presented as they are, not as some would like to paint them after a 'Rage-Quit' moment.\n\n***\n\nTo begin with, Ark: Survival Evolved is an EA(Early Access)game.  I'm well aware that for some this is an instant 'No-Go' decision and seeing as certain developers here on Steam have no problem allowing their tripe to continue to exist and therefore bilk unfair amounts of coin from the community, it's no wonder why this opinion currently exists.  However, despite some of the less than stellar entries tagged with the 'EA' moniker, I can truthfully say that this game has gone well beyond what many have grown accustomed to when buying into an 'EA' game as far as the current development speed and patches/hotfixes currently being displayed.\n\nWithin the first few weeks Ark was released on Steam those of us who took the chance and dove in were inundated with update patches on a schedule unheard of when dealing with the Early Access model.  Now I know from personal experience that a strong showing from a development team right out the gate does not a great game make, but the facts are easy enough to view for all that care to take 5 minutes out of their day.\n\nThis team seems to have waited a bit longer than others before releasing their 'EA' game and in so doing had a ton of content ready to greenlite out the chute from day 1.  The current ingame roster of creatures has easily doubled if not tripled from the original cast we had to work with as well as new tech trees adding logical upgrade paths and fan favorite suggestions to the Engram pool.  Couple that with their ever-present team committed to keeping the gaming community up to date with possible changes/additions, this particular instance may very well be the first time a Dev-Team got 'Early Access' right.\n\nNow, have there been issues with players unable to get into the game?  Yes.  Did the developers take proper steps in creating patches/hotfixes to alleviate these issues?  Yes.  In fact, I was unable to play the game when it initially launched due to my apparent 'potato-system'.  Within a few weeks, though, there were new options the Dev team had included that allowed players like myself to use when starting up the game such as "Low Memory: 4Gb", "Low Memory: No Sound" etc.\n\nAt one point there was even a real life reward being handed out by the Dev-Team to those of us that could prove a certain Selachimorpha was still able to be beached even after they hotfixed the issue out.  How many developers do you know are willing to do this?\n\nThe facts are available for anyone willing to look for them.  Since releasing back in June of 2015 there have been 132 patches/hotfixes to this game.  Those that bought into this game have been able to freely communicate with the Dev-Team Community reps and in doing so have seen their suggestions make it into the game.\n\nThe Long & Short of things is this: Simply put, "Ark: Survival Evolved" has risen past many if not all other 'EA' games currently available on Steam.  The Dev-Team has clearly demonstrated their passion towards the Survival genre as well as the Dino-love we all share from childhood.  The fact that they're able to join the 2 in a seamless union of awe inspiring moments such as the first time you see a Brontosaurus thundering across the land to the chilling terror of spotting a T-Rex sprinting out of the jungle towards you makes this game a definite top choice for those looking for a Dino-Survival game worth whiling away the hours online.\n\nWith all that said, it's one thing to be upset because you were griefed in some way while playing Ark, or chose to purchase an 'EA' game that you knew your Pc couldn't handle on Medium settings let alone Extreme.  As unfortunate as those issues are, these particular situations fall on you and shouldn't be held against the game in a negative manner.  Typing out a 'Thumbs Down' feedback here because of how some players treated you or because you had to struggle to get your Dorito-chipset desktop with its Etcha-Sketch display to run an unoptimized version of the game reaks of childish ignorance.  "Ark: Survival Evolved" is a game that's able to stand atop a steadfast platform of Dedication from the Dev-Team and Commitment to it's Community of supporters.  Let the facts speak for themselves when deciding on whether or not you want to purchase this game, not the few irate gamers that allow their myopic viewpoints to dictate their final judgement.\n\n-Tyger","March 18","true","415.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I joined some of my friends that had played before and we hit the ground running. We built an awesome base, tamed some dinos, worked and worked. Then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with the rockets showed up. Turns out they had been playing since launch and their past time was messing with new players because they have nothing better to do. They played with their food for a while, the food being my tribe. Eventually they just outright took everything we had and laughed.\nMy issue with this game is how fast you can lose things. I am 100% about a pvp sandbox survival game. I played eve for a good while. I like that knowing you can lose your work. It means it has value. However, this game you lose it way to quickly. You can build for days on end, then when you go to bed and come home from work the next day, its all gone.\n\nThe devs need to take a page out of Eve's book. In eve structures take a number of attacks to be destroyed. The game has reinforcement timers. When a structure's hp is brought to a certain threshhold it becomes immune for a day. During that time the corp that controls it can go repair it. A structure has to be brought into reinforcement multiple times before it is destroyed completely.\n\nHaving something like that would give a tribe a fighting chance against ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wait for you to log off to blow up your base and kill the dinos that take 2 hours to tame with the kibble you spent a week working for.\n\nThe game is still unfinished and perhaps the devs will invest in this. At any rate if you're looking to buy this game right now, don't.","March 25","false","115.8"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/346110/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo here i am again with yet another review :steamhappy:\n\nThis game i have had my eye on for some time before i finally could no longer resist and had to buy this for myself. Ironically the game was available with 17% off for the whole time i had my eye on it and i ended up buying it at full price :P\n\nSo around 5 weeks ago there was a free weekend or something for this game, so i decided to jump on singleplayer and see if it is all its hyped up to be. Upon waking up naked on the beach it was immediatly obvious my graphics cards were not able to run the game smoothly at the maximum settings that my computer automatically sets so i turned all the graphics down to a minimum and started to explore. First thing i see is a Dodo on the beach so what do i do? I punch it in the face until it falls unconcious of course and it has a taming bar?? I'm like 'how do i tame it??'. Long story short i tame him and call him Bobo and eventually figure out how to make some basic tools and build a nice little thatch hut by the ocean with a campfire. Myself and Bobo the Dodo were then both eaten by a Raptor that literally made me jump out of my skin :P\n\nI then went onto buy the game at full price and jumped straight onto a Public/Private server that is mainly used for a Twitch Livestreamer that i watch and had to start from scratch and i have to say that despite the fact that most players on the server are already established there i have had such a huge amount of fun playing Ark that i literally haven't touched another game since buying it. I think in the first 3 weeks i had managed to put in over 200 hours into the game primarily on the server that i play on, this is ontop of working upto 50 hours per week at my workplace which is just incredible. The only other games that have captured my attention this much ever in my entire life are World of Warcraft and Diablo 2 - both very different games but games that i may have put thousands of hours into.\n\nAs the game is in Alpha stages it is continuously changing so as of writing this review the game as you buy it consists of only one map that you can play on either singleplayer or on a server whether it be an Official Ark server or an Unofficial server. As i have stated above i personally so far have put in over 250 hours primarily into an Unofficial server and i could see myself very easily just on that server for thousands of hours to come.\n\nHowever, this game does also have Steam Workshop content which allows for various mods to be downloaded such as different tools or building structures. There is currently one particular Workshop mod that has been made by one of the Developers that is known as a Total Conversion mod - meaning that it converts the game completely into a new mode. This Total Conversion mod is called 'Survival of the Fittest', and basically this mode is a Hunger Games style game mode where upto 100 players are dropped into a modified version of the standard Ark map. They start by dropping around a central circle with various loot in the centre such as spears, hatchets, pickaxes, bows, arrows, cooked meat and many other items and the last man standing or the last Tribe standing wins the game.\n\nThere are a whole tonne of changes in this game mode in order to balance it and speed up the levelling and make the whole game fast paced. On top of the standard changes to the game, there are various modifiyers that activate every 15 minutes that will either help you to survive for longer or hinder your survival. Such modifyers can be Mega Cold/Heat which are self explanatory and The Beast Within which makes all non aggressive Herbivores aggressive and all Carnivores  much more aggressive, and an example of a beneficial modifyer that can occur is Double Taming, which will of course allow you to tame any Dinosaur at double the speed.\n\nSo Survival of the Fittest is a huge separate game mode that i can see myself also putting in thousands of potential hours  despite this being a Workshop mod, i do hope when this game is finally released for those on console that this game mode is included in the game because it really is well made and watching some streamers playing this mode i have quite frequently been at the edge of my seat its so gripping and immersive with such tense moments. Also did i mention you can tame and fly a fire-breathing Dragon in this game mode??\n\nAll in all this review is probably already too long but i can't stress enough just how immersive this game is and its only in Alpha stages! There have often been multiple updates daily for various content or fixes and if you haven't already, you just need to buy this game.\n","September 30, 2015","true","434.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisgoeshere/recommended/346110/","thisgoeshere","Swiggity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisgoeshere/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo begin with, this is not "Rust with dinos."\nWith a new early access survival simulator hitting the steam marketplace every week people are beginning to become skeptical as they all promise something that always falls short, the difference with ARK is that it exceeds what it promises and continues to do so.\n\nCurrently, the game is stuffed to the brim with content, I'm talking hundreds of hours of content, a lot of it I have just begun to do and I've got 80+ hours into the game. The Devs spent 9 months developing the game prior to releasing onto Steam early access, the end goal of the devs is to launch on console which means this game will NOT be abandoned unlike most early access survival simulators, while I will admit the optimization is sort of lacking it's being fixed and the game runs better with every large patch put out.\n\nHow much content can a game with dinosaurs have in it? A lot, an absolute astounding amount and new mechanics, features, and general gameplay improvements are added weekly, if not earlier which is something I find impressive as it shows just how much the devs care about the game and the community. Currently there are 65 player levels, each of which offers you the chance to improve one of the 11 of your characters stats. Whether you want to tame a spinosaurus or throw massive piles of poop at your friends, both are features in the game.\n\nSo what is there to do exactly? ARK currently houses a collection of things for the players to do, and things always have to be done to ensure survival for both you and your dinosaurs, there are 2 means of collecting food either you gather berries or you cook meat, both of which spoil overtime so food is something you've always got to keep an eye on but the player can craft a preserving bin to keep the food fresh for longer at the lower levels and eventually they are able to craft a refridgerator. Water can be retained at the lower levels by crafting a water skin, which as it is merely a bag of leather it leaks the water held in it over time but as you progress you can make a water jar that does not leak. ARK features a living ecosystem, a dynamic weather system that has heat waves and cold waves, and the vegetation grows back over time so resources are plentiful.\n\nLastly, the dinos. Taming them is a bit of a challange as it does take a good deal of time to gather the resources and actually tame whatever dinosaur you're looking to tame. Every dinosaur has its own level system as the player does, so when you tame one dinosaur you have another 34 levels of stats to assign for that particular dinosaur meaning theres practically an endless amount of things to do. Apart from the leveling scale, every dinosaur takes a differnt amount of tranquilizer to put it to sleep some take a mere 5 tranquilizer arrows while others take 30+, the amount of tranquilzer to keep it asleep for the duration of the tame differs from each dinosaur aswell. The process is fairly simple once you get the hang of it, like everything else it takes time. Most of the dinosaurs are able to have a saddle crafted for them and are able to be rode around the game world, most of them serve a specific purpose such as gathering wood more efficiently or berries faster.\n\nARK didn't stay in the top 3 of the top sellers list during the entire summer sale out of pure luck, ARK is astounding and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a new survival game to get lost in.","June 21, 2015","true","635.0"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","21","35","2","0"

Creativity within the game is incredible with so many creatures/animals to tame\n2. So many upgrades and objectives to complete you are always on the roll!\n3. You can choose to play either by your self (Where you can change the settings e.g. taming time) or you can play online with your friends and create awesome clans/factions!\n4. You can choose between PVE and PVP servers\n\n# Bad things #\n1. Many graphical errors/crashes, you need a good PC to run this game unfortunately\n2. A MASSIVE time waster, meaning you need a LOT of time to do anything in this game as taming certain dinosaurs can take up to 24 hours to complete\n3. Although this game is still going through updates/changes, there are still MAJOR glitches/bugs within the game\n4. Online PVP or even PVE servers have one massive division between big clans and smaller clans, once a big clan has setup in a server, its very hard for smaller, newer clans to start building up.\n\nOverall, this game does have amazing features and great potential, the disadvantages (bad things) are extremely bad and stop the player from playing sadly, this is why i will NOT recommend this game until future updates fix these unfortunate bugs/features.\n\nThats my review for ARK: Survival Evolved, i would like to point out that there are still big updates coming in the future which will hopefully fix the gitches/bugs and hopefully optimise the game.

I saw Twitch videos of this game and thought, this looks like a game I imagined up. It has all the elements from the console games I loved with none of the drawbacks. Skyrim's open world, but not silly sidequests. The ability to build, but in a world worth building in.\n\nSo I gave the game a try and 2000 hours later, not only am I still playing the game but I have my own server with over a hundred members also enjoying this game. There is so much the game needs to work on but they're working on it. The drawbacks are not greater than the perks. The ability to create this "home" and community had been an incredible experience.\n\nThe game is not perfect but the hard work that's being put into it makes it feel like a labor of love and it's noticeable. If you're looking for a game that makes you feel as though you're there (don't lie and say the death of a loved dino doesn't hurt!!) then this is for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a primitive server with a community experience to give this wonderful game a try on, check out my profile and join my server.

But I would not recommend it in its current state, UNLESS you have a way to play on a private server and even then there's just too many issues.\n\nCons:\n- The world is unbalanced, the dinos, the loot, the taming is not very proportionate to one another. (Ever try farming hide from a dilophosaurus vs. a dodo or a compy?)\n- The world is empty; particularly single player could have benefited from some human NPCs (I realize it's meant to be played online with others but even the official servers wouldn't be worse for wear).\n- The game could use some backstory or just story in general.\n- The official servers are not properly policed leading to rampant hacking, 'noob-killing', Alpha Tribe 'bullyings' and other incidents which generally makes the game an unpleasant experience for many new-comers.\n- It's a freaking killer for most systems, and the graphics are just not good enough to justify it (they're not bad, just not high enough to make such demands), the island also isn't large enough. It seems every patch pushes the system further rather than improving the performance.\n- There are a LOT of glitches, bugs and technical annoyances, not least of which is the rubber banding (Oh GOD, the rubber banding! Make it stop, PLEASE!)\n\nPros:\n- The world is really interesting to explore.\n- The dinos (freaking love dinos, ever since 'Land Before Time', 'Dinotopia' (the books) and 'Jurassic Park', dinos FTW!)\n- The game is a mix of Dinotopia and Minecraft, which sounds weird but is AWESOME!\n- If you can get on a private server with some friends, the game is a ton of fun, when you band together to try and tame a Bronto or take on an Alpha.\n- The dinos' appearance; a lot of detail went into this and it's exciting to try and find a dino with a distinctive pattern to tame.\n\nIn conclusion: The game can be a lot of fun but right now it has WAY to many issues, WAY too little oversight and is just generally unpolished for something they wish to release in June.","March 16","false","61.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Building bases, taming dinos - all the fun you can imagine.\nThe last patch simply mutilated this game. Dinos are no longer worth having, there is no point in taming them and making sure you have the best possible dinos. Instead of community that on PvE servers were helpful and friendly devs are supporting newbie wannabie warlords from pvp servers. They moaned about dinos being op etc etc. So the devs decided to "balance the game". They did it in such a way that really good dinos were gathering less materials than axe and pickaxe... Thats it for me as per Ark.

This game is offering an immense amount of content for it's early release build, it's being updated weekly as we speek!\n\nFulfilling my childhood dream of being able to ride a dinosaur finally came to fruition. The first parasaur I successfully tamed (named Ducky ;) helped out a ton for starting fresh on the server. Unfortionatly she died by a carno when I logged on the next morning... was a bit heart broken.\n\nWorking alongside tribe members to overcome monumental tasks (such as preparing to raid a giant base filled with baddies) is thrilling when everyone does their part.\n\nHowever, the one big downside I'm not a fan of in this how people harass lower level players (kind of like high school bullies) and consistantly get away with it. Starting fresh in this game is rough. I would recommend seeking help from a tribe, as long as you're willing to contribute. This brings me to my next point...\n\nFrom a personal experiance of starting fresh on a normal official server recently, I felt like I didn't belong to the tribe I was in. They already had an incredible base, tons of dinos, tons of defenses, and so on. I could have helped out, but it's hard to find a place to belong when most people (including tribe members) frown upon low leveled players. Very disheartening.\n\nIf you can overcome the learning curve of this game and see it through to the high level content (and possibly get revenge on those that does harassment daily), you will be in for a huge treat.\n\nAs it stands right now, I would recommend this game to anyone that can run it.","September 4, 2015","true","553.7"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","16","26","3","0"

But since the releases of the patches and the team working hard on releasing optimization and tweaks on performance, I have no doubt in my mind this is by far the best dino game ever!!! The content they release on a weekly basis is amazing. There are so many things you can do and I never get bored. I'm always either gathering meat and berries for my dinos, upgrading my building or exploring. Dino taming is really awesome, I can now fulfill my dream as being a raptor tamer ;p\n\nFor a newbie this game should be very easy to figure out and eventually you'll be on your way to becoming dino master :p\nThere are tons of servers for everyone to play on official and unofficial. You will not be disappointed on spending your money on this game!!\n\nUPDATE 2/24/16\n\nTo give an update on the review I wrote previously. Ark is one of those games you keep coming back too. Whilst I don't play as much as I used too, I still really like this game. I even finished my computer build, which makes this game even perform better. This game obviously isn't made to perform at its best on low end laptops. But you can still manage to play in the mean time. Since completing my computer, I can say this is a whole brand new game to me and I really appreciate the hard work the devs put into the graphics!! :)\n\nI like that the devs put a hold on dino dossiers and decided to work on the backlog of creatures they still need to put in the game. The devs are amazing and really listen to what the community wants and thinks about there game. There is always being something posted and fixes for bugs come out almost immediately, which is better then most games out there.","July 12, 2015","true","538.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I am a huge fan of early access survival games such as Rust, 7 Days to Die, H1Z1, etc. and have many hours logged on these games, so I was interested in seeing how Ark stacked up against them.  After Beast of Prey kind of flopped (in my opinion), I was hoping a survival game with dinosaurs would come along that was interesting and worth playing.  Well I am not disappointed!  At first I had the same troubles as everyone else, could not log in, etc.  But once I entered the game I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of character customization available, that the other survival games that have been out much longer still lack.  The graphics are amazing, though it is difficult to get good FPS right now on anything too high (I'm sure they need to optimize the game still).  The world is amazing, with the dinosaurs as a significant threat, a leveling system and building similar to that of Rust.  I can see myself spending many hours on this game and look forward to seeing how it progresses over time!","June 4, 2015","true","220.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The pace is very good, and well implimented, the level cap is high enough to keep you striving for leveling without being too grindy, you can poop, which is amazing and it is about time we can defecate in a survival game, loooong over due, updates are frequent and address issues, communication (so far) is very good from the dev team and they have already had a Q&A stream.

I've been playing this game for a week now and i already can tell you these things:\n\nFirstly, the children should stop crying about FPS... This game is in alpha mode and whenever you are about to buy it, it gives you a warning about these problems. I admit that the FPS in this game is horrible for some people (my fps was 10 with epic settings) but after going searching on internet i came across some good tips and after i did them i got about 30 fps everywhere on the map (the settings are all low but i dont care about look)\n\nSecondly, I like this game becouse i can have progress and have a fun time playing with my friends. yes, on multiplayer you get killed every 20 minutes but i am not playing on officials or in servers with more than 20 players. This is a bit boring but its great for me becouse i can learn all the things of this game. I did not buy this game to murder people, instead i got it to explore a world full of dino's , get some house going on, hunting etc.\n\nThirdly, i can recommend you this game becouse i had so much fun this week playing it, it was only one week but my adventures were priceless. You come across Horde's of raptors, get munched by a Trex, get stomped by a Bronto. This all made me want to quit at first, but yeah... i learned not to die.\n\nI hope this review helped you, if it did not im sorry.","July 31, 2015","true","149.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I purchased this as a gift for my son in law and then bought copies for 2 more family members and myself. I am fallen in love with the game, I can't stop playing it.  I love the many facets of building, gathering, hunting, survival, planning, working together as a tribe (family).  I love the choice to respawn where you want on the Island or the idea of respawning at the same place if you so chose.\n\nI find that I am playing the game for 8 - 10 hours per day. I have only been playing for 2 weeks and I intend to continue as the game continues to present more and more challenges.  Considering it is my first game of this type I am amazed at how I am progressing.  Although there are things that I have to rely on my tribe to omplete as I gain experience I am able to complete the tasks as I develop.\n\nThere are some glitches yet.  The game will freeze occasionally, but this is expected as the game is in the development phase.  So if you are looking for a good time I recommend that you check ARK: Survival Evolved out.","March 9","true","650.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","1"

Jumped onto an Oceanic Server after giggling at the abominations of avatars you can create if you wish(but setting for a perfectly normal, well-chiseled male with blonde hair) and spawned on the South- Eastern region of the map.\n\nI learned you only want to punch trees long enough to make a stone pickaxe because it hurts. The more resource collecting I did, the hungrier and thirstier that I got. After 3 minutes of gathering basic resources I run into a pack of Dilos and die. I did respan close to where I started however so I got my stuff- and died to the pack again.\n\nNext respawn I did was same zone, different spot. I managed to get to a camp fire with other fellow Aussies- trying to survive on this island. They even gave me meat to stop me from dying next to their camp fire.\n\nI then decided to take my pick axe to a Stegosaurus at level 3 to try and get more meat. This game can be unforgiving at times, but its still awesome.\n\nWiser- my next respawn had me land near my original spot, I found my way back to the camp where I met the nice fellow who kept me alive- he abandoned the camp, so I set up my own camp a little further- provided food and shelter to other fellow survivors, watched them turn on each other over the 1 hatchet and 6 meat I gave to them both. Another player showed up after I killed the survivor and we started a tribe.\n\nIt is now nearly Thursday, our tribe is a good 11 people strong, we have 2 bases, I am building a third, and an out post in between. every night has brought in something new that has kept me pumping nearly 8 hours a day average since I have owned it.\n\nDespite the fact that I had to upgrade my GPU just to play this game above 15fps on anything above minimum settings(R9 270 to R9 290X) and the fact that dinosaurs occasionally float into heaven after you kill them, making it hard to get meat and hide I am loving my first survival game that has stirred the slumbering child within. Smashing bases with trikes and fending off Carnos with naught but a spear is extremely fun and tense.\n\nNot only would I recommend this game to everyone else- I ENCOURAGE them to buy the game and see how an early access game and development team SHOULD be- they patch frequently and are always communicating with us and responding to steam forums feedback and bug complaints","June 10, 2015","true","562.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","1"

There's nothing more thrilling than walking in the forest and running into a large dinosaur that can end you quickly.  The ocean in this game terrifies me (it's deep and full of stuff that can kill you).  The visual and audio when under water is really well done.  The crafting is awesome and unique.

They even gave me meat to stop me from dying next to their camp fire.\n\nI then decided to take my pick axe to a Stegosaurus at level 3 to try and get more meat. This game can be unforgiving at times, but its still awesome.\n\nWiser- my next respawn had me land near my original spot, I found my way back to the camp where I met the nice fellow who kept me alive- he abandoned the camp, so I set up my own camp a little further- provided food and shelter to other fellow survivors, watched them turn on each other over the 1 hatchet and 6 meat I gave to them both. Another player showed up after I killed the survivor and we started a tribe.\n\nIt is now nearly Thursday, our tribe is a good 11 people strong, we have 2 bases, I am building a third, and an out post in between. every night has brought in something new that has kept me pumping nearly 8 hours a day average since I have owned it.\n\nDespite the fact that I had to upgrade my GPU just to play this game above 15fps on anything above minimum settings(R9 270 to R9 290X) and the fact that dinosaurs occasionally float into heaven after you kill them, making it hard to get meat and hide I am loving my first survival game that has stirred the slumbering child within. Smashing bases with trikes and fending off Carnos with naught but a spear is extremely fun and tense.\n\nNot only would I recommend this game to everyone else- I ENCOURAGE them to buy the game and see how an early access game and development team SHOULD be- they patch frequently and are always communicating with us and responding to steam forums feedback and bug complaints","June 10, 2015","true","562.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","1"

Terrible optimisation! Eyes get painful after playing for at least half an hour.  Also terrible design which all your belongings will disappear after your death, like completely and you have to start afresh.  Built a ♥♥♥♥ing base, was gathering hides to make bed and died because of raptors invasion, ended spending hours to find the base and didnt get to find it due to painful eyes and decided to write this ♥♥♥♥ing review.  Hope the developer see this review pls and really put in effort and ♥♥♥♥ing make some improvement, ♥♥♥♥ing 12 pounds even when i got it during discount.  Overpriced with this kind of experience! Also, animals dont live at all ♥♥♥♥ing places, plan their habitat please.  Raptor in water, raptor at the beach, raptor in the forest, raptor outside my base, raptor like ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere ♥♥♥♥ing my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the damn piranha in the sea.  In addition, when you have such advanced technology implanted in your hand, please could you have smth better for the ♥♥♥♥ing map.  it is really difficult for us to get back to the base especially when we just ♥♥♥♥ing see raptors and piranhas like everywhere and dying is just so common.  Make these improvements and I think this game will be worth recommending if not i will be really ashamed of even mentioning a word about it, just got ♥♥♥♥ed by raptors, non stop.  PS: raptor is a tornado-like dinosaur which he just runs ♥♥♥♥ing around you, like a ♥♥♥♥ing moon and earth.  Please change that, that was ♥♥♥♥ed up and I couldnt bear to play this game for more than 2 hours due to painful eyes.\n\nIn summary, terrible character customisation, terrible optimisation, terrible UI, terrible planning of habitats (you cant have all different animals everywhere, you think thats a ♥♥♥♥ing zoo?), terrible map for player, terribly over-priced, terrbible experience.

Also the game is meant to be played on DX12 which isn't out yet.\n\n+The Gameplay is unique, you level up and make choices on which kind of technology you want to learn, you dont get forced into a certian playstyle, you can either build a huge base or go out as a team and explore dungeons... or raid other people's bases, or just hangout in the wilds and tame some dinos !\n\n- PvE servers are plagued by thatch houses left to rot for 18 days before you can destroy them... it really feels weird walking around the shore and only seing thatch houses everywhere.\n\n- PvP servers are meant for GROUPS of people who do not fear losing their belongings, so many people whining because they got robbed, please, it's the darn goal of a PvP server.\n\nThis game feels better than most of the recent AAA games that are coming out...\nIt's an EA and to me, it already is a very good game as it is.","June 21, 2015","true","241.2"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","18","30","3","0"

Not to mention the recent nerf on Hit point and damage. Making Farming Meat even harder...  Does the Developer understable that game is suppose to be fun and relax... No one like hard grinding game.

The devs update it frequently, too.\n\nThere's a lot to do in ARK. You can level up, build a big wooden base and venture out to stab Dodos with a spear for fun. You can do the same thing but on a PVP server and stab people in the face with a spear for fun. You can punch a Raptor in the face, knock it out, feed it narcoleptic drugs and then feed it a ton of meat to drug it and brainwash it into being tamed. You can then have it follow you around and fight things with you or even put a saddle on it and ride it.\n\nYou can absolutely mangle your character in the character creator, too. It's fun. I made a character that looked like Smough from Dark Souls (weird neck included) but with tiny little arms. You can also paint your house and dye your clothing bright purple or yellow if you want. Oh and you can develop a single-shot rifle from scratch and shoot people in the face from in your bright purple base.\nI think the only issue it really has is that it runs a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and needs a bunch more optimisation.

A simple man with simple Interests, simple dreams and simple pleasures.\n\nI am interested in dinosaurs and hitting things with other things.\nI dream of riding raptors into battle against other dinosaurs.\nRealizing my simple dreams pleases me.\nARK has done this for me.  ARK wins.\n\nNow I have to get a disclaimer out of the way.  I have never really been into "survival" games before and while I like the Idea of PvPvE I am opposed to how most of the PvP plays out in these kind of games, I'll talk about that a little later.  My perspective of (at this point ) 158 hours of game play is entirely on a private server with default server settings playing with a small group of my friends as one big tribe.\n\n\nARK is early access, but it is gorgeous for that.  At 6 weeks after it's release the Devs have been incredibly attentive and are rolling out patch after patch.  Performance issues are improving (admittedly still not up to most peoples standards but it takes time), Content is being added steadily, bugs are being squashed.  It's as impressive an Early access game as any I've seen at this stage.  If they can keep this pace and quality up this is going to turn into an amazing finished game and not just and amazing beta.  That said even right now if the optimization was a little bit better I'd consider the $30 price tag well worth the price even if they added nothing else.\n\nI love the atmosphere of the game, I love the feelings it evokes, I love that even reaching level 62 in my time in game so far I haven't explored but a fraction of the island and am still concerned for my safety any time i wander more than 5 minutes from my base.  The island can feel open an majestic then claustrophobic and menacing and, if you are like me, the ocean (full of giant sharks) is just nightmare fuel.  There is a pervading sense of dread that sinks in after the first time you are murdered by a raptor in the dark you didn't see coming and in your panic couldn't run or fight that helps with the immersion.  You huddle to light sources, you build fires everywhere, the darkness becomes your enemy as you are naked and alone, and even when you are well armed and armored being alone in the dark is more than enough to cause a jump every time you hear "stomp stomp stomp" but can see the source.  There is a long term learning curve that tells you as soon as you get cocky and consider yourself safe a Carno or T-Rex (or even a herd of sabertooth tigers) is just going to show up and eat you.  That is where to me the game shines, it's not that it never gets easier it's that something can always seem to go wrong if you get complacent and that's where I like my challenge.  I mean by it's mechanics and atmosphere tribe play doesn't just make things easier, you literally feel better having a second set of eyes around when doing anything.  Speaking of Tribe play...\n\nThe mechanics of the Game encourage cooperation in a way I really appreciate.  It is literally impossible for one player to unlock all of the Engrams (crafting recipes) available in the game.  You need at least one partner.  Division of labor is built into the game and that's not even taking into account that resource gathering for even the most basic of structures goes from prohibitive to reasonable with helping hands.  This is NOT minecraft where you can build wonders of the world single handedly with little trouble, this is a game where you really should cooperate with someone to build anything of note and progress and I really do like that.  The further fact that Food and Water concerns are ever present make the survival elements come to the fore, you are never going to be completely free to just collect wood and build stuff you must take care of yourself (and your pets) or you will die to the most voracious predators on the island, hunger and thirst).  To me that has made the challenge remain.  It tethers me to water sources, it makes me plane my expeditions around my food supply, it helps with my immersion.  In addition to biological needs, getting lost in the process of construction won't stop the local wildlife from snacking on you so even just having someone around to literally just keep watch is valuable and that kind of fundamental teamwork encouraged by core mechanics is something I appreciate. Taming Dinos has become my new Hobby, riding dinos, capturing them, scheming new ways to make taming easier.... this is where i have found my joy, my tribe currently had a herd of 84 tamed animals (17 Raptors alone) many captured primarily by me r with my assistance that speaks to my enjoyment of the concept, and that's just one way to lose countless hours of time.\n\nAs i said I am playing exclusively PvE at this point.  I have no interest in the way much PvP in this genre is played.  I see no reason to involve my self in something where for no other reason than spite once you've beaten someone you erase hundreds of hours of their work.  That's my opinion and I don't expect everyone to agree with that BUT I do know many do.  The upside is that you don't have to play PvP at all if you want and I think there is some promise in "limited" PvP pr PvP with "rules of war" that will allow everyone to stay friends after a major engagement.  I'm interested in seeing where it goes bu t I have not participated in PvP in ARK at this point.  I do think interaction between tribes could be interesting and i look forward to seeing how that shapes up on my server if and when it happens.\n\nNow lets talk about draw backs: Primarily it's Early access which means it's incomplete and runs not as well as it could.  that's the biggest thing.  You've got weird rag dolling, funky physics in places, clipping issues, some weird to flat out bad animal pathing, low frame rates at times and odd graphical artifacts can be immersion breaking.  But all of that is stuff that is presumably being worked on by the devs in there multiple a week patches.  I wish the process of taming was a bit more varied and challenging but then I have spent the vast majority of my time in ARK taming one creature or another so it may just be over familiarity, I just wish it was a little more interactive. I find that rolling out of camp with a pack of half a dozen animals makes you pretty unstoppable but i'm hoping stat balancing works that out a bit.   All in all i don't have a lot bad to say right now.\n\nBottom line i love this game.  In three weeks I've put up nearly 160 hours while working a full time job as well, you could say I'm pretty hooked.  I've done it all playing with friends in a PvE environment and I haven't even come close to running out of things I can or want to do in game.  The game is very very viable in a PvE environment, engaging, immersive and one can only imagine going to get better.  If you like dinosaurs, are interested at all in survival games, or both you should really try ARK.\n\nAnd if that didn't sell you try this:\n\nAt some point you will be able to arm your friends with assault rifles you made yourself, hop onto a raptor (that you tamed yourself), and ride it into battle on a dragon hunt.  If that isn't all kinds of awesome to you... well i can't help you.  :)","July 27, 2015","true","601.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

But honestly other than dinosaurs this game doesn't have much. And even the dinosaurs are painful becuase you juat sit around waiting for rhe dinos to tame. The building system is alright. Everything is tied to grind. Progression through levels feels uninspired and you barely notice it. Their talent system us called engrams and let's you make buildings armor weapons and various devices and things for utility. While this seems cool, in practice it just means you need to keep in reserve the points you need in order to build or make what you want later and don't waste points on frivolity. Some have prerequisites in order to make you feel like there is some sort of system but really it is just boring. And then they have blueprints anyway which can sometimes make better versions of stuff...at which point you feel like you've wasted engram points....\n\nTribal warfare only exists briefly...generally an order develops on the server and alliances and pvp becomes boring...no one wants to lose the lvl 100+ rex or giga in a raid for the most part and killing other players quickly turns you into a pariah since they report who killed you or what killed you...\n\nLastly...I have a nice computer. I can run max settings and have a greater than 20 fps. That being said, the game is buggy. Often I'll be running along and suddenly I'll be back 10 feet where I'd already been. Different settings do not stop this because I tried putting everything on low.\n\nIf you do decide to play just play on a pve server. Official pvp servers are only fun messing with your reiterates and even that has its ups and downs. Pvp is a nightmare that is more theatrical than American politics.\n\nI will say the modding is nice but that is an built in ability of the unreal tournament engine for the most part. Other than dinos I'd say this game lacks heart. They keep trying to make more and more content with uninspired gameplay mechanics.","January 5","false","179.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Although i do still get the occasional crash. You have to remember that this game only came out a couple of days ago and so far everytime i log onto steam the makers have launched another update... something i have rarely seen an early access publisher do.\n\nThe gaming experience is great again not optimized so it will probably run sub par on your computer even if you have a good rig however theres ways to get around it, i found reducing the ground clutter to help tremendously.

I even can understand the 'whatever's' dropping supplies that you can gather. Its a lot of fun at lower levels when dino's are scary and the world is harsh.\nTHEN:\nAlong comes mid levels. Welcome to another advanced tech shooter game.\nYou go instantly from preserving meat in a smoking bin to making firearms up to and including automatic weapons in your stone and coal smelter with a tiny little smith table. Electricity and gasoline to power your geni's..\nAt that point, if your not on a decent server.. welcome to RUST with Dino's.\n100% Good game if they left the advanced tech out.\nStill totally worth it, and a GREAT game if you play on a server without the interference of Grief or Trolls.\nSo for now, because of the advanced tech.. 90% in love with it.\nA plus also.. You can solo play and live just you vs the dino's.. or host your own...\nIf your rig can run it.. GET IT\n\nEDIT: Now 11/21/2015 I gave up on this at all now, except for solo play. Where you can mod the game out, and crank the difficulty to levels of real fun. Keeps you interested while alone. As the devs continued to add advanced tech, this game just slipped farther and farther away from any remote fun at all for me online. If you didnt start out early and get a good tribe built up, boasting all the latest in modern gear and all the must have dino's your pretty much screwed starting out now. For me, it really slipped to just another impossible stretch of imagination for the sake of killing everyone. Which to be honest, would have been great fun, minus the advanced tech. If it could had stayed cavemen maybe getting up to muskets tops, awsome.. As in now, just another pure kill em all with total war chaos boasting machine guns and it all.... with dino's on the side.  Solo is still a ton of fun, I use a zero advance tech mod, and recently found one that adds in NPC humans with no advanced tech also. So now for me, its cavemen surviving other cavemen and dino's.. minus machine guns and weapons of mass destruction crafted with pixie dust and bubblegum in a stone fireplace.","July 1, 2015","true","210.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

But when you manage, you get the coolest companions! Both big AND small:D\n\n-had some mayor login-isseus, but most seem to be fixed now\n-Doesnt run too smooth on 4mb and lower machines. if your pc is crap, dont get this(should be obvious tho)\n\nAfter 200+ hours ingame i can add the following:\n\nI used to play 5 different games, now all i play is ark. its not out of nececity, but out of sheer enjoyment! i keep finding new projects to play with, im absolutely in love with the basebuilding, and im currently on a great server with everyone being a decent pvp community. no grief/base-leveling, or dino-killing during raids, and alot of fun rp-ish comms with other tribes in between, its hella fun. (if you feel you want to join this sort of community, add me to steam and ask about it;p)\n\nOut of all the hundreds of survival games i simply find this one to be most complete in what i want from it. I still need to make sure i eat and drink at max lvl, but it becomes easy to manage it, and after 200 hours ingame, there is still pve content that i want/need to do. The devs are really on top of updates and new content, patching every day still, AND adding new content every week!\n\nmy conclusion: Play it. They added loads of options for low-gear pc's, and even on low graphix(as im forced to play so, since my pc isnt the best) its a beautifull world. well-balanced, decent community, and loads of content!","June 9, 2015","true","463.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Although i do still get the occasional crash. You have to remember that this game only came out a couple of days ago and so far everytime i log onto steam the makers have launched another update... something i have rarely seen an early access publisher do.\n\nThe gaming experience is great again not optimized so it will probably run sub par on your computer even if you have a good rig however theres ways to get around it, i found reducing the ground clutter to help tremendously.

Its just a thing that goes on. If you don't like PVP go on a PVE server. Yes there are some bugs here and there but i have not seen any at all.

Anyway if you were a fan of The Stomping Land and that let you down, this will pick you back up.

The reason for a negative is the lie that this game is. Is it an alpha. They may say so but its not. Its a buggy full release. The problem is the game breaking bugs that were poorly/not supported.\n\nSo much stuff in this game is terribly buggy, yet on two seperate claims I was stonewalled. You spend 10-20 hours training a few dinos only for a raptor to spawn inside your building and eat them all while you are offline. Put a ticket in and the guy strings you along. "Are you sure it did not attack through the walls". Read that again. He was using one glitch to defend against refunding me against another glitch. WALLS THAT CAN BE ATTACKED THROUGH BECAUSE THIS GAMES GLITCHY IS NOT A REASON TO NOT HELP A GUY SCREWED BY ANOTHER GLITCH.\n\nDon't worry though they will constantly keep putting in new dinos and stuff to keep you busy. Clearly because us suckers have already paid so why bother fixing stuff.\n\nThe thing that makes me sooo anrgy with this game is it is sooo good when it works, but to much is lost, duue to the game difficulty fair enough, but to fails in the game programming.\n\nI mean seriously. After you spend 9 hours straight training a 120 bronto (if you don't kibble) do you really want to find it get stuck on a rock and dissappear.\n\nAgain this game is confused on what it is. If it is an alpha release then why not just help a person out of something glitches. Why defend as if its a full release.\n\nHence the do not buy.

Unreal egnine really makes the graphics pop, the water is beautiful, the GUI is impressive, everything is minimalistic and unintruding. The graphics and everything related to it, I mean this game just has it down to a perfection. It's incredibly difficult to believe the game is still in early access.

I stutter with the lowest graphics and memory settings, also the highest and everything inbetween. If I can't play this game, neither the hell can you.\n\nThere's nothing about this game that I don't love in terms of gameplay. The crafting is simple, new, and a rather quick then slow progression all of which can advance yourself to weapons, clothes and all for you or your tribe. Building and structures are impressive, simple designs but ones that look and rather feel real and beg to be touched. The dinosaur AI are impressive and annoying. Whether it be from watching a Rex hunt down another dinosaur or Dilos attacking you...There's always an interesting sight to behold as well to annoy you. Taming could be better, but once you're airborne you just never want to look back.\n\nI can honestly say if it wasn't for the horrible unoptimized gameplay, I would not have gotten a refund. Yes that's how bad it is, I actually got a refund and yet praise this game.

This game is beautiful, even on medium settings (you'll likely have to use medium if your GPU isn't up to snuff). There are performance issues but they are being worked on.\n\nThere's tons to do and the dinosaurs, for the most part are convincing enough. Best tail animations ever!\n\nThe world feels alive with the day/night system, weather and beautiful exotic setting thanks to Unreal Engine 4. You can form a tribe and invite your buddies, craft all sorts of weird and wonderful items, build structures, weapons and eventually, manage your own epic fortress. Best of all, you can subdue and tame the larger dinosaurs and mount them or utilise the bigger, non mountable dinos as muels for your ever expanding inventory. We haven't managed this yet but we're more than willing to persevere. I live to see the day when i'm magestically soaring across the horizon aboard my Pterodactyl. :)\n\nThe devs seem really keen on community feedback and are very active on the forums, interacting with their customers as well as supporting and providing regular content and game fixes. The game has received at least 4 sizeable updates already and it's only been out a few days (3 updates in 1 day is quite an achievement).\n\nIf you like survival type MMO's and you like dinosaurs then you could a hell of a lot worse than this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fcol/recommended/346110/","fcol","fcol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fcol/","959 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary: Can't say I'm impressed. Game looks pretty decent, wows with dinosaur riding, and other niceness, but all depends on you being able to get there. Started a game on a PvP server and found it incredibly difficult to get started - something that seems to be by design, or lack thereof. It didn't improve with moving to PvE servers.\n\n---\n\nJoined a PvP server. There's no real tutorial for noobs - which is fine - but the curve is quite steep if you spawn in the wrong part of the map. If you're not killed by a dino you're shuffled off the mortal coil by a bored high-level player. Again, this would be fine if you didn't have to start entirely from scratch every time you die. I could just suck at the game (and I probably do) but the mechanics seem to be very heavily skewed towards higher-level characters, or certainly those who bought the game closer to its EA debut. At this point I thought I'd switch to a PvE server, to at least try and remove one of the harbingers of a swift demise.\n\nYet another issue - suppose you decide you don't like a server - an opinion which might take a little time to form as your initial impressions will largely be the same on most servers: die a lot trying to stave off starvation and get on the "real" tech ladder. You decide you don't like it after a few hours, and want to switch to a friendlier server - except your character is locked to the server, and I have found no transfer function from server to server - even like-to-like. Bit of a dampener.\n\nSO, I transferred to a few PvE servers. The story was similar on all the ones I tried, but one in particular stuck with me: I spawned on a beach, as per usual, and started trying to scratch my way up the miserable and depressing end of the tech chain. When it came to place my first item (a camp fire to cook with), it turned out I was forbidden from placing it on any place across the entire map.\n\nI asked on the chat what the deal was (someone was kind enough to reply between shouts of "I NEEEEEEED NARCOS"), and apparently because the map had been peppered with structures  by other players to prevent such a thing, you're not allowed to place items within x distance of another player placed structure.\n\nSo let's phrase that slightly differently. You're allowed to join a server, but as long as you understand that you will be doomed to roam around like a tool in your cave-boxers, because those who came before (and not the cool kind from AC) have locked down all but the high-level areas of the map. So instead of high-level players killing me before I can make progress, any old player who's been there longer has prevented me (and you, if you buy this) from making progress in a much more insidious way.\n\nI'm sure I'm probably coming across as a butt-hurt noob, and maybe I am, but I then thought "no, there'll be provision for me, somewhere - surely the devs plan for the fact that their user base will grow?" So, a quick google turned up numerous threads about noob-friendly servers. Apparently that's just not a thing. More than half the posts were more about staying away from particular servers, both official and unofficial. So while I suck at the game, and the knee-jerk reaction is to tell me to git gud, there's a learning curve on every game - and I feel like the learning curve here is largely determined by the server you choose.\n\nThere's no real provision for new players, and while a lot of people in the reviews below (above?) seem to be complaining, probably quite rightly, about hackers and general unsportsmanlike behaviour, I think my biggest gripe is something more fundamental - the game allows that kind of behaviour. It's designed to be like that. There is no "beginners area" with low level dinosaurs, there's nothing to stop high-level players wiping your niminy-piminy little thatch house off the map while you sleep, and really nothing to say that anything you do now will still be worthwhile the following day. With the glut of Survive-em-ups at the moment, you're probably best looking somewhere else, unfortunately.","January 16","false","6.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Like, no lie, that's exactly what it is.  If you don't know what rust is, basically you gather materials by hitting them, then use those materials to build bases and other weapons, armour, tools and objects to better your chances at survival.\n\nPros:\n\n. Graphics - It's a beautiful game for early access, it looks a lot better than ''the stomping land'' but it is defiantly not up to par with newer games. Even so it has had great art direction and the dinosaur models + animation are good.\n\n. Fun.\n\n. Addicting - I have only played for 7 hours so far and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of things to do in this game, getting enough gear to survive against other humans and dinosaurs is great, and taming dinosaurs is really fun and rewarding.\n\n. Persistent levelling - when you die you don't lose all of your levels. I really like this as it takes away a trolling incentive for people to kill players, you don't start to get things worth stealing until you are a much higher level (at least 5 hours into it) and by that point you can defend yourself.\n\n. You can ride dinosaurs.\n\n. Dinosaurs.\n\nCons:\n\n. Low fps - this game is not well optimized yet and causes even high end computers to suffer in some situations\n\n. Map leaks and clipping issues - the map needs work and more optimisation, you can also get stuck in trees and see through the map at some points.\n\n. Underwater design needs a lot of work, as well as swimming and underwater dinosaurs seem to common, you can't safely swim from one side of a river to another without getting eaten by a Megalodon.\n\n. It's Unrealistic drinking water from the ocean to get your dehydration level up. It would be nice if they made it go down a little less and then added freshwater resources but this really just annoys me, I'm unsure if it annoys other people too.\n\n. Server load times need improving.\n\nThese cons are most likely to be fixed as they update the game practically every day since I have had it, even if these things don't get fixed, this game is very fun and is certainly the best dinosaur survival game out there and I would recommend it for the price.\n\nThank you for reading my review! <3","June 10, 2015","true","7.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

Lots of updates and it has some pretty addictive gameplay. The game has terrible optimization atm, but it is Early Access and in most games the bulk of the optimization happens later on. I expect this issue to be improved alot over the games development. That is really my only issue with the game so far is the bad optimization, other than that is is a joy to play.\n\nThe first 3-4 hours I was not sure about this game, but it has improved nicely already with updates that happens often and as I have learned more about the game the joy as skyrocketed. The game does crafting and building very well to, I have had a blast just building bases and crafting a ton of things, along with fighting dinos and scavaging.\n\nSo far atm it is without a doub much more enjoyable than H1Z1 and Rust. Good gameplay, Dinos that you can kill or tame (and ride around), a great leveling up system and devs that update the gam very often. So far so good, if you don't mind some crap optimization (which to be honest happens in a good amount of early access/alpha games until later in development) then pick this up! It is a real joy to play with friends! At first I was thinking a thumbs down because of the optimization but there is so much this game does well that it gets thumbs up after around 20 hours of gameplay.

The basic concept of this game is good - As a man or woman, you must survive on island full of dinosaurs. You must craft tools, build a house, keep yourself warm, tame a dinosaur... Honestly, I would be satisfied with this, if that game worked for me. Truth is, I don't have the newest computer, but yet... when I can play the Witcher 3 on lowest settings with 40-60 FPS, why do I play this on lowest settings with 10-30FPS?\n\nPros+\n+Great concept of this game\n+Taming dinosaurs\n+Things to do/not to do to survive (you must look for food, water, you can get tired very fast, you can break your leg...)\n+Dinosaur species are very accurate\n+ Good when playing with friends\n\nCons-\n-BAD OPTIMALISED (FPS drops, low FPS, lags, slow loading...) - And for me, thanks to this issues, it's unplayable. I'm looking forward to better optimalisation, but I am not going to play it in near future. Maybe one day, when it will be released and I won't have time for it, it could be great. This disappointed me really much.\n-Technical issues\n-When you join new server, you must create a new character - If there would be option to transfer your character to different servers, I would like it. Also, having more characters would be good too, if there was that first option.\n-Character customization is awful. You only can change color of your skin, if you will be fat or slim, tall or short, color of hair, color of eyes, and that would be all. There is nothing like changing different hairstyles, beards(in case of male character, obviously) and other details. That would be great\n\nWhat can I say... If you want to buy this, yeah, buy it, but don't be disappointed. If I could give you my advice - buy it, when they will fix the technical issues or when it will be released and it's price will be reduced.\n\n6.5/10, because it has a great potential\n\nReview will be updated.","July 7, 2015","true","14.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","5"

The Devs have released a plethora of patches to fix various performance and gameplay issues, but it still has a ways to go - especially along the optimization front.  However, I'm having fun working my way up to a brontosaurus burger (hopefully) while building out my own little village.\n=========================================\n\nThis is a very tentative yes - normally I wouldn't really recommend an Early Access game that isn't close to being finished (I've even gone back and changed reviews for this very reason) - however...  One hour in the game (singleplayer) was rather fun - it is sort of what I'd imagine a modern (realistic) Minecraft (modded of course) game to be.  I like the crafting, I like the open world, I like the mobs (dinos), and unlike a lot of people - I've had no issues running the game.\n\nAgain, I've only played singleplayer so far and my graphics are set to high, but with some changes - some of the recommended ones from the devs in the forums.  No crashes, no errors of any sort, and only the odd pause when opening up my inventory or accessing an item's inventory, but the devs have stated that the game is not optimized yet.\n\nIf you like crafting, survival games, or dinosaurs, then I would say check out the forums to see which systems seem to be having the fewest issues, and then if your system falls into that category get this game.  If not, then I'd say wait until the patches start rolling in before you buy.\n\nFor the curious - I'm running the following:\n\nWin 8.1\ni7-4770k\n16 gb ram\nGTX 780","June 3, 2015","true","9.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I will update this in the coming days as the game goes live and I assume gets patched.\nTLDR\nGame has some major potential and is more polished then most games in this genre (but that's not saying much) it has a lot of depth and a lot to do and a wonderful non procedurally generated world. Downsides, server stability is awful, optimization could be better, 30 ♥♥♥♥ING FPS CAPPED... Dino AI makes DayZ zombies look like geniuses.\nCrafting/Gathering\nThe current crafting/gathering system is quite basic but it does work, you gather random things through the forest like berries and fibre, and then you can use tools/punch trees and rocks for other resources. You do not need crafting benches or anything to create items but there is a level system where you "buy" blueprints with your level points. on average you can buy around 2-4 blueprints per character level and these grant you access to make anything from clothes to house materials. You build this on the fly assuming you have the required materials and can quene up 5 items at a time and still walk around.\nInventory\nInventory system is weight based not item based which is nice, however the UI is pretty damn confusing right now but not awful\nSurvival\nCharacter have a hunger/thirst meter and thirst does go down very quickly but food seems very fair, you'll need to kill one dino for meat every 30 minutes or so and cook it, you gain hydration by simply jumping in the water.\nCombat\nCombat is extremely buggy right now mostly because of server instability and the animations are nothing short of hilarious. Ranged combat works quite well actually and the slingshot will definitely be your friend early game.\nDinosaurs\nDinosaurs EVERYWHERE this reminds me more of a mmo with mob spawns than a survival game. Right when you walk in you'll see the world is extremely populated with dinos, pretty much everywhere you walk you'll be stepping on one. this makes gathering quite easy but kind of ruins the atmosphere as it feels very unrealistic. Most dinos are not aggressive until you attack them but obviously carnivours will attack.\nBuilding\nBuilding in the game is basically just like rust/reign of kings. Pieces snap together and have a health meter and can be destoryed. There sleeping bags/chests and more complex things like auto turrets later down the level tree.\nLeveling\nLeveling in this game is done by pretty much any action, gathering levels you, killing things, building ect. You lose all loot on death but not your level/blueprints.\nTaming\nTaming is a very cool system where you pretty much beat an animal into submission and when it's exhausted you feed it and it magically likes you and you can put a saddle on it. Cetain dinos are better at some things than another. Some are good for carrying heavy loads others are good for combat or flying. Overall this is probably the coolest system of the game as you can own as many dinos as you can tame.\nEnding thoughts\nARK is as good as the trailer for the game but they hid a lot of the issues, below is a video of some of my first steps and you can see there are glitches and server stability issues. Dino AI is dumb as terds which can leave dino combat not very engaging. I however really enjoyed my first few hours and highly recommend this title AS LONG as you acknowledge it is definitely early access and does need a lot of work. I personally feel there are no game breaking bugs though and for 25 dollars it's a steal. My biggest concern is how good the hack protection is on release.\nHere is some gameplay if you prefer that over a wall of text. I explain a lot of the mechanics as well as show some funny moments.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBZUMAAROBk","June 2, 2015","true","63.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

You can gather wood, rocks, fiber, tons of berries, and thatch! You can build amazing structures with most of these materials so you feel right at home as well!

The game is so poorly optimized, you won't get over 30 fps. I don't care how good your system is, it simply won't run well. And it doesn't even look good. It looks like a mediocre xbox game. The gameplay is alright, kinda fun once you get some stuff set up and begin to get how the game works, but its impossible to kill most of the predators in the game unless you have very good weaponry (and no lag, which is impossible) These predators will chase you down halfway across the island and keep after you even after they are so far away you can't even see them anymore. Taming animals sucks because you have to wait beside the animal for almost 10 minutes feeding it berries, all the while, you are starving, freezing, and predators are trying to kill you. Only a few animals are actually worth taming, the rest will be useless to you. When you start the game, you prety much have to stay on the beach, because if you go inland you will be eaten within the minute, and the beach is extremely boring. There is nothing to do except collect the same 4 resources until a raptor appears and eats you. Now lets get to my least favorite part about the game: restarting. Every time you die, you restart with nothing. It takes about an hour to do anything remotely satisfying or meaningful and you will die before that happens. Even if you manage to survive for a while, if you close the game, you will lose everything. So unless you like playing for 10+ hours at a time, you will never move beyond stone tools. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ survival game and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game overall.

I have had experience in this game for about a week and have made some observations.\n\nPerformance is terrible at the moment, however over the last week the developers have listened to testers and have been acting on feedback with quick and effective patches. Performance is much better now than it was a week ago and I can only see this improving over time, at this point it would appear the biggest complaint has been performance. A little patience and in the coming weeks I am sure that this will improve.\n\nThe game current features heaps of content, a great leveling system and encourages group play well. The caves are fantastic fun and I hope to see more of this content added to the game. There are some balance issues and recently based on tester feedback the development team has made some great changes and I expect more to come.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is character creation. While there are a heap of options to customise your look some of them can be pretty extreme and I feel it breaks immersion somewhat (although amusing).","June 3, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have never been a huge fan of FPS or Dinos in general. This game however, is extremely well done.\nMy first couple of days were rough. A lot of dying (learning)... Some Dinos, some players but once you get a decent footing and find a server that isn't full of psychopaths, it has one of the best experiences.\n\nI recruited three of my friends to play the game with and we have all teamed up to create a small community on the server.","November 25, 2015","true","523.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

When some Aussie fella crashed into my camp at night, knocked out my dino, knocked out me, took all my stuff and clothes and then knocked my dino out again causing it to die from starvation while I pathetically crawled away with blurry dim vision.\n\nI regained my vision and carefully followed the dino-murderer at a distance. I found his home base and stayed up on the cliffs out of view. Eventually dino-murderer-and-inventory-stealer went to sleep.\n\nI broke his front door, killed him, reclaimed my items, claimed all his items then skinned him for the meat to go out and tame a new dino.\n\nAdditional pro: Heading towards a light drop when realised the dude who lives nearby (high lvl dude who doesn't like me because he caught me breaking in and taking his stuff and I got away with it) had left his 3 Argentavis (big nasty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ birds) there on aggressive. The ♥♥♥♥ers attacked me and I jumped into the ocean with the vague hope I could get a shark to distract them and quite a lot of panic.\n\nThe first bird flew right past me and descended into the depths of the ocean, never to be seen again.\n\nThe other two perched at the edge of the underwater cliff, apparently baffled by the water and soon drowned.\n\nI gained a decent amount of wood housing from the drop and went on my way. I notice the dude has a 4th Argentavis and I may return to repeat the experiment.","June 8, 2015","true","479.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The current issues are server populations, much needed optimizations, and a bit of lag.\n\nNow, what you might not have expected is the incredible effort on the developers pushing out patch after patch each one having a positive  effect on preformace. I've never seen patches roll out this quickly on an EA game and it's blowing me away. The actual gameplay is awesome but the devs are a leagues above what I've come to expect from EA and I feel like with them we'll actually get a finished product and continued support.\n\n","June 3, 2015","true","104.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
