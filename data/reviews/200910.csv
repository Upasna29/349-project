And indeed, it was fun to play. It was unique. It was something fresh. And being a RPG fan, I am used with doing repetitive things in order to get that one rare drop.\n\nOne warning is that even casual gamers who would like to simply play the game and go through the story, might still face some moments where they have to engage battles over and over to get that last item for a recipe. Bite through it, the way you make story progression is quite slow in itself. Ronald Jenkees kicks ♥♥♥, but not after the 6~7th time in a row. Yeah, having only one fixed song per enemy doesn't get you on your toes that much.\n\nOn sales it's usually just one buck, so hopefully no buyer's remorse after you've even spent an hour at it.","November 27, 2013","true","17.7"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","50","57","0","0"

I absolutely love rhythm games but I couldnt see how they could successfully combine this into a RPG style. Although I was proved wrong as this game is AMAZING!!\n\nThe mechanics of the game are very unique and there is nothing quite like it. You use the rhythm of the music to fight a battle. To this you use the arrow keys and click them as soon as the arrow reaches the bottom of the screen. And this is when it gets unique. You have 3 fields to control via this rhythm ability. Mana, Attack and Defense. Mana is collected and can be used to cast spells in the attack field. You can switch through these fields at your free will. You need to make sure that you use each field correctly and at the right time to survive and win the battle.\n\nThe story of this game is what most suprised me. It had me hooked throughout the entire thing. There are many twists in the story that keep you guessing throughout the game. The voice is acting is very well done and the characters are very likable. You really do get to know the characters. In a rhythm game a gripping story is the last thing I would have expected. I am not going to go into detail about the story but just experience it for yourself and you will see how great it is.\n\nThe whole look of the game is completely incredible. The art style gives a real great look to the game that compliments the awesome gameplay.\n\nThroughout the floors you get different items. You have collect these items through playing the levels. I felt the items abilitys were very well balanced and contributed well to the gameplay. These items are obtained through a random drop rate on levels. Some items have a very low drop rate on levels later on the game. Unfortunetely this is where my only bad point comes from this game. To get these items it can become very grindy with you having to repeat these levels multiple times in a row just to get it. This can get very boring after a while.\n\nI'll end this review with the best part of the game, the soundtrack. It is made of music by Ronald Jenkees and Michael Wade Hamilton. I always feel that a game has a great soundtrack when I like it so much that I even listen to it outside of the game itself, and with this one I did. It is incredible and goes great with a rhythm game.\n\nOverall this game is a true masterpiece and a bit of a hidden gem. This game is possibly one of the best I have ever played and I really highly recommend it.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","March 29, 2015","true","17.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

The game plays like Dance Dance Revolution with the notes divided into 3 separate note tracks running concurrently on the screen for casting spells, defending against attacks and regenerating mana. There is a quirky story to pull you through to the end but what won me over was most definitely the music tracks behind the gameplay.\n\nI can't really gauge how difficult it is to play for beginners to the genre due to my many years of playing rhythm games from Stepmania, Guitar Hero and my current timesink of Osu!. Anyone who has played such games should find no problems however with adapting to the mechanics.\n\nDue to the RPG nature of the game, it can become a grind for specific items to drop on the monsters which are used to craft items needed to progress in the floors. The game does not come with any additional content beyond the story that I am aware of (I played mostly at release back in 2011).\n\nBefore the Echo wasn't the most challenging game personally but it sits in my game library as a comfortable purchase when I look back over two years. Give it a go if it is on sale but just be aware it may not be fun for everyone; the usual disclaimer case for most games in the rhythm genre.","November 28, 2013","true","12.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

I got this game from a bundle and decided to install it to try it out. I end up really liking it and played it until the very end. It's a rhythm based game, you have to change between 3 panels with Q and E, you use the arrows to hit the notes.\n\nWhen I saw the tutorial I thought the game would be insanely confusing and hard to play, but it's quite nicely done, as you see all 3 panels at once at any time, so you see what is coming.\n\nThe art is really cool, the music is awesome and the story is even more awesome! I wanted to play until the end to know what happens... It's full of surprises, it's hiralious and you get hooked right into the story.\n\nThe spells aren't limited to only damage, you have shielding, direct damage, DOT, healing, boosts... Alot of different spells to use. You have to kill the monsters and ascend floors until you reach the top. All monsters have specific drops which you have a certain percentage of getting everytime you kill them (with music of course). You also have to craft/find your gear and you can learn new spells by using scrolls and completing the songs with high accuracy or note combos.\n\nTheres not many bad things to say about the game... My only real issue with the game is the hitboxes... Sometimes it looks like you miss but it actually works and sometimes you think you succesfully hit the note but you didin't. Luckily this rarely happens so it didin't affect me too much. Maybe i'm just bad at the game though, I don't know!\n\nThis game is definately worth looking into, especially since it is only 4.99$. I'd say anybody that likes good stories or rhythm/music-based games should really try it out!","October 12, 2014","true","14.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/200910/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","I love rhythm games. Whether it's Elite Beat Agents, Dance Dance Revolution, Project Diva, Rhythm Heaven or iDOLM@STER, I can't get enough of tapping along to arrows and beats. When you combine my love for that genre with my love for RPGs, surely you'd have a winner right? Well, Before the Echo proves that isn't necessarily true. Before the Echo attempts to bring together RPGs, rhythm mechanics and cringe-worthy hipster jokes. In theory, these three aspects could get along rather famously. Unfortunately, in this case they get along about as well as a feuding family.\n\nAfter waking up in a strange tower with no idea how he arrived there, Ky is beset by strange monsters. Guided by his 'shepherd,' Naia, Ky has no choice but to work his way up the seven floors of the tower, defeating enemies and guardians through the power of rhythm. Only then will he be able to escape his strange experimental prison and return to his own world. Sadly, only the ending of the plot holds any real interest, and even then it's pretty bizarre and will be hit or miss for most players. The previous several hours leading up to it gives you little insight into what's happening or the purpose of the tower. I suspect this was done to increase the mystery and suspense, but all it does is leave you feeling irritated and without purpose.\n\nThis is worsened by the horrific script and characters. The dialogue is clichéd, overwritten, uninteresting and seems to rely on pulling out cringe-worthy jokes every few lines. This can be forgiven to a point, since most of the jokes intentionally parody the lameness in hipster culture. Unfortunately, they're not very funny. The characters have incredibly two-dimensional personalities and you'll feel no affection for them at all. The only saving grace is the voice acting. Script aside, the actors, for the most part, do a tremendous job of portraying their characters. Strangely enough, one of my favourite parts of the game was the credits. They're narrated by the actors playing Ky and Naia and it's probably the most enjoyable credits sequence I've experienced in any game.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get down to the nitty-gritty: the gameplay. In essence, Before the Echo can be broken down into two parts: rhythm battles and RPG-style item synthesis. On each of the seven floors, your primary goal is to collect the materials needed to create a key that will open the door to the next floor. To obtain these ingredients you must battle nearby enemies. After defeating them, you have a chance at obtaining various items that will likely be useful in synthesising items such as armour, weapons, new spells and the required key.\n\nSounds good, right? The problem is that some of these items have a relatively low drop chance and you're often forced to play the same 2-3 minute battles over and over and over again. In fact, on the seventh floor, I had to replay the same battle 13 times before the item I needed for the key dropped. It can be absolutely infuriating being forced to do the same battle again and again.\n\nOn the bright side, the battles themselves are pretty fun and incorporate some very unique ideas. Once you begin, you're presented with three different boxes on your screen. One is for attacking, one is for defending, and the third is for regenerating mana. Both you and your enemy have a health meter and it's your job to deplete theirs to zero before they either do the same to you or time runs out.\n\nSo, where's the rhythm, you ask? Once the music begins, each of those boxes becomes flooded with arrows. As arrows come down, you need to hit the corresponding arrow key. So, when the enemy's attacking you, you'll need to hit the arrows in the defence box. When you're attacking, you must hit all the arrows in the attack box to pull off spells. The catch? Only one box can be active at a time. Whilst you can see them all on screen at once, you have to swap between them using the Q and E keys to be able to interact with them individually. This can lead to some particularly hectic moments, especially on the higher difficulties where choices must be made on whether to sacrifice your attack to defend or vice versa. It's a very clever and intense little system that can provide a great deal of challenge for veterans of the music genre.\n\nTo actually attack your foe, you must choose and cast spells assigned to your sphere by hitting the corresponding numerical key. At first, you can only take a couple of spells into battle at once, but by the end this can be expanded to seven. New spells are learned by synthesising items and passing specific musical challenges. The attacks themselves include direct damage, damage over time, healing and more. There's a decent variety, but the real strategy comes in picking one spell over another. Do you pick a spell that does more damage but has a shorter recharge time? Do you take the most powerful healing spell even though it requires a huge amount of mana to cast? The spell choice adds a much needed layer of depth to the game.\n\nIf that doesn't sound hard enough then don't worry, it doesn't stop there. Each floor of the game has a guardian that presides over it and can interfere in each battle. By exercising their individually unique powers, guardians can seriously hinder your progress. Some can drain your mana while others can reverse the position of arrows, block your view of the arrow grids and even change the playback speed of the song. Once you finally forge the key and finish a floor, you then must then confront the guardian and defeat it. The guardians attack far more aggressive than regular enemies and the battles tend to have shorter time constraints. It's great fun.\n\nUnderlying all this great fun, however, is one massively poor design choice: synthesising items costs experience. Picture it: you spend an hour destroying enemy after enemy and collecting all the items you need, only to fail your synthesis and lose two levels worth of experience. It's incredibly frustrating. Each time you synthesize you are literally betting your hard-earned experience to increase or decrease the chance of success. On later floors it can be utterly devastating to lose so much. At least you don't lose the items, I guess.\n\nThe music used throughout the game is of fairly good quality. Fitting in with the theme of the game it's mostly electronic-sounding, which will really be a hit or miss thing for individual players. The tracks used during battle are solid, but there just isn't enough variety. Across the seven floors there are only around 10 songs used, and you're stuck with the same song for each battle. So, if you're fighting that same enemy five times, you hear the same song five times, which gets monotonous. Outside of the battle the music just sort of merges in with the rest of the game and is easily forgotten.\n\nAesthetically, the game starts off solid but starts to disappoint the further you play. The stylistic, artsy design of the characters and environments are fantastic the first time you encounter them, but they're reused far too often. Background graphics are reused a number of times throughout the game and enemies are palette swapped to an offensive degree. Character design, however, is well-rounded. Each of the guardians sports a unique and interesting design that sets them apart from each other and matches their somewhat stereotyped personalities. Ky may look like a generic hero, but you certainly can't fault him artistically.\n\nSo, did I enjoy Before the Echo? Yeah, I did. It's a fun game with some great mechanics and intriguing ideas going for it. If there was reduced experience gambling, less incessant grinding and a few additional songs, it could have been a far superior game. It may not be hardcore enough as either a rhythm or role-playing game for some, but there's still plenty here for both camps to like.","February 24","true","41.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

It's a sign to purchase it as a duty.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're reading this, congratulations! You have a good taste in videogames.\n\nAs a hardcore rhythm game player, Before the Echo caught my attention soon enough but honestly I didn't know what to expect. The conclusion after beating everything is a fully recommendation of the game.\n\nBefore the Echo (also known as Sequence) is a rhythm game with RPG elements. The basic stuff  in summary (HP, Mana, EXP, weapons, accesories...). The main character, Ky, has somehow placed himself into a tower where he needs to fight mobs and bosses in order to escape.\n\nThe battle system consists in getting control of 3 labels of notes. They have different purposes and you need to know when to focus into one or another. I won't explain their features here since the game has tutorials for that.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ The artwork is cool. Backgrounds are good-looking, and so are characters and foes.\n+ The soundtrack, as you might expect from a rhythm game, is pretty awesome. It also combines many music styles so if you're open minded with that stuff you'll probably enjoy it a lot.\n+ 4 difficulties, from lame to more challenging.\n+ The RPG system is pretty well included. Just as simple as it needs to be.\n+ The storymode is surprisingly interesting. The characters' charisma helpsa lot here.\n+ The dialogues. This is actually one of the most remarkable features. Dialogues in this game are VERY hilarious. Together with a pretty cool voice acting, dialogues will keep you super entertaining and will provide many, many laughs.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Despite having a cool artwork, there's not too much variety, specially from foes.\n- At some points grinding/farming is mandatory.\n- All achievements can be obtained no matter the difficulty you set, which makes them WAY less satisfying.\n- No leaderboards.\n- Steam version works like a Flash game (for instance, I couldn't make screenshots, nor broadcasts).\n\nAll in all, I've had a GREAT experience with this game. It has some minor flaws I could perfectly ignore, and every rhythm player should try this out. You'll surely find some good fun and discover a very consistent title despite its price (less than an euro during sales... WHAT?).\n\nFinal Mark: 7.5/10","July 1, 2015","true","13.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

Ronald Jenkees does a lot of the music for the game, and if you like his style then you will love the music found here.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are nice - the artstyle for the characters and backgrounds are well-detailed. The music is very, very good, however, if you do not like the electronic genre, then you may get tired of hearing the music, and this is critical because it is the core of the gameplay and (so far) the variety is not too expansive. You will also grind quite a bit, so you will be hearing the same tracks repeatedly.\n\nThe story is decent, nothing too fancy. The voice acting is not bad, and the comedic banter between the main characters is funny at times. There is also some teasing of common RPG elements, which I always find very nice when not overdone.\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself with - you use the WASD keyes and/or the arrow keys in combination with the numbers (spell hotkeys) and Q and E. The tutorial is skip-able but extremely important for understanding the mechanics of the game. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are not used to playing rhythm games. I am pretty good at beatmatching by ear, so I tried the 2nd hardest difficulty and had to tone it down a level - my finger dexterity on the keys are still rusty; however, I plan to do a playthrough on the hardest difficulty once I beat the game.\n\nGameplay is very, very fun if you are interested in the rhythm genre. You have three windows, Defence, Spells, and Mana. Arrow kills will fall in the Defence and Mana windows, and you can swap your active window with the Q and E skills (left and right respectively). If you fail to press an arrow key in the Defence window, you lose health depending on the type of arrow (basic white color = -1 HP, and so forth). If you fail to press an arrow key in the Mana window, there is no effect.\n\nArrows will only fall in the Spells window when you activate one of your spells with the number hotkeys, however, you must also have enough mana to cast the spell. Failing to press even a single arrow key in the Spells window will cause you to fail in casting it and you will not be refunded your mana. Spells are the way you damage your opponent, and you can also heal yourself. I believe you can only have 4 active spells at a time (you start with 2 slots and unlock more as you progress through the tower).\n\nBetween battles, you can craft and equip different items. There are 7 floors in the tower you wake up in, and you are given new crafting recipes as you reach new floors. One item will always give a permanent bonus (ex: +1 to offence), and others can be new spells, armor, or weapons. You can also scrap your items for experience points. When you craft, you have to pay exp. to increase the chance of success (you can even pay lose levels if you want to pay that much exp); if you fail, you are not refunded the exp.\n\nLevelling up is done automatically, you do not have to allocate skill points.\n\nAs you progress through the game, monsters will have a unique "guardian ability" for each floor - for example, on the 2nd floor enemies (once per battle) can activate an ability that makes the falling arrow keys fade to invisibility as they reach the lower quarter of your window. Listening to the beat of the music really, really helps because the keystrokes tend to match the beat very well. With enough practice, you can even swap windows freely and continue pressing arrow keys to the beat. There is a craftable item for each floor that allows you to ignore guardian effects (except when you fight the bosses).\n\nBoss battles are fun and the character's are pretty funny. Each boss will use their guardian effect more frequently, and you cannot negate it with the inhibition item.\n\nIf you are interested in rhythm games, definitely pick up this fantastic game.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\n\n\n","August 2, 2014","true","5.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

While other indie games like Limbo, Braid, etc., may make a better first impression with their stark visual style and challenging gameplay, Sequence is the game I find myself coming back to the most. It's just plain fun. The game has amazing replay value, too. The different difficulty settings mean you can always give yourself a new challenge, and if you happen to be lucky enough to own a PC compatible dance pad or guitar, then there are even more ways to play it, too.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of rhythm, but I was pulled in by the game's deep strategy. There is a lot more to this game than just pressing buttons to the beat! In fact, there is so much more to it that it might be off-putting or confusing to some people. In order to be successful, you have to be good at multi-tasking, and there is no such thing as a perfect run on the songs (due to the three-screen system, missing some notes is inevitable).\n\nThe music is good, with all the tracks distinctive and crisp. The art style is so-so. Another interesting feature of this already interesting game is the story. With a game like this, I really would have expected a tacked-on story or even none at all. However, the developer put in a decent effort to make an engaging tale with a few twists and turns. It didn't blow me away, but it is by no means terrible. It's a little above standard visual novel quality, and while I wouldn't reccomend playing the game for the story alone, I think quite a few players will be pleasantly surprised by just how good it is.\n\nAll-in-all, one of my favorite indie games.

Hearing Ronald Jenkees' "Throwing Fire" during one of the battles was easily enough for the game to go from check, to check-plus. The leveling system is also surprisingly not very tedious, though there are moments of grinding sometimes it's really not too bad, plus you can de-materialize items you don't want anymore into extra EXP! It's very convenient. I also enjoyed how  the bosses of each floor were presented. You hear about them before actually meeting them and you always see their effects triggered on your play field that make normal battles tougher than usual, so when you finally meet them it's almost like meeting a celebrity. It's a quality in RPGs that I rarely see these days, and it makes every boss battle so much more special.\n\nOverall Before the Echo is a fantastic game that I'm positive any rhythm game lover will come to enjoy.

Rhythm and RPG Genre Mixing Goodness.Genre: Rhythm RPG Indie Title\nDeveloped & Published by: Iridium Studios\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Cheap Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nPreamble\nOriginally titled Sequence, Before the Echo is the first game released by the indie devs Iridium Studios. It was later followed by There Came An Echo, a real time tactics voice controlled game released on Steam in early 2015. According to Before the Echo’s Steam Forums, they had a copyright claim thrown against them by another developer over their name. So, Iridium Studios had to rename Sequence to something else in order to avoid legal trouble. A rather unfortunate turn of events. However, I will say that Before the Echo might have been a better choice anyway, as Sequence isn’t particularly memorable for a name. I myself only discovered Before the Echo when There Came An Echo was released and got a lot of press attention for its unique voice control mechanics. BtE has some interesting ideas of its own though and I don’t think it should be ignored.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nA rhythm-based-combat RPG with a story driven narrative has a decent amount of content, especially if you decide to go for as many recipes as possible. The rhythm mechanics are a refreshing change of pace from the normal choose-spells, counter as best you can and win over and over again. It forces you to pay attention to what you’re doing and continually improve as the game goes along. This is even after my initial skepticism that this game had few legs to stand on. After all, we’ve had plenty of rhythm games before. What could possibly make BtE stand out? Well, a good story with an amusing banter between the two protagonists and a decently diverse set of characters to fight out against with their own particular personality doesn’t hurt. Neither does a refined rhythm system that requires you to pay attention and react quickly to three different fields of falling arrows.\n\nStory Thoughts\nThe player is following the story of Ky, a hacker who finds himself waking up in a mysterious tower called, well, the Tower. This seven leveled tower isn’t something to scoff as he’ll soon learn that he can die in this tower. Upon awaking and talking to himself about what’s going on, he’s greeted by Naia, a “shepherd” that has few answers for Kai but seems to be on his side or at the very least trapped by her own circumstances. She’ll help him out by guiding him through the tutorial and each level. Ky must do this, defeating monsters to grow in strength to eventually defeat the seven guardians that stop forward progress. The plot has lies and half truths a plenty. Not everyone is telling the truth and there’s something sinister going on in the background. It seems to be set in the modern era though no country or actual year is dropped. The characters do seem to imply this is all happening in the 2010s.\n\nCombat Thoughts\nIn Before the Echo’s battles, you defeat monsters and bosses by following the beat of the music and destroying the enemy’s health before they do yours in. This is accomplished in a dance-dance-revolution type battle where you’re trying to cast spells, block their attacks and regenerate your mana when possible. To do this, you’ll need to press the right direction on the d-pad and letter keys of your controller when arrows are at the right time. You’ll often need to use both set of controls in order to handle all the arrows falling. Keyboard and mouse can also be used but I find the controller to be a little bit more enjoyable and easier to use for this game. To further complicate things, you’ll need to select and cast spells using the controller’s joystick while keeping an eye on arrows. This can be a little tricky to figure out at first but I eventually got used to it.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings are a little bizarre here. Fullscreen on/off is the only traditional video setting to be found. Particle effects can be turned off, there’s a lag calibration for your controller, gem and text speed can be changed and a lot of other different functions important to the rhythm mechanics. Resolution options, AA, V-sync and other settings are missing as well. The one game I actually desire individual sound volume options doesn’t have them at all. I found the SFX was just a bit too loud over the music and people speaking but not unbearably high. For such an audio-intensive game, being able to adjust the different volumes seems like an obvious thing to include in your game. Voice acting can be turned off but I don’t know why you’d want to do that. It’s pretty good voice acting. I was surprised to hear the voice actor for Dust from Dust: An Elysian Tail in this title too. He plays one of the guardians.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBefore the Echo is a good and different experience that’s both decently approachable but difficult to master. The combination of RPG and Rhythm mechanics just works here, the mechanics blending well together and never allowing things to get dull for long. Though there are fights that can be overly frustrating. It’s also not too hard to lose concentration and find yourself in an unwinnable situation. So, you’ll need to stay on your toes or take a break if it’s happening too often. The story itself is pretty good, I found myself chuckling at the banter between the two protagonists from time to time. It does lean a bit too much on tropes but I think it does them well enough that I’m not bothered by it. It’s a good time “dancing” to the beats while playing a more traditional RPG game. I definitely liked this mix of genres and I recommend checking out when you have the chance.\n\nA Paladin's Review: There Came An Echo.[kingisaaclinksr.com]Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","November 29, 2015","true","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In its core it is a rhythmus game mixed with some light rpg elements. You get experience, levels and items which make you stronger and you can craft some items and you fight monsters.\nThe dialogues may appear childish to some people (not to me) and the story is probably told in three or four sentences. But for me it was interesting enough and left me with a lot of unanswered questions which made me curious for a sequel.\nWhile fighting monsters you have three "rhythmus screens" you can switch freely between: the mana screen (only for regeneration of mana), the defend screen (block attacks to avoid damage) and the spell screen (match the combination to attack with your spells). Watch a gameplay video to get a better impression.\nAs a sidenote you can not choose the music for the game. It is preset and there are "only" between 10-15 playable songs. Personally I found them quite enjoyable . Also you need to grind a tiny bit during the game in order to gain experiences and the right items.

I really enjoyed this game, and I would highly recommend it.  :)  I also think it is worth the $5 on Steam.\n\nTo give you a general idea of this game, it is similar to Step Mania only with an actual storyline.  If you don't know what Step Mania is, it's basically DDR (dance dance revolution) for the PC.  However, Sequence is kind of refreshing because it isn't just arrows flying up the screen to music.  In this game, you have three different sets of arrows that travel down the screen, and you have to switch between the sets.  One is your defense, one is your attack/magic, and the other is your mana.  This keeps things interesting and sometimes challenging (depending on the difficulty).  Yes, you are battling enemies instead of "dancing" to music like you would in Step Mania.\n\nThe storyline is excellent!  There are a few plot twists that you will not see coming, and the characters are very likeable.  The dialogue is probably one of my favorite parts of the storyline, and it had me laughing a few times.  The script is usually spot-on for some things that members of our generation would say.\n\nAs for the music, I like most of the music, but it gets very repetitive very fast.  You'll play through the same songs over and over.  Be prepared for that!\n\nThe achievements are very reasonable, and there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to get all but one or two during your first play-through (unless you are doing the bare-minimum to get by).  There is one achievement, however, that you will not be able to get on your own unless you know a little computer programming.  That is slightly unfair in my opinion, but it is what it is.  If you do have knowledge of programming, you'll probably pick-up on it rather easily if you happen to see the right part.\n\nAs for the difficulties, I played through medium.  Throughout most of it, that was way too easy for me.  There were a few battles later on where I did have a challenge.  The good news is that you are allowed to change the difficult through the first three "floors" of the game.  However, things don't get super difficult until you get to the final floor.  If you happen to lose a battle, you still gain experience in most small battles.  You are also given a chance to repeat with no penalties.  This is actually really nice, especially in those bigger challenges.  However, it may make the game a little too easy for some of you hardcore gamers.\n\nOverall, this is a nice, short game that I would recommend!","April 14, 2014","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My experience was on medium difficulty of someone who is not musically inclined, though I am a fan of rhythm games.\n\nThe RPG aspect of the title is somewhat limited. There's three equipment slots, but overall there's a clear progression of "this item is pretty much completely better than this other one," blandly increasing stats, though they -- like all the other items in the game -- may have punny item descriptions or names. The accessories slot, the third item slot, is interesting though -- if you ever find yourself needing certain items to progress, two later-game items let you increase your item drop rate at the cost of decreasing your stats, essentially. Or you can have a more unique attribute like doubling critical hit chance or decreasing spell cooldown. Leveling up is an across-the-board boost to your stats, but one interesting mechanic is in crafting -- you have to trade exp for chance to craft, exp is a currency. The level cap is 34, but you can beat the game in your mid-20s. I beat it at level 28 with relative ease compared to the grinding (more on that later).\n\nSpells are acquired to directly combat enemies. They are all balanced differently (mana cost, damage, length of time to cast the spell, spell cooldown, difficulty of the arrow sequence) so there's plenty of choices in gameplay style. You can have a maximum of 6 spell slots to unload direct damage, damage over time, healing, and life-draining spells. There are also two buffing spells that boost the damage of the next spell, and a barrier spell to decrease the number of arrows thrown your way on the defence field. You can ALSO play the game significantly more aggresively by using the Convert spells to trade a bit of health for a load of mana, allowing you to ignore the defence and mana fields if you want to try your skill at hammering out life drain and heal spells in between Converts.\n\nThe rhythm aspect is definitely its strenth. The higher BPM, the more chaotic. Managing all three fields is ideal for defeating enemies within the time limit of the song and for the most fun in general, as you bounce seemlessly between defending, attacking, and recharging. On medium difficulty, it seems like the game is SIGNIFICANTLY more merciful: players do NOT have to have perfect coordination -- just have an arrow in the space of the outlines and you'll hit it. There's not "perfect" or "ok" score like in DDR to tell you how precise you were(n't). Perhaps this is changed in the higher difficulties, especially since the game mentions that players who are more musically inclined should play them.\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the game is definitely fatigue and pacing. For a rhythm game, there are NOT a lot of songs -- about 25 in total, including background music that isn't used in combat, when there are 7 floors of 3-4 enemies each with a boss on each floor. Before getting items to increase drop rate, you may spend 5+ fights on each enemy to acquire their drops. Even with decreasing the number of encounters, you will hear the same songs over and over again on different floors, though spaced out decently well so it's not completely repetitive. If you don't like the two artists who contribute 99% of the music or the combat system itself, then you will not enjoy this game for very long (I highly recommend checking out bits of the soundtrack; not every song is like Piano Jam or On Cue, they tend to be more like Super Fun or Derty).\n\nThe story starts off fairly cliche and parodying, but it develops over the course of the game. Voice acting is good regardless of content; as an indie game, it's interesting that the programmer/writer also voices the main character fairly well. I highly recommend sticking to it (assuming, of course, a seemingly weak story is the main sticking point to enjoying the game). The final boss throws a curveball into the setting if you didn't pick up the foreshadowing before, and there is a hidden ending. And, of course, perhaps you will enjoy the story throughout because of its humor; others have praised it, but I was ambivalent.\n\nOverall, there's at least ten hours of gameplay, likely more for a 100% completion. It has a nice amount of replayability since the game allows you to change difficulty up to the third floor (wherein you should be able to decide the right difficulty for you), an incredibly low price, decent RPG mechanics, fairly unique rhythm mechanics, and servicable art (it's a rhythm game with THREE FIELDS, you have neither room nor need to show much more). A niche title as a rhythm game alone, but one of the best for those who want a rhythm game with progression. Buy it, especially if it's on sale for $2 like it was the Christmas I bought it!","August 2, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don’t know why I didn’t picked it up earlier, probably because I wasn’t sure if I’d actually like it but truth is I bought Sequence on the Steam Autumn Sale of 2013. Well, it turns out rumours were right and my suspicions were correct. The game is great, it possibly has one of the best soundtracks I’ve ever heard on an indie game and the arstyle looks absolutely beautiful with some nice visual effects. The combat relies on a typical rhythm match game, where you have to press each key at the right time and it’s probably better if you don’t try to press the keys when you see them on the right spot but when they coincide with the music “beat”. The combat screen is divided in three different fields, the Mana field which everytime you match a certain key you regain mana and mana is used to cast spells, the Spell field where you need to match keys everytime you activate one spell and if you miss one key of the combo the spell casting cancels and you still loose your mana and the last field is the Defense field in which everytime you miss one of the keys on this field, that key will deal damage to you. That is about it for the combat, everytime you beat an enemy you’ll gain experience and loot, each enemy can drop three different items and those items are either equipables or crafting materials. The story takes you to a tower where you’re guided by a girl named Naia via an intercom and she explains to you how everything works and that you need to reach the top of the tower which has 7 floors and in order to proceed to the next floor you need to find the required materials to craft the key to unlock the door for the next floor and also defeat the guardian of each floor at the start of it, from what I understand these battles with the guardians are considered boss battles. On each floor you have a safe room where you can equip yourself, craft new items and spells and also learn and practice your spells and also this is where you’ll unlock the door leading to the next floor and where you can choose to battle enemies, from what I saw there’s three different enemies per floor.  I’m gonna be honest and you can probably see by my playtime according to Steam, I only reach the second floor and I’m currently fighting the second guardian but I’m pretty sure II won’t play Sequence anymore, not because I don’t like it, because I really do, but because I’m extremely bad at rhythm games and I found the battles to be rather frustrating for me, which might end up with me taking alot of time in order to beat the game and that kinda makes me sad because I’d love to experience the whole story and unfold the mystery behind Sequence and its world, from what I’ve saw thus far the story seemed to promise but I disliked the voice acting in this game but I do believe you can turn it off on the options menu if you don’t like it either. Sequence is certainly a very unique game and a very good one indeed, but like I’ve said, if you’re not good at rhythm games you’ll have a hard time with it, eitherways you should totally give it a try, it is totally worth your time and money but unfortunately it’s not my kind of game.","December 25, 2013","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has an engrossing story with believable characters, great gameplay mechanics, the ability to alter your approach to the challenges they give you, and has great music to boot. As a guy who's not too into music and rhythm games, the RPG elements really made me stick with the game, because even if the challenge seemed too great, I knew I could go back to previous floors to get enough XP to give me the small boost I needed, or else just to hone my skills.

It was, at one point, called Sequence.\n\n\nBefore the Echo is a simple, yet fun rhythm game.\n\nThe plot isn't the greatest selling point of the game, but if you approach it as a riff off the Guitar Hero or Rock Band style game it is very enjoyable.  The music can start to feel a little repetitive at times, but the songs are enjoyable if you like the style.  Ronald Jenkees did the vast majority of the songs in the game, and many are available on his youtube channel for some samples.\n\nYour goal is to reach the top of a tower, while combating monsters with spells that you cast in a DDR style mechanic.  To complicate things, there are three "areas" that you have to swap between and work in- one for casting, one for regenerating mana, and one for defending yourself.  Winning a battle nets you some XP, and possibly up to 3 items.  The item drops and crafting mechanics seem designed to extend the length of the game, although I rarely felt like I was grinding unnecessarily.  There is something to be said for the practice associated with grinding drops and XP to burn on crafting, as the transitions in difficulty can feel a little rough here and there, and some of the spell casting sequences can take a bit of time to really feel natural.\n\nThe mechanics do feel contrived, but the game itself lampshades that fact.  Before the Echo doesn't take itself too seriously, and that is a good deal of the charm.  The music is great, and the art has a nice look and feel to it.\n\nI have not tried playing with a controller, but the keyboard interface is simple enough to use that I don't think a controller is a requirement.  I was able to finish the game (including the "hidden" ending) on Medium difficulty without too much of a struggle.  I briefly toyed with the harder difficulty but I found that I enjoyed the game on medium enough that I didn't continue down the harder path.  The differences in difficulty seem to be entirely based on the number of symbols necessary to complete a sequence, and higher difficulties make more use of the two buttons at a time patterns (up+left, down+right, up+down, left+right) instead of just single inputs in order.\n\nOverall, I think it was a fun game, worth a playthrough, and something I go back to from time to time just to play specific songs.  Worth the price of admission.","December 20, 2013","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sequence is a pretty fun game with solid soundtracks. The player has to battle enemies to get drops to build more equipment that provides bonuses, build new spells, or build a key to the next level. When battling enemies, there are three columns that the player must pay attention to; defense, attack, and mana. You take damage every time you let a stroke through defense, you attack by using a spell and hitting everything in the sequence in the attack column, and you get mana to cast more spells by hitting strokes in the mana column.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meroron/recommended/200910/","meroron","Meroron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meroron/","155 products in account","This is a bit of a mixed review. The battle system is pretty interesting with the switching between screens and thinking up the best strategies to beat the enemies. I also have fun with the crafting system (but it does make the game grind-y; I find grinding rewarding so I enjoy it, but if you have little patience for that sort of thing, trying to gather all the materials and experience points to craft stuff might get on your nerves). Overall I've spent a lot of hours entertained by the game and am invested enough to want to get all achievements, craft all items, etc. So for the price I think the experience is really worth it (and I even got it on sale).\n\nThat said - I expected an RPG with a rhythm game gimmick, and got a rhythm game with an RPG gimmick instead... the rhythm game battling is like 90% of the game. But it's not quite strong on its own to be what I'd call an "amazing" rhythm game... the music is a bit bland and sounds more like a nice BGM than something to actively enjoy. I also appreciate sleek visuals/designs in rhythm/music games but the battle screen looks pretty basic. This would've all been 100% fine if there was just more besides the battles to the game... like if you could actually move through a map and  meet the monsters in random encounters or something, in a more RPG-y way. Or if the story and characters were more unique and there were more and better written narration and dialogue, in a visual novel-y way. The characters are pretty basic and the dialogue is cringey at times (trying a bit too hard to be witty/funny to be taken seriously, kinda generic, uncomfortable moments like one point where the r-slur is used). Basically I feel like the game is fun but falls short of being Great. Better visuals/music, more varied gameplay, better story/writing - if it had any one of those 3 things, I think it might've been enough. I wouldn't even demand to have all three at once. But as it is, it feels like it falls short of its potential. I think the core idea of integrating rhythm games with RPG in a battle system is really great and that the game could've been better.\n\nBut like I said, since it's cheap, I do think it's worth its price. So if you enjoy rhythm games you might as well get it because it'll probably provide quite a few hours of fun. If you don't like rhythm games, I'd just say you won't be missing out on much if you pass.","July 12, 2015","true","12.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedwarrior/recommended/200910/","icedwarrior","icedwarrior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedwarrior/","607 products in account","Sequence: 8.5/10\n\nThe first thing I’d like to touch upon is the engaging gameplay. Think Guitar Hero, but more complex; directional arrows will fall from the screen and you must match them at the bottom, to the beat of the song. But where it becomes more complicated is that there’s “three screens” – one for offense (casting spells, which lowers your opponents health, heals you, etc.), one for mana (which is the resources for spells), and defense (in which you counter your opponent’s attacks; if you match the arrows, you don’t take damage, but if you don’t, you take damage equal to what the arrow is worth). This leads to a very fun experience, because you must decide on the fly if you want to cast X spell at that time, while managing mana and seeing if you want to finish that spell, or negate the damage incoming to you, etc. The spell must be finished completely, without mistake, to be cast; if you mess up one note, it doesn’t do anything, so the more rewarding the spell, the more difficult to pull off. I am not ashamed to admit that I had to shelf my “best” healing spell for a moderate heal because I could never pull it off. The game is at its best when you’re on equal terms with your opponent, having to juggle mana, spells, and defense. Unfortunately, the difficulty isn’t always there, and I’ve been able to literally completely ignore defense and just go for mana and spells. This is okay when the enemy is essentially a “gear check”, so to speak, but it happened more than I’d like. The game has seven floors (perhaps more, I’m currently on floor six of a stated seven), and each floor has a “special power” (that is designed to hinder you) for each fight: for the sixth floor, for example, you can’t see the screens you’re not currently selecting. Another power is that you’re unable to switch screens until the timer is expired, so you better make sure you’re on the defensive screen, or you’re going to be taking a lot of damage.\n\nI would like to note that I was very surprised at how well the (controller, never tested the keyboard) controls worked; I was swapping screens and hitting notes effortlessly, and I can count the amount of times I was disoriented / confused on my hand.\n\nBeing a rhythm game, the music is important, and Sequence delivers. I’d like to note that I enjoy it so much I’ll be throwing the tracks on my iPod for repeated listening. Said tracks are varied so it’s not just the same type of music, although I do wish there was more variety when you’re grinding; hearing the same song all the time on the same enemy did kind of get on my nerves. But, still, they’re good songs, so I don’t mind much. For each song, the tempo dictates how the notes are going to hit you: if it’s a slow song, there’ll be fewer notes, but they’ll count for more, while the opposite is true for frantic music.\n\nWhile the story does exist, it’s not very engaging. I am – as I’m sure a lot of others are – tired of the main character waking up and not knowing what’s going on / amnesia / what-have-you. The dialog between the main character and your ally is often amusing (they’ve had discussions which includes ♥♥♥♥♥, “…like a Disney without hidden sexual innuendo, they were missing something”, etc.) that I’ve forgiven the absence of the story. And, without spoilers, the dialog made me care for the plot development about two-thirds of the way through the game, so the plot is a lot better than most games in this genre.\n\nMy largest complaint is the grinding required to advance in the story. I am at heart an RPG-enthusiast, so I really don’t mind grinding – usually I enjoy it. Sequence, however, doesn’t pull grinding off very well, though. The game employs a crafting element to the game, which is required to use to advance. You can craft items such as permanent health increases, items that disable the hindering “special powers” that each floor uses against you, and, most importantly, key items that allow you to challenge the boss for that specific floor. To get these specific items, you must defeat certain enemies, and upon defeating them, you have a percentage chance to get one of three items that they carry. This wouldn’t be so bad, except you must often get a 25% drop from multiple enemies, and this quickly becomes annoying when they pose no threat to you. Without said grinding, however, the game would be at least half as long, so I don’t mind it too much…but enough to complain about it. ;)\n\nAnother small complaint is the difficulty curve. In the beginning, it was about perfect for me and my difficulty setting (I chose the default “normal” difficulty), since I wasn’t fully aware of how to time the notes and how the game worked, etc. Then floors two through five didn’t give me many problems…and then the sixth floor is kicking my ♥♥♥. I feel like they’re trying to prolong the game with unnecessarily high “gear checks” at this point. This would be more forgivable if said difficulty curve was more spread out and not super noticeable after having a very easy time previously.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with this gem of a game that I paid $1 for (among two other solid games). In fact, I like it so much that I played five straight hours of it one day, and am planning on putting all of the songs on my iPod to listen to later.\n\nWhile there are some small flaws in my eyes, the positives far outweigh the negatives.\n\nTL:DR = 8.5/10;\nPro = Gameplay is very fun, music is great, fun dialog.\nCon = Unnecessarily long, RNG-reliant grinding, spiked difficulty curve.\n\n[I played this game offline; I have eight hours logged as of posting.]","March 29, 2014","true","6.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

The last thing you know you were getting ready for bed and now you're here. A girl over the intercom tell you you're in a tower with seven floors and that you have to get to the top to get out. That's it. Oh, and by the way, you have to fight monsters and floor guardians in rhythmic RPG-ish-style battles. Are you confused yet? I was.\n\nThis game features four difficulty modes and I have to admit I played this on the easiest setting, which for a rhythmically challenged person such as myself was hard enough on the last couple of boss fights.

There's a defensive, mana, and offensive field where you need to correctly push up, down, left, right according to the sequence they come down in. The trick is in juggling these three fields, since you're not able to play them all at the same time. When notes (I'll just call them that) come down in the defensive field and you miss them, you gain damage. To damage the opponent, you need to cast spells and hit the right notes in the spell or offensive field. To regain the mana you spent by casting spells, you need to go to the mana field where hitting the notes restores mana. There are quite a couple of spells in this game, ranging from healing spells to direct offensive spells to damage over time. At first it can be a bit confusing, but it does get easier over time. I personally played this game with a controller and often found myself pressing the wrong buttons when in a rush to reach the right field, causing me to miss notes. For me, the controls as such were something to get used to, but maybe it's easier when playing with a keyboard.\n\nAfter each battle you gain a certain amount of XP and there's the possibility of getting items. While XP is used to level Ky, the protagonist, up, it is also used as a currency. On every floor you are given a couple a recipes you can use to synthesize items, gear, and spells. In order to do so, you need to invest some XP into the synthesizing process, a little more if you want a better change of success or a little less if you want like gambling. Spells can be learned by synthesizing scrolls and then 'using' the scrolls - again, with XP. You then need to finish one of the songs with a certain percentage of correct notes or a certain combo streak. The spells learned can then be put into your ring of spells, which starts out with two slots but increases to six as you progress in the game.\n\nNow, the music. The music was the high point of the game for me, as most of the tunes were catchy and didn't really annoy even after a reasonable amount of time spent playing. Outside of the battles I cannot recall any kind background music, though I'm sure it was there. Just not memorable. The sound effects were all right, nothing much to say there. The voice acting on the other hand I really liked. I think the characters sounded real enough, though the script was a bit of a hit or miss at times: I think the topics of conversation and references made might not be everybody's cup of tea.\n\nAnd last but not least, the story itself. So you start out with only knowing you need to get to the top of this tower with seven floors and that your shepherd, Naia, will guide you through via intercom. I won't spoil the story, but you won't find out much more than that until the end of the game. The ending itself, while explaining everything, felt a bit disappointing to me. If this game had relied on the story for its success, instead of the gameplay and banter among the characters, I don't think it would have worked out.\n\nAll that said, I do recommend this game if only for the fact that it's so cheap and quite a lot of fun. It's not a very long game, it took me a small ten hours to complete from A to Z, but the fun to cost relation definitely says that if you're thinking of getting this game you should give it the benefit of the doubt.","December 25, 2013","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you unravel the curious story of Ky, a man trapped inside the misterious Tower, with no idea how he got there. The gameplay is rhythm based (in the vains of ddr or guitar hero), but you have three "lanes" between wich you keep changing in order to attack, deffend and recover your mana. Sounds weird, well it is, but it's fun (even though I'd recomend a xbox controller to play).\nNow, the game starts really pretencious about its own plot, and about how "different" it is. Usually this is bad, but this is one of the rare ocasions where I'd say it's okay, considering the plot is interesting, well voice acted, and the gameplay is inovative (if a little grindy on the serach for crafting materials).\nFinally, the great attencion to details seals this deal for me, you can change not only your difficulty, but the speed your notes run at. Plus, you can listen and play any song you've discovered on the extras menu. If it wasn't for a lack of in-game volume controll I'd have nothing to complain about this Interesting, and quite underrated Rhythm based RPG.","November 22, 2011","true","40.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The third floor boss made me laugh more than any game character has in a long time.\n\nThe main weakness is that it can be very grindy - you have to use drops and pay XP to craft items, meaning you have to fight the same monster over and over again to get the items (each with a different percentage chance of dropping) and XP you need.

HOWEVER the RPG element shoots itself in the foot when you find yourself having to grind the same level 40 time with the same song over and over again because you are trying to get some stupid item with a low drop rate to advance.","February 21, 2013","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficulty scales nicely and the bosses are a nice touch to the music-rpg theme. The item drop percentages and item-grinding might turn you away a little bit but it is not that bad.)\n\nMusic/Sounds - 9 (Enjoyable songs and sound effects but definitely could use more songs to add more of a mix and make it feel less repetitive.)\n\nOverall - 9\n\nReplayability - 2 (Not much to be replayed here, just achievements and same game different difficulties if you want.)\n\nWorth it? - It's 5$ and very well worth the buy.\n\n-Minor Spoiler - I'd also recommend you to listen and watch the ending credits, they were entertaining.","December 28, 2011","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each screen is useful for one of three things: Mana, Attack, or Defense. So in order to prevent damage to you, you match the sequence on the defense screen.  You also collect items and abilities that you can use during battle.\n\nAnother interestign mechanic is the game provides you "recipies" on each floor. In order to get the items needed to make something, you have to defeat an enemy. Then, to actually craft it, you get a 50% chance of success. To make it greater, you can sacrific XP 9and potentially level).\n\nPros:\n- Mechanics are fun\n- Music is catchy (although can get redundant)\n- Cool crafting system (although not terribly deep)\n- You can level up above the necessary requirments if you feel like it to make it easier.\n\nCons\n- Can get grindy","January 24","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While keeping the modern-day theme, Sequence maintains a healthy dosage of humour whilst keeping al seriousness intact.\n\nWhen I played this game the music amazed me, it's hard to believe that a game can have so many good soundtracks, and with the game costing so little it's a wonder why more people don't buy it simply for the music. I give this game a 10/10 for originality.","February 16, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It also has a very compelling story that makes me want to keep playing it even  when it's been 2 hours. On top of that the music is phanominal I only wish there were more songs. I highly reccamend that you play with a controller rather than a keyboard. While it is playable on a keyboard I can get tricky when selecting spells.

Paying XP to craft... three different "arrow screens" to rotate between in battles.\n\nThere are some negatives:\n- You will play the same songs at varying difficulties through the game... I was shocked to enter the second "floor" and see that my battles were some of the same songs (some different, but some the same).\n- The writing and voice acting is annoying. If you go to negative reviews you will see this overwhelmingly stated... you can just skip the dialogue... or just not get SO bothered by it... it's not like there is a ton of dialogue in the game. There is a decent amount, but all save the tutorial is skippable.\n\nBut, as a positive, the general premise of the game is fun and it has some great ideas. It's a fun game if you don't mind "grinding" some DDR to get loot to craft items, etc.\n\nIf you can look past the negatives above and are even remotely interested in rhythm games and RPGs I suggest this game.

Now, before you scroll past this review, hold up a sec. I never liked rhythm games either, and I'm having a blast with Sequence.\n\nWhy, you ask? Well, the whole rhythm part of the game blends seamlessly with the RPG aspect. Your character has an inventory, stats and all that RPG jazz (though no choice and consequence so it's not a REAL RPG!), and from his equipment and statistics come his fighting abilities. Ky (the hero) fights with spells, casting them at his enemy if you input the correct rhythm sequence. He also has to defend and regain mana, also done by inputting the correct rhythm. Now, while he's casting spells, he can't defend or regain mana, unless you quickly switch screens during your rhythm input, a tactic which is unnecessary in the beginning but becomes more and more vital as the game goes on, and spells start to have pauses between their prompts.\n\nThis whole combination of RPG and rhythm game is brought with wonderful humour. Don't expect silly puns, lazy groaners or pretentious in-jokes, the game just approaches everything with a healthy and snarky brand of humour, from the dialogues to the item descriptions. Of course, since it's a rhythm game, the music is a very important element, and it doesn't disappoint. You'll hear a lot of it, but it never bores. The composers enlisted by Iridium to score the game have done a great job, and all the music is extremely engaging to listen to.\n\nAgain, don't be surprised if you find yourself gnashing your teeth at the screen in the beginning. Once you learn to correctly input the prompts by listening to the music, instead of visually, you'll find it becomes a lot more manageable and you'll improve in leaps. And once that happens, you'll have awesome fun with it!","April 30, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/200910/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Sequence is a Hybrid of a Rhythm game and an RPG.\nEvery combat is done in the way of a rhythm game like, say, Guitar Hero. With each battle you gain experience, materials and equipment, which you can all use to become more powerful, and face harder enemies, progressing through the story.\nThat may or may not seem like it works for you, but trust me, they've done a damn fine job with it!\n\nYou're Ky, and you wake up in a Tower, with amnesia. Everything inside feels like a weird game in which you're but a pawn. You life is in danger, or so you're told, and so you fight for survival, learning about the place and its purposes on the way.\n\nWhile the story did feel a bit cheesy for the most part, it did have a few cool ideas, and a few twists to keep it interesting. It's not the main focus on the game, but I think it added quite a lot of character to it.\n\n\n\nThere's not much in way of graphic style in this one.\nThe graphics consist mainly of hand drawn backgrounds and characters, with a bit of animation when they talk. It's not bad, by any means, just not something that you'll play this game for.\nEven during the battles, each spell you cast (more on that later) only produces a few sparkles as visual effects, but it's just enough not to feel empty. All in all, it's very simple, and let's you focus on the gameplay, while maintaining an appealing look.\nThe only criticism I have of it is that certain spells will overload the screen with particles, obstructing necessary information.\n\nAnother thing, regarding the interface. Outside of battle it's nothing special, but it's certainly easy to navigate. But when in-battle, it gives you every bit of information necessary without having to look for it too hard. And this is a great since, since this game WILL challenge your multi-tasking abilities (in a good way!).\nGood job on that! Keeping it simple, yet complete.\n\n\nI would now talk about the music, but music and gameplay are directly tied in Sequence. So I'll try to summarize gameplay and then talk about its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAs I said before, you're in a Tower. You're guided by Naia, who gives you recipes as you go along.\nYou go from floor to floor, with a Boss Fight in the end of each.\nWhen you enter a floor, you'll be given recipes for Equipment, Spells, and a Key and Inhibitor for that floor. There are 3 enemies in each, which drop 3 different materials, for you to craft later. When you craft the key, you're able to unlock the door to the next floor, and fight the Guardian.\n\nYour characters has Mana (to cast spells), Health, Defense (to lower the damage you take), and Offense (to increase the damage you deal through spells).\nYou can improve these either by leveling up, or by wearing different pieces of equipment. Equipment is mainly linear in its progression, without many sidegrades.\nTrinkets, on the other hand, are a bit different. These can improve your spells' cost, their cooldown, make battles harder to improve item drops, etc. These are actually more tailored for different types of gameplay, and some have pretty cool effects.\nSome you get by crafting, others you can get by enemy drops.\n\nThe Inhibitor is used to lower the Guardians' effects (more on that later).\n\nThen, there are spells. You can craft them, and then have to learn them. How do you learn them? You play a certain track on the game, with an added challenge (which can be a note streak, or a given accuracy). These are carefuly designed, as they would be in Guitar Hero, with different button presses following the notes' pattern (to an extent, of course).\nThey weren't too hard, mostly. But the final one was way more challenging, but also very fun to play, so I won't complain.\n\nThis pretty much it for when you're outside the battles.\n\nHow are the battles, then?\nWell, there will be arrows falling, to the beat, and you'll have to press them. Pretty simple. But that's not all, of course.\n(There are single notes, or doubles. For these, you have 2 sets of "arrows" on the controller/keyboard, to make it easier, specially on a controller. It works really well, and you'll find yourself a master of it by the end, and it feels great! The game does a very good way to constantly challenge you, making you better, without being frustrating.)\n\nIn every battle, you have 3 screens you need to pay attention to.\nOne, is your Defense screen. Each arrow you miss here will damage you, so you need to keep an eye on it.\nAnother one is your Mana screen. This one has the same spell learning pattern, making it the closest to the song, with a lot more notes. Each failed note doesn't penalize you, but you gain one Mana for each note you strike, which is needed to cast spells.\nFinally, you have your Spell screen. You have a spell wheel, with your different spells (you have a limited number that you choose outside the battles). Each has a different effect and costs more/less mana, with a bigger/lesser cooldown.\nEach time you activate a spell, its notes will start dropping. The spell is cast if you strike them all. If you fail a single on, bye bye mana.\n\nThat's it, mostly. Your objective is to lower your opponent's life before he does yours. Every piece of information (damage dealt, received, mana, etc.) is easily visible to you, which is great.\nYou will be constantly switching between these 3 screens during the battles, which sometimes gets a bit chaotic at later stages, but never too bad. The whole game is a constant balance between when you can afford to take damage, when you need mana, and so on, rarely feeling stale!\nWith each enemy is a song associated, so you'll repeat some on them quite a lot for their items/experience, but it's not too grindy.\n\nOne more important aspect is the Guardians! Each one has a special ability, that'll mess you up, during their fight, and the fights in their floor.\nThese can go from obstructing your different screens (so that you need to be there to see what's happening) to accelerating the tempo of the songs, or the last one, that switches the arrows. This one was diabolical. Everything you had learned goes to hell, and you need to play everything in reverse. But it doesn't last long, so it's all good.\nIt's these differences that keep some of the battles very interesting, and you never know when it might throw you off of your comfort zone!\n\n\nThe music was done by DJPlaeskool and Ronald Jenkees. It's a mix of electronic/synth music, with a bit of rock. It's wasn't something I was into at the start of the game, but it started growing on me. I ended up enjoying the music quite a bit, although I won't listen to most of it outside the game.\nAlthough, the last song, and so freaking epic... Man, I wasn't expecting that. That song had changes in tempo that worked great musically and from a gameplay standpoint! (It's called Piano Jam, search it on youtube). That one I'll be listening to for a while. Great job!\n\nSo, I enjoyed the music, but I do believe it lacks a bit in replayability comparatively with other rhythm games. But it's also a very unique and very well designed game. I ended up enjoying it way more than I expected, and it had many brilliant design choices.\nThere isn't much negative to say about it, really, aside from having to grind a bit, and perhaps looking a bit too simple. But even that didn't really lower the experience much for me.\n\nI really enjoyed Sequence, and I think it does a great job of mixing the rhythmic combat and RPG elements.\nOne thing though, is that during the battles, while the notes do fall on the beat, there isn't as big of a connection to the notes and there is on the Mana screen (or the spell learning). Each spell has a pattern (with some random elements) that is independent of the song, and the enemies as well. So, it might not feel like like you're playing the music.\nBut I don't think it detracts from it too much, and those modes are still present.\n\nSequence is surprisingly great!\n\n\n","June 7, 2014","true","26.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

This is a really addictive and difficult (On hard difficulty at least) rhythm RPG. You have to switch between three panels, each of which you can see in the background even if you're not using them. The defence panel is to stop attacks that enemies throw at you, any missed will cause you to take damage. The spell panel comes up with the rhythm of any spell you cast, and missing even one will cause the spell to fail. Finally, the mana panel has rhythm which fits the song and replenishes the ability to use spells. Very difficult to keep track of the three, yet whenever you mess up you KNOW it's your fault. It also lasts a fair amount of time, however the necessary random drops can be quite frustrating.

I dove right in on the highest difficulty being a DDR/stepmania veteran and found it to be indeed quite challenging, though occasionally there was an enemy type much above what I'd actually be able to defeat mixed in with two easier ones, for whatever reason.

It almost sounds absurd how badly this game wants to eat your time while pretending it's fun. If time is money then this game is on the same level as those horrendous microtransaction modeled games.\n\nThe poorly voiced dialouge is littered with social justice warrior overtones (I wish I were joking), and since all your fights are timed you'll end up wanting or needing to grind levels to hit harder faster. OH WAIT I SPENT MY EXP AND LEVELED DOWN BECAUSE THE RNG REFUSED TO CRAFT PROPERLY.\n\nDon't worry though, you can increase your chances to craft successfully by.........spending more exp per attempt.\n\nUninstalled, I regret spending money on this ♥♥♥♥ fest.","March 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

This is a shame, because it buries them in terrible design and writing.\n\nLet's start with the good.  The basic gameplay of the game revolves around a rhythm based combat system. This is similar to DDR or Stepmania, but with three step charts (one for your attacks, one to defend, and one to recharge your mana).  This system is intuitive and rewards both musical ability as well as strategy (primarily for when you attack).  If this game was just a series of songs which had to be defeated using this system it would have been great.\n\nUnfortunately the game has been lengthened with the most obnoxious forms of grind.  To get to the next boss fight and to proceed to the next area, you must craft a key.  To get the items for crafting the key you must fight the three monsters on your level.  They have a random chance of dropping various items, with some of the required items having a very low chance to drop.  And on top of this, crafting isn't guaranteed.  You can sacrifice your XP (and possibly lose levels) to increase the chance of success, but the success rate caps out at 95% so you can still fail.  If you do fail you lose everything and have to repeat your hunt for those items from scratch.\n\nThis means that the game very quickly forces you to repeat the same fight over and over and over again, long after it has ceased to be challenge anymore.  This completely killed any enjoyment I had for the game.  I have a feeling the developers added these grind elements to lengthen the amount of time that people would play the game, but it had the opposite effect for me.\n\nWhile the grinding aspects are what kill this game, I should note that the writing is also horrible.  Absolutely everything in the game, from the dialogue of every single character and every single item description, is written in this ironic hipster tone.  This might have been amusing if it had been done in moderation, but as it is every bit of text in the game is trying to show you how funny it is, when very little is even amusing (unless you find lines like "I feel like my brain got stabbed by a hobo" to be hilarious).  It also kills your sense of immersion when absolutely every character is aware (and comments on the fact) that the game mechanics don't make sense and seem to be completely artificial.","May 19, 2015","false","1.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","3"

Stepmania used to occupy all my time when I was younger, but this game is just so messy. Casting spells then waiting for them would create awful timing where you'd end up having to defend yourself by the time your spell appear, so you'd have to stagger your timing, and failing a spell will punish you with reallocating your timing between attacking and defending to regenerate your mana. To make it worst, each fight is a timelimit based on the song's length so if you get to a choppy start, you're pretty much screwed.

Combine item farming with the rather limited collection of music and you are in for one hell of a repetitive ride. Luckily this game makes up for all of its errors with its impressive voice acting; the various bosses you meet have various distinct personalities that make them super memorable. The game presentation is also very beautiful and organized. The music, although limited, is ridiculously catchy.

It's logical to assume that defense decreases the damage you take from missed gems, which is in turn multiplied by the gem color, but no indication is given about how much defense reduces how much damage.\nCoupled with the fact that you can't see actual concrete stats from enemies (only vague bars), and the RPG mechanics seem to be a gimick that was tacked on to a rhythm game to make it 'harder' without requiring them to add more songs or harder difficulties for the songs.\n\nUltimately, I'd rather play something like Stepmania on the harder difficulties for my Rhythm game fix, and then play an RPG like Dragon Age or one of the various Elder Scrolls.\n\nI give this game a 2/5.

Now to meet anyone that says: maybe you're just bad at rhythm games, maybe I am, but I the music alone is not motivating and doesn't telegraph much of a downbeat let alone figuring out the count.\n\nThe game tries extremely hard to be hip and ironic.

I would enjoy this IMMENSELY more if there were multiplayer. Fighting against stale AI is pretty dull, but I like it for what it is.\n\nThe dialog is full of excruciatingly bad deliveries of unwitty jokes and poor "insightful" satirical sarcasm that belittles people's intelligence in an almost superfluously verbose manner (as if they are talking to a child). I don't need the explanations of these poor attempts at "correcting" whoever they are trying to correct and I am sure most people didn't eg., when they say the word "Mana" and say it is pronounced "Mah-na", It came off so pretentious and belittling. It would just be so much better if they didn't have this unnecessary dialog for the tutorial, people want to get straight to the gameplay and see if they like it before wasting an hour of dialog! I know how "Mana" is pronounced, I am sure most avid gamers are familiar with it and even MTG players. BUT the MAIN character, I guess because of the personality he was given? He speaks FOR me. He called Naia annoying, dear god is she annoying! The voice actor who did her, I don't know if it was a girlfriend of one of the developers or something, but she has that valley girl voice that makes me want to rip my hair out every time I hear her vocal fry. She stutters here and there and fails to convey her credibility as a "guardian" in the game. Despite her lines and voice acting being terrible, the main character proves a redeeming glimmer of hope of tolerance.\n\nBeing there were some sound issues already, I expect way more and some of the sfx are not mixed into the overall game volume very well.\n\nThe music, thus far, is pretty bland. It would be better if they were all original tracks catered to the players and developers.\n\nI recommend the game if you can catch it on sale or in a bundle or if you have a 10-16 year old sis/bro, otherwise I'd say to go find a different rhythm game. If multiplayer comes to be in this concept, then it's on!","August 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","4"

I expected an RPG with rhythm based combat, like it actually advertises. But it falls short on every level, except for the music. The music is actually something that I enjoyed listening to. The graphics are very basic; the art looks ok, but there are basically no animations. It feels very empty and simple. I'll admit I can't expect a 'retail quality' game for this price, it's true. But still, if you build expectations you better deliver.\nThe combat is a nice idea, but poorly executed. You pick an enemy from a list (I know, right?) and then fight it by pressing buttons on the beat of the music. It's nothing fancy, and about everything is text based, items included.\nYou explore the tower by picking levels from a list as well. Wait, what?\nThere's just no style; it doesn't stand out.

The extra gimmick of this game is that you simultaneously fight against monster and there are different rhytm lines for Mana, Attack and Defence. See some videos about this, if you want to know more as I am not going to explain this further in this review.\n\nThis little gimmick is not bad, but it isn't revolutionary either. In the end the game is extremely bland and for a person like me who isn't fan of this kind of genre, the game was waste of time excluding funny conversations that the characters make in the story that gave some delight. What makes me not to recommend this game is that it is very repetitive. There is only a few of songs and the gimmick that this game has is seen very quickly.\n\n\nGrade: 5/10\n\nI would only recommend this to a person who is fan of this genre and who has tried all other variations of this kind of games.\n\nLast edit was to change Grade from 4 to 5 to be more in line with my other reviews.","November 26, 2013","false","15.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

There's the defense field in which you defend against incoming attacks by aggressors by blocking their attacks pressing the corresponding keys.  The spell field in which you cast spells with different effects such as DoT, healing, or fast recharge low damage spells.  And the mana field in which you replenish mana, which is used to cast spells, you can only have one of these fields open at a time and there is a time limit for defeating the monster, which is an interesting concept.  The monsters have a chance of dropping various items, the lower the more rare and they all give a different amount of experience. You use your experience to craft items, spell scrolls, or keys which you use to use to progress, herein lies some of the problems of the game.  It feels like a grind, just a huge grind.  You end up wasting so much time either killing the same monster over and over again to find that ONE item you need to make better gear or spells, and you can end up wasting all of that precious expereince you earned making you down on experience, although you do lose out on some items.  It just gets very very repetitive around floor four you notice none of the spells bring anything new to the table.  It doesn't help the writing isn't super compelling.  Not to mention the music is reused and the only time you feel like you're actually playing a rhythm game is when you're in the mana field, which is when the keys actually feel like they correspond to the music.  It's got cute ideas but it's riddled with flaws, it's worth checking out if you feel confident sinking money into just to get a feel for it, hey if you're into the grind and slamming on keys for 10 seconds at a time (roughly how long it takes to get your mana replensihed) then be my guest.","November 27, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's more engaging and introspective than most games you will have played.\n- There is a lot of humour to be found in the game; almost every item name and description is a joke.\n- Even the credits are engaging and fun to sit through. Great game design from the start of the game until the very end.\n- A level of difficulty for everyone, with a good curve.\n\nIf you are still not convinced, just watch the trailer and see the greatness of the game and the person behind it.","July 22, 2012","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkapplepolisher/recommended/200910/","darkapplepolisher","Salvia Hardon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkapplepolisher/","689 products in account","Very unique spin on an otherwise commonly used rhythm game mechanic.\n\nAnyone who has played rhythm games is all too familiar with the standard mechanic of having 4 columns of arrows falling in tune with the music. Sequence manages to make a very strong tactical/multi-tasking game out of it by having 3 seperate grids. One grid is the mana grid, which you use to get mana to cast spells - it's very common to miss lots of beats here in preference to landing beats on the other 2 grids. This is also where the beats primarily follow the song. Another grid is the defensive grid - beats that fall here and you don't hit will reduce your HP until you hit 0 and lose. The other grid is the spell grid. At any time you have the mana for it, you can choose to cast a spell - the effects vary from dealing damage to the enemy, healing, lifestealing, hitting the enemy with damage over time, giving yourself a mana boost, boosting the strength of the next spell you cast. Each individual spell has its own beat combination that doesn't change with the exception of inverting a few presses, left instead of right, etc, and also significant changes between difficulties. All these different spells are balanced by difficulty of input, how much blank space is there in between beats (to allow for swapping to other grids), as well as cooldown before you can cast that same spell again. Anything less than 100% on a spell input results in it failing, going on cooldown, and using up mana.\n\nAll those different factors result in a very frantic level of multi-tasking that I have never seen in this genre, and continuously leaves me mentally engaged, instead of just sitting back and hitting buttons corresponding to a beatmap all day. Incredibly satisfied with Sequence for gameplay originality and engagement.\n\nMusic: I'm not that big of an electronica fan, however, Ronald Jenkees has made a good effort to change my mind on that. The music for the beatmaps are all catchy. DJplaeskool did a good job with the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nWriting/dialogue: There is a large community wide disagreement between enjoyment and annoyance of the dialogue between the 2 main characters, so your mileage will vary heavily in that regard. What I can say from an objective point of view is that it is very mechanically solid, all the characters in the game have lots of personality, and the voice acting also performs just as well as the writing.\n\nStory: The story is neat and fairly original, and with an excellent great reveal at the end.\n\nRPG Elements: Probably my least favorite aspect of the game, but they work solidly enough. In order to progress to a higher level in the tower, you need to do the same 3 beatmaps on the existing level enough times to collect enough drops to craft a key to be able to start the boss fight to go to the next level. This part is just fine, since it encourages a not-excessive amount of replaying the same content to a good amount of replayability. By collecting those drops, you can also craft items that make it so your spells are stronger, you have more survivability, and/or a larger mana pool. There's also experience that gets used to improve those stats via level ups, and gets used in crafting. The big reason why I'm iffy on this, is that especially on the higher difficulties, I put myself in a dilemma of whether I just need to get less bad at the game, or if I just need to grind out some better stats to give me a better fighting chance.\n\nOverall: All the parts come to work together without any major flaws to spoil the image, and where the game truly excels is its innovative take with the 3-grid system.","December 6, 2014","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/200910/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Personally used a DS4 gamepad for Sequence. Having played through it using only the gamepad, I have no idea how it handles with a keyboard, but I can say that the gamepad felt completely natural to use. Switching through the fields using the triggers was outright cathartic.\n\nSequence is a gameplay-focused game, and the gameplay is as fantastic as it is interesting. The field-based rhythm combat isn't just a novelty, it has handfuls of legitimate merit. I'd even go so far as to call it innovative. The inherent multi-tasking and battle system means that the game is less execution-heavy than you might like, but playing on Hard did mean that Piano Jam left my fingers aching nonetheless.\n\nBattle system itself revolves around the use of skills and micromanaging several fields. Things start to fall apart here - the usefulness of skills is determined by your stats (automatically allocated after each level-up) entirely and utterly. Pulling off a skill doesn't nearly matter as much as the stats behind it, and at several points in the game I had to go to a previous area to grind up a few levels because I was simply unable to deal enough damage to defeat an enemy in the time allocated (you only have until the song ends). Taking into account that the insurmountable enemies in question were rather easy otherwise, it was a total chore.\n\nStats don't belong in this game - instead of skillfully outmaneuvering the enemy through sick beats, you're either painfully chipping away at their health pool or utterly annihilating them, and all in the space of about 2-3 levels.\n\nThe reason this game has so many stats is because it also bills itself as an RPG, and stats are a required part of that I guess. It fails as one. There's no sense of playing a role whatsoever, and the worldbuilding is so thin it completely collapses under itself at several points. All the item descriptions are all completely irrelevant puns (funny ones, but quick wit doesn't flesh out a world), and the entire premise is waved off by the characters as intentionally arbitrary, which tries as hard to engage as a prince betrothed to a simian. This game is about as much an RPG as your average dating sim.\n\nYou progress through the game through the game's shallow crafting system. Choose an enemy to fight, and they have a chance to drop an item. Use these items to craft an item that will allow you to progress to the next area. How quickly you are able to craft this item depends on whether or not an enemy decides to drop the item. While it should be noted that there are some late-game items that increase item drop rate, the progression remains steadfastly a nightmare. Farming for items isn't fun. Whoever thought it was fun is a monster.\n\nCombine this with that crafting recipes requires EXP. On it's own, this is a fantastic idea. However, combined with the stat-dependent gameplay and already tedious farm-based progression, it does nothing but serve to remind yourself how much of a chore it should have been to get through the game, had it not had the lucky break of being legitimately enjoyable to play. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon, though.\n\nThe character banter is alright, though the story is so horrendous that I was left shocked by the sheer contrived garage leaking out of that final 10 minute exposition dump that sold itself as an ending. Shocked at a point I'd long since become apathetic. It's almost impressive how bad the plot is. The weak sense of intrigue initially spiked is just dragged out and finally shot like a dying dog. The super secret Sequel hook is hilariously nothing as well.\n\nArt direction, I found, was fine, outside of rather cheap-looking UI. There's not enough of it though - there's a total of about 8 area images, and a single sprite per character or monster. No CGs for major events, and even those scarce few images are reused to hell and back. There's budget, and then there's ridiculous.\n\nIn spite of these problems, I completely and totally recommend that you play Sequence. The choice of music is stellar, the mechanics responsive, and as a whole the game is plain fun. The gameplay doesn't just carry it, it vaults it to the finish line. I'd love to see a sequel.\n\nRegardless of its other issues (they're important to know, and I've spent the majority of the review ragging on them as a result), they're superficial to the very meaty game itself. And that's the bottom line.","December 25, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ending isn't what you would expect, either, and will have you going ".../what" along with the characters. The music is great to groove out to, there are four difficulties for the musically (dis)inclined, and the background art is beautiful.\nA little caution if you're against people joking around 80% of the time and making pop culture or using memes. You aren't able to choose the songs that you can play, outside the three you're given for a level, but thankfully the songs never get annoying.\nAll in all, it's a pretty fun game, and is well worth the $5 you pay for it.

If a game that combines rhythm game and RPG appeals to you then this game would be something to look at even if that combination of genre wasn't so rare.\n\nFirst off to all the people who aren't scared off from thinking of potential problems or weirdness already, it's not just "let's smash these genres together". It's very functional as a rhythm game and they made that part of gameplay the "battle" portion of the RPG. You switch between "fields" to either defend against attacks, cast spells or regain mana. The balance of strength of attacks and difficulty pulling them off feels nice and natural and the game overall feels just wonderfully made. Like any RPG you might need to grind a little but just remember to pay attention to getting good equipment and good spell usage and it shouldn't get too bad. I think the only negative I can really think about gameplay is there isn't any "turn based" alternative for anyone that isn't physically capable of playing a timing based game, but for the rest of it it's good to go.\n\nMusic and visual aesthetics might depend a bit on individual taste to say for sure but I personally loved both in this game.  The story is awesome too, unlike a lot of other RPG's it doesn't give you a ton of story which works since plenty of the interest comes in the mystery and uncertainty. You get just a few cutscenes every floor, long enough to enjoy the strange characters but not so long you forget you're playing a video game. Trust me there's not really any throw away characters.\n\nSaddly as much as I'd like to go on I don't know how much deeper I can dig without risking any spoilers or rambling on too much, but trust me when I say this is a unique gem of a game worth playing through to the end.","February 23, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/recommended/200910/","katosepe","Katosepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/","603 products in account","Games like Sequence are the reason Kickstarter and the Indie Game movement exist. It's not a perfect game, not everyone is going to enjoy it and it will never receive a lot of fame and recognition. However, for the niche audience that can appreciate it, Sequence is a game like no other.\n\nThe closest thing I can relate Sequence to is Puzzle Quest. The game doesn't play like Puzzle Quest but what that game did for Match-3 games, Sequence does for the rhythm genre. The base game has you traveling up a tower by fighting enemies, collecting their dropped items, and synthesising items such as keys, weapons and armor. Battles give you experience which will level up your stats while armor and weapons are equipable and can also improve your abilities.\n\nWhere Sequence differs from the average dungeon crawler is that combat is played out by putting you in a rhythm system similar to StepMania, if you're using a keyboard, but with three separate boards. One board is defensive, one board is for building mana and one is for casting spells. On the first board, any notes that you miss will count as damage against you so catching them defends your HP. The second board will have a constant stream of notes. Missing them doesn't hurt you but catching them restores your mana which you need to cast spells. The last board stays dormant until you cast spells, the only way to damage your opponents. When you cast a spell, it takes mana and makes you complete a short rhythm sequence. Failing it causes the spell to fail but completing it will cast that spell. While it can be a lot to juggle at once, the game does a great job of teaching you and ramping up the difficulty slowly in order to build your skills both in game and out.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is fun for a while but as the entire game is built around grinding items and EXP, it would get boring very quickly if it weren't for the well written story pushing players forward. The tone reminded me of The World Ends With You in the best possible way, but felt wholy unique. Your main character finds himself waking up in a tower with no idea how he got there. The voice of a girl named Naia tells you that you are stuck in this tower/game and you will need to make your way up 7 floors to escape so off you go. While there are some predictable moments, the story as a whole never becomes too transparent and despite a few moments when I swore I was done after one more battle, curiosity kept me pushing ever forward. The characters are all voiced as well and while none are particularly mind-blowing, it's a nice touch and the quality stayed consistent throughout. If you do find your bar set particularly high in regards to VO quality, they do have an option to turn it off as well although I doubt this will be necessary for most people.\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't without it's rough spots. For a music-based game, Sequence has a surprisingly limited soundtrack of only about 10 songs that show up in battle. This means several monsters will have you playing the same songs repeatedly. Thankfully, they aren't bad and some of them I didn't mind repeating but considering each monster all but requires multiple playthroughs anyway, don't be surprised if you wind up hearing the same song 10+ times. As that suggests too, the gameplay is simply too grindy and while item drops are pretty common, it can be irritating when you need one specific item and have to fight the same monster over and over just to move forward. Finally, the song balance is a bit odd as by the end of the game, the length of the song decided more battles for me than my HP did. It felt like very artificial difficulty (you lose if the song ends before killing the enemy) and it would have been nicer to have some of the songs be just a bit longer, especially in Floor 7. Depending on your strategy, you may not have a problem with this but it showed up several times in my game.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for something different and enjoy music gameplay, Sequence is worth a shot.","March 2, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays pretty intuitively, although it can be a little complex, and the difficulty doesn't seem to scale very well, as the settings are awkwardly simple, boringly simple, and from there are just horrendously complex, especially when first begining the game.

It's painful.  If you watch the trailer and listen to one of the devs trying way too hard to be hip while describing the game, you'll understand why it turned out this way.\n\nSadly the music is a low point as well.

This game is good, but it's not as great as I thought it would be.  The lack of RPG elements beyond combat and item use really kind of hobbles the game. This would be great if it fell back heavily on the rhythm game aspect of the game, because that genuinely shines.  The problem is, there are only a very small handful of songs.  Very small.   Each area, you don't get random encounters, you get a small stable of enemies to CHOOSE from.  Combat gets you items to combine into the key that gets you to the next area.  You will fight these same enemies over and over until you get the drops you want, playing through the same light airy techno/electronic music over and over.  The artwork is beautiful, if amateurish (it looks like it's hand painted by someone's really artistic friend), and the dialogue is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic, and delivered very sarcastically and deadpan.

Normally, RPGs and music games both face issues, but I can't readily see them in this title. It took the gameplay of Rockband: Unplugged for the PSP and made it actually functional, and into an intuitive battle system. The RPG elements, with the ability to gain and lose levels as you spend time bettering your character, made character building interesting and every upgrade felt impactful. The voice acting was well done too, though similarly with There Came an Echo the character development was not endearing, focused too much on antagonistic dialouge rather than meaningful trait building. Still, however, you can skip these scenes so you can get away from that as much as possible.\n\nThe game itself, I'll warn, has little replay value. There's no software to add custom tracks like in Audiosurf, the music gets used on multiple levels and, given you are grinding, you get to hear the songs over and over again. If the music was bad, this would have been worse of an issue but I can't honestly say that the songs were terrible and didn't go so far as to play abrasive music from Dubstep, etc. Other things I'd change would be additions of things like local PvP, clearer labeling on the spell circle to tell which spell was which and what numbers corresponded to which slice of the circle, and more than seven levels/three battle senarios per level.\n\nAll in all it is a fun game. For 5$, it has about as much content as you'd expect and with as polished as it looks, sounds, and feels I can't recommend it enough.","March 14, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not certain? Still worth a look.\n\nPlayable with the keyboard, a gamepad, or a dance pad (which I really want to try one of these days), the basic gist of the gameplay is hitting arrows in time with a beat a la DDR. For the Puzzle Quest influence, this has an RPG story where you beat monsters to collect items and proceed up a tower. You flip between three "boards": one board's arrows are attacks aimed at you, and clearing the arrow defends against the attack; one board will regenerate your mana; a third board is active when you cast a spell, and nailing that sequence means your spell succeeds.\n\nThe dialogue is refreshingly snarky, and fully voice-acted.\n\nThe all-important question: how's the music?

The game looked to be just the right mix between rhythm and RPG elements, with a fun soundtrack to back it up. Unfortunately the game gets a little too grindy for my taste - you can beat pretty much any encounter in the game provided that you're a high enough level.\n\nLeveling up is a chore though, and the bonus for beating an enemy skillfully isn't enough to outweigh the immense grind. A lot of the depth of the game involved simple grinding to get better levels, as later bosses had too much health and an item or a couple of levels was enough to make it easy. The grinding is really boring though as the regular creatures usually don't pose much threat.\n\nIf you're a fan of rhythm games I'd recommend picking it up, but if you're new maybe give it a pass or play it on a lower difficulty. I played it on Hard because it said "for the not musically challenged," but most of the difficulty came from luck not going in my favor.","February 6, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Which probably sounds daunting but the game's tailored to all varieties of skill levels.  And then you add in a pretty solid soundtrack and genuinely enjoyable writing and art and you've got a very solid package.\n\nThat said, be ready to (ugh) grind.  There's a heavy RNG factor that can force you to repeat content or spontaneously penalize you, and that really does drag down the game.

The game plays much like StepMania (DDR without the dancing) although there is an intersting field switch mechanic which you need to exploit to clear the stages.  Alot of odd design decisions went into this game; spend your experince to maybe get an item, craft required items in order to progress the stage, challenge the same stage over and over in hopes of getting key components.  It all adds up to repetitively grinding the same monsters on the same handful of songs over and over in order to progress.  I can only imagine these were added to help artifically increase the length of the game, which would otherwise be extremely short, which leads me into my major issue with the game; the writing.\nWriting is an issue which it's much better successor shares, everyone is so contrived in following along with the plotline, In this iteration, the protaginist and the supporting heroine are set up as antagonists, but engage in half hearted bickering until events contrive to have the hero off rescuing her a couple in game hours after their intitial meeting; what changed to reconcile these two advesaries?  A couple of passing comments wich imply the possibly the heroine is not 100% commited to organization which is forcing the hero to risk his life.  If only it was that easy for me to reconcile with my enemies.  The story climax involves a forced moral objection to something which, when you think about it, isn't all that bad, which has the hero vowing to commit his life to destroying those responsible and taking on substatial personal risk in the interium.  This isn't a crusader of justice, it's suposedly a VERY bright college kid caught up in a risky mis-adventure.  In real life, 10 of 10 of such kids would not tell the head of a powerful multinational organization which managed to abduct them and spirt them away to tower of death, that not only will you not forgive them, you'll make it your life's work to destroy them for the crime of  setting you up on a blind date","June 16, 2015","false","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing the player is treated to is the banter between the protaganist and his unseen guide.  The voice acting is good and the dialogue is consistently amusing with the occasional chuckle-worthy highlight.\n\nAt each level the player is encouraged to create objects from recipes but the raw materials for each recipe are only acquired by defeating enemies.  The basic enemies drop one, two, or three different materials based on individual percentages so a specific drop is never guaranteed.  This requires the grind for which RPGs are famous.  The objects created from these recipes aren't required to progress in the game but because battles are resolved in fun rhythm challenges ala Dance Dance Revolution, why not obtain the materials to create the objects and try them out?\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that the first boss I encountered was an Internet meme and my interest is only piqued to see what subsequent levels will bring.\n\nYou know you.  If resolving RPG combat by playing a rhythm game doesn't sound like fun to you, then take a pass on Before the Echo.  Otherwise, take a chance on it and you will likely be glad you did.","December 4, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Taking rhythm to the next level, you are forced to pay attention to up to three separate flows of arrows at the same time..and all while keeping beat. Utilizing the Dance Dance Revolution style of rhythm game, these arrows shall be used for offense, defense, and recovery as you battle your way through foe after foe.\n\nWhat can make it particularly exciting is that no two battles are alike: by using your spells at different times, you essentially 'remix' the steps within the song yourself, providing a somewhat-new spin time and again.\n\nOf course, with a rhythm game, you want its soundtrack to shine, and Before the Echo does not disappoint. With a variety of techno-like beats providing you with sweet ear-candy, you'll find yourself swaying or bobbing to the beat as you work to defeat your foes.\n\nWe've had Puzzle/Bejweled meets RPG in titles such as Puzzle Quest, and now the rhythm genre seeks to remix..and so far, it's shining.","November 28, 2011","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly, the gameplay is spot on. Like most rhythm games you are simply required to hit buttons in time to the music, but Sequence has some interesting mechanics. You have three lanes of incoming notes that you can switch between at any time. One of them is defensive; any notes you miss here deplete your health. In another lane you must time your button presses to increase your mana, which is used for spellcasting. The third lane is for the spells themselves. Once you cast a spell you need to hit a short sequence of notes in this lane for the spell to actually take effect.\n\nThis leads to quite a frenetic experience where you're constantly shifting between offense and defense. It can be frustrating and it takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's pure gaming bliss that rivals the old classic Amplitude, not to mention Guitar Hero.\n\nThe other, and possibly more significant, reason to play this game is the music. Much of the music is provided by Ronald Jenkees, a man of prodigious melodic talent. I've played Sequence for a good few hours, but I've spent much, much more time listening to the music of Jenkees. It's truly phenomenal, and even if you have no interest in this game I'd recommend checking it out.\n\nSequence is not perfect. There are RPG elements, and while they work well enough I can't help thinking that so, so much more could have been done with them. I'm put in mind of Puzzle Quest, another game which combined RPG elements with a totally different style of game, but did it in a much more dynamic way. Perhaps the makers of Sequence didn't have the time or resources to go that far, but I do believe they could have come up with something a little more compelling that repetitive grind they've got in this game.

It's the unique gameplay that Sequence carries.\n\nYes, on first glance, it's like Dance Dance Revolution. However it's unique because you play three different windows that you can switch to at any time. One window is for defense, one is for regaining MP, and the other is for spells you cast. I kind of feel like a music mixer by switching between these three windows constantly and hitting several notes.\n\nThe thing that also makes Sequence shine is the fact that it has so much potential in its core game that it's one of those few games out there that could spawn a successful sequel if it wanted to! It's also a quick game (took me 7-8 hours to 100% the game on normal difficulty, maybe another hour or two to get the rest of the achievements) with lots of replayability in the other difficulty levels.

One is a Defense panel where when your monster attacks notes will popup and for every miss you start loosing hp. In your attack panel notes will appear depending on what spell you cast. Some will deal damage some will heal you and others will cast buff/debuff on the playing fields. The difficulty will change appropriately at least for people who have played the konami music games.

The more I discover about this game the more I want to keep playing.\n\nEven if it's a great game, I wouldn't recommend it to people who have difficulties with rhythm (didn't look through all the difficulty levels though). As an exemple, it isn't a game for my brother... but he does enjoy watching me play it. Also, some might find it a bit repetitive, I could understand why but so is every RPG or RPG-like game.\n\nPersonnaly, it doesn't bother me, and it offers an ok variety of good music and intersting small adds to the gameplay along the way to not mind the little repetetiveness. This game has also a great pick up and play feel to it. Sometimes I just don't know what to play, my mouse is far away from me and I look for a game simple (yet more elaborated than a phone game) and enjoyable while browsing my library and Sequence fast became one of those games that I would just pick up, quickly remember where I left off and get back in right away.\n\nIf you're ok/good with rhythm and looking for something different then you should absolutly buy it!

The DDR Max-RPG hybrid system works flawlessly, the voice acting is top notch, and the dialogue is great. Little touches such as being able to spend experience points to increase synthesis success, having a practice mode to work on your timing, and more are all done well. The hand painted enviornments look gorgeous, and the character and enemy designs are great, although a couple of the later enemies are palette swaps of the early ones. The soundtrack is great, with several catchy songs you'll find yourself humming in the shower later. Unfortunately, the number of tracks is rather limited, and each enemy is assigned only one song, but the songs are still good enough that they don't get annoying. The only flaw I can find is that there is no free play mode, as at this point I have reached such a high level that even the hardest battles only take around thirty seconds to win. Still, its hard to fault a game for not letting you replay it enough, so I'll conclude by saying that this is the single best indie title I have had the pleasure of playing on Steam. A fantastic game that should be enjoyed by all.","November 28, 2013","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One regains mana as you hit notes, one blocks incoming damage when you hit the notes, and one is for casting spells.

And yet, this game exists.\n\nI'm not going to lie, there is a bit of a learning curve at first, but once you adjust to the (surprisingly smooth) concept of managing three different DDR boards at once, all in different fashions and priorities, the game really flows well.  The story is interesting, and the descriptions and names of the items you get really show how much the developers enjoyed making the game.  Speaking of the devs, they read the credits at the end, which plays out as more of a DVD commentary than a bland credit list.  This was actually the first time I've really cared about a credit sequence for anything, ever, so props to them for that.","December 30, 2011","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an excellent game with a really creative core and solid execution.  Full voice acting really helps to make the game feel more fully developed then the JRPG style 2D pictures would otherwise make you feel.\n\nMusic is excellent and really well made, however grinding for levels and items does mean you'll hear the same songs over and over again.  In the end, I think it was a valiant effort but I can definitely see how some people would tire from the inevitable grinding necessary to progress.\n\nIf you do give it a try, make sure you have a controller (or preferably a dance mat,) as the game is clearly designed with a controller in mind.\n\nOverall probably worth the price, but definitely not for everyone.","December 3, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I'm not going describing it in one word. I'm going to describe it in as many words as I can--and--hopefully in the clearest way possible. As the trailers will tell you Sequence is a lot like a DDR game. It has a great mix of rhythm and rpg elements laced within 4.99 (and as I write this review, 1.99) dollars of pure fun. The games mechanics sound difficult at first but once you get a grasp of them it really is just like a dance stepping game (dance stepping...yeah). You have three different fields, Magic, Defense, and Mana that you must use to defend yourself against a selection of creative monsters and even more creative (or perhaps creative-er...if that were a word) bosses in order to solve four things: Where are you? Who took you to said where? Who is this chick talking to you over an intercom system? Why the heck is there an intercom system in what looks to be a tower straight from a fantasy game?\nThe games plot: You are a young man named Ky, a university student who was brought to some unknown world where each wrong move could essentially be your last. But not to worry though! A very slick talking female voice is there to help you through your adventure through conveluted tower. With her aid you'll hopefully beat all fo the bosses and get to the 7th floor of the tower and...well...that's all the game tells you.\nOne thing I will tell you though is if you are looking for closure this isn't the game for that. The ending to this game isn't bad--no I found it highly satisfying. But it felt very cliff hanger...y for a game that as of right now is just a one shot. I assume this is so it can have some kind of sequel. Something I personally have my fingers crossed for. The music is wonderful, I'd never heard of Ronald Jenkins before this game and let me tell you I'm glad I did. Go ahead and look up his music to get a taste of what you'll hear in-game.\nAs with any grinding rpg you may find yourself feeling a bit bored from the repetitive fights, forging of materials through recipies and other little minute chores you have to do in the game. But I personally believe the music is what helps bring it together. Nothing ever really FEELS like a chore in this game. The monsters are relatively balanced, after you defeat and gather what you need for a boss you will feel like top dog for a few brief moments before getting brought back down a peg or two from the next monster one floor up. The only complaint I have is that the particle effect is too much for my computer and has a tendency to lag and affect your rhythm. This could just be my computer though. The dialogue is very well versed and thought out. Smooth gameplay mechanics and you rarely feel any mistakes made is anything but your own.\nAnd the item descriptions. Oh the item descriptions.\nNeedless to say, I have a bit of a bias for this game and I want anyone reading this to take that in terms with this review. This is a very niche kind of game. If you love DDR games you'll love this to death I'm sure. But I do recommend checking it out for its low price alone.","June 19, 2014","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a little hesitant at first to pay even the 90% off price because the trailer on the store page made the game sound rather complicated, and I wasn't sure how the gameplay would hold up.\n\nHowever, I wound up caving and figured I'd buy it for the heck of it, and I'm really glad I did. Sequence is an excellent, solid game if you can play through everything. The soundtrack is wonderful, the game's artwork is spectacular, and the writing is witty and interesting which makes for a fun playthrough.\n\nI've been actively trying to get my friends into playing because I wanted to share how wonderful this game really is. I'm commonly asked what it's like, which I'd have to say is really similar to Dance Dance Revolution, but played with the keyboard's arrow keys. It's definitely easier once you know the songs and beats, because you have to match hitting the falling arrows in time with the music, essentially.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough.

I don't know why I bought it and when it was over a piece of me went with it.\nTruely one of the few inde games you will apreciate.\n\nSure I like some fun rythm games every now and then and maybe some games that will challenge me to be a better player, but what keeps me hooked until the end is that storyline. I'm all about the feels and this game's storyline delivers it.\n\nSTORY: 10/10\nEverything about this game feels like a budget game, but the voice acting and the music and thought put into the story developement drove it home for me. I truely felt like I was experiencing all of the hard work each person put into this game I even took a moment of pause and watched the credits. its that good.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\nLets be honest, rythm games are very hard to be creative with. You can only do so much to make a person appriciate the music and stay with the beat before it becomes too difficult or too generic.  They did a great job with attempting to give you more than just a beat to hit some buttons with, they gave you enemies to hammer down and spell combos to add a twist to the mix of some pretty good beats.\n\nAt first, juggling through 3 different rythm windows in a battle along with a timer taunting you to the very nano second to hammer out the best moves orElseUlolFail@life can be intimidating, but it actually makes a ton of sense and you feel like youre really battling it out with some baddies while head bobbing to the beat. For what they had to work with, this is something to really try out for yourself.\n\nART: 8/10\nThis isnt some blockbuster game that had millions of dollars backing it along with teams of graphic designers, so dont expect amazing CG movie like animations here ladies. The art for each stage is very unique and even melds with the music and the tone of the story. The characters do seem budget like, but by no means are they generic.\n\nREPLAY: 5/10\nSometimes the replay has to justify the price, and this game definately had the opportunity to get some DLCs going of side quests, a battle arena for other players, hell even an after the tower storyline. I really did enjoy the game for what its worth, but after playing the entire thing including the extras in the first run I wished there was something more to comeback to later on.\n\n\nConclusion: I know you will pass buy this game as your browsing through the store looking for a quick fix and overlook it. I honestly dont recall what made me buy it in the first place, but I am glad I did and I am pretty sure you will be too. If youre that strapped, its just 5 bucks and you get a lot more bang for your buck from this game than you would for whatever 5 bucks can get you nowadays. Pick up this game and enjoy the adventure.","January 3, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know why I bought it and when it was over a piece of me went with it.\nTruely one of the few inde games you will apreciate.\n\nSure I like some fun rythm games every now and then and maybe some games that will challenge me to be a better player, but what keeps me hooked until the end is that storyline. I'm all about the feels and this game's storyline delivers it.\n\nSTORY: 10/10\nEverything about this game feels like a budget game, but the voice acting and the music and thought put into the story developement drove it home for me. I truely felt like I was experiencing all of the hard work each person put into this game I even took a moment of pause and watched the credits. its that good.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\nLets be honest, rythm games are very hard to be creative with. You can only do so much to make a person appriciate the music and stay with the beat before it becomes too difficult or too generic.  They did a great job with attempting to give you more than just a beat to hit some buttons with, they gave you enemies to hammer down and spell combos to add a twist to the mix of some pretty good beats.\n\nAt first, juggling through 3 different rythm windows in a battle along with a timer taunting you to the very nano second to hammer out the best moves orElseUlolFail@life can be intimidating, but it actually makes a ton of sense and you feel like youre really battling it out with some baddies while head bobbing to the beat. For what they had to work with, this is something to really try out for yourself.\n\nART: 8/10\nThis isnt some blockbuster game that had millions of dollars backing it along with teams of graphic designers, so dont expect amazing CG movie like animations here ladies. The art for each stage is very unique and even melds with the music and the tone of the story. The characters do seem budget like, but by no means are they generic.\n\nREPLAY: 5/10\nSometimes the replay has to justify the price, and this game definately had the opportunity to get some DLCs going of side quests, a battle arena for other players, hell even an after the tower storyline. I really did enjoy the game for what its worth, but after playing the entire thing including the extras in the first run I wished there was something more to comeback to later on.\n\n\nConclusion: I know you will pass buy this game as your browsing through the store looking for a quick fix and overlook it. I honestly dont recall what made me buy it in the first place, but I am glad I did and I am pretty sure you will be too. If youre that strapped, its just 5 bucks and you get a lot more bang for your buck from this game than you would for whatever 5 bucks can get you nowadays. Pick up this game and enjoy the adventure.","January 3, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a pleasent surprise, one of my favorite games I bought during winter sale (though even at full price it would be a good buy).\n\nIt's fresh and funny. The concept of a rhythm game mixt with RPG is well executed. The voice acting is great and I Iove the light and humorious dialogues. The more I discover about this game the more I want to keep playing.\n\nEven if it's a great game, I wouldn't recommend it to people who have difficulties with rhythm (didn't look through all the difficulty levels though). As an exemple, it isn't a game for my brother... but he does enjoy watching me play it. Also, some might find it a bit repetitive, I could understand why but so is every RPG or RPG-like game.\n\nPersonnaly, it doesn't bother me, and it offers an ok variety of good music and intersting small adds to the gameplay along the way to not mind the little repetetiveness. This game has also a great pick up and play feel to it. Sometimes I just don't know what to play, my mouse is far away from me and I look for a game simple (yet more elaborated than a phone game) and enjoyable while browsing my library and Sequence fast became one of those games that I would just pick up, quickly remember where I left off and get back in right away.\n\nIf you're ok/good with rhythm and looking for something different then you should absolutly buy it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/recommended/200910/","katosepe","Katosepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/","603 products in account","Games like Sequence are the reason Kickstarter and the Indie Game movement exist. It's not a perfect game, not everyone is going to enjoy it and it will never receive a lot of fame and recognition. However, for the niche audience that can appreciate it, Sequence is a game like no other.\n\nThe closest thing I can relate Sequence to is Puzzle Quest. The game doesn't play like Puzzle Quest but what that game did for Match-3 games, Sequence does for the rhythm genre. The base game has you traveling up a tower by fighting enemies, collecting their dropped items, and synthesising items such as keys, weapons and armor. Battles give you experience which will level up your stats while armor and weapons are equipable and can also improve your abilities.\n\nWhere Sequence differs from the average dungeon crawler is that combat is played out by putting you in a rhythm system similar to StepMania, if you're using a keyboard, but with three separate boards. One board is defensive, one board is for building mana and one is for casting spells. On the first board, any notes that you miss will count as damage against you so catching them defends your HP. The second board will have a constant stream of notes. Missing them doesn't hurt you but catching them restores your mana which you need to cast spells. The last board stays dormant until you cast spells, the only way to damage your opponents. When you cast a spell, it takes mana and makes you complete a short rhythm sequence. Failing it causes the spell to fail but completing it will cast that spell. While it can be a lot to juggle at once, the game does a great job of teaching you and ramping up the difficulty slowly in order to build your skills both in game and out.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is fun for a while but as the entire game is built around grinding items and EXP, it would get boring very quickly if it weren't for the well written story pushing players forward. The tone reminded me of The World Ends With You in the best possible way, but felt wholy unique. Your main character finds himself waking up in a tower with no idea how he got there. The voice of a girl named Naia tells you that you are stuck in this tower/game and you will need to make your way up 7 floors to escape so off you go. While there are some predictable moments, the story as a whole never becomes too transparent and despite a few moments when I swore I was done after one more battle, curiosity kept me pushing ever forward. The characters are all voiced as well and while none are particularly mind-blowing, it's a nice touch and the quality stayed consistent throughout. If you do find your bar set particularly high in regards to VO quality, they do have an option to turn it off as well although I doubt this will be necessary for most people.\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't without it's rough spots. For a music-based game, Sequence has a surprisingly limited soundtrack of only about 10 songs that show up in battle. This means several monsters will have you playing the same songs repeatedly. Thankfully, they aren't bad and some of them I didn't mind repeating but considering each monster all but requires multiple playthroughs anyway, don't be surprised if you wind up hearing the same song 10+ times. As that suggests too, the gameplay is simply too grindy and while item drops are pretty common, it can be irritating when you need one specific item and have to fight the same monster over and over just to move forward. Finally, the song balance is a bit odd as by the end of the game, the length of the song decided more battles for me than my HP did. It felt like very artificial difficulty (you lose if the song ends before killing the enemy) and it would have been nicer to have some of the songs be just a bit longer, especially in Floor 7. Depending on your strategy, you may not have a problem with this but it showed up several times in my game.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for something different and enjoy music gameplay, Sequence is worth a shot.","March 2, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ending isn't what you would expect, either, and will have you going ".../what" along with the characters. The music is great to groove out to, there are four difficulties for the musically (dis)inclined, and the background art is beautiful.\nA little caution if you're against people joking around 80% of the time and making pop culture or using memes. You aren't able to choose the songs that you can play, outside the three you're given for a level, but thankfully the songs never get annoying.\nAll in all, it's a pretty fun game, and is well worth the $5 you pay for it.

There's the defense field in which you defend against incoming attacks by aggressors by blocking their attacks pressing the corresponding keys.  The spell field in which you cast spells with different effects such as DoT, healing, or fast recharge low damage spells.  And the mana field in which you replenish mana, which is used to cast spells, you can only have one of these fields open at a time and there is a time limit for defeating the monster, which is an interesting concept.  The monsters have a chance of dropping various items, the lower the more rare and they all give a different amount of experience. You use your experience to craft items, spell scrolls, or keys which you use to use to progress, herein lies some of the problems of the game.  It feels like a grind, just a huge grind.  You end up wasting so much time either killing the same monster over and over again to find that ONE item you need to make better gear or spells, and you can end up wasting all of that precious expereince you earned making you down on experience, although you do lose out on some items.  It just gets very very repetitive around floor four you notice none of the spells bring anything new to the table.  It doesn't help the writing isn't super compelling.  Not to mention the music is reused and the only time you feel like you're actually playing a rhythm game is when you're in the mana field, which is when the keys actually feel like they correspond to the music.  It's got cute ideas but it's riddled with flaws, it's worth checking out if you feel confident sinking money into just to get a feel for it, hey if you're into the grind and slamming on keys for 10 seconds at a time (roughly how long it takes to get your mana replensihed) then be my guest.","November 27, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which sounds sort of repellent when I say it that way, but I'll just reiterate how great it is.\nFor one thing, the combat mechanism is ingenious, forcing you to choose between offense, defense, and the ability to actually do anything, meaning that you can't just turtle up, you have to be doing multiple things at once. This is complicated by restricting you to a certain time limit to resolve your combats. When you factor in the occasionally crippling difficulty (especially if you joined me in suicide and started on the hardest difficulty setting)...♥♥♥♥'s hard. Which is great.\nFor another thing, it has a pretty decent story behind it (and not a few dramatic twists), and some quirky ARG elements behind one of the achievements, which I thought was a fun touch.\nOf course the RPG elements are only in the sense that you can 'level up' and 'have an inventory', but the decision between taking levels and ensuring crafting successes is another cool touch.\nI highly recommend this game if you like games with a solid story, and even more if you already like rhythm games by themselves.","February 11, 2012","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tries very hard to be an 'offbeat RPG' like Puzzle Quest, but ultimately the RPG elements are unimportant and the story sequences feature a bunch of flat and emotionless voice actors trying to be hip and witty.\n\nIf fanboys of the Matrix got together and tried to film another Matrix with no budget and an all-new script they wrote themselves, the dialogue would probably sound like it does in this game.  It's painful.  If you watch the trailer and listen to one of the devs trying way too hard to be hip while describing the game, you'll understand why it turned out this way.\n\nSadly the music is a low point as well.

This is every bit as peculiar as it sounds. The music is slick, much of it licensed from capable hands such as the wonderful Ronald Jenkees, and the gameplay can be quite punishing on higher difficulty levels. I would recommend playing this game witha controller, and indeed have not checked if it is possible (or enjoyable) without.\n\nYou'll be switching between three sets of scrolling DDR style arrows: one for incoming damage that is blocked by accurate hits, another (typically containing the most difficult pieces of the song) recharges your Mana pool on accurate hits, and a third for spells. Spells are cast with the right analog stick, which (after a delay) sends down a specific rhythmic snippet that changes it's tempo to fit the current song (the specific direction of arrows changes every time you cast, and the difficulty level also changes the spells, making the more complicated versions of the same basic rhytmic idea).\n\nThe game has you madly flying between these screens to defeat enemies before the song ends--it's one wierd, wild ride and it's well worth it. Battles are tense and fascinating, and there's a lot of room for varied play styles in your spell collection of choice as well as a lot of room for growth within the broad difficulty span. There's even a practice mode where you can just play through the full songs in a more standard rhthym game format.

You aren't able to choose the songs that you can play, outside the three you're given for a level, but thankfully the songs never get annoying.\nAll in all, it's a pretty fun game, and is well worth the $5 you pay for it.

If a game that combines rhythm game and RPG appeals to you then this game would be something to look at even if that combination of genre wasn't so rare.\n\nFirst off to all the people who aren't scared off from thinking of potential problems or weirdness already, it's not just "let's smash these genres together". It's very functional as a rhythm game and they made that part of gameplay the "battle" portion of the RPG. You switch between "fields" to either defend against attacks, cast spells or regain mana. The balance of strength of attacks and difficulty pulling them off feels nice and natural and the game overall feels just wonderfully made. Like any RPG you might need to grind a little but just remember to pay attention to getting good equipment and good spell usage and it shouldn't get too bad. I think the only negative I can really think about gameplay is there isn't any "turn based" alternative for anyone that isn't physically capable of playing a timing based game, but for the rest of it it's good to go.\n\nMusic and visual aesthetics might depend a bit on individual taste to say for sure but I personally loved both in this game.  The story is awesome too, unlike a lot of other RPG's it doesn't give you a ton of story which works since plenty of the interest comes in the mystery and uncertainty. You get just a few cutscenes every floor, long enough to enjoy the strange characters but not so long you forget you're playing a video game. Trust me there's not really any throw away characters.\n\nSaddly as much as I'd like to go on I don't know how much deeper I can dig without risking any spoilers or rambling on too much, but trust me when I say this is a unique gem of a game worth playing through to the end.","February 23, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/recommended/200910/","katosepe","Katosepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katosepe/","603 products in account","Games like Sequence are the reason Kickstarter and the Indie Game movement exist. It's not a perfect game, not everyone is going to enjoy it and it will never receive a lot of fame and recognition. However, for the niche audience that can appreciate it, Sequence is a game like no other.\n\nThe closest thing I can relate Sequence to is Puzzle Quest. The game doesn't play like Puzzle Quest but what that game did for Match-3 games, Sequence does for the rhythm genre. The base game has you traveling up a tower by fighting enemies, collecting their dropped items, and synthesising items such as keys, weapons and armor. Battles give you experience which will level up your stats while armor and weapons are equipable and can also improve your abilities.\n\nWhere Sequence differs from the average dungeon crawler is that combat is played out by putting you in a rhythm system similar to StepMania, if you're using a keyboard, but with three separate boards. One board is defensive, one board is for building mana and one is for casting spells. On the first board, any notes that you miss will count as damage against you so catching them defends your HP. The second board will have a constant stream of notes. Missing them doesn't hurt you but catching them restores your mana which you need to cast spells. The last board stays dormant until you cast spells, the only way to damage your opponents. When you cast a spell, it takes mana and makes you complete a short rhythm sequence. Failing it causes the spell to fail but completing it will cast that spell. While it can be a lot to juggle at once, the game does a great job of teaching you and ramping up the difficulty slowly in order to build your skills both in game and out.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is fun for a while but as the entire game is built around grinding items and EXP, it would get boring very quickly if it weren't for the well written story pushing players forward. The tone reminded me of The World Ends With You in the best possible way, but felt wholy unique. Your main character finds himself waking up in a tower with no idea how he got there. The voice of a girl named Naia tells you that you are stuck in this tower/game and you will need to make your way up 7 floors to escape so off you go. While there are some predictable moments, the story as a whole never becomes too transparent and despite a few moments when I swore I was done after one more battle, curiosity kept me pushing ever forward. The characters are all voiced as well and while none are particularly mind-blowing, it's a nice touch and the quality stayed consistent throughout. If you do find your bar set particularly high in regards to VO quality, they do have an option to turn it off as well although I doubt this will be necessary for most people.\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't without it's rough spots. For a music-based game, Sequence has a surprisingly limited soundtrack of only about 10 songs that show up in battle. This means several monsters will have you playing the same songs repeatedly. Thankfully, they aren't bad and some of them I didn't mind repeating but considering each monster all but requires multiple playthroughs anyway, don't be surprised if you wind up hearing the same song 10+ times. As that suggests too, the gameplay is simply too grindy and while item drops are pretty common, it can be irritating when you need one specific item and have to fight the same monster over and over just to move forward. Finally, the song balance is a bit odd as by the end of the game, the length of the song decided more battles for me than my HP did. It felt like very artificial difficulty (you lose if the song ends before killing the enemy) and it would have been nicer to have some of the songs be just a bit longer, especially in Floor 7. Depending on your strategy, you may not have a problem with this but it showed up several times in my game.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for something different and enjoy music gameplay, Sequence is worth a shot.","March 2, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know why I bought it and when it was over a piece of me went with it.\nTruely one of the few inde games you will apreciate.\n\nSure I like some fun rythm games every now and then and maybe some games that will challenge me to be a better player, but what keeps me hooked until the end is that storyline. I'm all about the feels and this game's storyline delivers it.\n\nSTORY: 10/10\nEverything about this game feels like a budget game, but the voice acting and the music and thought put into the story developement drove it home for me. I truely felt like I was experiencing all of the hard work each person put into this game I even took a moment of pause and watched the credits. its that good.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\nLets be honest, rythm games are very hard to be creative with. You can only do so much to make a person appriciate the music and stay with the beat before it becomes too difficult or too generic.  They did a great job with attempting to give you more than just a beat to hit some buttons with, they gave you enemies to hammer down and spell combos to add a twist to the mix of some pretty good beats.\n\nAt first, juggling through 3 different rythm windows in a battle along with a timer taunting you to the very nano second to hammer out the best moves orElseUlolFail@life can be intimidating, but it actually makes a ton of sense and you feel like youre really battling it out with some baddies while head bobbing to the beat. For what they had to work with, this is something to really try out for yourself.\n\nART: 8/10\nThis isnt some blockbuster game that had millions of dollars backing it along with teams of graphic designers, so dont expect amazing CG movie like animations here ladies. The art for each stage is very unique and even melds with the music and the tone of the story. The characters do seem budget like, but by no means are they generic.\n\nREPLAY: 5/10\nSometimes the replay has to justify the price, and this game definately had the opportunity to get some DLCs going of side quests, a battle arena for other players, hell even an after the tower storyline. I really did enjoy the game for what its worth, but after playing the entire thing including the extras in the first run I wished there was something more to comeback to later on.\n\n\nConclusion: I know you will pass buy this game as your browsing through the store looking for a quick fix and overlook it. I honestly dont recall what made me buy it in the first place, but I am glad I did and I am pretty sure you will be too. If youre that strapped, its just 5 bucks and you get a lot more bang for your buck from this game than you would for whatever 5 bucks can get you nowadays. Pick up this game and enjoy the adventure.","January 3, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play the game by matching Arrows in three different fields. Defense blocks attacks, There's an attack field where you need to hit all the arrows to cast spells. Then there is the mana pool where you replenish your mana for more spells. The thing is you queue your spells up on your own. So you have to either take a few hits while you get a spell off on the enemy or maybe you'll find that gap in the enemy's attack pattern. Besides that the game has a ton of other rpg elements like monster drops, item synthesis, equipment, learning new spells and more.\n\nI also enjoy the voice acting and all the snarky sarasm that goes on between the guy you play and Naia the girl over the intercom.

Constantly shifting between streams, organizing your list of spells, and seeking out rare materials for crafting new gear is made even more fun by the top quality music, great voice acting, and a script that is much funnier than you'd ever expect.

They did a good job at implementing RPG elements into the genre and wrapped everything up in a surprisingly decent story. You can play this with a keyboard, but I found it a bit easier to play with a controller.\n\nSo basically you "fight" yourself through a tower with seven floors and their guardians, and by fighting I mean you press directional arrows in three different windows to either defend yourself, regenerate mana or cast spells. If you're bad with coordination you might have trouble on the higher floors as switching quickly between the windows will become mandatory.\n\nMy two major gripes with the game are a lack of different soundtracks early on (luckily there will be more variety later on, and some of the soundtracks are amazing) and incredibly frustrating RNG at times. Both item drops and crafting items are based on a percentage, the latter costing experience which makes failing a little more frustrating. If you want to get everything, you WILL have to grind a bit.

It's not that the game is bad, rather that its an idea who's implementation seems inherently flawed.\n\nThe base mechanic of the game is the traditional "press one or more of the 4 directions on the beat as instructed". However, the twist is that you have three panels of arrows to rotate between and timing your presses correctly on them has different effects. There's your mana regen panel where each correct press earns you a little mana to cast spells. There's another that represents spellcasting where successfully landing a series of presses will cast a spell (more on this later). The last one represents defense where a sequence of arrows represents the enemy's attack; if you miss any here you take damage.\n\nThe problem is that the defense panel's arrows (i.e. the enemy's attacks) occur at random, but you have to manually trigger your spellcast sequences. You may already see the issue here: you build mana, cast an attack spell, and arrows start to fall in the spell cast panel and defense panel simultaneously. The game's prescribed cure for this is to constantly keep up a "barrier" spell which effectively mutes the enemy. So the game requires you to continually recast this barrier spell so that you can actually cast the spells you want in between each barrier cast. In my opinion this is a kludge of a game mechanic. You get involved with a whole lot of busy work just to occasionally do something meaningful. Perhaps it all gets a bit smoother with some practice, but whats to engage you enough to want to get that good?\n\nI found a majority of the music to be ignorable at best. I've enjoyed some of Ronald Jenkees' music, but what's offered here I'd be reluctant to classify as even B-side music. The dialog is atrocious, the story is insignificant, and the graphics are the kind of crappy animatics that have now become standard fair in a sea of indie game dev mediocrity. The game would be perfectly suited for two hands on the keyboard, but I was forced into using a controller. (Oh I hope this wasn't just because I had a controller plugged into my PC; I'm not going back!)\n\nPerhaps worst yet is that the game devolves into a grind as each enemy you face has the chance to drop (at most?) one of three items of increasingly rarer chances to drop. You can face an enemy multiple times (enjoying the same music each time!) to get all items from an enemy. Why? Did the game need a time sink like this? Again, its more poor game design that not only contributes nothing fun, but actually contributes frustration.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I had it on my wishlist as soon as it was released and bought it while it was still named Sequence. Despite the game's somewhat novel concept, it seems like the developer tried to throw a hodge-podge of ideas and twists at the rhythm genre, but just ended up with an overly-complicated and unfun mess.\n\nUnless you're some kind of rhythm game fanatic, skip this one. 6/10","February 16","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some good 12+ hours of gameplay on the normal difficulty, plus some cool bonuses and optional hidden ending for the hardcore looters.\n\nFor this price, it's definitely a good buy, even if you're not particularly interested in rhythm games in the first place (that's my case, and I still really enjoyed Before the Echo).","March 11","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

New levels and challenges for unlocking spells tend to recycle songs from previous levels.\n- Item crafting is done by sacrificing some exp. This in itself isnt horrible, but when paired with the tiny song selection, repeating the same fights over and over again to craft your armor and weapons and keys to unlock the next level all while trying to maintain a level that allows you to continue playing comfortably becomes tedious.\n- In short, grinding becomes pretty much mandatory.\n- Not much selection in craftable weapons and armor. Each level supplies you with crafting recipes for one armor and weapon item at its beginning. Additional items can sometimes be dropped by enemies, but I have rarely found these helpful. When I saw the crafting screens in the trailer, I was hoping there would be more variety in items for the player; a build with a ton of attack and no defense, or a ton of mana but not much health would be interesting challenges to make repeating songs less tedious.\n\nAdditionally, controllers are supported by the game, but only 360 controllers as of right now. I used the program ds4windows to make my ps4 controller compatible with it (running on Win8.1), and I have seen others find supporting programs for different controllers. Using a controller makes for comfortable gameplay.\n\n\nOverall, I'm not sure I whether I would recommend this game. The core concept is interesting and the spells are fun. Playing the faster-paced songs is a blast. However, the game suffers from a tiny playlist which turns some floors into drudgery and "this track again?" rather than keeping it a fun, fresh experience. On sale or in a bundle, I suppose it is worth it, though, as this game definitely has its strong points.","October 1, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It delivers this with surprisingly unique gameplay, an interesting story, and an excellent, albeit limited, selection of music to play along to.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's not unlike DDR in that you have four arrows that you have to hit to the rhythm as they reach the bottom of the screen while music plays in the background. However, the similarities stop there. Combat involves rotating between three screens: your damage screen, your mana screen, and your spell screen. The damage screen represents incoming attacks from your opponent, and each arrow missed on this screen will result in your health taking a hit. The spell screen is used for all of the abilities in the game, where you must select what type of spell you want to perform and then hit every arrow in that spell for it to succeed. The mana screen grants mana, for casting spells, with every arrow that is hit. As a result, the game turns into a very interesting experience where you have to time spells so that you don't take too much damage, and prioritize each of these screens so that you can keep yourself alive and deplete your enemy's health bar before the song ends.\n\nWhen a battle concludes, loot is dropped. This loot can be used to craft specific items on each floor, such as new weapons and equipment, a key to get to the next level, and a few other secrets that are best observed within the game. Especially towards the end, there are some very interesting items that can be crafted, and a lot of secrets and hidden content. I highly recommend crafting every item in the game, waiting until after the credits, and then exploring a bit more based on what you learn. This game quickly becomes intriguing, and knows how to deliver on it.\n\nOne point of criticism I have for this game is that, if you're looking to craft all of the items in the game, it can get a little repetitive. Each enemy has the same song every time you fight them, and when you get close to the end, there are a few items that have pretty low drop rates. Having to repeat the same fight fifteen times in a row, as a result, can get a drab. Luckily, it's not the exact same pattern of arrows every time, and the gameplay is engaging and fun enough that I didn't find this to be much of an issue, but it is something worth mentioning.\n\nIf you're a fan of rhythm games, Sequence brings a twist on a traditional formula that makes it feel almost entirely new. I'm glad I put in all of the time that I did, and I think a lot of people would be surprised at how much they enjoy it.","November 30, 2013","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a pleasent surprise, one of my favorite games I bought during winter sale (though even at full price it would be a good buy).\n\nIt's fresh and funny. The concept of a rhythm game mixt with RPG is well executed. The voice acting is great and I Iove the light and humorious dialogues. The more I discover about this game the more I want to keep playing.\n\nEven if it's a great game, I wouldn't recommend it to people who have difficulties with rhythm (didn't look through all the difficulty levels though). As an exemple, it isn't a game for my brother... but he does enjoy watching me play it. Also, some might find it a bit repetitive, I could understand why but so is every RPG or RPG-like game.\n\nPersonnaly, it doesn't bother me, and it offers an ok variety of good music and intersting small adds to the gameplay along the way to not mind the little repetetiveness. This game has also a great pick up and play feel to it. Sometimes I just don't know what to play, my mouse is far away from me and I look for a game simple (yet more elaborated than a phone game) and enjoyable while browsing my library and Sequence fast became one of those games that I would just pick up, quickly remember where I left off and get back in right away.\n\nIf you're ok/good with rhythm and looking for something different then you should absolutly buy it!

While the ending is a bit lackluster on all accounts - a tad 'what the heck?', a bit of open-endedness, even on the secret ending, and a special achievement that might or might not really bug you (I was fine with it, and rather liked it) - Sequence/Before The Echo is an indie game that you need to buy right this second. Just be ready for tons of horrible puns.","January 15, 2012","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not usually an RPG fan, but this game is enjoyable so far and there's no question that I'll see it through to the end.\n\nAs a long-time DDR/stepmania player, I stepped quite easily into hard mode.  The charts themselves are still pretty easy for me, and I can easily get 100% while unlocking spells.  However, during regular gameplay, coordinating switching between panes with hitting notes is a new and interesting challenge.\n\nThe biggest downside so far is the lack of content.  The soundtrack, while well-made, is extremely limited, and you'll end up hearing the same handful of songs over and over (so far maybe a half dozen songs in the first 4/7 floors of the tower, compared to dozens/hundreds in your average true rhythm game).  That coupled with the fact that I'm better than halfway through the game in under 4 hours suggests that this game won't have replay value.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- The art is somewhat low-res (720p?) and you can't change resolutions.  You can choose full screen or windowed though.  Not something I notice during gameplay, but nowadays I'd expect full HD (or preferably vector) art.\n- So far I've only gotten one defensive spell and it's not that powerful.  There's a huge emphasis on attack-heavily-and-occasionally-heal with not much in the way of actually defending.  Some battles you can coast through without using the defense pane much at all, so it's not equally balanced throughout.\n- A lot of the items/spells seem ignorable in general, unless you're a compulsive completionist like I am.\n- Each floor of the tower has 3 different enemy battles (each with 3 different item drops), plus a boss battle.\n- It's interesting that the item drop probabilities are shown, that way you can quantify how bad your luck is when grinding.  Sure, I got the 35% item in 3 of my last 4 battles, but I only got one of the 85% item that I need three of.  Haha.\n- The boss battles don't seem to be replayable, but they do unlock new songs when you complete them that will be used in the higher levels of battle.\n- Most people complaining about the name change (from "Sequence") have no idea how trademark law works, or why companies are obligated to protect their trademarks.\n\nOverall, this game is well worth that 99c sale price, but it seems like something I'll play through once and then forget about.

New levels and challenges for unlocking spells tend to recycle songs from previous levels.\n- Item crafting is done by sacrificing some exp. This in itself isnt horrible, but when paired with the tiny song selection, repeating the same fights over and over again to craft your armor and weapons and keys to unlock the next level all while trying to maintain a level that allows you to continue playing comfortably becomes tedious.\n- In short, grinding becomes pretty much mandatory.\n- Not much selection in craftable weapons and armor. Each level supplies you with crafting recipes for one armor and weapon item at its beginning. Additional items can sometimes be dropped by enemies, but I have rarely found these helpful. When I saw the crafting screens in the trailer, I was hoping there would be more variety in items for the player; a build with a ton of attack and no defense, or a ton of mana but not much health would be interesting challenges to make repeating songs less tedious.\n\nAdditionally, controllers are supported by the game, but only 360 controllers as of right now. I used the program ds4windows to make my ps4 controller compatible with it (running on Win8.1), and I have seen others find supporting programs for different controllers. Using a controller makes for comfortable gameplay.\n\n\nOverall, I'm not sure I whether I would recommend this game. The core concept is interesting and the spells are fun. Playing the faster-paced songs is a blast. However, the game suffers from a tiny playlist which turns some floors into drudgery and "this track again?" rather than keeping it a fun, fresh experience. On sale or in a bundle, I suppose it is worth it, though, as this game definitely has its strong points.","October 1, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play the game by matching Arrows in three different fields. Defense blocks attacks, There's an attack field where you need to hit all the arrows to cast spells. Then there is the mana pool where you replenish your mana for more spells. The thing is you queue your spells up on your own. So you have to either take a few hits while you get a spell off on the enemy or maybe you'll find that gap in the enemy's attack pattern. Besides that the game has a ton of other rpg elements like monster drops, item synthesis, equipment, learning new spells and more.\n\nI also enjoy the voice acting and all the snarky sarasm that goes on between the guy you play and Naia the girl over the intercom.

The story is intriguing, especially later into the game, and the characters are hilarious. Dialogue is snarky and well-written, and had me laughing a lot. In my opinion, the only thing truly lacking was the gameplay, which was a little weak. I only played on medium, and it was challenging by the end of the game, but the content was repetitive.This isn't so much a problem of difficulty, but more a byproduct of the game's small pool of resources compared to many other rhythm games.\n\nAll in all, as a cheap-♥♥♥ game it's a nice buy.

They did a good job at implementing RPG elements into the genre and wrapped everything up in a surprisingly decent story. You can play this with a keyboard, but I found it a bit easier to play with a controller.\n\nSo basically you "fight" yourself through a tower with seven floors and their guardians, and by fighting I mean you press directional arrows in three different windows to either defend yourself, regenerate mana or cast spells. If you're bad with coordination you might have trouble on the higher floors as switching quickly between the windows will become mandatory.\n\nMy two major gripes with the game are a lack of different soundtracks early on (luckily there will be more variety later on, and some of the soundtracks are amazing) and incredibly frustrating RNG at times. Both item drops and crafting items are based on a percentage, the latter costing experience which makes failing a little more frustrating. If you want to get everything, you WILL have to grind a bit. Other than that, I found it overall enjoyable and enticing.","February 25","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The general gameplay involves switching between three play fields - one to gain mana to cast spells, one to actually use the spells, and one to defend against enemy attacks. It's the kind of concept that must be played to get a good idea of, but let me tell you, it's great. Most of the gameplay music is by Ronald Jenkees, who I now know to be a fantastic artist. While the ending is a bit lackluster on all accounts - a tad 'what the heck?', a bit of open-endedness, even on the secret ending, and a special achievement that might or might not really bug you (I was fine with it, and rather liked it) - Sequence/Before The Echo is an indie game that you need to buy right this second.

I'm not usually an RPG fan, but this game is enjoyable so far and there's no question that I'll see it through to the end.\n\nAs a long-time DDR/stepmania player, I stepped quite easily into hard mode.  The charts themselves are still pretty easy for me, and I can easily get 100% while unlocking spells.  However, during regular gameplay, coordinating switching between panes with hitting notes is a new and interesting challenge.\n\nThe biggest downside so far is the lack of content.  The soundtrack, while well-made, is extremely limited, and you'll end up hearing the same handful of songs over and over (so far maybe a half dozen songs in the first 4/7 floors of the tower, compared to dozens/hundreds in your average true rhythm game).  That coupled with the fact that I'm better than halfway through the game in under 4 hours suggests that this game won't have replay value.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- The art is somewhat low-res (720p?) and you can't change resolutions.  You can choose full screen or windowed though.  Not something I notice during gameplay, but nowadays I'd expect full HD (or preferably vector) art.\n- So far I've only gotten one defensive spell and it's not that powerful.  There's a huge emphasis on attack-heavily-and-occasionally-heal with not much in the way of actually defending.  Some battles you can coast through without using the defense pane much at all, so it's not equally balanced throughout.\n- A lot of the items/spells seem ignorable in general, unless you're a compulsive completionist like I am.\n- Each floor of the tower has 3 different enemy battles (each with 3 different item drops), plus a boss battle.\n- It's interesting that the item drop probabilities are shown, that way you can quantify how bad your luck is when grinding.  Sure, I got the 35% item in 3 of my last 4 battles, but I only got one of the 85% item that I need three of.  Haha.\n- The boss battles don't seem to be replayable, but they do unlock new songs when you complete them that will be used in the higher levels of battle.\n- Most people complaining about the name change (from "Sequence") have no idea how trademark law works, or why companies are obligated to protect their trademarks.\n\nOverall, this game is well worth that 99c sale price, but it seems like something I'll play through once and then forget about.  I absolutely love the concept, but it needs more content for sure.","December 30, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got you hooked yet?\n\nSimply put, the player switches between 3 "fields" or screens (Defence, Spell, and Mana) while in game as arrows move down in each field.\n\nThere's a great deal of multitasking involved because of casting spells, defending yourself, and gaining mana.\n\nYou win by draining the opponent's HP to 0 by casting damaging spells, but you can lose by losing all of your health or by not winning by the end of the song. It's a great game that keeps you on your toes and equipping the right spells.\n\nThat being said, don't feel as though there are "wrong" or "right" spells to use. Some are better for certain levels or battles, but I've been able to use the spells that fit my playstyle.\n\nBefore the Echo is a great game for people who love RPGs but may not have all the time in the world to spend 60+ hours in.\n","April 21","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is beautiful, the music is great, and the gameplay is very unique. The story isn't very deep and complex, and the game gets a little grindy at the beginning of each floor, but it's definitely worth what you are paying for it.","May 30","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oder zwei, denn in den höheren Schwierigkeitsstufen wird's hektisch! Das gemischt mit gut gemachter Musik und der Tatsache, dass sich Sequence definitiv selbst nicht ernst nimmt, ergeben ein unterhaltsames Spiel für zwischendurch.","November 20, 2011","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you find Step Mania or DDR challenging or frustrating, this game is likely going to be too hard for you.  It forces you to not only hit arrow keys in time with the music in the same fashion, but adds even more layers of difficulty.  There are no color codes on the arrows themselves to tell you what beat the note is on.  So you have to go purely on listening to the music, and sometimes the arrows are just on really awkward notes or tones of the song, like a series of 16th notes where only a few of them have arrows on them.  Tack on that you are watching three sets of arrows at once instead of only 1, having to swap fields of arrows to be hitting, and apply strategic thinking to when to cast spells and what to cast SIMULTANEOUSLY and you need to be so good at something like Stepmania that you don't even have to think about the arrows.  You have to be able to do them almost completely subconsciously to keep up with this game (At least at the Hard difficulty level)  If you're that good, this game will knock your socks off.  It's incredibly fun.\n\nThe only real downsides to it come from sheer lack of variety.  The game has RPG mechanics for sure, and that includes trying to collect items with a % drop rate.  Meaning if you get unlucky (And you WILL get unlucky) you may be grinding the same exact monster for half an hour.  Which means the same damn song for half an hour straight.  What is worse, each monster does not have it's own song.  Some repeat.  This can get seriously old.\n\nFor 5$, this game is awesome.  Something I've never seen before and very well put together.  And at that price, the lack of variety is understandable.  Personally, I'd love to see a sequel, and would be happy to pay four times as much if they just make sure to really crank up the variety so the game isn't such an awful feeling grind at times.  The foundations of this game are rock solid.  It just needs a few more coats of paint.\n\n","June 4","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
