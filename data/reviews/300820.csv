I cannot stress this emphatically enough: IT WILL NOT WORK. The game requires "Games For Windows Marketplace," a completely unrelated and obscure Microsoft download (not normally included in Windows) to be running, and then if the stars align the file MIGHT start up (after starting three times in a row for me, the fourth time  it decided that it was done). This is pretty frustrating for what is essentially a kids' game.\n\nIF (and that's a pretty big "if") you get the game running, the second major issue is controller support. The Steam description touts "Full controller support," but this is not entirely accurate or true. I am using a wireless Xbox 360 controller with a USB dongle, which works flawlessly on all of the dozens of games in my library which were released after 2008 -- but not this one. The game has trouble recognizing that a controller is present, and seems to forget that one is connected quite frequently. Again, when the stars align and you do have the game running and the controller working, it does finally begin to resemble the Xbox 360 game in terms of playability, even if the game is not coded to display the Xbox 360 buttons, instead opting to show generic controller buttons (for example, the yellow "Y" 360 button is mapped to a gray "1"). This in itself is not that big of a deal, but it isn't good for young children using the Microsoft product.\n\nI honestly wish I could tell you more about the gameplay, but the chances are that you'll never see it which is a shame (although a little "floaty," the game is worth it for the "Woody's Round-up" segment alone, which rewards exploration and quests with a lot of genuinely fun unlockable content). This version is a complete waste of money and time. If you already own an Xbox 360 and are looking for something to play with a child, or just want a good, solid light-hearted game, buy the Xbox 360 version, which has great visuals and two-player splitscreen co-op in a world filled with quests, upgrades and exploration. If you have no friends and hate yourself, check out the Wii version, which omits 2-player and replaces good old-fashioned button presses with wildly unpredictable waggling motion controls. As for the Steam version...\n\nThis Steam version is only for three types of people: 1.) Software developers who enjoy figuring out why a program doesn't work and Rube-Goldberging a solution 2.) Conscientious software pirates who want to own a legitimate copy of the game they torrented before the government finds them 3.) Richard Pryor in the movie "Brewster's Millions" (I feel this last one is self-explanatory, but in case you haven't seen it, he has to spend one million dollars in a very limited time on in order to win a larger inheritance, the rub being at the ethat nd of the time alotted he has to have nothing to show for it, which descrbes this game perfectly).\n\nEveryone else should just avoid it at all costs.","February 28, 2015","false","5.4"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","23","29","7","0"

I first installed it on my son's computer (set up as a Steam game console). First it constantly crashed on boot. Once I fixed that (requiring the installation of a no CD hack... seriously) it was supposed to be controller compatible. It is, but not until after you use the mouse to click on Start. Since I have his computer set up as a came console there is no keyboard or mouse connected. Then once you actually start the game it's choppy as hell and unplayable.\n\nI tried running it in compatibility mode and that didn't fix any of the problems. His system runs Windows 7, so on a whim I tried on my Windows 10 PC. Exact same issues.\n\nDo not buy this game on Steam. The PC version, or at the very least the digital version, is broken and unplayable. It's also falsely advertised as being fully controller compatible which is not true.","August 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/300820/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Toy Story 3: The Video Game is a platform game loosely based on the film Toy Story 3. Almost the entire Toy Story case from the films return in voice acting, apart from the two key characters, Buzz and Woody, for me, it is an absolute shame that they didn't get Tom Hanks and Tim Allen in...\n\nGame play wise, Toy Story 3 is a platformer, where players control either Woody, Buzz or Jessie. Each of the characters have their own special move. There are two main modes in the game, Story and Toybox. The story mode has nine levels, this follows the events in the movie, as well as the opening sequence from Toy Story 2. Toybox mode, you can create and customize levels, fill it with inhabitants and missions. Completing various objectives and missions in this mode, you will earn money, which in turn can be used to purchase new objects, toys and to expand your city. Some of the characters are also from other Disney and Pixar franchises!\n\nIt almost looks as if you are watching the movie with the graphics on show here; it's a shame I couldn't play it in full 1080p, the resolution option just wasn't available. Also I was disappointed to see that it is capped at 30 FPS,  so it would look even better if you could play it on a proper resolution/frame rate...\n\nAll of the levels are well presented, there are a copious amount of jumping puzzles, and BOOOOOOOOOOOY do I love jumping puzzles.....You will be playing in well known locations such as Andy's bedroom, Sunnyside Daycare and Junkyards. All of these look amazing and filled with lots of little nuts and crannies to explorer. My favorite level is the one based on the Buzz Lightyear Video game (the one Rex plays), it just resonates nostalgia. Everything is there from the laser eye, to the wall of spikes, to the secret passage on the left.\n\nI have to admit, I did struggle at times with a number of the jumping puzzles, but then again, I struggle with them on any game,  other than that, there aren't any real hard points,  that should be expected from a game mainly based at the younger audience though.\n\nSadly the main issue I have with Toy Story 3 The Video game, is the length. I finished the story, all of the side missions and most of the collectibles in just under two hours. To me that is unacceptable for a game of this stature, I would of been satisfied if it was maybe five hours, but two hours is just not on. There is so much more which could of been included into the story mode to flesh it out.\n\nWith that being said, if you grew up with Toy Story, you will have so many memories and nostalgia towards the whole gang, and you will more than likely get a lot of enjoyment with this game if only for those reasons only. I would certainly not recommend anyone pick this up at full price. Sadly since it is a Disney title, it probably won't go on sale very often, so keep your eyes out.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

After buying this game and downloading it from steam, it would just crash and I was confused. I ended up downloading a pirated version of the game and I had to apply the no-cd patch from the pirated version ON THIS STEAM VERSION I PAID MONEY FOR to get the damn game to work. This should be fixed as it's ridiculous that the game from steam literally won't run because it needs to be patched because this version you download from steam doesn't pass the anti-piracy measures even though you bought it legit. To top it all off, once you get in the game, the graphics settings are emberassing. The max resolution for this game is 1600x900, and you cannot put it into a windowed mode.

It's imposed by the game and I can't find the ini file.\nJust can't understand why they'd want to limit it that way. SO stupid. I wouldn't have bought this game knowing it's locked into 720, so if anyone else wants to see high-res graphics, don't buy this game.\nDUDE! Even PS3 has 1080p support on this game. Fix this! 2560x1600 and 1440 please, pretty common sizes!","December 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 13 of 38 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","13","38","0","1"
