"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/263460/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4251 products in account","This is one of the most insane puzzle games I've ever played. The mechanics are simple: you have a grid of X by Y squares, place your pieces down in a way that everyone likes who they're seated beside (the basic rule of the game: Girls like Robots. Girls don't like Nerds. Nerds like Girls, Robots, but not other Nerds).\n\nExcept then suddenly you're learning that June actually really likes Bugs. But Bugs don't like Girls. And Ben likes June, so make sure to leave a space near June for Ben so he can ask her out, and...\n\nThe game's complexity builds slowly, and it comes through adorably quirky cutscenes. It also has 3 tiers of medal per stage, but in a twist I absolutely adore, "gold" does not mean "perfect" - it just means "the highest". This is one of those games where the designer didn't go through and mathematically 'solve' every stage and expect you to do the same, and that goes a long way for me in saying "This is the kind of game devoted to fun first, humor second, and everything else is just a bonus".\n\nPlus, if you score enough golds and things, you unlock alternate silly modes. I'm waiting to see what Nerd Drop is.\n\nedit: Infinite Nerd Drop is everything I wanted from the name.","June 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","45","52","2","0"

The puzzles get more difficult as you get further into the levels, but the hilarity of the 'plot' and the reasoning.... Girls like robots, nerds like edges, girls are only okay with nerds if there is an adjacent pie.... Just a quirky unrealistic logic game, but hey, who knows! Maybe some girls really do like pie THAT MUCH. Turn it around from a way to a man's heart is through his stomach.... now it's a way to sit next to a girl is through an adjacent pie. It's definitely some good laughs with some 'wtf logic' moments.","February 14, 2014","true","14.7"," 38 of 52 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","38","52","0","0"

Basically, you have to arrange the people in the way the game demands; Girls like the robots, robots like the girls, nerds like the robots and the edge of the playing field and, last but not least, the girls don't want to be near the nerds.  It's all straightforward until you begin to realize that this isn't a linear, repetitive game.  No, the developers keep throwing new things at you in order to keep it fresh.  This made it extremely entertaining the entire playthrough.\n\nThe music isn't too bad, but at times it could be repetitive.  Then again, I was focusing like a madman on the puzzles and the art (the square people are cute, ok!?) so the music didn't really capture my attention that much.\n\nAll in all, a good puzzle game for the price and an enjoyable one at that.  I recommend it to anyone interested and I hope they find the same amount of enjoyment that I did in the game.","June 3, 2014","true","10.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

The art style is playful and vibrant with a wonderful attention to detail, especially in the backgrounds.  The animations were smooth and fun to watch, as a feature the game also allows the player to skip the cutscenes or even watch the cutscenes again in the level viewer.  The story was surprisingly well done as well. Normally, I would not expect a story in a puzzle game like this, however there was a story, and it was quite easy to follow.  Though the adventures were wacky and didn't make any logical sense, it fit the overall tone of the game perfectly.  I must also applaud the creators of the game for adding little references from other media and of course geek culture.  The soundtrack of this game was great, however it got very repetitive as the game progressed, for my ears got tired of hearing the same banjo tune strummed over and over again.  The best way to remedy this problems is to take a break once in a while to let your ears rest.  However this little problem did not and will not dull the rest of the gaming experience in anyway.\n\nThe game was easy to pickup and play, however don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles will take a little bit of thinking to figure it out, especially if you are a completionist.  Bonus content allows for some replayability which adds to the value of the game itself and in no ways detracts from the main game itself.  The system of unlocking bonus content is well done, as even an intermediate skilled player will be able to "buy" the content (The main game will provide more than enough "happy" points to unlock them).  The achievements brings nothing new to the table, but it fairly awards those who are willing to spend some time in the game.\n\nOverall this is a solid game with little to no faults to describe.  It is a must own for people who like puzzle games, and for people who don't, this is a good game to pick up, because of its ease of play.  The game's content to value ratio is good, however don't expect to sink hundreds of hours into this game.  9/10","February 15, 2014","true","12.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

It's very obvious that its a mobile port, but it doesn't actually play that bad on PC.\n\nThe game itself is very funny and completely unrealistic. Girls like robots, girls dislike nerds, nerds like edges, etc. Very simple gameplay, easy to pick up on, especially considering the game holds your hand throughout the first several levels. The art style is very quirky and colorful, along with the smooth animations.\n\nThe game does have a slight story to it, in the form of various cutscenes scattered in between levels. It's a ridiculously simple story, nothing fantastic, but it is rare to see any type of story in a puzzle game like this, so props for that. The story doesn't really make much sense logically, but neither does the game, so that's okay! The game's soundtrack is quite repetitive, however.\n\nThe puzzles were (for me) quite easy to follow. It gets progressively more difficult, but not so difficult as to prevent progression on my part. It really depends on how much thought you put into each puzzle before acting, as it is a logic puzzle game. The game has a high replayability if you're a completionist. Each level can be perfected, if you know what to do, and it would take quite some time to do so, hence the increased replayability.\n\nOverall, Girls Like Robots is a fantastic little game. It's a pleasure to play, even on PC, although I can only see myself playing this on mobile instead of Steam in the future. The pricetag is set at $7, which may be a bit high for a game of this scale, so try to pick it up during a sale if you're interested.","March 9, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a rectangular grid and you're tasked with placing the various characters in the scene in such a way that everybody is happy or some other requirement is fulfilled. How happy people are is influenced by who they're next to, so girls literally like robots.\nNerds like girls, like robots and like being near the edge of the group but dislike being next to other nerds (I like to imagine it's because they disagree on the age-old Star Wars vs. Star Trek debate).\nGirls don't just like robots, they also dislike nerds and tolerate other girls. Robots like girls and have no strong feelings about nerds or other robots.\n\nThese are just the first three characters, and already they have enough different interactions to have plenty of puzzle fun, but this barely scratches the surface. There are tons of other characters, each with their own likes, dislikes and quirks, but never so many that you're forced to remember all of them (and if you do forget you can always easily look up the relevant interactions, just in case you'd forgotten that fish and robots were mortal enemies).\nThe puzzles themselves also vary in type, with some allowing you to freely place characters while others restrict the order in which you place them.\n\nThis would already be a strong recommendation without bothering to go into the delightful story.\nIt starts simple enough, a school trip, a sports game, a volcano erupting, a big dance. Wait, volcano?!\nNever taking itself seriously, but always sharing the joke with the player, the plot is as light-hearted as they come and animated in the same gorgeous style as the core game.\n\nWith three large Acts, each with around a dozen chapters to go through (which themselves consist of ~4-10 stages) there is plenty to do, but it doesn't outstay its welcome and the finale, while a bit long, is definitely worth the effort.\nStrongly recommended, get some Girls and Robots in your life today.","May 27, 2015","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It has very positive reviews and an adorable trailer. I bought it for the fun of the puzzles and because I liked the art style. However, by the end of it, I found it to be tedious and unlikable. As someone who strives for 100% on games that I enjoy playing, I open this game now only in pursuit of the last achievement. Here's what stands out from my experience:\n\nPros\nCute art style, fairly unique\nCustomizable avatars for each of the puzzle pieces\nInteresting and challenging puzzles with many variations\nEasy to use menus and settings\nSkippable cutscenes\nCons\nP.I.T.A. to get the last achievement (50/50 Infinite Nerd Drop - even the developer has acknowledged this one was bad taste on their part)\nNot enough gameplay to warrant the $6.99 base price\nLacks replayability - no settings or difficulty modifiers\nIf I were writing this review earlier in the game, I might have recommended it. There were a lot of good parts to it, but it was not satisfying overall from a completionist perspective. Girls Like Robots has left a bad taste in my mouth that I could not, in good conscience, wish unto others. Looking at the global achievement stats and seeing that only 17% of players have even finished the first act, I think that others have also had a negative experience. If you like to buy games and then not play them through, feel free to add this one to your collection.","March 3","false","44.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's not a game for everyone, but I was surprised to find out that it was a game for me.\n\nSome things about the game might seem tedious, but they sort of break away if you overcome the difficulty curve and truly learn how to play. It also helps to get into the mind of every character and understand what they like and dislike, rather than memorize a series of patterns.\n\nThe soundtrack is very folksy, and I happen to love folk music. I don't think everyone else can appreciate that, but that is a factor to consider before getting this game as a gift for a friend or loved one. Also, I appreciated how it was Safe For Work and at times amusing.","February 24, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bieeanda/recommended/263460/","Bieeanda","Bieeanda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bieeanda/","656 products in account","A decent puzzle game with a cute presentation, but some annoyances as well. Under the hood it's all math: each of your square figures has a like/dislike relationship with every other one, and score is kept based on which faces are in contact at any given time. This is only explained briefly, once, though there's a button to show current relationships on a colour scale instead.\n\nThings become more complicated when you're forced to place tiles in a specific order. Things become annoying when, doing one of these puzzles, you realize that in order to correct a mistake made a dozen turns ago, you have to undo all twelve moves. Tile swapping puzzles present a similar challenge in that you're only given a certain number of moves, and a similar annoyance in having to restart if you realize that you've fouled things up royally.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers decided to throw timed minigames into the mix, and make them part of the scoring/unlocking scheme for the bonus puzzle levels. They're skippable, but again, they're tied into the system that unlocks bonus levels. This kind of thing baffles me-- these games are supposed to be brain teasers, not repetitive, fast-paced drills.\n\nDespite those gripes, I definitely recommend this title. There are dozens of puzzles in varying formats, and the whole thing is very well presented.","February 15, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite being a logic puzzle, the world is an entirely crazy place. But the game succeeds at developing a personality without pushing the absurdity too far. It may appear like a mobile game, but it feels very solid on PC.\n\nThe game is a fairly casual puzzle, involving interactions between character pieces. Each group of levels focuses on new mechanics, introducing them smoothly and keeping the game fresh. Each group uses the story to justify rule changes, with some levels focused on getting the lowest score possible. The game stays fresh and hardly feels repetitive. Some levels did cause me trouble, mostly the five or so levels with a time limit. The music is solid and relaxing, but some songs can be repetitive. Sound effects are often hilarious, and still make me smile after playing the game to completion.\n\nA sense of humor is needed for Girls Like Robots, as you can't take it seriously. It's a lovely game with a great personality, and strong gameplay to keep it going. It's perfect for a fan of puzzles and silly comedy. With the full price of $7 USD, I'm willing to recommend it to everyone.","July 20, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(And "nice" is the best word I can come up with; it fits very well.) The mood is positive, maybe a bit cheesy and clichée, but that can easily be overlooked. The puzzles are very varied. You get new types of challenges and viewpoints and problem-types very often, and it's all embedded in a story arc.\nYou can skip particularly troublesome puzzles and finish them at a later time, which is REALLY good. You can finish and move on with low score, or try to get a better one for more points, thus getting earlier/more unlocks of bonus features.\nSo the game is very forgiving, combined with being motivating and having lots of variety.\n\nIf I had to say one bad thing about the game, it would be that there could be a little more musical variety. The music fits the game though. It just gets a bit repetitive after a while.\nOh and when you play the final level ... that takes FOREVER, and towards the end it gets more tricky, and if you make a single mistake, your chances of getting a certain achievement are ruined and you'd have to start over. Happened to me. So frustrating!\nIn general, the whole game is casual and then the finale is not at all casual. But with patience, focus and perseverence it will succeed.\n\nI don't know what else to say. I'm usually quite critical when reviewing games, but this one is an easy 'thumbs up'. This game is so cheerful! It's like the whole time you're playing this, you're partying.\n\nAnd while I got this with heavy discount, if your own budget allows for more, it might easily be worth full price. Especially since the game has a decent length if you don't try to rush through. (108 puzzles) ... It is also quite challenging if you want to get gold for all puzzles.","September 25, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What sets this one apart and makes it fun to play and interesting is the very same thing that holds it back from being a "great" game. The graphics, while well drawn and cute, do grate on your nerves after a bit.\n\nThe developers responsible for this game have obviously spent a lot of time worrying about the sound design, the cute voice effects and absolutely fantastic old-timey bluegrass soundtrack kept me playing longer than I would have otherwise for a first sit-down with this game. Even with the great soundtrack and cute voices, I see myself playing through Girls Love Robots in small 15-minute chunks, as opposed to marathoning the entire thing like with most puzzle games.\n\nSo, really, my most major criticism is that it just isn't addictive enough.  Cute, simple to understand concept with some surprisingly challenging puzzles when pared with the childlike graphics do not make something easy to sit and pour hours into at a time. I don't think this was the point of the game, anyway, but it is definitely something that loses points - at least for me, it does. After 20 minutes or so, you will want to strangle every, "Normal girl," that lets out an excited squeal whenever placed next to a robot. Very mixed feelings about this game.\n\nSwitching up the gameplay features and creating interesting challenges does keep the game interesting to a degree, and I appreciate the silly but harmless sense of humor inherent within it. This game would be great if you have a friggin' genius for a child that can figure out puzzles, but they would probably get bored with it after a few short sessions, as well.\n\nThe hilarious use of stereotypes is great - you've got your nerds that sit in the corners, and are pleased as punch surrounded by robots, your preppy girls who love robots because they're cute, the nerdy girls who are loners and love ladybugs, and the robots, which are way overdone - but it has been a few years since they've been featured in a major way in anything pop culture related thanks to the zombie boom. It hasn't been that long, yet, fellas.\n\nI got it in a bundle, so I really can't say anything bad about the price, but on the Steam store it would be a worthy pick up for less than 5 dollars. However, I wouldn't pay any more than that for it, because you might not finish the game, or you may take forever to finish it by playing in small bursts of time.\n\nSure, I recommend it, but don't count on getting addicted to it like with some other puzzlers.\n\n6.5/10 - Gameplay and addictiveness.\n9/10 - Soundtrack.","October 8, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It starts out really handholdy and boring, and it remains boring throughout. If you're a fan of puzzle gamers you might get a kick out of this, but everything this game does is done better in pretty much any puzzle/match game out there. It basically sacrificed the gameplay over the style, and it really shows after about 5 minutes that it's nothing special.","September 9, 2014","false","2.1"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

I was not particularly drawn by the strange title or artwork (square face icons). After a while, I decided to give it a shot. I've got to say, it is a well made game. It starts out easy, and you are slowly introduced to more difficulty. Though the artwork is... well... square faces, the makers did well to animate them and make a little bit of a story. It is surely quirky, but the game itself is solid. The music is good. It runs very smoothly. I can say that it feels a bit like a tablet game in some ways, but it doesn't take away from the PC experience. All in all, it is an enjoyable game that is quite quirky, but in a good way. It is good, clean fun with nothing objectionable that I have seen.","November 9, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
