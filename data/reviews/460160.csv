Audio and graphics are the same as The Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nYou may think: "It costs 3$ who the hell would buy this?!? it's so short and its a side story!" First of all, it's worth the money and who the hell would buy it? Me. Why? Because i'm a fan of the series~\nI hope this awnser satisfys you :)\n\nVerdict 8/10 - I reccomend this for every VN lover, and if you never have read or heard about Grisaia just watch the anime or read this, you'll be introduced to some characters there too ;3","May 18","true","24.6"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","55","57","5","4"

You will see a rather different side to them.\nI think this would be a good introduction for someone who hasn't played the series yet, and it doesnt cost much at all.\nBeing a fan myself, it was nice to get something while waiting for the rest of the trilogy to come out.\n","May 18","true","1.5"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","48","53","5","3"

Even partially?\n\nIf your answer is yes, then I would recommend this. It's cheap and you'll find that Front Wing's humor is spot on as always. It's a nice little side story to add to the main visual novel. It's about an hour long, so you'll read it through quickly.\n\nIf your answer is no, don't even bother. Not trying to turn away any potential fans for Grisaia, absolutely not. It's just that Leisure of Grisaia brings nothing special to people who browse random visual novels. With no real introductions to the characters, it's expected that you should know who the main students that attend Mihama Academy are, since you won't learn much here. If you want to read this, I'd recommend reading some chapters from The Fruit of Grisaia first, at least until you can kind of tell what kind of people the students are.\n\nSimply put: it's good, but to make your experience better, check out The Fruit of Grisaia first if you haven't already.","May 18","true","1.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

In just 5 minutes.\n\nAh, the Grisaia trilogy. Three of the greatest stories ever conceived. Then there's this, one of the greatest side stories ever conceived.\nMihama Academy chew toy student Michiru once again takes centre stage in this small tale, primarily backed up by Sachi and her...unique skillset, along with Makina who is just being Makina. As usual.\n\nIf the above statement doesn't make much sense, you might not have played the main games and may not get the full level of enjoyment out of this. Knowledge of the characters is definitely an advantage, but if you like a bit of a laugh then it may be worth checking out anyway. It's main downside? Being pretty short, even by fan-disk standards.\n\nHandy dandy Pros N Cons taken from the above because nobody actually reads reviews anymore\nPros:\n+ Ridiculously funny\n+ Pretty cheap\n+ Nice soundtrack as usual\n+ References to the main game (Tunafish Man cameos FTW)\n\nCons:\n- Short\n- Worth mentioning again, but you'll really get full enjoyment out of this by actually having prior understanding of the characters (Is this really a con?

It focuses more on the laughs and risque moments of the Grisaia series, without much, if any reference to the darker undertones of the Fruits of Grisaia (Grisaia no Kajitsu) visual novel.\n\nWithout a doubt, I bought it simply as a huge fan of the original visual novel, but if you're not a pretty devoted fan to the Grisaia series, you will almost certainly feel pretty ripped off for the 40-50 minutes of fanservice entertainment that this game provides.\n\nSo with that I recommend this game, if you know what you're getting into. Without meaning to sound too hipster, if you didn't know this game existed, then you probably aren't the target audience for it.","May 18","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you can infer from the retail price, this novel is fairly short, taking 45-60 min to complete with an average reading pace. Despite this, this short little sidestory will not fail to make you laugh just as the main game does. Overall I felt the experience was worth the $3 and I suggest giving this a go, especially if you liked the Fruit of Grisaia.","May 31","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is not at all related to the actual Grisaia series, this is just a spinoff, but as a Grisaia fan I still enjoyed this little story. Filled with the fun humour of the original series and adding in more of Michirus crazy ideas made this a really fun read for the small price to pay. My waifu Yumiko is still lowkey horny as hell and tries to hide it, she was entertaining as always. Minus a few spelling errors here and there, this is well worth the price, especially if you are a fan of the Grisaia series.

A few mispellings here and there, but great work overall.  Note - will probably want to have already played Grisaia (or at least started it) to fully enjoy this side material.\n\nStory mainly revolves around Michiru, Makina, and Sachi.  Yumiko and Amane also show up.  Takes place after Yuuji comes to Mihama Academy, but he does not appear.\n\nLength is a little under an hour.  Leisure is similar to Fruit of Grisaia's common route in tone (comedic).  Only real problem is that I wish they kept the font from Fruit's release.  Also had one crash within 30 seconds of starting the story that fixed itself after relaunching.\n\nSome sexual themes/humor, but no actual sex scenes.\n\nInterface is essentially the same as Fruit's.\n\nOverall, a nice short story worth a fistful of change if you like Grisaia and need a little helping while Rakuen/Eden finish up translation.","May 18","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The characters are given no introduction here as you're expected to have either read the original visual novel, or watched the anime, which is what this was originally bundled with in Japan.\n\nThat said, if you have read the original visual novel and enjoyed the comedy, this is something you'll enjoy reading.  The Leisure of Grisaia is a short (about an hour) side story centered around Michiru, Sachi and Makina, with Michiru being the focus character.  Amane and Yumiko both make appearances, though their roles are minor here, and Yuuji is only mentioned in passing a couple of times without making an appearance.\n\nAs for the cons, well it would have been nice if Yuuji had made even a brief appearance, or even if we had gotten a line or two explaining his rather conspicuous absence (Makina's behavior makes it pretty clear this takes place after his arrival at the academy).  Also, while I do think Leisure is worth the money, it would have been nice to get maybe another hour of content, although that might just be me being greedy.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of Grisaia's humor, this is an hour of good laughs, as the humor picks up pretty much right off the bat, and watching the girls go off on tangents just never seems to get old.  It would have been nice if it had been longer, but it's still worth buying regardless.","May 19","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
