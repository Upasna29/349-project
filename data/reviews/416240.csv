Seriously. You start out with a simple trusty mining laser and a newbie station, build further crafting systems, build ships, build more SPACE STATIONS, and so on.\n\nI've always had trouble telling from the trailers of these sorts of games whether they emphasize the arcade/shooting parts, or maybe they're FTL clones, or just really boring and cheaply made. But this is the real deal so far, for me.\n\nGraphics that don't look like some poorly put-together Unity thing. Instead you have pretty block-graphics, lighting effects, and a very snappy responsive interface.\n\nAlso there are actual PHASER ARCS like star trek that you have to aim, which should give an idea of the kind of game you're getting into.\n\nWish there were quests and other star systems to visit, but comparable things are already in the feature list and will be coming soon enough if the devs are to be trusted. Based on what I've seen, I believe in them.\n\nP.S. A server browser would be really nice and would encourage early adopters to get together easier, I think.","March 1","true","27.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","1"

I haven't eaten or drank, but it's okay, I have Tritanium, sweet sweet Tritanium!\n\nAll joking aside I'm only 4 hours in, but it gets very addictive, I rather like this game so far.

I also love FTL and other space related games so I might be a tad biased. This game is different than those but somehow retains a similar addiction~  I also like pixel art, customization, and exploration. I just feel like this game has a really great feel.\n\nI did not expect there to be much to do in it's early access state. But seeing where the Dev's are in the development process and seeing how much crafting and customizing there is/will be has got me excited to say the least!\n\nYou start in a little tiny pixelated spacecraft in a star system next to a space station. You can zoom in and out and open up a menu for your ship and stations. You mine asteroids and pick up ore's and craft new items/kit's ect. Your ship can take damage and be repaired. You can warp to other star systems and mine more exotic planets and asteroids as well as explore other wrecked ships and destroyed space stations to collect their goodies!\n\nThere is already tons of crafting objects in the menu but no fear you can check a box to show only the itmes you are able to craft. You can add remove/upgrade parts from your ships and stations. Your starting ship called the "Venture" does not have much cargo space, so you may find yourself storing things on your home station which you can frequent anytime to drop off or pick up items. Once you have collected/explored enough content you will start to upgrade lasers to mine faster or possibly purchase/build a new and better ship.\n\nIt is possible to generate systems for new games using seeds similar to the way it worked in minecraft. Some have called this terraria in space and I can see the relation but this game feels very unique in it's own right.\n\nThe game is composed of tiles so customization and modding should be avaiable and simple for most everyone making future options and new content limitless~\n\nCore mechanics seem solid and as I am writing this I am looking forward to diving back in.\n\nThe game is simply charming!\n\nI wish this game was getting more attention than it is which is funny because I read where the developers were surprised that it was getting so much attention. I will probably buy another copy or two and gift a few friends I know would enjoy it.\n\nThe (I believe) 2 dev's seem to be very proactive and motivated, engaging their community and soaking up feedback. I will be playing the game more and more as time goes on but felt it necessary to come post comments and thumb it up to help thrust the game forward.\n\nI will be back to update my post as I consume more content and as the game progresses.\n\nThank You Dev's~ Keep up the great work!","March 29","true","3.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This game is actually pretty cool though. Mining, crafting, upgrading and etc all in a space setting. Ships, stations, asteroids, AI and etc. Multiplayer!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vexrak/recommended/416240/","vexrak","Vexrak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vexrak/","98 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUnfortunately I have a bias for this game, as I have played it since the second day of release and almost loved it to death. So you might not be able to completely trust this review, but otherwise let's begin.\n\nWhen I first recieved the beta testing copy I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but what ever I did expect, it went far beyond that expectation. There are so many things to do you will almost never get bored, but it's also simultaneously easy to get bored, and I can not explain this. It will obviously vary between every person, though I think it is weird that I can get bored easily even though there are so many things to do.\n\nOther than that I personally love everything about this game, the gameplay, the visuals, the music, and of course the game in general.\n\nI absolutely recommend it to everybody that loves Space Simulators, 2D Mining and Crafting games, easily modded games, and pixel art styled games.\n\nThough if you get bored easily you might want to take a break every once in a while so that you don't play for too long and feel like you don't want to play anymore.\n\nAgain another amazing addition to Happy Polygon's playlist of games, and I totally recommend this game.","March 3","true","15.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The developers heard the calls for the reduction in material needed to progress down the many, many tiers of ships. Now it is easier to build ships and move on from the dreary gameplay that is the starting ship. I've also noted a small increase to the game performance on my low-end laptop, though that negligible on my PC.\n\nKeep your eyes on the game! It is going and things are getting better with each passing update. Just recently, networking was improved immsensely and that was one of the big gripes I had for the game. Hopping on with friends is, although still lacking the steam invite function it seems.\n\nCombat is still fun when you have a bunch of friends running circles around a ship twice your size and cutting it apart with the precision of a surgeon.\n\n***Edit 3.9.16***\nThe Dev(s) to this game have done an amazing job trying to help my friends and I enjoy their game which is more than I can say about most game devs. They've taken their time out to have a civil discourse with me and offer a bunch of solutions to help out with our situation, which is fine. I do have to remind everyone that this game is Early Access, and the Devs are actively aware of problems with the game and tell us, the players, what they are and how they're going to fix these problems. I'm going to go ahead and change my review from Negative to Positive thanks to the proactive and supportive developers and I look forward to continuing my discourse with them as a player.\n\nI'd like to thank Rexspaceman (the dev) for the time and patience spent discussing the game with me and I do feel as though it's only fair that I put as much time and effort into their game as they spend time fixing it and talking with me.\n\n(This edit changed my rating from Negative to Positive)\n\n*** Edit 3.8.16***\nThe mysterious failing to connect issue is back! Woo! "Connection refused from server" or something.\n\n***Edit 3.8.16***\n\nFinally had a chance to get the Multiplayer to work! It's a fun game, with lots to do but the UI is clunky as hell. Found numerous bugs, one being that if you use another one of your ships to destroy another, (in this instance I used my spacebase to blast away my crippled Venture). In which case I was stuck as the Spacebase. Because I enjoy being a floating gray tub.\n\nAnother problem: It's a tedious grind to get enough resources to even upgrade your ship. There's no point in bothering because you'll always be a paper-thin Venture because if you try to leave the area to get new resources for bigger ships, you'll get hounded to death by aliens. The only weapons in the game are the mining lasers which are, quite frankly, useless. Every fight turns into a battle of the paraplegic spacecraft that spin around aimlessly because the AI doesn't quite understand how to fight.\n\nTL;DR: The grind is horrendous. Right click all day. Leaving to get higher-level resources means death. Enjoy the starter ship.\n\n***\n3.7.16\nI cannot recommend a game that advertises itself as a multiplayer game but the moment I try to join any of my friends, it loads, then immediately says I am disconnected and booted back to the main screen.\n\nMultiplayer is broken. We've tried having no passwords, tried using the Steam "join game" drop-down option, using our IPs or joining by name. Just doesn't work. Haven't seen anything else on the discussions about how to resolve the problem.\n\nThe game itself is amazingly fun for whatever few frustrated moments I spent on it. It brought me back to one of the best space games I've ever played: Star Trek: Broken Mirror which was awesome. The gameplay is fun but I haven't been able to figure out how to craft or add onto my ship. It seems deep and fun but I can't review on that. The Devs have made a polished and fun game. If only the multiplayer worked.","March 8","true","13.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","21"

The Devs are clearly very passonate and engaged in trying to make this game better. Don't beleive me just look at the forums. If you want to get involved in this process and actually have your voice heard then this is it. Honestly if you watch the Lets plays or the trailer and you think this is a game you'd enjoy then you most likely will. Grab a friend to and go have exploring this wonderful sandbox.

That said, it is not yet completed enough to warrent a release on steam, even for 'early access' there should be playable content... i'd come back to this game in 6-12 months...","March 26","false","0.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","2"

In over an hour (80 minutes) that I've held right click I have done nothing other than fighting the yellow energy bar and now my hand hurts. For all the right clicking and waiting for the energy to refill, I've only upgraded my mining laser to MK3 which did practically nothing because even tho it mines faster, it also uses more energy, so there was no net gain.\n\nWhere it's a nice concept showing the mechanics of what could become a nice game, currently the alpha state is only a test platform and you may want to resort to using cheats to get yourself resources to build your ship or you'll be stuck holding right click until the game is released.","March 6","false","1.4"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","1"

It's very fun to see new ship after you crafted them but when you died, you restart from the smallest ship which is a thing i think should be removed as it's pretty troublesome to keep starting over but that just my playstyle. There are some features and content still coming over this year, it's all planned out on their website so go check it out. There are some very small bug like able to spawn multiple ships with just 1 ship kit but i'm sure it would be fix and some other bugs that just mostly required a restart to fix it. And it's pretty cheap to buy as well so buy it so you can try it, it's a game worth exploring just like the gameplay.","March 6","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
