I played about three games and it needs a lot of fixes especially with bugging textures. It also needs new characters and clearer menu. I like this concept of games, they're good for relaxing :D I think after some time it will be as good as for example Smite.","February 4, 2015","true","0.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"
