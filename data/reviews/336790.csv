Not every game is for everyone.\nThat being said, if you are here and are looking for a special and unique game, something different, you are in the right place. And I do recommend you this game.\n\nSo first I'll tell you why you might not like Kwaan :\nIt's a very different game, not bad, just different.\nAnd this can be very disturbing for some.\nGoals are explained but not really entirely. There is no end game, competition, combat.\n\nThe game is all about how to play together to achieve a bigger goal than you could alone.\nIt's about how to take care of a world with the help of everyone, every day.\n\nNow, why will you love this game ?- Because it's a very different game.\nYou won't have to fight, or kill or get killed (you can die, but no ennemie here to kill you).\n\n- There is a big learning curve but the other players will be pleased to help you learn.\n\n- The game is beautiful for anyone who loves pixel art. It's cute, and the music is soothing.\n\n- The gameplay is relaxing : you'll have to draw (really) to achieve things or just for the sake of drawing (there is spaces for free drawing, that's a very nice touch). You'll have to explore, and to explore more you'll have to uncover mysteries of the world. Most of things to unlock can't be done alone, and everyone will participate to unlock new regions to explore or new mysteries to uncover.\n\n- You will find some RPG mecanics. You'll gain XP by doing quests. You'll have skill points to spend. You can even customise your dwall (your character) with a cute haat (a leaf or a flower as a hat :p). And you have skill to use but in KWAAN your skills are dancing, eating, meditating, singing !\n\n- KWAAN is a living world that needs to be taken care of ! Create bunnies so you can have flowers ! Those flowers will create butterflies ! (it's just an example of the ecosystem, but there is a LOT to learn on how life is working on KWAAN).\nThere is a story to discover and I won't say much more, to not spoil but also because I haven't uncover all the story myself.\n\n- The developpers are very active and you will find them online a lot.\nSometimes you will be able to tell them about a bug and they will just work on it right away.\nAs it's an online game only, the devs will continue to work on KWAAN for some time to keep the world and the stories alive.\n\nBut for that to happen we need players...\nSo come ! Don't be shy ! You might not know it but this game is perfect for you ;)","January 23","true","247.9"," 66 of 71 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","66","71","4","0"

I've bumped into this little gem by chance while I was browsing through the steam store in search of some good summer deals. I'm truly glad I found it despite its low visibility.\n\nYou play as a Dwaal, a cute sapling; you can't jump, but you can use a rope to swing around the world (or a sheep as a trampoline!). This platform element is actually pretty challenging, especially at the very beginning of your experience. The more you play, the more you actually become good with your rope and you'll be able to reach tricky places.\nYou can collect maana gems and use them to buy items in the shop or as a energy coin to summon critters and bloom flowers.\nThere are colorful pixels scattered all around the world, and you can use them to draw, to create new branches on the Kwaal tree, to bloom flowers and to grow fruits.\nFunny fact: maana crystals are shared among all players!\nEvery day you unlock new quests to complete in order to gain levels and unlock new summoning abilities.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to please the big tree Kwaal and make him fell happy with everyday rituals, in order to keep the world alive. Rituals may consist in summoning new creatures, crafting items and dancing all together for Kwaal.\n\nThe music is very charming and catchy, and the world is so bright and cheerful.\nWhat I like the most about this game is actually the community: I met very kind people who teached me what to do and how to. Kwaal is in fact a very cooperative game, in order to complete the daily ritual you need the help of other players (and you really have more fun dancing with other people rather than alone!).\n\nThere are currently two servers: a FR one and a US East one. You can play on both since you won't lose your progress after switching from a server to another. On the FR server people speak English as well, so I got no communication issues. The community is still pretty small yet very active; everytime I log in, there are progressions on the daily ritual.\n\nDespite being still an early access, the game is really polished and I didn't notice any game-breaking bug yet.\nAll in all, I definitely recommend Kwaan and I truly hope the community will grow bigger, this game really deserves it.","June 22, 2015","true","81.8"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebrazi/recommended/336790/","zebrazi","Victor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebrazi/","28 products in account","I have had this game for a couple of weeks and it's fascinating. It evolves around the idea of the playerbase (the dwaals) gathering offerings for KWAAN's (the tree) three-step ritual, so that it maintains its happiness and keeps on surviving for another day. Every few succeeded rituals, KWAAN becomes taller and allows for more room for climbing, drawing, putting up fruit, and most importantly, more Taazes (quest lines). If the playerbase neglects KWAAN's need of rituals, it becomes progressively unhappier to the point where the server dies and everything is reset.\n\nThe ritual consists of a set number of dwaals dancing (a number that increases with every step, from 4 to 6 to 8) in front of the altar after gathering the previously mentioned offerings (which may be animals such as beavers, sheep, butterflies, koalas). The act of completing a ritual's third step, and thus finishing all requirements for KWAAN to survive, is known as "Kwaanza", a holiday that dwaals celebrate as a collective result of teamwork and cordiality.\n\nSome have reviewed that the server keeps dying because nobody ever comes online to help, and truthfully, that is a terrifying thought to whoever wants to buy the game, only to be met by a world whose death seems imminent. Thankfully that is not a problem since the number of dancers (players online) can be minimalized by purchasing NPCs at the cost of time took to collect enough resources, this way removing the requirement of needing a set number of people online. But again, we make sure to complete most rituals during the peak hours so that nobody has to worry about them later. We seldom need dancers for it.\n\nOthers have reviewed that they have no idea what to do in this game. I thought I'd write a little bit about everything KWAAN has to offer gameplay-wise, in hope that no one who buys the game can say it's void of content or ambiguous.\n\nAs KWAAN grows, more and more Taazes are unlocked. Taazes are day-specific questlines that require teamwork to complete and encourage discovery. They can only be completed once by every dwaal, but you can always go back to specific teamwork related areas in order to help others out if they're in need.\n\nIf the ritual has been done and you have completed the Taaz, you've still got plenty of other things to worry about.\n\nYou can help by cleaning the area around. As an ecosystem, the world accumulates dirt over time and has to be taken care of. If the dirt level of a certain area is high enough, it starts to eat away dropped loot and thus causing drawbacks (for example, if you're looking to summon a grub, you'll need an apple and a leaf. You put up an apple in the tree and wait for it to drop, along with a leaf that drops naturally. As soon as the apple hits the ground, the garbage eats it and causes you to wait for another one).\n\nThere are three NPCs in the main town that you can receive quests from. They may include:\nsummoning animals (that have an individual use; the crabs dig up shells you can use in order to summon other creatures, penguins may dig up resources required for building certain devices/zones, moles may help you get through normally unaccesible paths),\nfinding critters (that may drop different things from the tree. KWAAN already drops leaves and all sorts of stuff in it's natural state, but there are many critters you can find in it that drop items required for Taazes, items that you can't summon certain animals without, etc),\nopening up treasures (found in certain locations of the map and contain pixels),\nusing a certain amount of pixels to draw things in the world boards or on KWAAN (yup, you can draw on the big tree).\ncollecting Maana (the resource we use in order to buy things from shops, put up fruit in the tree, summon animals, hire dancers. It's scattered all over the world and can be collected by coming into contact with it. The resource is shared between all dwaals).\nThis means you can always have three diverse quests on you that reward pixels or experience. The more experience you gain, the more you level and the more cute hats you unlock (every 5 levels unlock a new hat) that you can use to idenfity yourself. At the same time, there is a level requirement on certain worlds that have grown too much to be as well understood by the new players, so leveling up allows you to join those worlds at some point.\n\nThe world is not big enough to require a map, but it's big enough to keep you interested in it and find different uses. You should always strive to explore areas that you're not necessarily told to. They're home to specific loot that may ease your work in the future. I'd give spoilers, but I'd take away from exciting discoveries.\n\nIf you finished reading this whole thing, then you've heard a big chunk of what KWAAN is about. I truly want the game to grow. There are so many wonderful and amazingly friendly people willing to help. The game has a continous cycle that does not allow you to be bored. There is always something to do, and if you ever feel like you've done it all, there is always someone else you can help out.","February 12","true","112.2"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","38","41","0","1"

That being said, Kwaan has the friendliest community that ive ever met. EVERYONE is like the nicest ever when they play this game. the sprites are adorable and the music changes as the day goes on. I used this game as a background track while I played smite. however, i should probably talk about cons as well.\n\nTo be blunt, unless you are a certain kind of person, this game is boring at first glance. You think, "where is all the fighting? where is the story? what is with these horrible jittery mouse controls?(no longer mouse controls, now wasd) but I promise you, if you stick with Kwaan, you'll find an experience unlike any other.\n\nThis game, it's never been done before. you have to grow a tree by offering animals to rituals, and all dance around a diamond while the spirits of the animals you've sacrificed are imbued into the tree. to get the tree to grow, you have to work together, everyone has to work to get the ingredients right.\n\nBut the best thing about the game, hands down, is the drawing. I LOVE pixel art. and the aforementioned tree is a giant canvas. You can only use shades of brown on the tree, and at first, i thought "What? why did they give me all these colors so i could just use brown?" but soon i found out that the pixel art looks like its a part of the tree, or carved out of wood.\n\nBut the other colors are far from useless, in order to summon animals, you need to grow fruit, and to grow fruit, you need colored pixels. In addition, there are canvases spread out around the world for you to express your skill in drawing.\n\nso all in all, Kwaan is a great game, but not for everyone. chances are, if you decided to scroll down into the reviews of a game that is advertised as a "living ecosystem" than you are probably the kind of person this game is for.\n\n*Edit Edit\n\nby the way, most of the games content hasnt been unlocked yet! you can still experience the magic and wonder of this game along with the rest of us. devs are on this game like garlic on bread, and are constantly patching the game\nSorry for all the errors in grammer and spelling.

You click with your mose and your character runs to that place. There is also some platforming involved and some of it is not very simple. For that you use a rope and it can be especially tricy when there are spikes around.\nActivities consist of random summoning of criters depending on your needs. There is flower blooming (you draw flowers pixel by pixel) and also painting (there are pictures throughout the world that anyone can edit).\nMain issue is there is not enough players sometimes and some rituals are imposible to do solo. Especially when you're a new player and can't get enough exp in one day (you get xp by completing daily quests).\nI am excited to see how this game turns out but Ankama should try to attract more players since this game - if you want to really have fun with it needs larger community than it is now.\nIf you want to support sort of unique project buy this game but take note that this is still very early access.","May 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","2"

Although one genre that never intrigued me to touch was MMOs. Maybe cause most of them were fantasy and had frustrating menus and thousand HUDs. So what happened here?\nWell to tell you the truth, the artstyle of KWAAN played a major part to drag me in. Then I saw that your main goal is to keep alive a tree-server. Also there was a pixel editor kinda thing and  I think that was the last piece that made me push the add to cart button.\nAs I'm in game for a few days now, I found that the game has a unique way to unravel it's gameplay and the community plays a major part on that too. There are some minor 'everyday' missions to do to get XP and some puzzle missions that you have to squish your brain to solve them (or just ask for tips from the lovely people in there).\nYes the game is weird.

I EFFING LOVE THIS ONE! I've been playing for a while and I know Kwaan will give me hours of entertaining.\n\nIt's true: You don't have much information when you play the first time and you can feel a little lost, but explore the whole HUD, everything's in there. If you don't do it, you'll probably get bored soon and that's not fair.\n\nYour "Dwaan" (your character, that little Deku kid) is a bit tricky to control the first minutes, but you'll handle it fast.\nThe pixel aesthetics fits perfect (you can paint in some especific parts of the map! how cool is that?) and the music is the perfect companion for your adventure.\n\n· The worst thing I found in Kwaan is not really their fault in my opinion: There's only a few people playing it in EU servers, so in some moments you'll be so alone, but this depends on us. The more people plays Kwaan, the less alone we'll feel.\n\nBUT don't forget that this is an EARLY ACCESS, so it has so much potential to grow as an incredible and entertaining game.

I didn't really know what to expect.  The art style is really cute, and I love the pixel editor aspect of the game.  I think I spent my first hour just editing and gathering pixels.  I also liked that each time i logged in it was a different world.  Everyone kind of bands together to build the different building and move forward in the story.  Movement was a little tricky since you can't jump.  But I think the grappling hook aspect helped make things more challenging and fun.  Ultimately the puzzle aspect is what is going to draw you in.  It's a game where you actually use your mind instead of mindlessly hacking and slashing away at things.

It's very casual and calming not to mention so so cute, others before me have definitely covered the basics of gameplay and the concept driving the world of kwaan so I don't want to delve too deep into that, but I do want to say that I love love love the idea of sustaining a little world by working together. That's what melts my heart: being able to take a little part of your day to care for a small (digital) corner of the world through teamwork. Even if everything else goes wrong that day it's a little thing that can go right.\n\nThere are more 'how to play' basics available than when I first got the game which makes it a bit less confusing when you first get started, but even that you have to work to figure out how the world works and discover the uses of items (all with the help of your dwaal friends) strengthens the inner logic of the game and really makes it your world to discover.\n\nThe graphics are unbelievably adorable, the music changes as you go through the cycles of kwaan's day and I personally find it so soothing and uplifting, and the community is so kind and supportive. The one thing that's been troubling me is that the structure of this game depends on there being players in the game and lately people have been going on less and less; it can be disheartening to go in and find that you're playing all by yourself! The community is pretty small as it is so it's really noticable when dwaals go MIA. Sooooooo! the best solution is for all you kind folks to get the game and join in in our quest to please Kwaan, our tree god :)","April 12","true","208.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chadleeskrikker/recommended/336790/","chadleeskrikker","endlessly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chadleeskrikker/","19 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKWAAN is an interesting specimen. Not quite a platformer, not entirely an RPG, the game occupies a space between the two genres, and throws in the concepts of ecosystemic servers and communal gameplay.\n\nAll in all, a simple, peaceful little game that should be perfect for a bit of time away from the usual offerings. What takes Kwaan a step away from perfection are the few problems that bog down what could be a really great example of non-violent, social game experiences.\n\nThe biggest of these is the control scheme. Your player character is controlled with the mouse. A click near the character moves it left and right, and a click on an object higher up will allow the player to swing towards the object, while holding pulls the character closer to said object. I’m sure this was created with fluidity and freedom in mind, but it simply does not work. Clicking to move in a sidescrolling environment is incredibly counter-intuitive, and unless the developers offer to rewire the brains of their customers, feels anything but natural. Reaching higher places can be a frustrating business, and even walking onto platforms is made unnecessarily annoying, often resulting in falling off and having to start over again.\n\nAdding a traditional keyboard control scheme, or even a keyboard/mouse combination, would make for a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nAnother major issue of the game is the overwhelming amount of words and concepts the game throws at you. Words like taaz, zaaz, miaam and paash are used in dialogue and menus with little or no explanation, and the game makes no effort to ease new players into its world, systems and mythology. I know the developers are working on a tutorial and story mode, but I think an internal, constantly updating codex or handbook is the best option for handling the huge amount of…stuff in this game. Getting into the game can be difficult. Since there is no tutorial, players have to rely on more experienced players, which is not always possible, due to constant server underpopulation. As of now, the KWAAN wiki, the only other place for help, is equally underpopulated, and not much help.\n\nOther than that, KWAAN is a good game but wobbles dangerously into bad game territory when it comes to certain design and gameplay decisions. The pixel artwork is stunning to look at, not to mention the amazing user-created art that populates the game world. But while pixelated images are nice to look at, pixelated text is quite the opposite, making in-game reading a chore. The NPCs are cute and the things they say are funny, but we know absolutely nothing about any of them, and the somewhat philosophical quips scattered around the game and related media can feel a tiny bit pretentious when you’re given no reason to really care about the world.\n\nKWAAN is still in early access, though, and the developer promises a tutorial and story mode, among other improvements. Whether I keep playing is up to whether the developer can fix the flawed controls and maybe tone down on the mythology, at least at the beginning. And, for a game that (literally) lives and dies on its community, a few more players sure would be nice.","November 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Not only that, but most things in the game aren't really hinted at or anything. Items don't have descriptions, Locked doors don't tell you how to unlock them... apparently, you're supposed to just ask the chat what to do at every turn. There's no way to figure out what you're supposed to do, you just ask what to do at EVERY obstacle. That's it. That's the WHOLE game. I don't think I've seen a worse idea for a game in my life. Not to mention, the only character customization is changing your hat, and the only "sandbox" element is drawing on the tree or on some signs.","January 25","false","2.9"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","9"

Low price, cute art-design, very very very very good community. That's what make this game worth to buy.\nYou can do everything...or do nothing. There is no real objective (you have to make an ancestral tree, Kwaan, happy by performing rituals with your friends. No monsters, no PVP, no money...\nKwaan is like a "game chat", but he's way better.\n\n***\n\nAt this moment, game is still in early-access, so the map is quite small and lots of features aren't implanted yet, be aware !","March 22, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's never one specific goal.  Rather, there's several generic goals; Things like keep the Kwaan happy, Complete quest objectives, and other things like that.

There are some platformer elements, but the game is really about discovering and understanding the world and collaborate to improve your skills, learn new recipes and find the way to spawn new creatures, that will, themselves, allow more power and exploration. The "Kwaan" evolves and grows by the collective actions of the players and is clearly the main attraction. So cool to login each day and see how does it look?
