It is one of those games that will hold your attention for years to come.\n\nI remember walking into a very old Poundland type of shop when I was younger. Literally a year or so after it was released in the early 2000's and we found this game just in a discount shelf, so it was bought for our almighty Windows 95/98 machine. It was one of the best games I had ever played, of course, I was very young, 6/7 years old, and not very good at it, but it was epic and always will be.\n\nBetrayed by one of your own, you must set out to defeat the enemies of your land with those loyal. Building villages to towns and cities, to defeat your enemies. This is no easy game. It requires time, patience, knowledge and a did I mention time?\n\nStrategy is extremely important. You cannot mass produce the same troops, not unless you want rekt by some archers and some militia. Speaking of armies, it is important that you keep a steady flow of resources, as your serfs are the most important people you can create. They take raw resources to buildings so that food and weapons can be created, to then be transferred to your castle or storehouse. Every character you can create serves importance, resources are limited and sometimes time is as well, as the enemy A.I. will attack and will be ruthless towards you, the further into the game you get.\n\nI must mention KaMRemake.com here, not because I've been asked to, but because of the work they have put into the Remake. coded from scratch, as the original code was never released, Krom and Lewin have recreated this masterpiece, fixed bugs, allowed speed up buttons, pause buttons and some new maps and a totally new and improved multi-player! With the Remake you also get 3 new campaigns created by players, for players, that are very challenging and not for the feint hearted.\n\nDownload the Remake, you will not be disappointed!\n\nIf you are into strategic fighting and building games, you NEED to get this now!\nIt's late, I'll probably add to this review soon, but for now, peace!","May 31, 2015","true","12.5"," 105 of 109 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","105","109","2","0"

Every stone and plank added to any building is carefully built piece by piece, and best part is you can SEE that happens.

So many childhood memories I have of this game. I remember playing this years ago and sucking horrible at it because I was too young to be any good in strategy games but now im older and somewhat better at strategy games, spent over a 100 hours in this game because its so addicting and time consuming :)\n\nUpon purchasing and playing this game, the game kept crashing and crashing for me when using windows 7. Luckily fans made a HD remake mod for this game and I can play at without any problems, even though the remake version isnt 100% complete yet and it need some tweaking here and there.

I started it up the first time completely confused as heck wondering why no one was listening to my commands and quickly stopped. Decided to give it another shot and am quite happy I did... as I ended up playing for four hours straight.\n\nThe AI is interesting to note on this one. Rather than telling peasants (or serfs as their called) or builders (laborers) to do exactly what to do - you are a planner and the serfs and laborers do your bidding automatically. Yes, that means that serfs and what not micro manage themselves. It can be a bit of an issue as I've noticed building 3 or more buildings sometimes can halt production, none the less though once this is addressed there shouldn't be issues. Roads need to be built to interconnect the city as well as allow serfs to travel to the job site to drop off materials for the building to be built. Laborers and serfs work closely together to accomplish the building - serfs mostly look after distribution of resources. There are A LOT - of different resources which get stored at a supply house. Bows, swords, shields, flour, corn are just the beginning of what is stored.\n\nThere are different types of units military wise but the civilian crowd delivers stability to your village. Bakers can be trained, animal trainers, farmers, carpenters, wood cutters, miners etc... It can get quite crazy and overbearing at times early on in the campaign to see how much can be done with the diversity of the units.\n\nBattling is interesting and is as cool as an old style RTS can get. What is neat though which I wish other games would follow is when holding down the right mouse button, you can actually choose 360 degrees which way your troops should face. When you select a band of your troops, you are able to link up units with other units (conjoin groups) and are able to unite a bunch of units under one banner. Be it under one banner or not, you are able to rotate and position in HOW MANY lines the troops are allowed to be in. This really helps keeping a long line of infantry while keeping a band of arrows behind the infantry line.\n\nI got this game extremely cheap on sale and figured why not? Somehow for some reason, I like this game. Some of the in game perks as which way the soldier should face I found absolutely brilliant even though simple. I found myself mesmerized watching the AI serfs and laborers do my bidding and build.\n\nIs this game for everyone? Not really - you may get sucked into it like I did or you may think this is some stupid old game that should stay buried. I will recommend it as someone who is consistently looking for action in games, found myself happy with the eventual build of my village.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.4/10\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	C	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-\n\n\n\nScreenShots :\nSoldiers need to be fed as you can see on the right (condition) while a button needs to exist to give peasants crap for standing around and pretending to not look busy","October 17, 2014","true","11.7"," 83 of 90 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","83","90","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/revbiskit/recommended/253900/","revbiskit","Biskit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/revbiskit/","65 products in account","Knights and Merchants, or KaM to those of us that have played the game on and off for decades, is a fantastic and fun game in which you build and fight in a variety of lands.  Each 'mission' has it's own goals, however they do tend to blend together and every new map seems to have the same goal.  Battle missions, where there is no building, are quick, and you will find yourself on the losing end if you're not paying attention.  First time players will see themselves restarting a battle mission a time or two.\n\nKaM is an old game indeed, and this release on Steam finds you with the original, "The Shattered Kingdom" and the next release "The Pesants Rebellion" (both known to the community as TSK and TPR respectively.  The Steam version also includes an "HD Version" which modifies the graphics a bit and the game speed.  It also opens up all buildings starting at mision 1 which is not what the orginal game does.\n\nIf you are into strategy build sims then KaM is a game you will want on your list!\n\nThat said, if you buy this game from Steam or from GOG, I would recommend you play TSK and TPR missions 1-3 only.  That will give you the fundamentals of the game and how it works.  You'll also see several issues with the game and you may encounter a bug or two.  Even with the bugs in the original game, it is worth playing, and worth your time.  Why only the first 3 missions you may ask.  Well, that's because as awesome as the game is, it gets better with the KaM Remake.\n\nOnce you see the game in all its original glory, you simply MUST go get the KaM Remake from www.kamremake.com to enjoy the game with today's computer capabilities.\n\nThe good folks over at KaM Remake have rebuild this awesome game from scratch and added some enhancements, such as better AI, a map editor and the ability for you not only to create your own maps, but make your own missions or even entire campaigns.  They have truly taken a great game, and made it better using all the original game pieces such as the units, environments, and animations, and recreated the game code to support today's computing power and screen sizes.  My personal favorite, is the ability to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.\n\nWhile the KaM Remake has removed two building types for game balance, they added the Marketplace, which was part of the original game but never implemented.  The Marketplace adds a new factor to the game, allowing you to trade one type of resource for another.  This opens up a TON of options for map, mission, and campaign creators.\n\nAdditionally, the KaM Remake is FREE.  Yep, you heard me, FREE.  However you must own KaM in order for the Remake to install and work.  Details can be found at www.kamremake.com\n\nBuy this game.  Get the remake.  You'll be glad you did.","December 23, 2014","true","10.2"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","75","81","0","1"

Ah..\nAnyway, nostalgia trip over, here's my views on this game.\n\nPro's and benefits:\nThis game has an indepth resource management system. Seriously, it's way better than anything to date. Your army can drain your economy rapidly depending on how big it is, so fielding smaller armies can be mutually better, if it may take longer to defeat your enemy.\nStrategy is actually required for this game. No really, it's not a case of throwing a large army of 50 spear holders against a small force of 10 swordsmen with some archers behind, because that'll just get you murdered and that's a whole bunch of gold and resources gone. It's better to have small squads of 6, 9 and 12 with occasional 16 squads appearing now and then.\nThe nostalgic feel of this game is incredible! This game was made a good 10 years ago at the very least, maybe even earlier. Because it was made earlier and during the time that game developers actually had the balls to step outside the box and try something now, it created this game as well as many others.\n\nThe Cons/painful stuff:\nCrash crash crash landings. This game SUCKS with the amount of crashes you can get. Seriously, there's an amazing amount of things you can do, and half of them will make you crash to desktop faster than the speed of light. (Note: this can be remedied via downloading the remake version on modDB. No free game for you though, you have to own the game to get access to the remake. Nice little touch of coding on the dev's part)\nTime. THIS TAKES FOREVER!!! No really, you can be there for a good few hours figuring out one single mission. It can get really frustrating and at times I need to quit and relax my mind before I blow a brain tumor.\n\nFinal score:\nI give this game a 4/5.\nI'm giving it this score because considering everything that's great about this game, the crashes and amount of time it takes, as well as the sheer amount of difficulty some missions can have will result in rages and you not touching the game for a full week. However considering everything else about the game, it's really fun to play.\n\nNotice: With the remake edition, multiplayer is available as well as a few other options, not to mention the crashes are at a minimum and you can increase time to X10 so waiting on your ♥♥♥ no longer becomes such a dull practice. Use the remake version if you want a better game in general. (again, you must own the game before you can use anything in the remake, and even then the remake isn't complete even today, so expect a few issues)","April 3, 2014","true","1.6"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","6"

You can Focus on the city Builiding and then make units.\nIt even has a feeding system where you have to feed everyone in your base constantly so , planning is very important , without the right balance people will go hungry and die eventually.\nEverything is simple and Influences your game in a way.\nIts a very unique old game , unless you master that starting tutorial the game will be impossible to play easily.\nThere are a lot of fan based Re-makes and fixes but i recommend playing the game as it is, Its a great challenge that way, specially For those not interested in multiplayer.\n\nDo Remember to save a lot , The game tends to crash after a long stretch of gaming or music changes","November 25, 2013","true","7.0"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","46","50","0","0"

I found myself playing for a few hours, after only intending to play for 15 minutes or so to write a review. I think if you see this game for dirt cheap, and you enjoy games such as Age of Empires, this is definitely worth a try. It is an older game, so be prepared for that, but you should find some enjoyment with this little gem.","May 24, 2015","true","8.0"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","25","32","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doom1412/recommended/253900/","doom1412","rmn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doom1412/","56 products in account","Great Nostalgia, as I played the original game ~2000 when I was a kid. If you already played this game, you can't do much wrong buying it again, it contains both campaigns (The Shattered Kingdom [TSK] & The Peasants Rebellion [TPR]) which should take ~50hrs of raw speedrunning if you still know the concept of the game.\n\nThere is a problem though: This is NOT the original game from 2000! It's a remake with a hell of bugs and changes (esp. if you played TSK and didn't own the Gold Edition)\n\n\nSome things I noticed:\nOpposite KI is waaaaaay worse than the original game (only TSK). E.g. senseless re-adjusting of the forces which is an invitation to lure them out with an archer without much trouble. They once didn't attack for 30 seconds after my archer hit them and just ran one by one in their death. Then the next army and so on. I killed about 50 Units and didn't lose a single Platoon of guys.\n\nIt's not just more buggy, the KI seems to be more passive than it used to be. I remembered some TSK missions - in Mission 4, they used to have a really vicious timing-attack pressuring a small opening in the mountains if you stood too passive and just tried to eco. The chevalry didn't even move a single feet/hoof in this remake. So lets say you have very much time just building your economy, which you didn't have in the original game and made it kinda tricky to balance economy and army.\n\nAnother (quite annoying) bug is that - if you build the mercenary camp - mercenaries kinda freeze the game. Commands are delayed by ~5 seconds, which can cause big frustration in a combat. So I recommend playing TSK missions without building the mercenary camp, though the units are in some mission very useful.\n\nOn the other hand, they didn't fix a giant bug concerning siege: if you click in a good rhythm at a building to attack, you need 1/2 of the time to destroy it. I found it out by accident in the old game and it's a really abusive thing, especially with the dumb KI which does not move for a big time. In one mission i just sneaked a platoon behind the lines and used that - If you split your original forced the missions would have needed maybe 10 minutes instead of 2 hours.\n\n\nNow while this may sound really bad, you can still play the game and have lots of fun. But you have to be your own judge: If you abuse the mistakes in the game it's a really boring Settlers-spin-off. If you play honest some missions still are kinda tricky, especially in TPR. The story is great, the games brings many old feelings and the music still is nice (though not the same as in the original game, which I liked more)\n\n\nFor under 5€ definetely a must-have!","October 12, 2015","true","71.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","15","15","3","2"

It is a super in depth game similar to the original warcrafts. Unlike warcraft though, these maps can take forever since you have to start from a store house and make all your resources from food to weapons to character units nd army units. The combat in this game is much more complicated as well, forcing you to attack more strategicaly rather than just trying to zerg rush. On a lot of maps when you are given starting troops, with the proper attack strategies, you can take out your enemies with just the starting troops. The maps are long and pretty tedious but watching your town flourish is so addicting and the great music will keep you entertained the whole time. It is by far not without its flaws though, the original game's AI is pretty dated and while everything will work fine just working towards your goal, if you try dominate the map your serfs will kill themselves trying to walk across the map when an inn is right next to them. Also this HD version for some reason lacks the super fun music the original had. There are mods for this game online offering enhanced AI and other awesome features worth checking out.","July 20, 2015","true","18.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","0"

While the graphics aren't great compared to modern titans, they were some of the best when this game first came out. It's a great example of classic old school rts/micromanagement. While the gameplay is a bit unusual, you learn most of the mechanics of it through the campaign.\n\nSkirmishes are great for practicing and for goofing off with ideas. The ability to organize your soldiers in rows and columns is nice, and allows you to better place your soldiers in small places.\n\nOn the downside, if you don't like having to build each individual building and creating each specific unit for each building, then this game is not for you. If you like to micromanage everything, then have fun, you'll enjoy it.\n\nOverall I give it a 4/5.

Honestly, the best part of the game is building your village and I have to admit that I don't play it for the battles; they're pretty much a necessary evil, haha. It's fun to keep trying new layouts and road systems. I can spend hours just building a village and then start over once I'm done.\n\nThe mechanics are great, just plan your buildings and roads and your serfs and workers do all the work. Try not to build too many things at once though, because you will make it go slower accidentally. The workers have a pre-set priority. For example, if a building needs resources the serfs will go there first, and once the building has resources, the workers will go there to build it. This means that roads won't be finished (the workers abandon it to do the buildings first) and some workers might even die while waiting for stones. So, try to finish one thing before you start the next project.\n\nThe music gets stuck in your head, I catch myself humming the themes while at work. Crazy. Very fun to play, very nostalgic. The graphics may not be anything fancy, the game surely makes up for it. I definitely recommend this to anyone who's on the verge of buying it.

It got a very late conversion to it but i liked it back then as much as I like it nowadays. The game has a few twists that make it different to the typical settlers game:\n\nIt is much more slow paced, but this is a good turn. In some parts of the gameplay it's even more realistic especially in the military part: Instead of single knights you have different type of units that are organized in seperate groups or squads within the same weapon type. These squads can be moved much like they did in the real medieval or baroque world and the strategic placement of military units before a battle most likely WILL differ the victorious player from the loosing one.\n\nThe game has very nice and athmospheric graphics and background musics. Everything is handdithered to a 1024x768 resolution and it's all nicely blended together. Furthermore there is much detail to discover in the landscapes like floating searoses, swimming fishes or the leaves of trees weaving in the wind. Ok, now you could say that the graphics of the game look kinda oldish but at least I like 'em very much the way they are, as (again) I personally dislike most real 3D game engines especially for this type of strategical.\n\nI think every lover of the settlers searching for a different and in some degrees more complicated but nevertheless completely fun driven medieval simulation should give this game a go. The support for actual systems is very well as it runs on all newer windows versions without problems and all the released bonus missions (nowadays called dlcs) are already included in the main package. So this historical version will give you quite some weeks or months if not years of fun.

On one hand, the town creation system is very engaging and highly enjoyable... But, if you are looking for an alternative to Age of Empires, then you have come to the wrong neighbourhood.\n\nThe combat systems in this are EXTREMELY finiky, and attempting to give quick orders to your troops in the heat of battle is almost impossible. The Archers in this game are definitely the most unresponsive units i have ever tried to control in a strategy game. 90% of the time, when I try to tell my archers to shoot some approaching axe-men, they merely run up to the axe-men and let the axe-men kill them. One such time was when I was attempting to order my archers to fire into a battle, over a mountain, which they have the range to do. No matter what I did, half of my men would start shooting, the other half would run around the mountain and sit there and allow themselves to be killed. I assumed that it was because they were out of range. So, i loaded a previous save and tried again, only this time, I split up the archers into 2 different groups, keeping all of the ones that had been shooting before, in place and telling the others to sit and look pretty... Half of the firing group ran around the mountain and got themselves killed...\n\nThe melee units are a little better, but a lot of the time, just trying to order them to form ranks will have one of them charge off into the enemy, ala Learoy Jenkins. Other times, they will ignore your orders completely, specifically, one time when I was down to my last axe-man in the enemy base, and I was ordering for him to start attacking a building, he merely stood next to the building and focussed on killing serfs (Sorry, little buddy, but peasants only count in the event of a draw.)\n\nThat being said, when the game IS performing how you want it to, it is actually very satisfying. Bottlenecking your opponents on a bridge with a bunch of axemen with archers behind them, showering your opponents with arrows, whilst they bounce off of the axemens shields, like in 300, is a very fun thing to do.\n\nOne last thing to note is that, the combat is somewhat fair, because the enemy AI appears to have much the same problems controlling it's own troops.\n\nI love this game, but oh my god, the combat just makes me want to pull my hair out.\n\nIf you are looking for a medieval style Sim-City, however, I would highly recommend it, because this is one of the most satisfying games to build a vast, thriving city.","April 18, 2015","false","9.0"," 37 of 67 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","37","67","6","3"

I say this in the most positive way possible and for several reasons.\nFirst of all, and least importantly, the graphics have aged rather not all that alrightly. There are an abundance of worse examples but Knights and Merchants is definitely on that fringe of being a little too jarring to sink into.\nSecond, this game came during an age when many of the muscle memory type commands and standards of user interaction were still being experimented with and ironed out. That’s not to say that K&M plays poorly, after 8+ hours of play it’s still a game I’ll dabble in at times in the future. It just feels a bit clunky. Much in the same way a typewriter would feel clunky after using a modern keyboard, all the functionality is intact but the experience is just antiquated.\nFinally, and what I would imagine would be the tipping point for the average summer sale shopper, Knights and Merchants is DEEP. If you really want to dig into this game, I would absolutely recommend it. The gameplay comes from a time when people didn’t expect games to hold their hands and it has no qualms about offering up as much depth in gameplay as machines could handle back then.\nKnights and Merchants is a great game but for a modern audience I think it would be eaten alive. It comes from a different time but that doesn’t automatically make it bad, just very novel in this day and age.","April 6, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Recently started playing again after some years.\nI find it quite sad that there hasn't been a game made after K&M with the same concept. There are plenty of good RTS games around, but none like this.\nK&M focuses more on building a good village, where there will be enough food for your people, and placing your buildings strategically to contain a good chain of supply.\n\nIf you like this game simply depends on this: do you like building your city for more than an hour before getting huge battles or do you play your RTS just for the battles. If it's the first one, you will like playing K&M, if it's the second, you would be better off playing other RTS.","February 24, 2015","true","101.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Sprite animations, nice music, line manufacturing, attention to details, colorful environments and buildings, art of war... It really has everything. And it was game of my childhood as well. I used to play game without fast forwarding and missions took hours, days to play, and it was still more fun than most of today games. There were other games like Settlers but none managed to capture magic of this game. And it aged pretty well i think. Other major factor in the game is strategy... there are no health bars and with 10 men in right position you can kill 100 other men.\n\nGame is total pro, but for con I would probably put animations between missions which were quite bad even for that time. And maybe repetitive game play... although it is not repetitive as it looks like. If you are cunning enough and have great strategy, you can win many missions without constructing a single building. Other con I can think of is hard game play (for beginners) as the game is quite non-forgiving when it comes to wrong choices, and poor micro management. But again, it is also a kind of an advantage since you perfect your game play like that.\n\nOverall, one of not so popular classics.","April 6, 2015","true","38.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is the reason why the big marketing machine had shadowed one of the biggest strategy game of all time : Knights and Merchants.\n\nI'm a total fan of the game, trying to create every town with the right urban organisation, avoiding starving and creating the best scheme for wining. Each level is original, and you have to make every time a new strategy : Enhance you food supply, securise raw material, make warrior as fast as possible to support your allies.\n\nAs an old game, there are some bugs, but guess wgat, they are more funny than anything else : Ennemy's Ghost Town, Ennemy do not feed it's soldier sometime and makes it easy to win. Those type of bugs can happen 1 time on 99.\n\nBut this game is one of the best strategic game ever.\n\nI recommed it if you love strategy games and if you have the time to play it. It can take between 15 minutes and 5 hours to beat a level. Yes, you read it, 5 HOURS, and it's worth it, looking at you army detroying the ennemy building.

It has a beautiful soundtrack which fills me with happiness every time I hear it. The campaign is difficult but a ton of fun and playing normal maps is great too, even if the AI isn't that good.\n\nIt still has some late game bugs that could ruin your game, but I find that it doesn't occur that often and if it does you just gotta make sure you win fast. :p\n\nI highly recommend you install the Remake from http://www.kamremake.com/. It fixes tons of bugs and makes the game so much better you could call it an entirely new game.\n\nThis is definitely a nostalgia influenced opinion though.","January 3, 2015","true","15.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Since I've bought it here on steam I am afraid to play it because of how addictive it is.\n\nI prefer the economic aspect of the game rather than the militar. The chain of production, the city planning (and that street pathfinding thing) and food management are great challenges without having even to fight the enemies.\n\nThe fighting system is good, but since it's a game that was made more than 15 years ago, some things could be way better. Still very good and relies a lot on tactical thinking.\n\nFor those who think the game is slow, and it is, I recommend pressing F8 while ingame. This will speed the game :)\n\nDo you like RTS?

Compared to the old version I have on the CD format the Steam version of it seems to be easy to gather food (by adding in the fishers hut) and dose have some fix's to the builders where they would stop working after you grew to fast. Though with this the steam version also made it longer on the missions compared to the old game.\nTo those who never played this classic I would highly recommend this to you, the game is based on building your town and getting an army up fast. Though if you grow your town to fast you will lose, you need to have about 6 farms, 6 wine farms, around 3-4 pig farms and 2-3 mills that will take care of your food for most of the game and lets you get plenty of pig skins to make the better units. I would also like to add that you need about 5 or wood cutters. You will run out of wood and stone fast, on the other levels once you get to about half point of the game you will need to get gold, I would say rush to that asap.\nThere is also a trick to winning the maps with out losing to much men, you make a single bow unit and put him close by to enemy units wait for them to come out of there base to attack your unit, then with draw him back to your line (that needs to be near by). With this tactic you can wipe out there main force. Sometimes this will not work if you don't have the right units to do it. Most maps will last you 2-4 hours so make sure you have time, and that you make 2 saves (one at the start of the level encase you screw up, and a mid map save or a save when you need to take a break). The game dose take time in fact allot of time, I have not beat the steam version and made it to the last level on the old school version before my old 497Hhz died.\nOver all Pros and Cons:\n\nPro's\n*Game has much needed fix's such as the builder’s bug and the resource bug.\n*The AI dose not rush you as much as the old version (except on a few maps with just fighting units).\n*You are able to do a mid map rush if you are a vet of the game.\n*Added single maps where you can play AI with out the missions however you can not set up teams and the AI is highly lacking.\n\nCon's\n*The music is not the best is not the original and will sometimes lock up.\n*The sound file's of the game will sometimes skip if you have the music on which can lock up the sounds.\n*Increased the games time for most maps where it will take you an extra hour.\n\nOver all I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games like AOE (Age of Empires), Warcraft III.

Now, let me first dispell the theory that this game is only played because of nostalgia, as I have played it a good deal and am looking forward to continue playing it for some time, and had never heard of this game as of a few days ago. Okay, now on to the review. This game is a solid base-building strategic RTS, and has a good deal of depth to it. First of all,  I will say that the HD version has a few bugs and issues, but overall is a good substitute for the original (you get both). I will say that they took out a few random things like fishing, the tutorial is a horrible failure so go to the original for that, and in my oppinion the UI is a bit weaker because it shows you everything tech-wise when you load in, instead of revealing new branches of tech as you progress (you'll understand what I mean when you play, because you dont know what buildings are available until you unlock tech needed prior to building it in the original). Anyway, aside from that, I really enjoy this game. Though controlling units in combat can be a little difficult, I think that the intricacies of how you need to have a chain of buildings to make food, and little things like having to send food out to your units over time make up for the lack of a superior control system for your armies. Its fun how you have to manage everything in your civilization, and how you could very well starve if your roads  get too clogged (this happened to me once, it was tragic). Overall, this game has a lot going for it, and even today- excluding the fact that it came out in the 90's, I would pay at least $10 for Knights and Merchants, much less 90 cents!! Just buy the game okay? What is the worst possible scenario? You lose out on a 90 cent investment (or $5 for those who arent participating in the sale- but come on, its a great game!).","June 4, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Very complex economy system, quite challenging and long missions. The game switches between missions where you build your town and fight the opposing kingdom and mission where you just fight off an army of enemy troops. The game has aged very well, but it is deffinitely not without it's flaws and can sometimes be quite frustrating due to it's mechanics. Despite, I would stongly recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in the genre.\n\nI do however recommend you buy the Knights and Merchants: the Peasants Rebellion version and not the Historical Version here on Steam! Big fans of the game have made a remake for the game that SOLELY works with the Peasants Rebellion version of the game! the remake involves a few improvements to the game mechanics, the ability to play the game in 1080p (the native game only goes up to 1280x1024) and an added matchmaking system with fans and veterans of the game.

They did a good job on showing the processes from basic material to the actual product. Woodcutter cuts down tree, servant brings log to the sawyer, servant brings planks to weaponcrafter, servant brings weapon to training ground.

But in that time its lost none of its magic and its fantastic to see it here on steam.\nFirst off, the economy is excellently simulated; you need to quarry stone and cut wood to have building materials - then you must build farms/vineyards/pig farms to have raw ingredients for your millers, bakers, sausage makers etc to turn into food for your population.\nArmy construction follows a similar theme - mining of coal and ore, followed by smithing into weapons. Recruits are trained and turned into soldiers. Thus the conquest commences.\nDefeating your foe is a little more standard-RTS-esqe - take your men, beat his men, destroy his stuff. Yet tactics are very important in the game - you'll need a blend of men, bowmen, swordfighters, pikemen etc - to successfully take out your foe.\n\nAlthough this micromanagement sounds cumbersome, the game is actually very streamlined and within a short period of time your base/town is up and running and you can focus on fighting your enemy.\n\nBrilliant retro game you can spend hours on","January 22, 2015","true","28.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is one of the first games I ever played, and I loved it back then as much as I love it now. Recently, a website was giving away 7 games for free, and this one was one of them. I was quite happy to see this game again, and I wanted to try it out. Sadly, it wasn't what I was expecting. Before I start the review, though, I want to to say something to whoever is reading this: This game is from 1998. We're in 2015. The game is already 17 years old, and thus, it might look like garbage for people that are actually YOUNGER than the game itself... But there is a BIG line between a game that's Old-school (you can just pick it up and enjoy it), and out-dated (something you don't want to go back into). The Angry Video Game Nerd said that once, and I believe it suits the situation perfectly. That being said, I'll start talking about the bad things of the game, and sadly, I've found a few.\n\nFirst and foremost, the game comes with both the original version, and some sort of "HD" version that I didn't even know it existed. The original one is quite literally what it was back before, but has problems running with today's computers, crashing a few times. The HD version works way better than the original one, but FOR SOME UNHOLY REASON THAT I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND, IT'S MISSING A TON OF FEATURES! Playing with bots? Multiplayer? Random maps? Map editor? All of that, and more, is missing in the version that actually works. You can only play the tutorial, play the story-mode (I'm not a big fan of it, but there is one), and change the settings. That's unexcusable, WHY BOTHERING TO MAKE AN HD VERSION IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT UNFINISHED!?\n\nAnother issue I have with the game, is something that could have been fixed alongside the HD version: You see, when you desire to build something, your builders will go there, prepare the terrain, and then the workers will start bringing the building materials: That's something that I like, buildings are done in a realistic way, not just having one random peasant hit a bunch of planks until a castle suddenly appears from nowhere. So, where's the problem? You need to connect every building with roads. Something that I also like, but roads and building can take an INSANE time to be build. Why? Your workers can only bring one stone or plank at a time, and most of the time you will have to build arround 10 1x1 areas of road to connect a building properly, and the worst part is that workers move really slow. You can quite literally spend an hour setting up your basic buildings, before you can bother to start with the military parts of a match. This only goes worse when you notice that those workers who help builders, also have to carry every resource in town. EVERY. RESOURCE. And they block themselves while walking on the roads. I believe I've said enough to make you understand, building can take longer than Episode 3 to be made.\n\nAnother issue I have with the game, are the bots. After playing for a while, I managed to get the hang of it, but during your first random matches, they'll annihilate your ♥♥♥. Why? Well, I can't see them in the minimap, but I bet they don't have the same issues as you do, or something. All I know is that they're always a whole stair-way above you.\n\nSomething that also seems to not work properly, is the language. I have my Steam setup in English, because original dubs and translations are usually WAY better than the Spanish ones, and I can both speak and read English without an issue... But still, the HD version of the game starts in Spanish? That's because the game looks at your OS to know what language it should have, INSTEAD OF STEAM! The original version does work properly, but that's just lazy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nA last issue I have with the game, is something quite stupid that the devs have done. So, they did NOT take the time to make sure the Steam-port was good, but they DID take the time to put ads in the game. Yeah, ads. Commercials. What do I mean? Every time you start the game, it will also start your Internet browser, and go into the Steam page of another game they did. Want to know the funny part of it? That game, named "Raven's Cry", that was released quite recently and was there for pre-purchase for months and months, is a huge piece of dog-sh#t. I'm not making it up, it's a horrible game. It doesn't even deserve that you look at it, but they force you to it. And it's a piece of sh#t that's worth 60€, or so they say. What dumb excuse they got for this?\n\nSo, does the game actually have GOOD things? Yeah. The gameplay is great, once you get over the insane building process. Towns actually kind of work like they did back then: One guy cuts down trees, another one takes the tree and makes planks, another one transforms the planks into useful stuff. It really goes well with the gameplay. You also have to make the weapons and armors of the soldiers, something that I like a lot, and has been done in other games as well, while in here was done to near perfection. The music and sounds are quite out-dated and haven't been updated properly, but it's not something worth ripping off your ears.\n\nSo, in the end... Do I recommend this game? Yeah, it's fun and quite a blast from the past. Do I recommend the STEAM version? No. F#ck no. It's not worth the purchase. I got it for free, and I still feel dissapointed. What I suggest you to do, is download the fan-remake of the game, you can find it here:  Knights and Merchants - Remake [www.kamremake.com]\n\nThis is where the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and hilarios part arrives: A bunch of fans managed to fix EVERYTHING that was wrong with the Steam version, AND MORE, without that much of an issue. The original Devs didn't even bother to do it right. If you EVER want to play this game as IT DESERVES to be played, go to that website, and download it.

Dou graphics are old and gameplay may seem to be too slow, but after you will get an idea you will keep playing this game and it has an HD version also available if you don't like old format version.\n\nThe only thing I don't like in this game is that I really still don't get how to remove the farm land spaces if it is possible and even worse thing is that it doesn't have speed buttons, so it will take some time to see your town grow.\n\nI really do like the soundtrack of this game not less as the gameplay and I am almost sure if you will get this game, you will not feel bad for the spent money, dou I suggest that you would get this on some discount price, because it is still out-dated and 6.99€ for this is in one or the other way - too expensive. :)","March 1, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Took me a little bit to get into. Controls aren't exactly smooth and intuitive but, they are forgivable for its age.  The graphics are a little crusty but it has its certain charm I like. If you like old school/retro and RTS games you might want to try this one. I consider it a little gem. It's not easy either for all you difficult game lovers.  Has a great supply chain you gotta crank up to build each weapon and shield and piece of armor you need for each individual soldier.\n\nI'd recommend this game for sure 6.2/10\n\nPros:\n- Fun supply chain to feed your weapons builders full of supplies.\n- Micro-managey\n- Great retro feel without being to sluggish or outdated feeling\n- Watching all your guys go to work of their own accord is fun while you wait ( and you will)\n\nCons:\n- First level took me hours and hours to beat.\n- AI for your own troops is hampered and downright non-intuitive. but you can work around it\n-  controls are just a little crunchy\n\nAll in all, not a bad game for a few bucks. You might find yourself addicted.","March 4, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The rating would not be high just because the unplayeable crashes.\nRating: 5. (if the game worked fine without crashes then it would have been a 9)\n\nI recommend playing this. But i dont recommend playing this on steam.\n\nPositive:\n\na Relaxing top-view Strategy game.\nMusic is relaxing and medieval. (but old one were better)\nGraphics are not terrible at all for this old game.\nIt has 2 Campaigns and a tutorial.\nEach campaign has like 20 missions.\nSave and load feature.\nCampaign 2 has different units.\n\n\nMedium:\n\nIt has multiplayer, but in the past this was IP BASED.\nAi. has unlimited supplies in the storagehouse.\nGame is an easy pick-up to understand and the AI usually gives you enough time to build something before they attack you.\nThere are a skirmish kind of maps to play on but the maps will never change or rotate so they are always the same.\n\nNegative:\n\nMany crashes. Like freeze crash. Campaign 2 (Game 2 basically) has the most. and makes the game unplayeable. (Random crashes)\nMax resolution is 1024x768. unless you took the HD Version in the menu.\nHD version makes the game run very fast.\nEasy accessable but no options on the main menu, only during the game itself.\n\n","February 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Part of the issue was there was no way to tell what you had selected.  Most games will highlight or box the unit or building that you have selected so if you have multiple units or buildings of the same type you know which one you've selected.  Also useful for when the units get closely bunched so you know you've selected the correct one.\n\nAfter quiting the main campaign and going into the tutorials I was still confused about several key points.  First, I didn't see anywhere in the tutorial that told you the "sign post" of a building had to be connected to the road instead of any portion of the building (as was true in Warcraft 1).  This led to frustration as I had half a building constructed and a bunch of laborers sitting around doing nothing because the road didn't touch the right part of the building.  It didn't seem possible to rotate the building to change where the sign post was.  It was also offputting that laborers and serfs aren't rolled into one job.  Having a laborer wait at a build site because he didn't have materials was disappointing, especially if the build site was right by the storehouse.\n\nI feel as if the combat tutorial was also far to short for the complexity of controlling combat units.  It would have been nice to include the paper-rock-scissors hierarchy of which units are strong against each other.  It was hinted at by telling you to attack certain units with a specific unit type but I believe there were only two instances of this.  There was also no explanation for how to train additional combat units.  It took a bit of playing around to figure out that you had to train a recruit at the schoolhouse then train him into the appropriate class at the barracks, but only if you have the appropriate equipment.  Another thing missing from the tutorial was facing and lines.\n\nThe combat in general also seemed somewhat clunky.  In the combat tutorial I had units charge past the enemy archers I was trying to attack, taking heavy casualties while they essentially encircled the enemy.  I also had a line of archers, facing forward, not auto-attack a lone enemy unit as he walked right up to them and slaughtered half the line.  It's not bad to have a lot of options and depth in combat but units should also use common sense.\n\nOverall, this game appeals to people that like to micromanage, and could be good if it had a little bit of tweaking.  If you're looking for fast action this is not the game for you.","November 29, 2015","false","1.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"

I really want to like it, but frankly, there's nothing to like. The game has two aspects: townbuilding and combat. Ultimately, though, it's all about combat; the townbuilding is just there to facilitate your armies.\n\nThat's unfortunate, because the combat is terrible, and here's why:\n- Controls are clunky.\n- Pathfinding is abysmal\n- Units will barely move in formation\n- Archers will only fire if the enemy is coming from a certain direction\n- Units can move off the map, killing them\n- Bad pathfinding and inconsiderate level design mean that this will happen repeatedly!\n- Units get hungry (which is pretty cool), but when you supply a troop the hungry unitss aren't prioritised, so they starve to death while their well-fed friends are getting stuffed with sausages.\n\nThe list goes on. All this is just from the first level! In fact, combat is so terrible I had to restart the combat tutorial at least four times to not get slaughtered.\n\nIf you like townbuiling with a little bit of combat, try Caesar or CivCity: Rome; if you like the peasant-and-pike combat, with a bit of town management on the side, play Stronghold. Either way, save yourself the ragequit and don't buy this.","August 21, 2015","false","5.9"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","0"

I understand the tags say Strategy, Medieval, Simulation, and City Builder, but it felt like a RTS. Modern real time strategy games have much better UIs, with less clutter, and more easily identifiable units/buildings. They also tend to give you more information about what your choices will lead to.\nThis game grants you almost none of that. It has a very poor UI, with a lack of easily identifiable information, like what each unit or building ultimately leads to. If you are a newcomer to the game, good luck. I can't comment on the graphics too much, as this seems to be a very old game, but even still, they're not that great.\n\nThe game is extremely slow paced. There are many different units and buildings to place, and I can't help but feel like less would be so much more in this game. I figured the serf would fill multiple different roles, but no, you have to build a schoolhouse to train the different types of workers. This is a convenience of modern RTS games, where you just have a one size fits all worker unit. This game affords you no such convenience. You also cannot command the serfs individually.\n\nI honestly could not sit through very much of this game. It's just so boring, with a high barrier of entry. Taking the time to learn every unit, and everything that each building does is too much for such an old, obsolete game. There's nothing to be had here, except maybe nostalgia for those that played this many years ago.","November 15, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingblackcat/recommended/253900/","kingblackcat","Hack Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingblackcat/","409 products in account","Knights and Merchants là một game chiến thuật thời gian thực mà đối với hầu hết game thủ, đó là tuổi thơ dữ dội mà họ đã từng trải qua.\n\nPhần chính của trò chơi là phần chiến dịch, có tất cả 20 màn. Game có vẻ khó khi mới bắt đầu, nhưng một khi bạn đã hiểu rõ về gameplay, bạn sẽ thấy nó cực kì dễ dàng. Hầu hết các màn chơi trong game đều bắt đầu từ việc xây dựng một thị trấn, rồi sau đó huấn luyện quân đội và tiêu diệt kẻ thù. Tuy nhiên, có vài màn chơi chỉ cho bạn một số binh lính, bắt buộc bạn phải suy nghĩ chiến thuật để phòng thủ, hoặc tấn công một kẻ thù nào đó. Những màn chơi như vậy sẽ giúp bạn học được cách đánh thắng kè thù đông hơn mình gấp 2-3 lần.\n\nTrong suốt quá trình chơi game, những công trình mới sẽ được mở khóa dần dần, thêm vào đó là những đơn vị lính, hàng hóa mới. Thông thường, kẻ địch sẽ hiện đại hơn bạn một chút, tức là có trước những công trình mà bạn chưa mở khóa được. Nhưng đừng lo, hãy chứng tỏ mình là một pro gamer và đánh bại kẻ thù bằng những chiến thuật mang lại vinh quang cho bạn.\nPhần kinh tế trong game được làm khá chi tiết mà tôi chắc chắn rằng, kô có một game chiến thuật thời gian thực nào khác có thể tái hiện giống như Knights and Merchants. Ví dụ như bạn muốn có bánh mì, bạn cần phải có một nông trại thu hoạch lúa mì, rồi sau đó chuyển lúa đến một công trình khác để làm ra bột mì, và cuối cùng bột mì được chuyển đến những lò nướng bánh để cho ra một chiếc bánh mì. Thật chân thực phải kô? Vì vậy, để có một người lính thật kô đơn giản như những game RTS khác. Bạn sẽ cần sản xuất ra những trang bị riêng cho những người lính. Đơn vị lính mạnh nhất, knight sẽ cần một thanh kiếm, một chiếc áo giáp sắt, một chiếc khiên dài và một con ngựa. Để sản suất ngần ấy trang bị sẽ tốn khá nhiều thời gian khiến việc có một đội quân lớn không hề dễ chút nào.\n\nMọi đơn vị quân trong game đều cần phải ăn. Bạn có thể kiểm tra đơn vị quân ấy có cần ăn hay không bằng cách nhấn vào đơn vị ấy. Thông thường, những đơn vị dân sẽ tự động tìm một nhà hàng để ăn. Có tất cả 4 loại thức ăn, đó là: bánh mì, xúc xích, rượu nho và cá. Những đơn vị lính thì khác, họ sẽ cần những nông nô giúp đem thức ăn tới mỗi khi họ đói. Bạn có thể lợi dụng điều này để tấn công kẻ thù trong lúc binh lính đang bị phá vỡ đội hình khi đang ăn.\n\nHệ thống chiến đầu của game có một lỗ hổng khá lớn. Ví dụ như việc di chuyển lính một quãng đường dài sẽ khiến đội hình bị phá. Bạn chỉ có thể điều khiển một đội lính một lúc, điều này gây ít nhiều khó khăn trong việc điều khiển binh lính. Nếu như binh lính của bạn di chuyển đến gần kẻ địch, hai bên sẽ đánh nhau và bạn sẽ mất quyền điều khiển chúng cho đến khi một trong hai bên chết hết, và bạn không thể ngăn được chúng đánh nhau một khi nó đã bắt đầu. Điều cuối cùng là nếu lính của bạn đói khi đang chiến đấu, lính sẽ chết dần cho đến khi được ăn.\n\nTuy nhiên, cũng có vài mặt tốt trong hệ thống chiến đấu của game. Hầu hết các đơn vị lính đều có những ưu nhược điểm khắc chế lẫn nhau khiến game rất cân bằng. Pikemen là lính sử dụng giáo, khắc chế kị binh như Knights. Archers cần phải được bảo vệ bởi bộ binh vì Archers không có khả năng chống lại những bộ binh khác.\n\nÂm thanh trong game cũng rất xuất sắc. Bạn có thể nghe thấy tiếng chặt cây của tiều phu, hay tiếng thợ mộc đang tạo ra những vũ khí phục vụ cho quân đội. Thêm vào đó là 20 bản nhạc nền thú vị. Tất cả tạo nên những âm thanh sống động như thể bạn đang sống trong thế giới trung cổ vậy.\n\nTóm lại, đây là một trò chơi gắn liền với tuổi thơ của khá nhiều game thủ, trở thành huyền thoại trong dòng game chiến thuật. Nếu bạn muốn nhớ lại một phần kí ức, sao không thử download và chơi game ngay nhỉ? Đó là một ý kiến không tồi chút nào!","October 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","7","21","2","0"

There is only one defensive building which has an incredibly short range, and quite a few buildings you aren`t told how they even work. I realize this is from`98, but c`mon!

Being able to drag the mouse to select units, being able to select multiple units, the select unit/building being highlighted.\n\nIn addition it is frustrating to me to not be able to have a little more control over units.  For example if one unit in a company gets in a fight (maybe he took a different path than the others)  all of your units move to engage.  And you can't cancel it.\n\nThere is also no unit progression which I really like.\n\nThe game was probalby great in its day, and playing a few levels had some nastalgia, but it does not hold my attention.","November 1, 2014","false","3.1"," 6 of 28 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","28","0","2"

It's more of a 50/100 review, but anyways, on with the review:\n\nI'll make a list of the things and put a star on the points I touch up on later in the review if you want to see that, along with a number so you can quickly find it if you don't want to read the rest personally.\n\nThe good things first:\n+Decent strategy, including a great variety in soldiers\n+The game has a campaign with meticulously planned enemies, it's nice\n+The maps are surprising, I have found things like waterfalls, swamps, and bridges while playing\n+The controls are simple (after all, it's literally arrow keys and mouse)\n+You can link up your units, so to make a large group move you don't have to select all of them, just one\n+People seem to still be actively playing the game\n+*1: It has the KaM remake, which vastly improves the game.\n+The pathing is surprisingly nice, the enemy AI... not so much (*2)\n+The game has a community which produces new stuff (I recently played Space Invaders in this game)\n\nAnd now the bad:\n-*2: The game is outrageously slow (IMO, others may find it a more decent speed)\n-In the campaign, you face off against enemies with nice soldiers in iron armor with strong weapons and whatnot, but you only have access to leather and timber. (The enemy has no access to it either, so when you kill the enemies they are gone for good, but still they shouldn't have them in the first place)\n- You have to connect everything with roads for them to be bulit, so if you find some iron across the map, but none is near you, then good luck!\n\nI know the good list is much better, but trust me, the 2 bad things overpower the good things.\n\nSo anyways:\n\n*1: It has the KaM remake, which vastly improves the game.\nThis game has the Kingdoms and Merchants remake (KaM remake), which adds in fish, which is a tactically game improving resource. The AI, which already had good pathing, adds in a bit more intellegence. Before, the AI might have brought stones to buildings first, however the building requires wood before it can be built. Also (it seems, I haven't checked properly), the AI originally seems to have required to take materials to the storage building and then to it's destination. KaM fixes both of these. KaM also adds in multiplayer!\n\n*2: The game is outrageously slow.\nIn the game, there's basically a chain of progession of how to produce something. It all starts with a few basic buildings: The quarry, the woodcutter, and the farm. One of the things that I don't like about this game is that there are a few unnecessary steps, and one of them is immediate. The wood you get from the woodcutter is entirely useless if it doesn't go through a sawmill, which produces only wood. So the sawmill basically turns useless wood into useful wood. There's no importance to this building, as you could just as easily turn the first wood into wood that you can use. I don't like that. This also happens with the farm. You take the corn to the mill, another building which could possibly be skipped, to make flour, and then to a bakery. I don't like that either. It makes the game feel very slow.\nI played the first campaign level for 2 hours (if you knew what you were doing, that could probably be shortened to 1-1 1/2 hours). Around that mark I made an advancement into the enemy territory and was fully able to destroy their town. Turns out there was another town which I had to advance to, and I had already been playing that one level for two hours. When I went in to attack the second town, they had full iron troops. (*2: The enemy AI... not so much) I made more troops to help me against them and defeated them, went into their town, and they didn't even have barracks to produce soldiers! In fact, they only had 2 buildings. However, they had a better army than mine, when I had a fully built town with barracks included! So I spent about 2 1/2 hours taking my time to build up a successful town that could run and produce an army in order to defeat a town with 2 buildings.\n\n\nI could go on more about the slowness, but I should probably wrap up. Basically, if you're super patient than you can probably enjoy this game much more than I did, however for me the fun ended when I figured everything out.","June 20, 2015","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the HD version but one thing they haven't fixed since the original game is that you will occasionally have peasants not doing anything when building materials need to be brought to a construction site.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROFY_GAMER/recommended/253900/","PROFY_GAMER","bot_2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROFY_GAMER/","104 products in account","Knights and Merchants, or KaM to those of us that have played the game on and off for decades, is a fantastic and fun game in which you build and fight in a variety of lands. Each 'mission' has it's own goals, however they do tend to blend together and every new map seems to have the same goal. Battle missions, where there is no building, are quick, and you will find yourself on the losing end if you're not paying attention. First time players will see themselves restarting a battle mission a time or two.\n\nKaM is an old game indeed, and this release on Steam finds you with the original, "The Shattered Kingdom" and the next release "The Pesants Rebellion" (both known to the community as TSK and TPR respectively. The Steam version also includes an "HD Version" which modifies the graphics a bit and the game speed. It also opens up all buildings starting at mision 1 which is not what the orginal game does.\n\nIf you are into strategy build sims then KaM is a game you will want on your list!\n\nThat said, if you buy this game from Steam or from GOG, I would recommend you play TSK and TPR missions 1-3 only. That will give you the fundamentals of the game and how it works. You'll also see several issues with the game and you may encounter a bug or two. Even with the bugs in the original game, it is worth playing, and worth your time. Why only the first 3 missions you may ask. Well, that's because as awesome as the game is, it gets better with the KaM Remake.\n\nOnce you see the game in all its original glory, you simply MUST go get the KaM Remake from www.kamremake.com to enjoy the game with today's computer capabilities.\n\nThe good folks over at KaM Remake have rebuild this awesome game from scratch and added some enhancements, such as better AI, a map editor and the ability for you not only to create your own maps, but make your own missions or even entire campaigns. They have truly taken a great game, and made it better using all the original game pieces such as the units, environments, and animations, and recreated the game code to support today's computing power and screen sizes. My personal favorite, is the ability to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.\n\nWhile the KaM Remake has removed two building types for game balance, they added the Marketplace, which was part of the original game but never implemented. The Marketplace adds a new factor to the game, allowing you to trade one type of resource for another. This opens up a TON of options for map, mission, and campaign creators.\n\nAdditionally, the KaM Remake is FREE. Yep, you heard me, FREE. However you must own KaM in order for the Remake to install and work. Details can be found at www.kamremake.com\n\nBuy this game. Get the remake. You'll be glad you did.","June 8, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely repulsed.\n\nThe reason? I didn't realize this was made in 1988. Playing this back then, before Age of Empires, before RTS was even a thing would of been incredible.\n\nI can't recommend anyone buy this game, it's so dated it's ridiculous. I got it in a $3 bundle.

There is a good part and a bad part to this game. First let's start with the good. The city building. It is great! It's practically a God game! Watching your town expand as you give small commands is a really great feeling, and relaxes you as well! It is fun to build your town, and collect supplies even. But now we must go to the bad part of this game. The combat... The AI in this game feels extremely broken. For example: I set up an army of archers and catapults as an ambush. I was going to send some scouts to attack the enemy archers and send some of my archers to draw them into the ambush. The scouts dropped everything they were doing when being shot at. Not to mention forced my archers to move to the front where they were killed. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great medieval city builder! But as for combat. I'd say restart a level if you reached that point.

It hooks you in and you will see the hours go by as you try to perfect your starting strategy. This game may be very old and maybe even dated, but I think it's a great game that anyone can play. It's also an easy game to run on almost any computer, so there is no need to have a high end  graphics card.

Townsfolk will collide when meeting on the paths and wildly spin off until their AI gets righted. And soldiers, in probably the most frustrating example, charge the enemy in a single. file. line.

The demo came from some PC magazine that had discs full of other demos.  I was addicted, even though I sucked at RTS games.  With it being a demo, campaign was very short, had little to no tutorial and some buildings were unavailable.\n\nAt around 13-14, I remembered this game but couldn't find the demo nor remembered it's name.  I would always bike to Gamestop just to see if I can find the game and remember but it was never found.  Then finally at the age of 19, I found a retail copy of this game and finally remembered the game's name.  I couldn't believe it and picked it up.  A couple years later and it's on Steam!\n\nIt plays completely the same and there was even an expansion that I didn't know about.

I can not tell anything bad at this game as it was my most favourite game in childhood and though this new HD version has got a bug with rotating the army, I can manage to turn them otherwise. I know a lot about this game so I simply recommend this game to everyone who likes solid strategic game.\nYou can build the infrastructure, your own army and some missions are pretty challenging and at the end rewarding. But enemy AI is sometimes very stupid. Your own units will be stuck when the city is crowded so you must think in front. Make gaps between buildings, roads. Set inn at the corner of the town, castle outside the town. Do not forget to supply your people with lots of food and you can raise great armies.

There is a good part and a bad part to this game. First let's start with the good. The city building. It is great! It's practically a God game! Watching your town expand as you give small commands is a really great feeling, and relaxes you as well! It is fun to build your town, and collect supplies even. But now we must go to the bad part of this game. The combat... The AI in this game feels extremely broken. For example: I set up an army of archers and catapults as an ambush. I was going to send some scouts to attack the enemy archers and send some of my archers to draw them into the ambush. The scouts dropped everything they were doing when being shot at. Not to mention forced my archers to move to the front where they were killed. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great medieval city builder! But as for combat. I'd say restart a level if you reached that point. (Oh yes, also enemies do not fight each other even if you get them right next to each other)","October 15, 2015","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a tutorial that explains the basics, but when in game you'll find yourself stranded when all your men start to starve because the lack of food. I so far have played 8 hours and I'm still learning things. I love this game for the fact that it's very simple, but at the same time you have a lot of challenges to overcome and learn how to adapt. It hooks you in and you will see the hours go by as you try to perfect your starting strategy. This game may be very old and maybe even dated, but I think it's a great game that anyone can play. It's also an easy game to run on almost any computer, so there is no need to have a high end  graphics card. I recommend this to anyone getting into pc gaming or anyone who has a lot of time to kill and enjoys a challenge!","October 15, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The demo came from some PC magazine that had discs full of other demos.  I was addicted, even though I sucked at RTS games.  With it being a demo, campaign was very short, had little to no tutorial and some buildings were unavailable.\n\nAt around 13-14, I remembered this game but couldn't find the demo nor remembered it's name.  I would always bike to Gamestop just to see if I can find the game and remember but it was never found.  Then finally at the age of 19, I found a retail copy of this game and finally remembered the game's name.  I couldn't believe it and picked it up.  A couple years later and it's on Steam!\n\nIt plays completely the same and there was even an expansion that I didn't know about.  Played for a few hours and it just brought back many memories of this game.  Still harder than Age of Empires.","October 17, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd recoomend this game for older players that enjoy strategy games. It lacks a bit of features but it doesn't ruin the gameplay tough. I'd grab this game if you like Medieval games, especially strategy. I didn't play it a lot, but tried it and im enjoying the first minutes.","January 4","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a RTS, just like Age Of Empires, but way much difficult than AOE. Why? Because it's too unnecessarily realistic. If your troops need food (i.e. bread), you need  farm wheat, process it to make flour and finally make the bread. Thus, there's an arduous process behind every single item that must be done.That's why KAM is so magnificently wonderful! ٩(o´  ▽  `o)۶ ♥","November 9, 2013","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
