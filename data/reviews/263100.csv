"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/recommended/263100/","RemyLabue","RemyLabue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/","394 products in account","How do I write a review about a game that was developed in the name of charity and stay objective. It's difficult to say the least, yet I find it difficult to recommend this to anyone unless you want to donate and it's on sale.\n\nFirst of all, if I had to describe what this was, I would be more likely to call it an interactive art exhibit. The graphics and color choices are gorgeous of course, but all you do is walk on a beach, follow butterflies to items, spin the item until you locate another butterfly, then click on said butterfly, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt was designed to be experienced, not played or beaten, and the subject matter is supposed to illicit an emotional response from the user. Unfortunately, I don't think that subject matter was conveyed properly for it's intended results.\n\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the discription on the store page, it would be hard for me discern the message this game is trying to convey. The idea is that each item you locate belonged to a victim of the Japanese Tsunami, however the game gives you no indication of this. After each item is located, the tide goes out a bit to uncover the next, maybe this was an artistic decision on the devloper's part to convey something deep. Locating the lost artifacts pushes the Tsunami back, acknowledging the victim's loss undoes the damage of the Tsunami, something like that? Maybe it's up to the player to discern for themselves how to interpert this. The focus of the game doesn't become clear until you locate the butterfly on the last item, which takes about 10 minutes from starting the game, if that. After which some text appears on the screen explaining the damage the Tsunami had done in Japan, then the credits roll.\n\nI feel terrible about not recommending this game due to the nature of the title. How can you say no when a percentage of the profits go to the Tsunami Relief Fund? I want to make it perfectly clear that I in no way disagree with the game's message, and support the developers for donating to the charity through this title, I just disagree with it's design. The message could have been conveyed in a more understandable and focused way. As I played I knew what this title was trying to do, I just never felt that it accomplished it's task, and that's the only reason I couldn't recommend it.\n\nLet this be a lesson to developers everywhere. Wanting to create a game to help educate the world of a foreign cataclysmic natural disaster, and to donate to a charity, is not enough. That game must be worth the time of the people donating, and more importantly, the game must make it's message clear. Otherwise people who wish to donate can just do it manually through the charity's website.\n\nThank you Space Budgie for developing this title and choosing to help out of the kindness of your hearts. I'm sure families all over Japan praise your work and thank you for your time. I wish more developers would put their talents to good use by creating things like this in the name of charity. Please don't take the fact that I'm not recommending this game as a personal attack in anyway, or a stance against your message. Don't ever stop creating and helping humanity the best way developers can. Your work is appreciated, maybe even more than you know. However, as a reviewer, I have to be honest, even though in cases like this one, I wish I didn't.\n\nIf you wish to donate to the Japanese Tsunami Relief Fund and other charities that the proceeds of this game are going towards without purchasing this game, here are some links.\n\nJapan Earthquake and Tsunami Relief Fund[www.globalgiving.org]\nAid For Japan[www.aidforjapan.org.uk]\nPeople and Skills for Disaster Relief[www.redr.org.uk]","January 21, 2014","false","0.3"," 253 of 341 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","253","341","0","7"

Sadly, there is a cold, blunt truth in this statement. When we hear about a natural disaster or an ongoing war somewhere in the world, and read about the number of casualties on television screens, newspapers or history books, that's all we usually see: statistics. We live in an age that detachment and conformism are the norm, so it rarely bothers us enough to even think about collateral damage, if we are not a part of the collateral affected by it.\n\nHere, all you'll ever find will be a collection of blurry scenes, scattered around a beach lot in San Francisco, painted in shades of blue and purple. Not one of the greater works of Unreal engine, surely. As we start the experience, we are asked to follow the butterflies and that's all we are going to do for the next 15 minutes, until the game ends. We walk in the beach lot, approach disappearing shades and discover phantom objects to contemplate on people that we know nothing about. We probably never will...\n\n9.03m is not a game in the conventional manner. It is a really short, interactive art exhibition that serves as an empathy simulation. It is a tribute and a requiem for people who lost their lives in 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, aiming to humanize the victims by presenting hypothetical anecdotes from their lives, hopes and dreams. It is not a good game, neither necessarily quite successful in an artistic manner; but here with this specific project, it really is the thought that counts and nothing else. All profit made through the sales are sent to Aid for Japan and Redr charity organizations. With this ridiculously low price tag, it really is a choice of donating or not rather than buying a game.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 10","true","0.3"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","48","53","0","4"

It's intention is not to be a ground breaking evolution of the medium, nor is it supposed to even be fun. A short 15 minute experience, it is meant to be a game of remembrance; dedicated to all that were affected by the disastrous tsunami that hit Japan in 2011.\n\nSimilar to something like Proteus, 9.03m doesn't have a narrative or any real mechanics to speak of. Wandering along a quiet beach, you are asked simply to follow the trail of butterflies which lead you to the scattered items of the people that used to live there. It's a decidedly somber experience, but also a very beautiful one (both in terms of presentation and purpose), the core message is one of hope; that those who were lost are not forgotten, and those who survive will be able to rebuild and live on despite the tragedy that befell them.\n\nWith how little it costs and the fact that 100% of the proceeds go to charity, there is no reason I would tell someone not to support 9.03m. It doesn't matter that it's short, or that it's hardly a game, because it isn't supposed to be; it is merely intended as a short moment of reflection, and has more meaning behind it than possibly anything else you will play in a long time. That alone is reason enough for me to ask you to give it a chance, whether it looks like something that would normally interest you or not.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 2, 2014","true","0.2"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","4"

Truth is, I'm a borderline misanthrope who, given a choice between saving the rest of nature and saving "us", would happily herd us all into the great Dog Food Factory in the Sky.  We really are, on the whole, a grubby and nasty little species who are probably fully deserving of a nice, big meteor in the face some time in the next few decades or so.  Having said that, there are people who I love very dearly, and for whom I will no doubt feel at least a twinge of sadness for if and when they pass on; and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it, beyond all my smarmy cynicism and cold, rational analysis of us from a purely anthropological perspective, when all is said and done, I AM STILL HUMAN.\n\nAnd I'll be darned if this tiny little twelve-minute ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-turd of a game didn't almost make me cry.\n\nBut hey, I've caught a lot of flack lately for going off-topic and not just sticking to the nitty-gritty of "reviewing a game", so in the interests of being pragmatic...yes, it's super-short, yes, it has virtually no "gameplay" to speak of, and yes, it can be "beaten" by even the most unskilled of gamers.  Hell, even your grandma can probably get to the end of this one.  Having said that, if any of you people are still buying so-called "walking simulators" expecting anything BUT what I've just described, then you really are a bunch of wretched, unsalvageable ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-WITS, aren't you?\n\nOoops, a tiny bit of my misanthropy crept in there again.  Sorry about that.\n\nIn my opinion, this "game" does what it sets out to do exceptionally well, and as I've possibly alluded to above, can potentially touch the heart of even stone-hearted mother-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ers like my dear self.  Sure, it's not TIMEframe - a "game" which genuinely makes an apocalypse into a thing of true beauty - but it's really quite affecting for the short time it plays out, provided you're open to such things.  If you're not - and believe me, I bought this game actually looking FORWARD to writing a damning, hateful review - then really, you may as well save your fifty cents or dollar and go find some other cheap game where you can blow ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up.  Me, I like to stop killing things every now and then to stop and smell the flowers...or failing that, the "napalm in the morning", if more applicable.\n\nIf there's one thing I actually DO like about humanity, it's art, and the limitless possibilities therein.  This "game" is but one example.  Take it for what it is, or leave it be.  Oh, and Merry Christmas to one and all...me, I'm spending most of it alone, but that's just the kinda Scrooge I am.  But I wish you all the best just the same, and if that mighty meteor DOES hit, I at least hope it's quick and painless for us all.

Short, simple and meaningful.\n\nOne more point I feel that is important to add is that the people that made this originally had the intention of donating half of all their proceedings to the charity aid for japan. But ‚Äúupon breaking even with initial costs, will increase this to all royalties going to charity‚Äù which was something very nice to read. It shows they did this not for themselves, but for the people.","December 6, 2013","true","0.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

This is when it succeds in the goal it set for itself, when it takes a few examples out of the 15000 casualties so that you can briefly know something about them: the tragedy behind events with high death tolls is that the faces and lives of those lost are easily shadowed behind numbers and I appreciate what 9.03m tried to do hence my thumbs up.\n\nHaving said that it's short length and lack of any gameplay will surely turn some people off and I can easily concede that the message'd have been carried just as well using a video or other means.

Since then it has raised its price to $1, with the understanding that half goes to a charity. People have raised questions about the legitimacy of this charity, but its price and this "charity offer" did not affect my review.\nOkay, I know I'm not recommending this, so I anticipate downvotes, but I judge projects based on their goals. The goal of this game is to "humanise and remember" the victims. To do this, you walk from item to item, objects left behind by those who died, and examine them until a butterfly appears, leading the path to the next object. This happens perhaps six times and then the game ends with another brief cutscene. Looking at objects left behind can tell you a lot about the people who left them, but i didn't feel that way with this game. They're all very low-poly and contain no material that would teach one about the people involved, or fulfill the game's goal of humanising them. Beyond that, you walk slowly on a low-poly, two color beach. Because you are to follow a set path and theres no real reason to explore, it isn't really even interactive- there are no choices to be made. Neither is there any randomness, as in Dear Esther. So, as art, it kind of fails as well- the choice to make a small empathic project a game means that less money can be spent on the surroundings. If it were a video, (which it basically is, as there is no room for player incentive or experimentation,) the polygonal nature of the surroundings and the repetition would doom it. So, in my book, that dooms the game as well. It's only really about the victims of the tsunami because the game tells you it is, to be honest.\nIf you feel like feeling sad, this game might make you feel sad. That's not enough for my personal recommendation.","January 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 52 of 92 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","52","92","7","0"

An important story. The developers have described the game perfectly, without 'spoiling' anything. Since it lasts about 10-15 minutes it's hard to tell anything about it without 'spoiling' things. Therefore, I will repost the description that the developers have posted so you get a better understanding of what it's about:\n\n"9.03m, is a short, first person, art/empathy game for PC. Not a game in the traditional sense of the word; it aims to humanise, and remember the victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The media is quick to put figures to death tolls in such disasters, and 9.03m tries to remind people of the individuals behind those figures.\n\n9.03m is set on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where debris from the tsunami has washed ashore in the years following the tsunami."\n\nThis is exactly the game, without any spoilers. It's a sweet story accompanied by subtle graphics and beautiful music. And since some of the money earned is given to charity it's money well spent.

Like how an artist paints a memory, or puts emotion into an event, this game does the same thing. It shows a brief glimpse into the awareness of those lost in the Japanese Tsunami of 2011. The butterflies represent the spirits of those gone. As I've said, it's not a game. It's a small walkthrough to feel a little of the emotions of what happened. I think there should have been a little bit more in the remembrance and perhaps the exploration than what is there. The ending was beautiful, but I do feel like I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe that's the point.\n\nI'm not sure to give it a good or bad review. I want to give it a good one because I think this kind of thing should be encouraged , as it's a means of remembrance, which rings true for those who know and perhaps felt the sadness of what happened in Japan. It's also a way to contribute to the charities that exist to the people who survived, and who lost someone they loved. The idea is good as an art form.

This is what personalises the event and the people, makes it more relatable and brings the realisation that these strangers we see on the news that seem a world away from us, were exactly the same as you and I. It brings everything closer, makes it seem more sort of... real in a way, being able to emotionally relate to it more so than we otherwise ever would.\n\nWith every object examined, the water recedes further down the shore to reveal a new trail to follow and a new person at the end of it, almost as if the tsunami itself is being pushed back and the very people themselves are being reclaimed by us with each new realisation we have of them.

There are no real objectives, no adventures, no guns, swords, killings, blood, gore, money, cars, explotions, fame, fortune, not anything like you'll find within the average Steam Library. I would use 'game' loosy with this title, and more of an interactive virtual memorial. 9.04m is set on a beach colored with simple blue and purple hues, a soothing piano playing in the background as you search for objects associated with those who lost their lives in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. It's a big reminder of how life can just as easily be taken for granite, as it is taken away. It lays the devistation of the disaster heavily on you, and it did more than stir my emotions. It's cheap, but the money spent buying this game is sent to charity, to help those in need. Experiance this for yourself, you must to get the full understanding of this beautiful artwork.\n\nMy final rating: 8.5/10\nIt is a beautifully done and emotion jerking short game with some flaws in the graphical department.

With the missing Malaysian passenger jet and the crisis in Ukraine, March 11th rolled by without many pausing to remember the event. To those who were not directly affected by this tragedy, it is easier to forget--something that the developers of 9.03m have tried not to let happen.\n\nCalling 9.03m a game should be considered a crime. 9.03m is not a game, but rather an interactive memorial designed to make the startling number of deaths caused by the disaster feel more intimate and close, not half a world away. It tries to show that those who died were people like us--young and old, with hopes, dreams, and loves--and it does so admirably well.\n\nExperiencing 9.03m would feel more appropriate in a museum, not on Steam. But perhaps even there 9.03m would be out of place, surrounded by dead fossils and lifeless artifacts of civilizations gone by, because 9.03m is neither dead nor lifeless. Quite the opposite, in fact: 9.03m is a living reminder of those who are no longer with us because of the Fukushima disaster--much like their memories in the hearts of loved ones.","March 21, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course this would have been related to the fact that it is such a simple game, with a span of just over 15 minutes for me. However, I am not at all concerned with this fact, and neither should anyone considering buying this game. In fact, the emphasis on numbers and figures is exactly what the creator wants to divert the player's attention from with 9.03.\n\nDedicated to those who died, were injured or unaccounted for in the 2011 Touhoku earthquake in Japan, 9.03 aims to give the lives of people behind the figures more meaning than just a number to represent a casualty. Not only was a person lost, but the rest of a child's life was taken. A potential family can no longer live happily together. Each of these are represented by a single memento that you find on the beach that the game is set on, and despite being only a simple object, you can't help but build a bigger picture in your mind about each one. About who might have owned it, what kind of a person might they have been, what kind of lives they led before the tsunami.\n\n9.03 gave me cause to consider all these things, and because of this I would say the creator has definitely succeeded with this game. And with half the proceeds going to charity, what better reason is there to experience this beautiful work of art?","January 12, 2014","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I almost guarentee anyone who plays this will probably cry or feel like crying by the end of it and I think that is why the game definetely succeeds at what it is trying to do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strickebobo/recommended/263100/","strickebobo","Owen or something","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strickebobo/","264 products in account","9.03m is both original and thought provoking. I wrote a full review a while back when it first released, and you can either read that here or in all its formatted glory on the blog I posted it.\nHere's the original: http://nwapmakesjackasilentprotagonist.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/aftermath-and-individual-903m-review.html\nAnd here's a version in this review itself:\n\nAftermath and the Individual ‚Äì 9.03m\n\nWith a whole bunch of triple-A titles being released it‚Äôs quite easy to forget about indie games entirely, and with a sale on dedicated to games you might miss (Not on Steam Sale) this is a great shame. One such game is 9.03m, a game that appeared on Desura the other day. Knowing little about it I bought it because:\na\na)      It‚Äôs a self proclaimed art game and I‚Äôm a lover of all things abstract\nb     b)      Half (yes, that‚Äôs 50%) of the proceeds from this game go to Aid For Japan and I‚Äôm a sucker for feeling good about myself.\n\nIf these aren‚Äôt things that appeal to you then you probably won‚Äôt enjoy 9.03m (you heartless ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•).\n\n\nSo as you can see the game is shamelessly depressing, not afraid to pull at your heartstrings or roll out the piano chords. If the game was in another developer‚Äôs hands it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôd be telling you how pretentious or cheesy it is, but Space Budgie have handled the subject in a mature and effective manner.\nThe game takes place on a San Francisco beach (that was the golden gate bridge you saw in the trailer) where you explore the remnants of the lives that were destroyed when a tsunami hit Japan in 2011. It‚Äôs at this point in time that if you‚Äôre of any geographical knowledge more advanced than being aware that the world is round, you‚Äôll realize that San Francisco is (believe it or not) not in fact in Japan. But if you‚Äôre convinced that somewhere along the line an awful mistake has been made then you‚Äôll be wrong, because I‚Äôm told that debris from the disaster genuinely did turn up on the shore of San Francisco. If that isn‚Äôt a story that deserves to be turned into a (kind of) exploration based game than I don‚Äôt know what is.\n\n\nThis wonder-‚Äòem-up consists of walking (duh) along aforementioned beach in search of butterflies. Finding these butterflies consists of following a trail of lights to find a silhouette that will fade to leave behind an object that acts as the final remnant of their existence. Once you have closely examined the object is shall be replaced by a butterfly that will fly away. The tide will be lowered and the process repeated.\nThis is such a simple mechanic that provides little challenge, so in theory it should soon become repetitive or dull, but in reality the truth is anything but. It‚Äôs a core mechanic that‚Äôs incredibly effective. The imagery is clear, yet incredibly moving at the same time. I‚Äôll try not to spoil anything, but one encounter involving a baby made my heart drop and I uttered audible protest at what I knew the game was about to present.\nOther than that there isn't much here, which by no means is a criticism, the minimalistic features work to 9.03m's advantage. The sound effects are great too, the sea sounds believable and like it's usual calming self. The music also works well, normally soppy piano chords or strings, but is suitably sombre for a game dealing with such sombre issues\n\n\nI thankfully managed to avoid blubbering like a baby, but the fact that it put my entire life into perspective is a testament to how well Space Budgie have executed 9.03m. I need not provide any further explanation other than it made my grateful to have my chief concern being that it was difficult to find the key that takes screenshots on fraps in the dark.\nThe art style is also worth noting. Consisting mainly of various shades of blue it either is reminiscent of the colour of the sea or just looks cool, but either way it really added flavour to the whole experience.\nThe greatest triumph of the game, however, is how it humanizes a statistic. Joseph Stalin once said that the death of one man is a tragedy but the death of a million men is a statistic, and that‚Äôs ever-present here. To see the damage the tsunami had on individuals will always be far more moving than reading the number of deaths or the cost of the damage, and in that respect I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything quite like 9.03m.\nIt also touches upon aftermath which is something that‚Äôs sadly rarely present in a medium so focused on the here and now. I don‚Äôt really think I understood just what the impact of the tsunami was before playing this game, thinking about what disasters such as this mean to individuals has always been present in my mind, but it somehow seems so much more real now.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs rather unfortunate that 9.03m suffers from the Achilles‚Äô heel of indie games, namely it‚Äôs short and costs too much money, as despite being ¬£1.99 the game is only 10 minutes long. However if this does put you off the game then I refer you to my earlier comment that half of the proceeds currently go to Aid For Japan (I say currently because that may even become 100% some day, or so I believe). Aid For Japan is certainly a worthy cause that helps children who were made orphans by the disaster, so if you look at it as a donation that gives you a great game rather than a ten minute game for ¬£2 then it‚Äôs actually a pretty good deal.\nSo 9.03m is a game that not many people will hear of which is sad because it‚Äôs a really thought-provoking and tender game. It‚Äôs tragic and glum and is far from a traditional game, but it‚Äôs an experience that genuinely had an impact on me, and not many games can say that.\n\n\nYou can be the thing from Desura and now Steam, as that's where you're reading this, isn't it?","November 30, 2013","true","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ordinary people swept away by a cruel act of nature.\nIt did make me think about 'What if it was Britain that had been devastated?'. We always detach ourselves from these far flung places where interesting natural things happen because we imagine them to be less developed than us, less concious of their reality; but Japan is our equal, if not our better. Their people are just like us, just as developed, just as intelligent, just as wealthy.\nIf anything, this game inspires a sense of solidarity with the Japanese people for their loss.\nApparantly the proceeds of the purchase go to helping Japan recover, and while it may have been a year or two ago, we should know better than to think that when it's not on the news anymore that it's fixed.

There are only a handful of these - each is a person who presents an object when you near it. Move the object around to find an icon. Click on the icon. See a piece of text (literally a sentence or less) and then follow the trail to the next tableau. It really is beautiful and could be applied to a number of situations, with modifications of setting and topic. It's easily worth the dollar price of admission, as long as you understand you are buying a short experience and not a "game".

I just don't think it was quite done in a way that made me feel like it really gained all it could've from being presented in an interactive medium, and I didn't feel like I was able to connect with it as much as I would've liked (although from a design point of view, having to physically manipulate the objects does at least get you some of the way there), but the ending was a high point. Kind of interesting and could worth checking out if you're into the whole "Hey, you got art in my game!" thing, but not one of my personal favorites.","January 10, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game?  Interactive Experience?  Tribute?  Fundraiser?  9.03m sets out as none of these, yet achieves all of them.  In emotion, in story structure, even in 'game play', it evokes one of those memorable Ocarina of Time moments ‚Äì just walk and look long enough, and maybe you will begin to see.  See how disparate peoples are united by common desires; how the things we care for most, those that shine brightest in our lives, are given to - and taken so easily - from us.  But this isn‚Äôt a game, or a story, or even a tribute. It‚Äôs an appeal ‚Äì to the inter-connectedness of human experience.\n\nFrom a sensory point of view, 9.03m is pretty much flawlessly realised.  Visually, aurally (with an excellent musical score) and in terms of involvement. The pace is slow.... but maybe it needs to be.  We're all accustomed to fast-paced, instantly gratifying 'action'... 9.03m tells us to stop, take a moment to look around and listen....  it's all too easy to allow our tendency towards disregard to blind us to the plight of others.  From a technical point of view if, like me, you're taken by the desire to just explore, then there's a fair chance you'll end up losing your bearings and feeling it might just be possible to miss something... and that‚Äôs not something you want to do.  Interactively, or emotionally.\n\nRarely have I been so moved by something that, by definition, exists to be experienced only through the distant medium of keyboard and mouse.  Buy this title.","January 11, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very atmospheric linear adventure game that explores the aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake/tsunami. The gameplay is very simple; all you do is follow a trail from one point to the next, examining objects to learn their origins.\n\nThe good: This game is dripping with atmosphere, all you have to do is look at the screenshots in order to see that. The art direction is excellent as well, as is the music.  While the game doesn't always succeed at packing an emotional punch(which I'll get into later), there is one moment where I was fighting back tears.\n\nNow for the bad. While the art direction is solid, the quality of the art is pretty low. I also ran into a number of graphical issues that are inexcusable in a game with a run-time of about 10-20 minutes, such as low draw distance and, again, especially bearing in mind the length of the game, very low resolution models and textures. For a game that sells itself on emotion, the majority of it will leave you bored. After you successfully identify the owner of each object, you have to watch a long, slow, cut-scene. It doesn't help that you move very slowly in-game. There are a few other issues that I won't get into, since they won't impact most other people, but this game is surprisingly unpolished, again, for something as small as it is.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes, I recommend it, if only because of the fact that all money made goes directly to charity.","June 7, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not much longer than about 10 minutes, but that's all it really needs to get its point across.\n\nThere is a good deal of ambiguity to the simplistic visuals, and they lend themselves well to the experience I think. The player, for lack of a better word, is able to project whatever they want to believe or make of the tragedy. In my case for example, I saw the often quiet determination of the Japanese people with each object I interacted with. The music in particular helped reinforce this thought in particular. It really is what you make of it, what does the disaster mean to you?\n\nIt may sound like I'm contradicting myself, but the message the developers intended to send shines through in spite of and because of this and pays special tribute to all those lost. It‚Äôs a reminder to look at things on a microscopic level whenever possible, and to empathize with others. The final sendoff of all the people dotting the beach was very beautiful and left a distinct impression of hope and love.\n\nIf you have a couple spare dollars I say give it a few minutes of your time, if not, move on to something more entertaining and/or meaningful.","December 7, 2013","true","3.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is a short, highly exploratory, wander-em-up style presentation that presents you with the discoveries of a sequence of artifacts along San Francisco's Baker Beach. These items, conceivably simply forgotten detritus to any other game, carried wayward by strange unfathomable currents and deposited on the West Coast of America about 12 months after the tsunami, convey way more than words or numbers alone ever could, and burrow themselves in your brain in the most human of ways.\n\nGameplay is as simple as possible: find an object, learn a bit about it, move onto the next. The presentation is tightly controlled, as only one object is visible at a time ‚Äì the tide recedes as you collect each object, revealing the next. With that level of distraction removed, there's more time to focus on the several objects you'll find. These objects are intensely sentimental in nature: a teddy bear, a pocketwatch frozen at the time of the tsunami's impact, a music box with an entwined couple inside. Subtitles are occasionally present, but sparse - no more than five found throughout the game's duration.\n\nEven in a brief glance over this game, I was aware of it being purported as heavily emotional. For a while, I wasn't sure if I was convinced I felt the same levels ‚Äì people speaking of tears and the like. The game's climax, though, is where it shines, and yes, that prophecy came true. This is one game that is exactly the right length ‚Äì about 20 minutes, and it's at around that time when you can expect to be most impressed with what it does right. It's not artsy in the overwhelming, over-the-top cheesy sense you might expect from anything that didn't begin as a graduate student's thesis project; much like Goldilocks' proverbial porridge, this game is "just right" on virtually every aspect. Rest assured, you don't have to "get" symbolism or "art" to understand this game.\n\nI could say more about this game, but I firmly believe the best advice is to go play it yourself.

The ending is very sad, yet beautifully portrayed in a way.\n\nGuided by glowing butterflies, you walk around on a beach and finding objects left after the disaster. Each time you find an object, the water draws back further so that you find other objects. You always see a glimpse of who the item seemed to belong to. (just shadowy figures) And it provokes a lot of sadness when you realize who the items belongs to.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone. The only kind of "action" you will get in this game is walking the beach and turning the objects around. That is it.

I ended up being touched by the experience. The fact that the developers are donating 50% of the proceeds from the game to charity is always a plus.\n\n9.03m does a great job of accomplishing feels. It gives you the feels while you‚Äôre feeling feels so you can feel feels while feeling feels. Anyways, the gameplay was quite linear, which I probably should have expected from a game that resembles a work of art more than a game. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, not at all. Your goal is to find butterflies among the items strewn across a San Francisco beach, these items being washed ashore from the tsunami that devastated Japan in 2011 due to the T≈çhoku earthquake. The gameplay itself was relatively simple, just follow the glowing orbs floating above the ground to the next object that has floated ashore. The player then has to inspect the item by rotating it, trying to find a ‚Äúclue‚Äù, which turns out to be a butterfly silhouette. This is the same for every object. The objects each had their own emotional impact on me. The ending to the game, which was only about ten minutes, was heart-wrenching and is bound to stick with you for some time. I would have loved if some nonlinear exploring could have made it into the final product, however.\n\nThe graphics in 9.03m were phenomenal. I‚Äôd love to see a full-length game with this kind of art style. It was so simple, but somehow, so elegant. Just simple shades of blue and the occasional white figure. Simple, but sorrowful music, very soothing. Atmospheric waves, the sounds of a beach. All blending together to form one excellent atmospheric mood. The simplest controls you can get. The game makes use of the analog stick and the analog stick only. No other controls involved, like I said, this is a work of art, not a full-fledged game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31oQBwv_69k","November 25, 2013","true","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Those who come from the 'cowadudy' world will just think of it as a boring walking simulator. It doesn't have to have weapons or explosions to be a game.\n\n9.03m, is a short, first person, art/empathy game for PC. Not a game in the traditional sense of the word; it aims to humanise, and remember the victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The media is quick to put figures to death tolls in such disasters, and 9.03m tries to remind people of the individuals behind those figures\n\nYou start off on a blue beach with butterflies flying around you. They flutter away from you, further and further.. You continue through the beach, finding the butterfly symbol on items that the people in the Tsunami incident may have had at that moment; Items such as a toy train, a pocket watch, a teddybear and even a baby cradle. Everytime you find one of the butterflies, the tide dies down a little, revealing more people.\n\nAt the very end of the game, the sea withdraws, revealing hundreds upon hundreds of people -- The people who are no more since the Tsunami. White orbs, presumably butterflies, fly into the heavens to form stars.\n\nOverall, 9.03m is a short, but alluring game.

It's punctuated by atmospheric and emotional use of a piano to help hit the needed emotional notes.

Those who come from the 'cowadudy' world will just think of it as a boring walking simulator. It doesn't have to have weapons or explosions to be a game.\n\n9.03m, is a short, first person, art/empathy game for PC. Not a game in the traditional sense of the word; it aims to humanise, and remember the victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The media is quick to put figures to death tolls in such disasters, and 9.03m tries to remind people of the individuals behind those figures\n\nYou start off on a blue beach with butterflies flying around you. They flutter away from you, further and further.. You continue through the beach, finding the butterfly symbol on items that the people in the Tsunami incident may have had at that moment; Items such as a toy train, a pocket watch, a teddybear and even a baby cradle. Everytime you find one of the butterflies, the tide dies down a little, revealing more people.\n\nAt the very end of the game, the sea withdraws, revealing hundreds upon hundreds of people -- The people who are no more since the Tsunami. White orbs, presumably butterflies, fly into the heavens to form stars.\n\nOverall, 9.03m is a short, but alluring game.

It feels like the kind of short program a university student studying video games would create as an assignment.  The sentiment is beautiful and the ending is nice, but when it comes down to it, the game is 10 minutes of walking through a blurry purple landscape looking at a few low resolution objects while a sad piano piece plays.  If that is all you are looking for, this game delivers.  For me, I guess I was hoping for a little more emotional connection.  Regardless, it is great that the devs are donating their royalties from the game to charity.","March 26","false","0.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Just know I‚Äôm not really someone who likes "artistic games." However, since all proceeds do go to charity, if you think you can trust the developer, it's basically a free game for donating to charity, but at this same time I feel like you should donate directly to a charity instead of buying the game and trusting the developers to give everything to charity, and don't forget that Valve gets a percentage of all sales, and that's why I don't recommend buying this game.","October 3, 2014","false","0.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

But I think that the execution undoes the whole point.\n\nThe game is about putting a human face and soul to the number of lives lost in the 2011 tsunami. Unfortunately, the gameplay does not support this in the slightest. I have no problems with 'walking simulators' when the walking has a purpose in relation to the message. Here, there are no choices, there is only one path, and the metaphor is so blandly obvious that it ends up uneffective.\n\nWhile I don't want to say what a game should or should not be, I think if the developers wanted to tell this story, they should have had HUNDREDS of objects wash up on the beach, and have it be free to choose which objects you want to look at and examine. Not just to add gameplay, but to give the onus and agency of realisation to the player. Have the player organically grow an attachment and develop feelings to empathise with the tragedy. By having a very limited number of objects, and having it scripted to the point where you're just walking on one path, the realisation that each object was attached to a person gets completely lost. We've barely gotten connected to the situation when the game ends and shows all its cards. We can't help but wonder why the game didn't let us learn about all these lives organically rather than a ham-fisted souls departing ending.\n\nOnce again, I love indie games, I'm a sucker for art house, but for me, this game missed the mark and even worse, missed out on an opportunity to say something profound about a huge loss in life.","June 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

If anything, it's an interactive memorial to the victims of the 2011 disasters in Japan. It takes about 15 minutes to play, and you walk along a very blue beach, examining common items and exploring the ever-receding coastline. The idea behind this memorial seems to be to commemorate and humanize the victims; unfortunately it doesn't paint much of a picture unless you chew on it as you play it.\n\nTo say "as you play it" is a misdirection, as you don't really play the game either. You walk and you rotate objects. If 9.03m really is a game, then it's a game where you have to mull things over and make your own stories as you play it, or else you're stuck with almost nothing. It's a game that tells you who less than a fraction of these poor souls were, but it still fails at conveying the true depth of a disaster like this to a simple foreigner. The game showed me things and I understood what it was showing me, but it didn't change me. The pacing seemed stretched out, too, and although the ending is pretty profound, you're not changed by it.\n\nAside from the game's purpose and structure, it's well-made in the sound and graphics departments. The minimalist low-poly visuals look so-so in stills, but REALLY come alive during gameplay. Unfortunately with a limited number of resolution options and no support for vsync, the suspension of disbelief (what little there is to be had) is immediately lost. Thankfully, the music and sound design are immersive enough, providing their own beauty to this memorial.\n\nDon't buy 9.03m if you're looking for an actual game. If you hated Dear Esther or To The Moon, chances are you'll hate this. Do buy 9.03m if you want to see one team's memorial, however ineffective it may be in provoking emotion, to the tragedy that shook a nation to its core.","March 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

In terms of graphics and gameplay, it is quite subpar. It is, however, interesting enough to warrant your time.

The game does not develop ideas well enough, partially because it mushes so many meaningless things into the ten minutes, to gain any sort of empathy.

Well, merely at face value its an Indie art nongames like Proteus, Dear Ester before it, about the 2011 Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami. Delievered in a sombre, but empathic fashion. But unlike Proteus which had you envelope yourself in the sounds and sites of an island, or Dear Ester puts you in the shoes of a man dealing with loss and guilt; 9.03m doesn't have a underlying mechanic or a layered subplot. Its simply serves as a guided tour across a retreating shoreline, inspecting lost belongings.\n\nFor much of it I just couldn't understand what this game was trying to convey, it was almost lost to me. But having seen it through and given it time to sink in I think that is supposed to be the point of 9.03m. Tragedy is something you can never really comprehend.

I replay Dear Esther and Trauma time and time again because of the atmosphere and how they try to push the boundries of what a game can be. Neither game are what I'd call "good" but I'd call them fascinating and endearing because they try to be different. 9.03m doesn't try, it makes you slowly plod along a dull beach following a trail of fire flies to see a ball or a ring. The graphics are shoddy, the attempt at gameplay is benign and I have no idea what the hell is going on.\nAll you do is walk, pick up object, rotate object and watch some words float up on the screen before the trail or fire flies leads you elsewhere. Don't even both free roaming, all you'll get is an endless field of blue. At least Dear Esther had the common decency to avoid clicking on things senselessly.\nIn short: 9.03m looks like an interesting experiment in gameplay with some cool screenshots to win you over. I'm aware this game costs $2 but I don't think the game is worth even that.\nEdit>> I noticed that all proceeds go to charity so at least I have the knowledge that my money went to a good cause to make me feel a little better...

It raises awareness towards tsunamis and those unaware to the effects of one. 9.03m is a very deep and meaningful game, and the money from every purchase contributes to 2 wonderful charities which help the victims of the japanese tsunami.\n\n9.03m is all about symbolization, in which you need to figure things out for yourself. The total game doesn't take too long to complete, though the story is amazingly powerful. You're on a beach, on which the tsunami hit. You're task is to follow the glowing butterflies which lead you to the ghost of a victim. Heading to them in the dim moonlight, you will find a possession of theirs in which you need to find a clue to inform you of their name, history, etc. The whole game is based on supporting the victims and raising awareness, and in my opinion it has succeeded in that. 9.03m is not meant to be played as a game, more as a meaningful and sad story.\n\nThe game is simplistic though meaningful. Symbols are a large part of the game, creating mystery and suspense. With all it's earnings headed directly to 2 charities, this game is worth the full price.

The experience involves walking along a beach to find items and then proceed. There really is only one path to go on. Stray too far off and you'll teleport back onto the correct path. Every time an object is found the goal is to find and click on the butterfly that's on the object. Once that happens, the player is treated to an animation of a butterfly flying off to the beach it can never quite reach, leaving a trail of balls of light in its wake. Given the situation with Fukushima, seeing the butterflies with light coming from them heading to the ocean reminds me just a bit too much of the oceans being hit with massive doses of radiation. Also, it seems like the makers of this undercut their own message of tragic loss by repeatedly associating human beings with objects. It's kind of dehumanizing, actually.  Also, there are no pictures of any of the dead. At the end there's a bunch of people in silhouette on the beach, but its just vague forms of human beings and nothing that might actually make me relate to the dead or their loved ones that grieve for them now. The whole experience just comes across as empty and pointless. Perhaps the makers of 9.03m thought the same way about the tsunami and wanted to convey that to everyone else. I'm kind of conflicted on this, but ultimately I do not recommend 9.03m.","January 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It had some strange design choices. To start out, I decided to walk along the path I was placed upon backwards.  For some reason, this led to the title screen.  I started again, and was forced to rewatch the camera pan over several spots again.  This didn't seem to serve any greater artistic purposes, and was quite annoying.\n\nAt one point, I was for some reason tasked with climbing a rock, but because I could not see the face of the rock because of the art style, I had to randomly run into it in several directions in hopes of finally climbing up an invisible path carved on the rock's face.  I eventually succeeded, but it took me 5-10 minutes to figure out, which really took me out of the game.  Again, a poor design choice.\n\nThe last choice that bothered me was just plain odd.  The game takes place on a beach, and throughout the game I assumed it took place in Japan, where the tsunami hit.  Perhaps I missed a flash of text, but nothing I noticed led me to believe otherwise.  Then, just befroe writing this review, I read in the description that "9.03m is set on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where debris from the tsunami has washed ashore in the years following the tsunami."  I found this quite surprising that the developers chose to place a bit of information, which to me, is essential to the artisitic experience of the game, in the description, but not prominently in the game.\n\nAgain, while I do appreciate what this game was trying to do, evoke emotion about the tragedy that occured because of the tsunami in Japan, I feel that some bad design choices got in the way of what the game was trying to do.","November 27, 2013","false","0.4"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

No special lighting, animation or shadow processing.\n+ All availible game mechanics (there are just a few) work fine.

It isn't even a game, and if you expect it to be then this review is not for you.\n\nGameplay was not exciting.  I was not excited for a majority of the game.  But it was relaxing.  It's simple; find the stuff that's clearly marked and find the butterfly.  They even give you trails.  It was, as someone commented prior "Like an interactive art gallery" which I enjoyed.  I like art galleries.  It was bland, but I think that was intentional so as to encourage a state of reflection within the player.  Tranquility and simplicity were the main points of the little gameplay there was, and I found it intruiging and calming.\n\nPersonally, I liked the graphic scheme.  I thought that, while not particularily appealing to the decrotive aesthetic, the graphics of the game had their own unique charm that overall fit the purpose it was designed for.  The dullness and darkness to me emphisised the sadder nature of the game and seemed fitting for the subject.\n\nI can't say that I'm thrilled with the sound, of which there seemed to be very little.  I think that, despite everything else, it could have been so much better if therehad only been a little more music.  Although what music there was was enjoyable, the addition of more music would have been much better.  Also, the footsteps get obnoxious after a while.\n\nSumming it up, I think that this game is good for a 7.5 out of 10.  I'm being generous because I enjoyed the gallery-style play, but that is not what most players on here are for.  While the gameplay was simple and calming, it was bland and repitious and offered no mental stimuli other than the (somewhat optional) reflection on the lost lives.  The graphics were also relatively bland but keeping in the game's context I think suited the game well.  THe lack of sound frustrated me and I think that the game would have been much better for the music.\n\nIf you want to donate .99 cents to a cause and get something from it, then this may be a good idea.  It isn't and exciting shoot 'em up, but I personally had a fun time with it.\n","July 23, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will probably give some little looks into the lives of those we lost, and it could be an intense tearjerking experience.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nI keep seeing the words Humanise, Empathy, and Character Development. I'm not entirely sure people are talking about the same game. The entirety of the game consisted of watching some butterflies fly to a silhouette, then following them at the speed of an 80-year-old down a Walmart aisle.\n\nOnce you reach the silhouette, it turns into an item! At first (the first item being a soccer ball) I thought, oh man, here it comes. The waterworks are.... Oh it has the kid's name on it... Are people really so dilluted as to not humanize people until they see a name on a soccer ball?\n\nThen, the item turns into a butterfly and does the whole cutscene/slow walk song and dance again. Items include: A wedding band with an inspirational quote in the band (unlike every wedding band in the world), a box that plays music, an empty baby cradle (Which would have been more powerful if I wasn't bored out of my skull and having ordinary items shoved in my face) and... Actually I can't even remember any of the other items.\n\nIn the end, this 15 minute game failed to instill any more empathy than I already had for the people affected by the 2011 tsunami. There was absolutely zero character development. There was no powerful imagery. And I'm really disappointed. This game could have been powerful. It could have had some real content. It could have drawn in some real attention for itself and the charity it's supporting. Instead, I just wasted 15 minutes of my life.\n\nDon't buy this game.

If you're not moved to contribute to the cause before playing this game, I can't imagine you'll be moved after.  I'll review it as a piece of electronic entertainment.\n\nIt's a walking simulator that doesn't let you walk anywhere, but where they want you to go.  If you walk beyond their boundaries, the screen starts to darken slowly.  If you don't turn back, it's game over, and you have to restart from the beginning.  I mean the very beginning. Opening credits, and all.  It sends you back to the main menu to start again.  That was annoying.  The game took about five minutes to play through.  My total play time of 28 minutes is due to a game over the first time, then not being able to locate the first "clue" the second time.  Once I found the first "clue," the game showed me where to go for the rest, and it was over very quickly.  I put "clue" in quotations because that's what the game calls them, but there's no mystery to solve here.  Find the item, click a specific spot on the item, watch an animation, done.  You'll do this 4 times then the game is over.  You haven't learned anything, you haven't discovered anything new, or made any kind of change to your environment.  You look at objects that represent a life once lived then you look at shadows representing the people who lived them.  That's all there is to see, and do here.  It's not Dear Esther, or any of the other walking sims you may have tried.  There's one monochromatic landscape that you can't explore.  The music is inoffensive, but dull.  The whole experience is dull.  Art is subjective, so you may find this a touching tribute, but I didn't find anything particularly sentimental about the experience.  Nothing that moved me, personally.  Nothing that offers a new perspective on the disaster.  Nothing that inspires you to get involved in the cause.  It's a good cause, but a bad gaming experience.  If I could go back in time, and talk to myself before I bought this game, I'd say, "Just donate a dollar to the Red Cross, or something.  Hell, donate ten.  Just don't waste your time with the game.  You won't be missing out on anything."","January 24, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The people/souls you discover, in my opinion, are superficial and lacking stories about their lives.

But if that's the case, Id rather expected the developers to at least elaborate some fictional characters, to fill the gaps.\n\nThe ending is pretty and rounds up this "game", that's also how myself and many others think about death - it's an end, but also a new beginning!","August 15, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greymusic/recommended/263100/","greymusic","greymusic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greymusic/","380 products in account","At this point it's probably fair to say I've developed a dislike for 'walking simulators'--as a gametype, they seem to be strung together by the bare minimum of required interaction from the player, which to me seems a betrayal to the medium of video games as a whole. '9.03m' is inarguably a game of that type, asking no more of you than a depressed W key and occasional fiddling with the mouse. At first, I found the objects the game wanted me to interact with interesting, but eventually they became part of an overly sentimental narrative--childrens' toys, specifically--and I found it harder to care. In terms of actual gameplay, '9.03m' is essentially a slide show which you are holding W to navigate.\n\nThe world that's constructed within, however beautiful (and it is beautiful, in a mystical, fantasy-light type way), is ultimately incredibly linear. The game has one objective at a time it wants you to go to, and if you go anywhere else, the screen fades to black and points you back towards your objective. So that there's not even a world to interact with--just the idea of a world, and the idea of the people that might have lived within it.\n\nUp until the end of the game, I was ready to deem '9.03m' unsuccessful--but in a strange way, it managed to make even the device of player frustration and incompetence useful in its narrative message. I won't spoil anything, because the game is incredibly short, but if you play thru the entire thing and aren't at least slightly moved, it's possible art games of this type aren't for you at all. I was beginning to think they weren't for me, but '9.03m' seems to be on the shallowest side of the 'gameplay' spectrum, yet still proved a rewarding experience. I recommend it to anyone who wants to examine the interaction between art, tragedy, and games, but with the warning that the actual 'game' is probably about twenty minutes long in total.","April 29","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
