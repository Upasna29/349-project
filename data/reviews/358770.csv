The western art style is quite refreshing. A wide variety of characters for many tastes. The music is good as well, a decent variety. Wish there was a bit more though.

Right now this game is nothing but a tease with the promise of a game that will come.....eventually. No set release dates, no real promises, and very little information is given other than, 'we have two games coming out before releasing the other chapters for this.' And, of course, no set release dates on those either. So late leaves me here, buying a TASTE of a wonderful game or at least the idea of one with no view of the main course in sight.\n\nTo be fair, while surfing through the discussions I did see a post from the developer that stated that one of the games slated to come out before this one has some projected time periods of 'sometime during the winter, we hope, but not nessicarily this one.' That leaves me even more annoyed,\n\nIf they put out some proper dates on the future of this series then I will GLADLY change this review to a recommended because the setting, the characters and the story telling meathod are all so amazing, but until they get their release schedule in order I cant, in good heart, recommend this chapter to anyone.","June 12, 2015","false","3.6"," 47 of 67 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","47","67","0","14"

The story seems to be heading in that direction. It soon changes though, and really it is very wrong to call this a Yuri novel. There is a Yuri content, sure, but it's by no means the dominant aspect of the story. It's a bit like calling the War Of The Worlds a heterosexual novel. It kinda misses the point.\nIn passing, I would also class the Yuri element as aimed at a male audience. It's rather too brash for a female audience.\nThe first episode is a decent length and accompanied by some good music. The story is inventive and compelling.\nRecommended?

While not a deal breaker, there are moments where the tone is slightly rushed, making it somewhat confusing to follow. This is thankfully not a persistent problem, but does weaken one or two scenes.\n- Music loops are sometimes not really effective. At least one music track for the battle/action sequences actually does have a build up: while hitting the climax of these build ups make sequences with action a lot more impactful, it does feel a bit flaccid when it loops back around to the build up while battle is still on-going.\n- The character design is a hate it or love it affair. This is more a subjective concern, and one you can more or less settle by looking at the screenshots. Personally, I find the semi-fan service style isn’t too distracting, but again this is a subjective concern.\n\nAll right, with that out of the way, let’s talk about the positives, because this game has a fair number of them:\n- The general art style is quite unique. The use of colour in the backgrounds and characters succeeds in making both pop, and shows a good level of variance. This is in addition to every character having a very unique silhouette, which helps differentiate between them.\n- The musical theme is well earned. There is a close tie in the story between rock music and demons, and to that end the sound track does earn its wings. I can’t say much beyond that due to my tone-deaf nature, but even a pleb like me can see that the rock in this shows a great level of promise.\n- Fairly charming ‘fish out of water’ story. While the world and demons of hell are a core part of the story, Toko adjusting herself to the human world serves as a welcome element. The quirky comedy that comes from Toko trying out various human normalities is nicely offset by the constant background fact that she is slowly becoming something she is not, and the natural emotional stress that would bring.\n--- Hugely likable and varied cast. In my personal opinion the visual novel’s greatest strength: the two main characters share the screen with a wide range of colourful characters, all with a variety of characteristics and motivations. This is in addition to a number of characters based on mythological figures, all of which have quite imaginative interpretations. Watching the characters bounce off one another, and seeing the conflict that comes from that, is probably the majority of the reason to buy the VN.\n\nOther facts (fair warning, might be considered SPOILERS):\n\n\n- It has JoJo worthy Stands. Trust me, it’s pretty cool.\n- The chibi art is adorable.\n- Ginxhou is the best. Search your feelings; you know it to be true.\n\nAs it is right now, the length is around 3-ish hours, and as the title says this is ONLY the prelude. That being said, I would consider it a worthy investment into what promises to be a good series.","July 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/358770/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Overview :\n\nThe Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude is a relatively short kinetic visual novel from the studio Lupiesoft.  It is the aptly named prelude to what will hopefully be a very successful series of visual novels crammed full of beautiful art and amazing music with a unique spin on timeless concepts and a ton of fun and adorable characters.\n\nStory :\n\n"When a human's time has come, it's up to the demons of the underworld to ferry the new soul to the afterlife. This noble duty with a proud history is carried out by every self-respecting demon...all except for Toko, the only demon in Hell who can't bring herself to ferry a soul and who is promptly booted into the overworld.\n\nNow in the world of humans, Toko must reap a soul so that she can earn passage back home or face becoming a human herself. However, once she meets the cheerful Nadia, Toko's objectives change as she unravels the mysteries of the past and herself. But with bigger plans in motion behind the scenes, Toko's in for one Hell of a trip." - from official website\n\nInitially I didn't know what to think about the story for The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude but as the tale progressed and started picking up steam I got more and more sucked in.  The characters are adorable (especially Nadia), the writing is on point, and the way they play with concepts such as the different types of demons and the deadly sins, the rings and levels of Hell, the struggle between Angels and Demons, witches and folklore, and especially music it creates a really fun and cool world in a way I haven't really seen tried before.\n\nNow that isn't to say that it is perfect.  At times some of the dialogue felt a little off (though I'm having a hard time figuring out why) and character progression (especially Toko) at times feels a little rushed and stilted.  It doesn't take away from the experience as a whole, not by a long shot, because you're just having too much damn fun seeing age old concepts reworked in a unique and innovative way.  I can't wait to have the curtain drawn back further in future entries so I can learn more.\n\nVisuals :\n\nArtist Taosym has made a name for himself by being an exceptionally talented individual so it should be no surprise that that The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude is a beautiful game.  Hell, beautiful doesn't come close to describing it properly in my opinion but you can see for yourself.  It has spunk, it has character, and most important of all it is unique.  The sprites are gorgeous and playful, the backgrounds are detailed and varied, and the CGs are just flat out awesome.  I adore it.  It is a real shame there isn't a gallery or something like that within the game that you could access to view all his beautiful art...but more on that later in the System section.\n\nSound Design :\n\nPonyo and Ryuno did a fantastic job.  Music is a big part of what makes or breaks a Visual Novel for me and thankfully soundtrack is stellar.  Smooth jazz, haunting piano melodies, unsettling and chaotic cacophonies, neat electronic grooves with ambient city sounds,  driving bass, bold percussion, flat out gnarly rock.  It is a big range but it never hits a sour note.  Considering the story implications with Music I would expect nothing less.\n\nAnd as a side note Falling From Grace Right On Your Face, Roaring Flames, and Swallow You Whole are my personal favorites but the entire soundtrack is amazing.  Absolutely worth picking up as an extra.  Hint hint.\n\nSystem :\n\nThe short answer is that it is Ren'Py and by that I mean everything works and I had zero system related issues.  Font choices were smart and always easily readable.  The GUI is simple, looks good, and fits the motif set by the story.  The only major issue I have is the lack of the very common (and always appreciated in a game with beautiful art and an awesome soundtrack) Extra section.  I can understand skipping out on the Jukebox section (as the Soundtrack is available and totally worth picking up) but I'm unsure why something like the CG gallery was omitted.  I can only hope it will eventually be added.\n\nConclusion :\n\nI love The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude to death.  I absolutely adore it.  The story is such a fun and cool concept and between the beautiful art and fantastic soundtrack it never feels tired or phoned in.  In a genre that is very often very melodramatic and with plot twists you can see from a mile away The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude never takes itself super seriously but somehow still manages to to put that sinking feeling in your gut at the perfect times.  It is impressive.  Aside from a few slight hiccups in writing, the lack of the almost industry standard "Extra" section, and desperately wanting more but knowing I have to wait, I can't say anything bad thing about it.  I'm super pumped to see where the story goes and I'll be eagerly waiting for the next installment.","May 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I have never played a (real) visual novel either.\n\nI'd say this has been a satisfying experience. I found myself halfway through thinking "well that was a nice story," and then was pleasantly surprised when there was half of the story left over to spacebar through. At points throughout the story, I found myself wishing I could actually play out the actions the characters were taking, e.g. searching for the lost ball, fighting the fighty fight, etc. The soundtrack wasn't anything that blew me away but at no point was it annoying, so hey no harm no foul I guess. While I can see where other reviewers found the intro to be paced a little too quickly, I wasn't terribly put off by the sequence of coincidences that set up the Toko/Nadia relationship. There could easily be some explanation for why Nadia helped Toko so much, due in no small part to Toko having received a "deed" of sorts to Nadia's soul, and Toko's nature as a succubus. I'm not entirely sure the final scene was necessary. But, taken as-is, I like this story and I'm interested in the series continuing. Sometimes the sprites move around too quickly so it's hard to see what they did, particularly the mini-cutscene where Toko pulls out Epiphone Epiphany. It's not a game and it's not a visual novel, and it never was going to be, so just ignore the complaints about lack of "gameplay" or choices.\n\nIf you don't like reading and lesbians, don't buy it.\nIf you like reading and/or lesbians, buy it.\nI don't like reading.","February 13","true","5.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I may just be picky.)\n\nI tend to prefer to watch feelings develop over time, but this does make more room for us to see where the relationship goes and how it will change. Too many dating sims/ visual novels stop when the characters come together and you never really see how the relationship grows.\n\nSo in summary:\nIt is worth checking out.\nand I'm excited to see how the dynamics of their relationship changes over time and with new challenges.","June 15, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It'll last you 2-5 hours depending on reading speed, so $5 is actually a pretty good deal.\n\nAlright, time for what you need to know: 1) the game doesn’t take itself too seriously and has several truly-hilarious moments; and 2) Ginxhou, a show-stealing side character, is (alone) worth the price of admission.\n\nI know a lot of people look at the game and feel the same way I did/do -- the character design is off-putting. I hate over-sexualized character sprites in any game, and several of Toko's characters are over-the-top in that regard. Well, once I started playing the game, it became increasingly apparent that A) the game doesn't take itself too seriously, and B) the outrageous designs are just a part of that ethos. There are a few moments of self-awareness where they make fun of the designs, even, so if that's what's got you on the fence I'd suggest giving it a chance.\n\nThe game is a "Kinetic Novel" -- which is to say it's a visual novel without player-inputted choices. If you haven’t played a visual novel before, think of it kind of like an interactive graphic novel. Sekai Project – the publisher of this game – has a solid catalog of other Visual Novels to try (Planetarian is a *fantastic* example of a Kinetic Novel/Visual Novel on Steam, and their upcoming Steam release of Grisaia is one of the best “VNs” (visual novels) out there).  If you have any difficulties playing visual novels, hit me up – I’m pretty active in the VN scene and I’d be happy to help you out.\n\nI really enjoyed Toko, and I look forward to Chapter 1.

The biggest problem being is that the story feels like it's being played with the fast forward button being held down. Character building and in particular relationship building feels rushed here, things happening overnight that just don't seem realistic. It's setting the stage, and I understand that, but a more even approach here would have been appreciated as I think the writing can hold up to interest the user.\n\nSee, that's the problem about this game in its episodic format in particular. There's some good art work and some interesting world building that develops here: and if the game follows up with some strong episods after it, this could have a payoff that would be great in the visual novel genre. But judging it for what it is NOW, it feels like it's hamstrung by several factors, and doesn't execute on the themes that it wants to.\n\nThis could easily change to a recommendation depending on how they follow it up. But for now, it's a game that while it does have things going for it, I can't say it's going to deliver.\n\nFull Written Review: http://techraptor.net/content/reject-demon-toko-chapter-0-prelude-review-2-fast-2-confusing\n\nLists:\n+:\nInteresting setup and premise, you want to know more about the world in question and more about these characters.\nCharacter interactions are good and while they are rushed, some of them can really stand out from a character arc standpoint.\nArt style does stand out rather well. Great use of color and even going against some conventions, it worked in terms of presentation.\nWriting overall works in terms of character presentation. Sometimes it's not the greatest of writing, but you can picture this playing out in terms of these characters in particular.\nHonestly the rock element was pretty cool.\nHas Potential.\n-:\nEpisodic format hurts it due to the limited interaction we had here, and really not knowing if you want to pay to continue. It puts hooks in, but they aren't deep enough to really convince me to continue on, especially without knowing when the next episode is scheduled to be.\nEven with that said, parts of the story feel rather rushed. The rushed love story here in particular feels like it never got the development in needed to get off the ground, making me wonder if there was truly a connection there.\nToo much introduced in the short time frame. Too many subplots started so that it makes you wonder how they are going to handle in the next episode.\nYou get lost at times. Wondering what the whole reason a section played out for and what purpose.","December 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","13","24","2","0"

Toko is sent out by her father to attempt to take her first soul. She ends up just getting a piece of paper with the word soul written on it from a young girl. This first failed attempt to get a soul is met by several more over time and eventually Toko is rejected and sent to earth where she will eventually become more and more human. Toko then runs into the girl from her first attempt at getting a soul. The story progresses and eventually get into Demon/Angel/Witch combined with high school and rock n roll.\n\nPositive\nThe art is actually pretty good, but it isn't for everybody. If your expecting cute anime girls this really won't offer a whole lot for you. The story is similar to the art style in that it is very relient on it's quirkiness. It has a nice sense of humor. It does include yuri for those interested in that.\n\nNegative\nThere is no choices as of episode 0. It has a lot of repeated assets and is likely to repeat these assets in further volumes. Some may find the art crude. The music isn't bad, but considering it talks about pop music and rock n roll it doesn't have any playing ever...\n\nConclusion\nIf your interested in a VN with a quirky sense of humor and art this is it.\n\nValue\nI'd say they priced it relatively fair at $5.

The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 is a kinetic visual novel that, while having some fairly important drawbacks, ends up offering something out of the ordinary for the genre and may be worth pursuing in that regard.\n\nTo begin, we'll go with some pros. In contrast to a lot of visual novels with convoluted storylines and serious tones, this one has a writing style that's very poppy and light on the tongue. This may be a direct consequence of the plot style, which is one of the main reasons I like this game. To sum it up, it feels less like a ponderous story and more like a (somewhat dorky) western-style comic book. The main characters are demons and angels and witches! Rock and roll is a demonic sex-magick! All the fights are based on music, with appropriate stings provided by the soundtrack! It comes off feeling goofy and loveable, which, together with some obvious tongue in cheek jokes about visual novels and anime characters in the script, make you feel like this was exactly what the design team wanted -- no world-shattering philosophies, just some light giggles. It's entertaining rather than illuminating.\n\nThe character design is something I both like and dislike; I give extra points for one of the main characters being drawn noticably larger than is the norm in the genre, and this not being used for comedy but simply a part of the character's design. Of course, everybody else is still ludicrously thin/amazingly bountiful in the chest department, but hey -- small steps, and an excuse can be made that most of those characters aren't actually human anyhow. There's also a strong lesbian romance theme going on, as might be gathered from other reviews; while this isn't exactly super romantic or developed (it's not that kind of story), it's there, treated as normal, and pretty enjoyable if you're into it. Still, the protagonist feels like a relative wallflower, who gets overpowered by funnier/more endearing characters like Nadia and Ginxhao.\n\nCons? Well, there's always another side of the coin to goofy and entertaining, which is that it sometimes feels like it's trying too hard to be cool in a very stereotypically adolescent way, and that pretty much nothing in this story is going to make you think; it's not very substantial in terms of themes. Or, as it turns out, in terms of content: expect an hour or so, and then you're done. That, I feel, will be the major sticking point for a lot of people who are used to VNs and wanted to try out something a little different -- for the price, there just isn't much there.\n\nUltimately, it boils down to a few questions: are there better visual novels than TRDT: C0? Undoubtedly yes. Are there better visual novels out there for free? Again, yes. But I need to stress that it  is  offering something a little different, and it is an entertaining little romp for how long it lasts. I feel like I should also point out that short =/= bad; time is precious and fewer people read extensively nowadays anyway, so it might be a good fit for somebody who's not overly interested in settling down and spending five hours getting invested in a story.\n\nFinal verdict: I wouldn't buy this at full price, not with the competition being what it is. But it may be worth a shot at sale price, if only to see if it's something you like. If I could half-recommend it, I would, but there are only thumbs up and thumbs down in this crazy world of ours, so I'll go with up since I personally enjoyed it. Just don't expect it to change your life.","September 7, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Being a game centered around demons and rock, I can't help but feel like the music, although nice, should've been a more intense one fitting the atmosphere at times. The writing itself seemed a bit too straightforward here and and somewhat awkward there, but for the most part, the story seems very intricate that I'd want to know what happens in the next part. The art and detail of the anatomy was surprisingly breathtaking - from the lewd scenes to casual wear, the artists put some great effort in making them feel less flat and more vivid. It may be a bit short for people, so you may want to wait until this goes on sale if you think you want to justify getting your money's worth.\n\ntl;dr nice art, nice music, nice PLOT, whycantiholdallthisyuri","June 20, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whinterfell/recommended/358770/","Whinterfell","WhinterFell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whinterfell/","358 products in account","Without giving away any of the story let me start by saying this Visual Novel (VN for short) is a kinect story with no choices or branching paths to it within the prelude.  The developer has said that they may work at choices and paths in later updates to the story but nothing is set in stone as of yet.  The same with voice acting, steam cards as of right now, and any kind of gallery for the various characters and scenes.  But again the developer has plans to add each of those things in future updates.  So if you like VN that are all about the story being told then this will be something to read through.\n\nNow as for the story itself, in short it is a fast paced story of a demon and her life outside of hell and what happens to her.  Various other character show up to either help or hinder her with her new life on Earth.  It is about 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours long depending on your reading speed.  The story runs a little fast with characters and leaves some things to be pieced together by the reader as it goes.  Being a prelude it doesn't explain everything but leaves you wanting more after reading.  Which with a prelude is exactly what is should be doing.  The art style is popping and the character are all unique in their style and appearance,  The music is catchy and switches between rhythmic soft classical to some deep rock.  Over all The Reject Demon Toko offers great music, interesting characters, popping art, and a great start to an interesting story.","May 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The Reject Demon.\n\nI will start by saying that this is my first experience of a Visual Novel on steam and i'm not disappointed. The story has great originality but still holds its own twist on demons and their world and how things work for them. The dialogue is serious but keeps the reader entertained by throwing in cute chirpy humor, the characters are very niceley defined and thats quite an important aspect so that characters each hold their own.\n\nThe artwork is just adorable. Beautifully rendered and the backgrounds are lovely and dont take away from the charaters themselves too much. I think one of my favourite aspects of this novel is the music, i adore it. It really sets the mood for what is happening in the scene, I think as a visual novel this is a very important aspect because it really pulls you into the story and what is happening.","May 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Even though it's fantasy, I was just like "um, ok?"\n- Forced innuendo. I get it already. The game's going for the yuri audience.\n- A visual novel joke at an arcade? I know you're trying to be meta, but it was an extended joke in the wrong place.\n- I know there was the big page sprawl about rock and roll but like I just chuckled at the whole Epiphany part where she suddenly draws out a guitar and it's like what's happening is a given even though her sister is using monsters to attack her and not any music.

(I will take Hollow-Oak's advice and actually say what I do not like).\n\nI bought this "game" on sale because I was curious about visual novels. I had heard about them and of course they are more or less mentioned quite often in anime and manga.  Now I know what a visual novel is, and it is what is says it is - a visual novel.  Basically a picture book that turns its own pages.  OK.  I can live with that.\n\nIn researching visuals novels I discovered many are interactive, and are simulation games, which is actually what I thought this was.  Visual novels though they fall in the catergory of simulation games are not since they lack any interaction by the "gamer".  OK.  I can live with that too.\n\nNOW about this story.  I found it VERY bizarre.   Here you go flamers and haters I equate this story to 'Rocky Horror Picture Show'.  Bizarre, off-beat, rather disjointed with at best a weak plot (?), if a musical instrument power up can be called a plot.  The story itself made little sense and I did watch it twice just to really try and give this story a fair chance.\n\nI also tried very hard to watch this supernatural girl-fest fiction with a very, very open mind.  Half of my mind says charming love story between two girls, and the other half screams OMG all the things to do if one wants to end up on a missing person's list and dead.  If the writers had really set up the romance better and laid it on thicker then oh say a gallon of jelly on a thin slice of bread I personally could have engaged in the story.  Love at first sight even, would have been better then this tripe.\n\nIn conclusion: I will also say the same thing I said about 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' after the first time I saw it.   Hmmm... well...I liked the music.  (And that was the only thing I liked.)","June 13, 2015","false","11.7"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","7","25","2","3"
