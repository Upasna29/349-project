The scenery looks cobbled together from cheap rubber and styrofoam. Enemies are either obviously stuntmen in suits or stop-motion effects. Many times, you can see the strings holding them up or the boom mic appearing in cutscenes. The plot is authentically nonsensical. Every facet of the aged Hollywood magic that made those films what they were is present, correct and jammed full of obscure references and Easter eggs; rarely has a game shown so much devotion and love to its subject matter.\n\nNot quite as endearing, however, is the commentary track that runs throughout the playtime. TDTOM is presented as a DVD re-release with the director and his production assistant firing out quips every thirty seconds or so and while it's been exhaustively written and is fairly humorous on occasion, there is just far too much of it. A lot of times, the two voices will be jabbering on, fully subtitled, while you're trying to hack your way through a major battle or set-piece so you wind up missing what they're saying by way of trying to concentrate on not getting crushed by a plasticine brontosaur.\n\nThere's a metric arseload of weapons to grab as you go, some far more useful than others, which can be upgraded with cogs that you find as you progress. Annoyingly, your loadout only allows for two ranged and two melee weapons at a time which wouldn't be a huge deal if the game didn't force you to find a terminal every time you wanted to change them. The worst part about this setup is that every time you pick up a new weapon, one of your current ones gets elbowed out of your inventory. Having fun with your ultra-powerful Tesla cannon? Not any more! Have this crappy flamethrower instead! Even better, have it while you're being literally SWARMED by waves of killer ants!\n\nThe character stat upgrade system is more pleasing and innovative. You're not rewarded with skill points by way of XP; rather, the game has you complete various objectives, many of which are completely optional. While you'll usually get one for killing a boss, taking down a giant dinosaur with a knife is all on you. It adds depth to a game that is, at times, lumbered with mechanics that sorely need it.\n\nStill, TDTOM has more than enough style and bare bones playability to be worth a try, especially for fans of the genre it inhabits. It's a forgivingly easy game; you can make it through without a good deal of the upgrades available but as a love letter to those creaky, weird and wonderful pictures that entranced me as a kid, you'll find none better.\n\nCheck out the first fifteen minutes below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OX-WFoqZTs","January 19","true","1.3"," 173 of 188 people (92%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","92","173","188","19","7"

The camera can be a bit wonky when using a keyboard and mouse, more so if you try and go somewhere the game never meant for you to go. The level desgin is amazing and leads to very solid platforming 99% of the time. The fact that you are almost constently moving up with no loading screens really gives you a sense of hight and then jumping off the tower to go get some hidden item really shows how much thought they put into the game and the titular tower.\n\nWhile the game is solid all around and fun the real place it shines is the love for B-movies. The sense of humor and the presentation are spot on. The VHS effects, the stop motion animation on enemies, the set pieces, all of it just works togeather. This is the video game you wanted as a kid, even if thats back when video games were pong. Yet you don't have to be old and or a fan of B-movies to enjoy the game and its off beat sense of humor. It's early in the year but this has already earned a place on my personal top games of the year list and if people have any sense it will make it on theirs as well.\n","January 19","true","8.8"," 73 of 78 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","73","78","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/353700/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Deadly Tower of Monsters is a third person perspective action game, set in a retro sci-fi film title. Releasing from ACE Team Studio, who are known for Zeno Clash and Abyss Odyssey.  The story is based on two astronauts and their robot friend.\n\nGame play is from the third person perspective above their heads. Firstly one of the game’s biggest flaws is the camera angle; it is in a set position on each frame, which means it can be very hard to look where you really want to especially when it comes to some of the puzzles. There are two sides to the gameplay mechanics; the platforming side, and the action side. The action parts of the game are your standard hack and slash style; with different weapons available throughout the game for you to use and upgrade using the game’s currency system.  There isn’t really anything standoutish about the combat system, other than it just works and does as it intends to do, as well as being easy to control and grasp. The platforming side of the game is one which I wasn’t keen on. It surely can’t just be me who is sick to death of jumping puzzle style. The camera angle of the game doesn’t help on the platforming at all. With the awkward camera angle makes any sort of jump you need to make, more of a guessing game.  Thankfully the platforming is few and far between, still a small gripe though!\n\nThe art style on show in Deadly Tower of Monsters is done in a cartoon, retro look. The camera filters which are also used throughout the game are to add to the effect that you are watching an old film, and it does it very well. It wasn’t my favourite aesthetic in the world; but I can appreciate the look and feel they were going for. The soundtrack and voice acting are all really spot on too. With the voice over and narration being a key feature for the game, adding plenty of comedic value and fourth and fifth wall breaking too.\n\nThis game is by no means easy; there aren’t any difficulty settings, so what you get is the same experience throughout. A lot of the game can be overpowered by simply grinding on monsters for more gold and “cogs” which are the games currency system for upgrading your skills, but a lot of the game will come down to how good the player is, rather than how powerful the character is. The end boss fights are a real challenge, and will require you to try and try and try before finally successfully conquering them.  Even some of the more regular monsters in between boss fights will cause concern amongst some.\n\nI finished the game in a little under six hours. There is a handful of side missions you can take part in, but none of them add anything to the story, nor reward you extra skills; purely just extra content. Some of them you run into whilst playing through the main story, whilst others you have to go out of your way for. For me I was quite happy completing the ones I found naturally, I had no real urge to go seeking them.  There isn’t any replay ability factor in Tower of Deadly Monsters; it’s a completely linear story line. The co-op mode may make a second run through viable with a friend, but you may as well just make your first run through co-op and save yourself the time.  There is a hard mode added, but that will be for a small group of people who’ll take that upon themselves to play.\n\nTechnically, I had no problems at all. The game runs very well even on 4K.  The frame rate did not drop below 60 at any points. I would recommend people playing this game use a controller, simply because it is easier to handle and you get the most out of the game play with a controller over a keyboard and mouse.\n\nTo sum up, The Deadly Tower of Monsters is your run of the mill OK game. The most redeeming factor about the title has got to be the narration and comedic value it brings. There are much better third person action shooting games out there, and there are much better platforming games available. What this game does bring to the table is an interesting, funny, and different storyline compared to most.  The game is priced at £10, 99 – a price I would be happy to pay again for this release. You are looking at a 6-10 hours’ worth of well-produced content.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

This game is probably about the closest that any of us can reasonably expect to come to such an experience...\n\n\nThe game is a basic isometric hack and slash adventure game. Action-wise it is not trying to reinvent the genre. However it is cast in a very inventive way: You are acting out the actions of the protagonists of a classic "B" movie being re-released on DVD while the director of the movie gives commentary about the film's production.\n\nThe presentation of the game is outstanding. It looks very much like an old sci-fi/horror flick from the 50's or 60's, complete with cheesy special effects such as visible strings holding flying creatures aloft.\n\n"The effects guys promised me the strings wouldn't be visible..."\n\nIn addition to the awesome graphical presentation the director of the film is constantly talking about the production whilst throwing off many off-color stories of his egomaniacal excesses and abuses of power. This commentary is absolutely hilarious at times. Best of all, the narrator reacts to the things that you do, especially when you do things that are off-script or if you take your time in an area.\n\nTo sum it up, the game is a hilarious sendup of the best of the worst of Hollywood and a fun action game at the same time. Highly recommended, especially to anyone old enough to have at least seen these types of movies on late night tv.","January 21","true","2.0"," 40 of 40 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","40","40","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazmire/recommended/353700/","hazmire","Hazmire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazmire/","165 products in account","This game is simply amazing. I am a massive fan of ACE Team. Their imaginative creations never cease to amaze. Yet again they have produced another winner, with a game that takes on a surrealistic approach to movies with amazing visuals and audio.\n\nFirstly may I say, that this game could be enjoyed simply for the voice acting and audio. The game basically revolves around you watching a director's cut of an old film, except you are obviously playing as the main character of the film, an astronaut who has crash landed on an alien planet. The Director will commentate on your surroundings, the story and pretty much everything else. For instance I started spinning around and he just started going on about how the main actor loved to spin in circles, it was even the reason they chose him during the role casting sessions! Even if you go afk he will start to say things like "At this point he forgot his lines and didn't know what to do". So yeah, if you like a laugh, buy this game right now!\n\nThe music and visuals are both equally great. The game should run fine on nearly all systems as it isn't too demanding, and is capped to 60fps. The visuals and audio can have one of two filters, either VHS or DVD. These obviously change the quality of both and add a different feel to the game. I highly suggest using VHS as this is how the devs intended the game to be played. The characters and enemies are all amazingly detailed, kingkong and dinosaurs are stop motion animated, giving them that nostalgic and authentic look and feel. Kingkong's hand when he grabs you is even on a stick! This game stays true to so many movie tropes it's unbelievable and equates to the funniest game I've had the pleasure of playing in a long time.\n\nGameplay itself is very solid, as I'm not a massive fan of top down games, torchlight etc... But this game gets it right. Behind the great visuals, audio, and "story" is a solid set of combat mechanics. You find new weapons, can upgrade them, and do powerful special abilities. Throw in the massive variety of enemies and you've got yourself a really fulfilling and satisfying game.\n\nMy only gripe with the game so far is the options menu. I think that some of the labels should be changed when using a keyboard, for instance to apply changes it just says press the "app" key. Turns out this is enter, which is pretty much common sense. But I think it should just say "enter". As I said, this is just a tiny flaw that if fixed up will make the game a classic.\n\nDo I suggest buying this? Yes! Go buy it now, you won't regret it. If you are a fan of ACE Team there's even more reason to buy it, help support these guys. They make really individual games that I wish other people took inspiration from. If you love movies, then yeah. You may wanna buy this simply for the near infinite references and elbow nudges to famous movies.","January 19","true","1.6"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","33","35","2","0"

The adventure, monsters, commentary, platforming, and so much more. This is a game you must experience. Especially if you watched those old movies where they special fx was made in clay. The game isn't even about the heroes of the game. It's more or less about the director of this "movie". As you play the game, You hear the director, hilariously, speak of how this movie was made. The director is what is making the game for me, amongst others.\n\nThe monsters: in the time that I have played, I have killed crabs, lizards, yetis, slime blobs, 3 different kind of dinosaurs, ufo's, king kong-type gorilla, and I'm sure I've missed more. But each of these monsters are unique in how they attack. So I love that aspect of it.\n\nThe Combat: It's amazing. Shoot, melee, special skills, and roll. The melee weapons and guns have been rolling in so far. I'm sure I still have much more to find. Only downside, You can only hold two of each at a time.\n\nFinal Summary: I would give them game a chance. But if you're a kid, I don't think you would understand the humor in the game. As it does use the movies of old as a reference.","January 19","true","7.5"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","30","31","2","3"

It is a comedy, but the comedy does not get in the way of the gameplay and actually improves on the experience. Secrets and collectables can improve the gameplay thourgh upgrades, but I found that I did not need to collect them all to finish the game.\n\nThis game encourages exploration but it has a streamlined sense of continual progression. This is what I would say is it's greatest strength. You can fall down the Deadly Tower to get bonuses or reach secret areas without losing any progress.\n\nIn fact... there are two mechanics which I say make this game flow perfectly, without which would have made The Deadly Tower of Monsters a frustrating mess otherwise:\n1) Checkpoints that, once you reach them for the first time, you can teleport to at any moment. This makes exploration breezy and also allows the player to have a sense of progression and sucess.\n2) An ability that allows you to teleport back to a platform you just fell from. This inclusion was pure genious. First, you can fall great hieghts to get items like rings and not have to backtrack. If you miss a landing (which you will do A LOT) you can try again immediately. If an enemy knocks you off a platform... it is no loss, simply teleport back into the fight!\n\nThese two gameplay elements, in my opinion, make this game wonderful.\n\nThere are some other points of note:\nPros:\n-Loading times are great. You can seemlessly fall down to a lower level without a loading screen. Teleporting up to a higher level happens in moments.\n-It runs very well. If you don't like the esthetic (choppy, like an old movie would be)... you can change that.\n-A large variety of enemies.\n-The hilarity of dying (the load *thump* and subsequent ragdolling, combined with the comentary, always gets me).\n-I would call the sound design great. The soundtrack in particular really captures the feel of an old 30's sci-fi b-movie like Flash Gordon.\n\nCons:\n-The upgrade system is a bit... janky... (gold is so abundant it does not factor into anything, for example. I forgot I had it).\n-The camera can be a bit wonky sometimes.\n-Some weapons are utterly useless (bye bye shiv). Others are very OP. (lasergun FTW!)\n-Movement in general can be frustrating at certain moments. Three of note are: Trying to land on a small platform using the jetpack, using sprint on conveyor belts, one or two sections where the camrea angle makes platforming a nightmare.\n\nOverall I enjoyed The Deadly Tower of Monsters very, very much! Probably one of ACE Team's best games yet, if not their best game yet.","January 20","true","6.9"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/recommended/353700/","sashadarko","Sasha Darko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/","1062 products in account","Status: Completed\n\nPresentation\n\nThe game has its own unique style and every single texture is a perfect fit, the models are well made and animated. Unreal Engine 4 physics-based shaders and lightning really make everything look amazing.\nThe animations of enemies is not something you see in other games, it imitates stop-motion animation from the old monster movies. They're done really great and it's always fun to watch them every time.\nThe game is meant to be played with the VHS filter and I highly recommend to do so. After all, just like the game says, that clean DVD mode is for robots.\n\nMusic / Sound\n\nReally memorable and atmospheric tunes. Some of them sound like a 50s b-movie of some sort, some of the cheery tracks reminded me of 90s JRPGs. I'd really like to have a soundtrack for this game, too bad it's not available.\nVoice actors completely succeeded in what they needed to do, and robot voice is my favourite one, too bad he has just a few lines. The director is the main voice you hear in the game and he takes the cake, making you believe it's all just a DVD commentary.\n\nStory\n\nIt breaks the 4th wall right from the beginning. You play as an actor in a typical 50/60s b-movie (and later as a group of three actors, but always controlling one of them) and your mission is to defeat super-mega-evil Emperor and his super-genius evil genius sidekick. Every enemy is not really an enemy but an actor in a suit (most of which work for mere cents).\nMost lines were not really funny for me, but they has their own charm and just pleasant to listen. It's more like The Stanley Parable, it has the story told in a quirky way, not necessarily a slapstick comedy or something like that.\n\nGameplay\n\nTechnically, it's a modern beat'em'up / action game. It has a lock-on system (if you're playing with the controller), which chooses the closest enemy automatically. It not always works the way you want (causing some frustration at times), but you'll get used to it. The camera is fixed and you can move it only slightly. You start with a weak gun and a stick, but you're getting more and more weapons on your way up, which you can also upgrade (by finding cogs and picking up gold after fallen enemies / broken objects).\nJust like the title of the game suggests, you're climbing up the tower. And it's a one huuuuge tower. So huge that it goes up into space. You unlock checkpoints on your way up and you can teleport between these checkpoints anytime (except when you fight someone). It's 100% seamless and whole location makes it feel like an open world game.\nYou can jump from the tower whenever you want, to land on some particular part of it, to get back to the surface or just dive through special rings (needed to get a couple of skill points). Jumping down from the tower looks and sounds astonishing, it even has its own beautiful dreamy soundtrack and you shoot while diving. It feels much like the opening of MDK (1998), but here it's not scripted. You can jump whenever you want and if you want to reach the surface, you can do so, without teleporting and in a most effective and beautiful way.\nYou can choose between three main characters (once you unlock them all), but the changes are mostly cosmetic. They have their own unique abilities though, but you won't need them most of the time.\n\nTechnical\n\nI had experienced a couple of bugs during my walkthrough. One time I stuck in the object and couldn't do anything while fighting the enemies (cost me about 75% of health bar or so), another time the game didn't unlock the exit and just froze on the infinite animation loop when I opened the teleport menu. It forced me to close the game through Process Manager.\nBut it surely is really well optimized and framerate was always high and stable no matter what happened on the screen.\n\nOverall, it's a must-have game for anyone remotely interested in b-movies or unusual games overall. Even if you're not, it's still a very enjoyable beat'em'up game.\n\nReview copy provided by publisher\n\nSasha Darko for Game Obscura","February 19","true","5.6"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","0"

(You're controlling the leads of the movie.)\nIt's very campy sci-fi. You can see strings on the spaceships, the monsters are designed to look like they're classic practical effects, from dudes in rubber masks to claymation monsters.

The voice acting/narration/commentary is well acted and very entertaining. The gameplay is solid though not noteworthy. The story line is original and funny while staying interesting enough to keep me invested for the full 10 hour playthough (some of which was wandering, looking for secrets, working on achievements, etc..). However even with all the dicking around the game was still longer than expected for the pricetag.\n\nThe game does a fantastic job of offering up a comical homage to the b-movies of old. Enemies on strings, stop motion enemies, someones nephew in a suit...it's got all the clichés. The final act was a nice touch but I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers.\n\nI hit a couple glitches during the game that prevented acess to the next section after defeating the enemies causing me to have to go back to the last checkpoint and rerun the section. But these were very few and far between and the checkpoints are frequent so it didn't damper the experience.\n\nI picked this title up on sale for just under $10 but even at full price the game is worth the money.","January 20","true","7.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

Frankly I was very impressed by that. The writing is great and the voice acting by the director just makes it all the more better.\n\nGameplay wise it is a top down thing, you can carry 2 ranged and 2 melee weapons plus there's character specific abilities. If you fall unexpectedly you can always teleport back to the point where you dropped from. Same applies if you fail to land where you wanted to, you can just hit "C" and try the jump again.\n\nGiven its low price I'd say buy it even if there's no sale, it's that enjoyable.","January 30","true","2.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

This one is a great platformer, disguised as an old directors cut B-movie, with the director narrating the happenings in a similar way to bastion, but with less focus on the actual character and more on how they did this scene or made that prop.\n\nThe game itself is more or less one huge level - the tower. And it's grand. It's rare to see a game so vertically inspired as this, and the developers make good use of it. Secrets frequently require you to drop down on them, or shoot them from above, and you have the ability to teleport from the air (or the ground briefly after landing) back to where you jumped from, so if you miss what you were aiming for or just feel like skydiving, it's null sweat. The view itself is phenominal once you start jumping from high up.\n\nThe graphics themselves are neat, but the art style itself is of course very different. Often enemies are clearly just people in suits, or are stop-motion animated. I personally find this amusing and interesting, but I know people who dislike it. The music fits the game well enough, and is similar to the music used in their other games, but if I'm being honest I can't really think of any of the tunes off the top of my head, so I can't say it's too memorable, maybe that will change as I play.\n\nLook, all you really want is a recommendation, right? I say yes, wholeheartedly and unreservedly, and follow that up by saying you should also go and buy every other game ACE team has ever made, because they are all amazing. They get a strange concept that most probably wouldn't recognize the potential of, and make it work gloriously. I think I've said this before, but at this point every ACE game that comes out is an instabuy for me.","January 24","true","4.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

The game is enjoyable and worth the play through. I love the mix of beat em up/hack and slash with a mix of platforming. For some strange reason i kept feeling like the game was a bit inspired by Super Mario Galaxy, guess thats just me. Anyway, the whole game takes place on a island, which is a planet and you'll start at the base of the island/planet working your way up to the top of the tower, which reaches the planets atmosphere.\n\nso far i enjoyed the game and for its price theres virtually nothing i can actually complain about. i played with the steam controller and from what i see, it seems that mouse and keyboard players may get a bigger enjoyment from this game. anyway, game worth buying and i enjoyed it while it lasted. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoy platforming and beat em ups. The game has a sense of nostalgia to it, from en era where game developers experimented with new forms of gameplay or even original IPS.\n\nI forget to mention that this game spoofs 1960's and as a scifi fan film dude ranging from the 60's to the 90s, this is a instant love. The game even samples the stop motion claymation animation that was known by ray harryhausen. some of the enemies will have that stop motion jerky effect. its funny and enjoyable to see personally.\n\nGame is worth owning and playing. I enjoyed every bit of it. hopefully a sequel will be more deeper in the combat and item department.\n","May 21","true","10.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Some of them can be still fun for the few minutes, but most of the time you are left with a feeling of paying for a silly meme and not for a game.\n\nThis is not the case with The Deadly Tower of Monsters, which is a class A-funny level comedy game, which is also very well made. You can see that a lot of love and effort was spent on the game. The game is FULL of small little touches that make you chuckle or even ROFL constantly.\n\nGraphics and animations are great and build up the B-atmosphere without being B-quality themselves, but portraiting the B-quality of the "movie" in-game nicely. Music is full of very nice retro-movie melodies, catchy ones with some nice B-epic parts in them. Voice acting is top-notch, way better than I expected from a $10 game, and there is a lot of that too. "♥♥♥♥ Missile penetrating deep into a black hole and then going to Uranus"  might sound childish and gross when written like this, but when you are shooting missiles ingame and they start to talk about that casually all of sudden gets your keyboard covered with whatever you were drinking.\n\nIts a semi-metroidvania openworld game, full of small secrets, plenty of different weapons and enemies. Lots of collective items that are fun to look for (one of the only games from my 300+ steam library which i bothered to 100%), and very innovative level design gimmick in the shape of the HUUUUUUGE tower which is all seamless.\n\nOnly bad thing I can say about the game is, that its far too easy. You have 20+ weapons in the game, but the enemies are such cannon fodder that you can kill every one of them with the first gun you get in the game... Well, even if the enemies dont give you much of a threat, finding all the secrets from the world gives you enough challenge to make the game feel rewarding in the challenge aspect too.\n\nVery much worth it, and even for the full price of $10 the game is a steal.","March 8","true","12.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

The dialog is very good and the humor is very topical while being self-aware. The visuals (and this is where ACE Team truly shines) are beyond amazing. I have never seen so much effort go into anything to make it look authentically cheap.\n\nThere's a tiny segment of black and white that is more or less blink and it's gone. I really liked that bit, and the dialog establishes that parts of the “film” were shot in black and white. Sadly, that was the only time it's seen.  As such, it feels less like part of a the game and more like an abandoned idea that the devs forgot to fully remove. Perhaps it can return as a video filter option much like “VHS” is?\n\nAlso, what you are expected to do at the end isn't really clear. I figured it out, but believed what I did was the wrong thing to have tried. I spent time trying to figure out a mistake that wasn't. You just have to do the thing until it works, which will not on the first couple of tries.\n\nThe worst thing I can actually say is that controls are often sloppy. For a game with tons of platforming, this can be horrifying. Yes, there is mid-air teleportation, but that doesn't stop some sequences from being white knuckle and frustrating, especially towards the end.\n\nI hate to say, but I've totally completed this game. I reached the end somewhere around the 5 hour mark. I spent the remaining time hunting for all of the achievements and extras (and sometimes just free falling for the hell of it). I now have 100% achievements and I'm waiting for any hint of DLC.\n\nBuy the game already.","January 31","true","12.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Gameplay is solid and a good mix of many mechanics I wouldn't thought would fit together in a top-down hack'n'slash game like that.\n\nThe story is hiarious, making you play the game like you were watching an audio commentary of the movie made by the director, it's an idea so refreshing, it's like the Bastion narrator but instead of being all serious and badass, it thinks out loud for you about alot of funny things happening on-screen.\n\nGraphics are superb, and the animation and audio is filled with little things movie lovers will laugh out loud at, for example the enemy lizardmen replace their head when they are not fighting, we know it's a suit but it adds so much to the cheesyness it's just perfect.\n\nIt's a solid game, definitely going to finish it later in the week and I hope more people will buy it, otherwise it's gonna be one of those underrated gems from 2016 that like 10 people played.\n\nI was ABOUT to finish the review with a faire score based on several points, both positive and negative, but I just pushed an ape-man down the tower and heard the Wilhelm Scream...\n\n10 out of 10.","January 20","true","2.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Even though I was sold on the premise alone, the amazing thing is that the game actually delivers even more than I could have hoped. Old sci-fi B-movies aren't just the gimmicky premise of this game, everything about the game ties into that premise. The enemies are either stop-motion dinosaurs or actors in rubber suits or puppets being dangled by wires. There is a blurry video effect that makes the game look like it's actually an old VHS tape. To skip a cut scene you hold the A button and the scene fast forwards like a videotape, complete with scan lines and sped-up audio. The "narrator" of the game is actually the director of the movie that you are supposedly watching, who is doing a commentary track for the DVD release of his crappy old movie. And suffice it to say that this game isn't just a one-trick pony, it continues to deliver on its premise throughout the 8 or so hours, with an excellent payoff in the last act.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is a decent action platformer. There are plenty of ranged and melee weapons that can be upgraded with collectible gears that you find throughout the world. I found the lack of information about the weapons (like damage and speed) annoying at first, but eventually I realized that it really doesn't matter that much, just choose the weapons that suit your playstyle and upgrade them. The combat can be moderately challenging from time to time, but nothing unfair or frustrating. There are a few boss fights that are clever enough and have a reasonable level of difficulty.\n\nAll in all, this is a great package. Some games based on a gimmick end up being more clever than they are fun. You might stick with them because the art direction is great or the writing is good, but the gameplay really doesn't stack up. The Deadly Tower of Monsters isn't that kind of game. The gameplay is fun and deep enough to keep you engaged, and the gimmick is so thoroughly and smartly explored that it's always a pleasure.","February 21","true","7.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The narrator is a great touch, breaking the fourth wall and basically talking jive the entire game.  The action is basic but the presentation makes up for it kind of like the deadpool game.  Would definately reccomend and its kind of a trip after a smoke.","January 20","true","1.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

I cant overstate how the music is beyond fantastic for this game.  I get a huge kick out of all the old school sci-fi cliche's and nonsense as well ♥♥♥ this old timey hollywood stuff.  The gameplay isnt anything spectacular but works for the game and theres something extremely titilating playing as a woman in tight crimson spandex weilding thors hammer or a 1960's robot weilding a glowing knife against evil apes.  The level desgin is dense and well utilized hiding with many hidden secrets ala metroidvania.  Lastly its super super fun to jump off the tower and free fall for days then you can teleport back to where you lept off.  I'm tempted to lable this game as style over substance but its not exactly lacking substance in any area, overall good title definately worth the sticker price.\n\nJust finished the game and I would like to add\nI was(at the end) a space babe weilding a frog and a grape flavored lightsaber 10/10 would disappoint father again.","March 29","true","5.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Most gags rely on precise, directed timing, and taking control away from a player in an interactive medium usually results in a bad game, frustration, and few laughs in the process. Through clever narration, smart satire, and an unflinching 100% commitment to it's jokes, The Deadly Tower of Monsters plastered a perma-grin across my face for my entire playtime. It's an entertaining, creative hack n' slash puzzle/platformer to boot.\n\nYour ultimate goal in The Deadly Tower of Monsters is to climb the deadly tower of monsters. Standing underneath the imposing structure and looking skyward (or taking a peek at the map) gives the deflating feeling that you're in for a near impossible test of will and patience. Once you take a few steps toward that journey, however, it becomes clear that many design decisions are in place to keep player convenience at the forefront. Fall off a ledge? Press “LB” and you're right back to solid ground, no penalty incurred. Getting lost? Pull up the map and you can warp to any point in the tower you've previously visited at will. (Protip: go up.) This isn't some hardcore, griefing, reflex litmus test. That wouldn't be funny. You're encouraged to fall, explore, and generally just have a good time in the campy sandbox, and you should take the game up on that offer.\n\nOn the base level the game reminds me of console-centric action/RPGs like Marvel: Ultimate Alliance or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. From an overhead view you have a standard melee attack which can be charged for a heavy attack, and a ranged weapon. As you progress you gain access to about a dozen different kinds of both types of weapons, and these can be upgraded by collecting components dropped by enemies or scattered around the environments. There are also perks like max HP increases, regenerating health, improved melee/ranged damage, etc. that can be earned by completing missions (main quests or side activities). You can swap between three different characters that have some unique skills needed to access certain areas, so there's also a bit of Metroidvania going on here.  Other options include the ability to parry attacks, extend your jumps with a jetpack, and shoot downward when near a ledge (that one good feature of Dark Void). It all adds up to a surprising amount of depth in a fairly short, decidedly goofy comedy game.\n\nEven the title screen of The Deadly Tower of Monsters is full of jokes. Upon booting the game, you're immediately greeted by a narrator who is “in studio” to record a commentary track for a truly awful Sci-Fi B-movie he made some years back, and he's going to be cringe-worthingly candid and let it be know just how much of scumbag he is. You're greeted at the start with a fairly typical though beautiful movie poster of the movie, where a 50's Hollywood space man is cradling an attractive, unconscious woman. The director remarks how proud he is of the poster. Boot the game up a second time, and the gender roles are swapped, with the woman rescuing the man. “I didn't approve of this change”, the director protests. His assistant chimes in to inform him that the studio execs shot an alternate take, foreseeing a future demographic where swapping the sexes would appeal to the masses. That's some pretty poignant and ♥♥♥♥ing funny social commentary. Not content to stop there, an alternate title screen shows a robot holding the man instead... for the future robot demographic.\n\nI debated whether or not to spoil the above gag, but the riffs are just so nonstop throughout the game that it's a small drop in a large pond of punchlines. You're controlling the “movie”, the perfectly voiced director is giving behind-the-scenes anecdotes nearly the entire time in rapid fire fashion akin to the densest, snappiest of MST3K episodes. This is more than fitting since the movie in question would feel right at home in a crappy Mystery Science Theater show: dinosaurs are convincingly stop motion animated, bats are held aloft by visible strings, nothing is shown that couldn't be created with practical effects from that era which usually means men in rubber suits. There's even more than a few cameos from (in)famous(ly bad) real movie monsters. Every environment and creature is lovingly crafted from people who are clearly fans of the genre, and the affection for the movies we love and love to make fun of is sincere and hilarious.\n\nI'm not usually a fan of “meta” comedy, but The Deadly Tower of Monsters is so out there it absolutely worked for me on every level. The DVD commentary presentation is excellent, and it breaks the fourth (and sometimes fifth) wall with such reckless abandon you just have to laugh. From a pure game perspective it's completely solid with enough fresh ideas to be enjoyable on it's own, but smiling and giggling like an idiot while playing elevates it to a must play game. It's one of the best surprises I've encountered in a long time.","January 29","true","5.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The art style, the narrator's comments, the music - everything just in the right proportions. The game is a bit short, though.\n\nBesides unique art style it also have unique characters progress system for an RPG game. You can go and kill as many monsters as you wish, but you only get gold coins in return. If you wish to level up you have to do the achievemtns. Well, the level doesn't matter much, though, so you can finish the game with a very low-level character. Well, it's less about an RPG and more about old sci-fi movies anyway, so it looks fine and, actually, feels more natural this way.","January 25","true","8.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I did this game in one sitting and honestly it was great fun, the interactions between the narrator and the characters actions can be quite funny at times. This said however there isnt much to do after completion, sure you can collect the missions which are basically achievements but even that wasnt something to keep me wanting to play more on an finished save. I think maybe some dlc would be fun, like a new area to extend the tower or perhaps go lower. Anyways as far as combat goes it does vary. Different probs such as gun and melee weapons are unlocked as you go but some arent really worth using. For example the first weapon you get in the game i stuck with because it was fast and did damage, i only ever swapped it when i got the lightsaber as it allowed me to do the same thing but with stun every so often and reflecting bullets. Idk maybe a small thing that is wrong with the game and it didnt push me enough to hate the game but i wish the weapons were more balance i guess. So overall the game is great, has and interesting and creative story along with some blast from the past. This game is great for the price of 7.25 but maybe not so much if it was any higher as of how quickly i completed it. Will i go back and play it? sure maybe in a couple of days, heck id even love to speed run it.

The director is providing audio commentary throughout, often hilarious, reminding me of Cave Johnson from Portal 2.\n\nAll enemies and setpieces are true to the B-movie style: Slow moving stop-motion monsters and people clearly in costumes, sometimes with strings visible. Many different monster types keep the game fresh over its arguably short running time (5 hours, which would be quite long for a movie). However, the game does not outstay it's welcome and I personally like shorter games that don't need to pad their running time out and drag on.\n\nTo summarize: the combat is satisfying, the artstyle is vibrant and pretty, the music is awesome, the voice acting really adds to it, and the game's just fun.","February 6","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/recommended/353700/","Allahweh","Allahweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/","299 products in account","A copy of the game was provided by Atlus’s PR team, but this does not affect the game’s review!\n\nWhen I first heard about this game, I wasn’t quite sure what to think. It was advertised as a video game version of a B-level sci-fi horror from days gone by (in this case, in the 1970s), and normally that wouldn’t quite be the selling point for a game. It sounds strange, and the funny thing is, after having actually played the game for a good while now, I can’t say that it’s any less strange. If nothing else, I’d say it’s more strange! But that’s not really a bad thing though, and if you bear with me, you’ll see how all of this just…works!\n\nThe Deadly Tower of Monsters comes to us from Chilean developer ACE Team, who you might know for the Zeno Clash series of games. The premise is that fictional director Dan Smith is coming into the studio to record the director’s commentary track for a bygone sci-fi romp he filmed some many years ago called “The Deadly Tower of Monsters.” We, the player, are actually taking the role of the characters from that sci-fi movie while he provides narrations and strange insights all throughout. So, it’s a game about a movie…sort of…And in this game we begin as ♥♥♥♥ Starspeed, an astronaut/explorer played by “a middle-aged nobody,” who ends up getting shot down over the planet Gravoria. No real explanation is given to why ♥♥♥♥ is flying over this planet or what he was doing in that portion of space (a fact that the sound guy recording the director’s commentary points out more than once), but Dan Smith tells us not to question things or “it all sort of falls apart.” Good advice, really, for a lot of movies from that era.\n\nOnce on the planet, we meet up with a woman named Scarlet Nova, the daughter of the planet’s emperor, and we get drawn into a crazy plot to destroy all manner of terrible creatures and ascend a massive tower to confront the emperor and end his plans. Along the way, ♥♥♥♥, Scarlet, and Robot battle dinosaurs, ape-men, lizard people, and all sorts of other trope-like characters, as well as some well-familiar (but for copyright reasons slightly distinct) monsters of other films. What might they be? Well, let’s just say that one of them bears a resemblance to a certain giant ape from a mystical island. Yeah, that one.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Deadly Towers reminds me a lot of the Zelda series, with a bit of Metroid and some Super Mario platforming mixed in for good measure. As you explore the tower and the islands surrounding it, you pick up different types of weapons for your characters and also gain equipment that will enhance them in many ways. Each character also comes with and can acquire skills that are very important to progressing the game. ♥♥♥♥ will eventually gain the ability to use landmines, and they are necessary to take down large barricades that impede both your forward progress as well as block some treasures you’ll definitely want to go back for. The Robot possesses the ability to slow down time, which is needed to get through things like giant fans and other traps that the two human heroes won’t be able to get past. In this way, the game is not entirely linear, because even though you can progress from A to B in a lot of instances, there will be many times you’ll either need to or want to return to previous locations with new skills in order to pick up things that you missed.\n\nThe game also has the ability to level up your characters as well as enhance the different weapons they collect. The enhancement system requires the use of different types of Cogs found throughout the game world, and while a few you will get by killing enemies, others (the silver and gold ones) will need to be obtained through exploration and using skills you get. I personally found that upgrading the gear wasn’t a necessity for a lot of the stuff, but it certainly can make things easier if your gear is in better shape at least.\n\nGraphically, the game is actually really good. The visuals are crisp and clear, the lighting and shadow effects are all really good, and I love the movie-set aesthetics that you encounter throughout the experience. The game recommends using a VHS type of film filter for the game itself, but naturally if you really want to (not recommended by ACE Team, of course!), you can turn that off and just enjoy the standard high-definition visuals we are used to. The sound is much the same way, actually. You can apply either a VHS (mono) or DVD (stereo) sound filter to the game, and no matter what you do, I noticed some little audio pops and glitches and things of that nature that really make you feel like you’re watching a movie rather than playing a game.\n\nSound-wise, though, the one gripe I had is that no matter what balance I chose for the volume levels, the in-game music and dialogue was always much louder than the director’s commentary. For some reason, that was just recorded very softly in some places, and it’s too bad because it’s one of the real gems in this game. Still, subtitles are provided for you, so it’s not the worst thing in the world either.\n\nWhile overall this game is just a blast to play, I think one of the best parts of the experience is the directorial commentary by Dan Smith. It’s really spot on and points out all these obvious flubs and cheesy things about the movie from the modern perspective that are pretty much the same types of things I notice when I go back and watch movies like this. He jokes about the strings that you can see on space ships and flying dinosaurs, the fact that the “rock barricades” were actually inflatables that never had explosion effects added during post-production, and in one particularly funny scene where he goes on about lens flair, he mentions that he kept touching the camera lens and that’s why you can see his fingerprints all over the camera in that area. It’s just hilarious.\n\nThe game is of a decent length for this type of experience, and there’s quite a bit of replay factor involved too. Given that non-blue Cogs are finite and hidden throughout the islands and tower, there’s a very high chance you’ll miss a lot of them if you hurry through your playthrough of the game. Also, like most good Steam games, this one comes packed with several different achievements that you’ll want to work on. And, in this case, it’s not just Steam achievements but they also come in the guise of “missions” that you can complete within the game itself.\n\nThis is a game that I’d like to come back to sometime soon and record a strong gameplay sampling for you all to enjoy. I think it’s a great game that can appeal to a wide variety of players. It’s not overly easy, though: while the game starts out simple enough and teaches you all the tricks of the trade (learning to aim downwards to kill enemies below, or hover with your jetpack, or to do a mid-air teleportation), but these things all take time to master. There are plenty of save points throughout, and you will have the ability to teleport between them, so backtracking is at least easier. The game is forgiving, though, because even if you lose to a boss you won’t have to go back too far to get back there and nothing plays in any sort of unfair mechanic.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the game does not seem to support ultra-wide resolutions (as you can see in the screenshots), and there are a few minor bugs along the way as well. There were times when I reached places I don’t think I was meant to go and had a very difficult time getting out of them outside of just teleporting away. That said, the engine holds up very well with strong performance even at the highest graphical quality.\n\nOverall, on a scale from 0 to 10, with a 5 representing a true “average,” this game gets a rating of:\n\n---------------------------------\nVERY GOOD...... 8.5 / 10\n---------------------------------","January 26","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've not seen many period sci-fi films, but even if you don't have a great understanding of them, some of the cliches in the may game cater to you. The nuclear ants, the wires holding things up, the spacesuits with the bubble helmets etc.\n\nI was a bit skeptical at the low price and small download size ( a little over 1gb), but the novelty value makes it more than worth it.

Merely making this cult classic available in a modern format would be enough to secure a recommendation, but the commentary by director Dan Smith gives an incredible insight into what went on behind the scenes that made this movie the so bad it’s good classic that we all know and have come to love. I also must compliment the audio engineer who was working Mr. Smith in recording the commentary. While it’s a bit unusual to include someone who was not involved in the making of the film in the commentary (especially with the omission of the original actors, such as the lovely Stacy Sharp), his contributions and conversations with  Smith make the commentary even richer with details. I won’t spoil anything, but he even managed to dig up a huge collection of previously unseen footage, including many, many, deleted scenes, as well as a previously unreleased extended ending to the film. You will not regret adding this DVD to your collection!","January 24","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you grew up, as I did, loving the old Sci-Fi movies on Saturday afternoon television, then you'll probably really enjoy this game.  It's somewhat hard to explain the overall feel of the game, it's a limited world platformer with none of the annoying multiplayer garbage most modern games have.  During your gameplay the Director's Commentary can be a bit annoying in my opinion, but the overall feel comes off a little like MST3K.  It's a fun game, not terribly expensive, beautifully rendered.  The action is fluid, but very true to the style.  I have a bad habit of getting up and walking away while playing this in between checkpoints so I am only a short ways into Act 2.

I found myself searching every part of the game, looking for hoops or gears or anything I could possibly have missed. The only issue I had with the game was how short it was.

You play as three different heroes, all with mildly varying powers, and you can use and upgrade a variety of melee and ranged weapons, most of which are bad.\n\nSo, the presentation is rather nice, with the audio commentary from the "director" of the game talking about how he "filmed" the "movie," and some random audio engineer that makes comments for whatever reason. The commentary, which extends throughout the game, is entertaining enough, and it makes plenty of references to old and new filmmaking. The visual style of the game adds to the presentation as well with "stop-motion" enemies that move at lower frame rates and wacky enemy designs.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game?\n\nWell, for one, I beat this game first try in 2 hours and 45 minutes approximately. Now, even for a 15 dollar game, that is fairly short. But length isn't all that matters, right? Well, that isn't the only problem I had with it.\n\nThe soundtrack for the game is alright, but I can only remember two main songs that got repetitive after some time. There is the main combat and adventure music, and the jarring music change that plays every single time you enter freefall. And you will hear those songs for the entirety of this short game, except when the music seemingly breaks or perhaps just randomly stops playing for whatever reason, which makes the game really uncomfortably silent.\n\nThe game also randomly crashed near the end for some reason.\n\nGraphically, this game is not bad. It is colorful, varied, and presents itself well even though the texture quality isn't particularly impressive. The animations can leave a bit to be desired at times, but it is alright.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay. One of the primary things this game sells itself on is the freefall mechanic. In short, it is really bad. You can jump off ledges and move around slightly and then instantly teleport back to where you just jumped off like it never even happened. It just feels so disconnected from the rest of the game. The only real advantage to it is to fall through rings for skill points and achievements. Otherwise, it serves little purpose whatsoever. Even in the boss fights, at the very end of some of the bossfights, the boss falls down and you get to shoot the boss a whole bunch, but it doesn't even seem to really do anything at all. I wouldn't be surprised if not shooting the boss had the same outcome as shooting them. I honestly can't say anything more about it because there really isn't anything else to it. Freefalling feels like a slapped on mechanic, and I would have much preferred if the game didn't pretend like it actually matters at all.\n\nAnother "mechanic" of the game, if you can even call it that, is that you can shoot down the tower. I don't mean shoot the tower down, but rather you can look over the edge and shoot at enemies that are coming up the tower. The game will alert you when enemies are climbing/flying up the sides, and you can look over the edge and click them a whole bunch. Also, you can shoot targets and if you shoot enough you get a skill point. That is literally all there is to the "mechanic." It feels so disconnected from the rest of the game that I honestly can't see why it is even in the game.\n\nSo now that the whole "looking down and clicking things a whole bunch" mechanics have turned out to be boring, repetitive, and disconnected from the rest of the game, you are left with a more basic action adventure platformer game. So, how does that fair? In short, not much better.\n\nTo start off, you have two weapon types, ranged and melee. You can carry four weapons, two of each type, and you can collect and upgrade the different weapons throughout the game.  The different weapons have different advantages and disadvantages that you must learn to utilize in order to fight the varied enemy types.\n\nActually, scratch that last sentence because it is a big fat lie.\n\nSo, you can use different cogs you find throughout the game to upgrade your weapons. But some of the weapons are so ridiculously strong that I cannot possibly imagine why you would use any of the other weapons. The mace/hammer weapon allows you to annihilate everything in your path with jump attacks. It can hit enemies twice, and when you land, its shockwave hits multiple enemies at once. Pair that with the fact that it does a ridiculous amount of damage even to single enemies that I am pretty sure it is more versatile than any pair of weapons in the game. The game quickly devolved into jump attack, jump attack, jump attack, win. It even works well against bosses, so every time I picked up a weapon I would switch to my other junk weapon so I wouldn't lose my hammer when the game forcefully changes my weapons. Then I would continue jump attacking to victory for most of the game.\n\nThe ranged weapons are in a similar boat. There is one lightning gun that does so much single target damage that it instantly kills even many medium strength enemies in one shot at range, and at the very least two shots them. There is also an energy mechanic where if you shoot too fast, your energy runs out and you have to wait to use your gun again, but the lightning gun doesn't even use too much energy for the insane amount of damage it does and it upgrades to max very quickly. The worst part is that the weapon can hit multiple densely packed enemies at once so I never felt hard pressed to switch to a faster weapon to kill weaker mobs because I could kill two to three at once anyway. The ranged weapons are less terrible than the melee weapons, with the machinegun, rocket launcher, and a couple others being okay but the lightning gun is just so good I had no reason to ever use my secondaries.\n\nEach character has powers that I can barely even comment on because I never felt the need to use them except when the game forces you to use them to open up a gate or move past an obstacle. The only one of note is at the last chapter of the game and lets you instantly kill any enemy that is being held up by strings, and it recharges very quickly. Surely, we needed more enemy types to become completely trivialized.\n\n"What about the enemy designs?" What about them? Thematically they are varied with apes that throw feces and robot samurai and dinosaurs and so on, but most can be summed up as: Small mob creature that dies instantly, medium strength melee guy, medium strength ranged guy, big slow guy. Oh, and the "enemy that flies up the tower and you click a whole bunch as it dies helplessly" enemy type. Again, the "shooting down the tower" mechanic is so disconnected that those enemies are hardly worth mentioning. The hammer and lightning gun make short work of all of the main enemy types anyway.\n\nThe platforming is extremely basic. You can jump, and you have a jetpack that allows you to hover for a short period of time while also preventing fall damage. Basically, its not a selling point either.\n\nAnd the bosses, along with the rest of the game, are laughably easy. The last "boss," if you can even call it that, is basically one last middle finger to the player as it is the easiest of them all.\n\nAll in all, unless the presentation just seems that appealing to you and the game is on sale, I wouldn't recommend it. I even got it for 10 bucks and I still wouldn't recommend it.\n\nEDIT: I completely forgot there even was a dodge roll mechanic until I looked at the achievements because it was so insignificant.","January 30","false","2.9"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

When I first saw this title on the sales list I thought this game could be fun. Man did I ever make a great choice. This game is a freakin blast. The graphics are in the style of an old time movie so it has that grainy feel but it doesnt effects the textures, water effects or colors. The water effects are ecspecially good. The music is nice, I wasn't blown away with it but it does give it an old action movie theme. Speaking of listening the commentary is awesome, just the things he says about the production of the movie is priceless. The director commentating this game is an excellent choice. Gameplay is arguable what makes or breaks a game and the gameplay for this game doesnt break it but it isnt mind blowing either. I did have some diffuclty at some points in the game (mostly the gorilla fight) but I think that was more the camera angle then anything. Do not get me wrong its nice and fluid but it hard to master at first, I was halfway through the game before I got the hang of the crontrols.  The enemy variety is nice too, from ape with blunt clubs all the way to alligator wizards with pitchforks hanging by strings and with everything in between. I could make a list on the different enemies but I won't you will just have to see them for yourself, but I will say this, some enemies have this clay motion visual style to thier movements and it works out so well that I wish more games took advantage of it.  The story itself is a linear one as to be expected, three heroes climb a tower and to take down the villian to save the innocent populious below. At the end of the day would I recomend this game, yes, yes I would. Even if its not on sale you should buy it, you will not be dissapointed and you wil get you money worth. The game is short, it took me six hours to 100% the game but trust me its worth it. My final verdict is 8/10, its a fantastic game but the controls at some point mix with the camera angle its can get diffucult but even with that added challange you can stil enjoy the game and the commentary.\n\n","March 26","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the aesthetic and all of the little details thrown in show that this game was made with an incredible amount of love and effort on the part of the developers.  From the constant commentary of a narrator that rivals Baston's, to the enemies that consist of men in costumes and dinosaurs moving a half speed, this game is a feast and a riot for fans of bad 60's and 70's sci-fi movies.\n\nIf you've ever laughed at a sci-fi movie on MST3K, then do yourself a favor and play this game.  It's not terribly long or difficult, but you won't regret it.  A perfect game to play and beat on a lazy weekend.","March 19","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me 8 hours to beat with around 80% of the secrets discovered wich is fairly short but I had a blast playing it. The game is hilarious and is like watching a cheesy 1960s si-fi inspired lengthy movie in which the director explains the scenes as you go along. I would recommend watching a video review to see if you will enjoy the style of comedy as i hear the narrator/ director is not everyones cup of tea, but i thought he was great.\n\nIt is a top down arpg with platforming and an amazing verticle tower lvl design that is very unique. you can also skydive off of anypoint on the tower and survive the landing with your jetpack and it gives a great sense of scale to the whole tower. the game is just a lighthearted good time and i highly reccomend it for all ages especially with the 4 player LOCAL co-op that just got implemented.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/353700/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: An action platformer-adventure that's also a playable B-movie.  If you're a fan of both, this is the game for you.  Otherwise, read the review.\n\nThe Deadly Tower Of Monsters core idea is this - you're playing an action platformer set in a b-movie.  The game however is presented as if you're watching a comentary track (complete with outtakes) on a DVD release of this nonexistent film.  So you don't just play out the story and the action - as you do so, the director and the recording assistant make comentary, review the history of the film, and banter.  It's a game of a movie that never was done as a DVD that doesn't exist.\n\nIt's also quite clever and fun.\n\nSo there's three parts to the game.\n\nTHE GAME: The game is a pretty standard action platformer - multiple characters to choose from with different abilities, character upgrades (that affect the whole team), and various upgradable weapons, a few of which are delightfully weird.   As you journey through the environment (a tower, of course), there's hidden items, loot, achievements, and so on.  Nothing you haven't seen before, but about 1/2 to 2/3 the way through the game, it really starts pulling out some truly crazy environments, puzzles, and designs.  The controls at times are a little "soft" and wonky, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nTHE THEME: The theme of the game, the b-movie-as-game is realized exceptionally well.  The film references come thick and fast, and even a b-movie fan such as myself may not catch them all (my favorite are the Energy Imps, clear references to the Monster of the Id from Forbidden Planet).  The banter is funny and usually well done, and it's actually interesting to "play" one story while you hear about another - the making of this film.  The director, Dan Smith, is an interesting character both human and flawed - he loves films and movies, compliments his actors, is friendly with the recording assistant, but also shows cluelessness, sexism, and a bit of ego.  He's probably a bit too close to reality.\n\nHOW IT COMES TOGETHER: The gameplay and the theme come together very well.  From the monster designs and styles (many look like stop motion), the crazy environments, the unusual bosses, and little effects and asides, it works.  It's sort of the game equivalent of "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra," a fun parody-and-homage.\n\nIt it perfect?  Well, there's a few flaws.  The action platforming elements have the slightly "soft" controls as mentioned, and there's not any real innovation in the gameplay - it's stuff we've seen before.  Theres' a need for a bit more tutorial elements and clarity as abilities and weapons aren't always easy to understand.  Nothing is game-breaking or indeed game-stopping, but a little more polish would have been nice.\n\nOn the other hand, there's plenty here for completists.  There's many achievements and hidden items and things to upgrade.  You can have fun watching for various film references.  You can try out different weapons or play with different abilities to find what works best.\n\nSo should you buy it?\n* First if you like a solid action platformer/adventure and like b-movies, you should buy it.  This is the game for you.  Buy it.\n* If you know someone who'd like this, you just found a great present at a reasonable price.  Buy it.\n* If you like action platformer-adventures, it's a mixed bag.  The theming is great and it's imaginative, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table - the way it works with the theme is a strong selling point.  Consider it or get it on sale.\n* If you know an action platformer-adventure fan . . . it might be a decent fit.  It's a gamble.\n* If you neither like b-movies or action platformer-adventures, really this isn't for you unless you just want to see an interesting envisioning of a genre.\n\nPersonally, I consider this game a little gem and a triumph of gameplay married to theme.  It's clever, witty, heartfelt, and fun.\n\nAnd c'mon Dan Smith had to have made more films, shouldn't those get, ahem, "special releases . . ."\n","January 30","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite being a more story-driven game, DTM still bosts some replayability for all of its little secrets. Just reading the achievment list left me scratching my head: at no point was I ever aware that there was a even Ghost Pirate Ship with some kind of boss on it to fight. The combat is solid and enjoyable, the parrying is competent and functional for sure, and the ever changing environments and enemies keep the experience fresh.\n\nThis has to be the most honest B-Movie parody I've seen though. They just keeping pulling out more and more random monsters that will just be in the game for a few minutes and never again, and it's clearly intentional, and enjoyable, just waiting to see what is going to top the fight with a large dog wearing a vacuum cleaner and christmas lights. The director commentary was honestly fun; I thought it was just something they did for the trailer, and didn't realize it was like the premise of the entire game: the way it tells both the game's story, and the story of the movie's production is really neat and creative, and at no point does the game become "just a game", it really stays consistent from start to finish.","January 22","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you have some parry mechanics, the enemies do so little damage that you don't even bother to parry unless it is for the achievement, and at the same time, you do so much damage that you really can't see much difference from one weapon to other at all as most of them one hit kill mobs.\n\nI think the most fun comes from the exploration part, finding hidden areas of the tower and the skydiving hoops/targets, as combat gets boring fast.\n\nIn the end you will stay for the funny dialogues and novel retro visuals.

That game was a tower defense game, though, with goofy villains and flying saucers. The Deadly Tower of Monsters (TDTM from here on out because golly that’s a long title) pulls it off in spades. The setup is a director coming back to record some audio commentary for the DVD release of the movie he made a while ago. He talks rather passive about things like people dying on the set to the cost of certain features and complaints by stars: it’s all very entertaining.\n\nThe whole game is run in a 60’s style of aesthetics with creatures that look like they are stop-motioned captured (love that T-Rex and the squid people). Keep in mind though, that this is the director doing the narrating while you play. If you die, he criticizes the one playing the video footage for getting bad footage since the scene never happened that way in the original film. It was mocking you and still explained it off (if you were worried about continuity and how they would talk about it). I died so much at one point that the one helping with the footage asked the director why they kept all of these reels when they weren’t  shot correctly. They really put a lot of thought into the narration and I love how they comment about almost everything.\n\nThe combat works fairly well, I did favor the melee over the range attack. It always feels like you do more damage than using the lasers and such. (I’m looking at you Tesla Gun.) Smaller melee weapons are faster and quicker guns are weaker, yadda yadda yadda, I wield the biggest stick and tank with my face! That’s not to say that things will always be that way throughout the course of the entire game. There are cogs of different colors and worth littered throughout the game and you will use these cogs to upgrade your weapons. Obviously there are more difficult ones to get and some that I just don’t understand how to get at this point in the game, but with exploring you’ll find enough of them to fix the weapons up to play the way you want to… or at least start in the direction you’ll want to go in. There is a good variety of different weapons that will get handed to you as you progress, upgrading them will be dependent on your determination to explore and gather the various types of cogs.\n\nYou’re given three adventurers to play around with in TDTM, and I used to feel that this was one of the few negatives I had with the game. They all felt like the same character to me. Whether it’s with the combat in general or jumping, there didn’t feel like there was any major difference in how they operated/controlled. If I had to ask myself if that’s a bad thing, I would say not completely. In the fact that they all felt the same, that means I could switch it up between ♥♥♥♥ Starspeed, Scarlet Nova and Robot. While I love Robot’s name, for some reason I loved to play with… Mr. Starspeed.\n\nIt was about the time that I was getting fed up with some golden cogs that I couldn’t figure out how to get that I realized that specific characters had different talents. The first one to really set itself apart was Robot. He had the ability to slow time down and that opened my eyes to being able to progress further and get some cogs that were impossible before hand. Now, with the other characters starting to show me their moves, it’s starting to feel like the characters are a bit more fleshed out than I had originally thought. Granted, as you obtain new abilities, you slowly remember places that gave you pause and caused your brain to hurt an hour or so back and realize that this game will have some back tracking. I was almost bothered by this until I discovered that all of the characters could fast travel up and down the tower (a power I had originally thought to be given to Scarlet only). This is what I get for assuming.\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nWith the characters getting more fleshed out and more weapons getting unlocked, the world seemed to open up even more. The narrator doesn’t stop from shining with the humorous comments and the game continues to be visually fun throughout. Something stops TDTM from being super compelling to play without a desire to stop. I find it rather easy to play, but other games continue to easily pull me away. That is not to say that it’s not worth picking up, but I think one should be in a specific mood to play this type of game. TDTM is a action-platformer, RPG and while fun, there is something that stops it from being great. I wish I could articulate my point better, but sometimes you just don’t know what you just don’t know.","April 10","true","5.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a must for anyone who likes that kind of crud, like myself. If you don't like this kind of stuff, just leave now.\n\nPros\n-Fun gameplay\n-Funny dialouge\n-Plenty of references\n-Great platforming\n-Great concept\n-4p local coop\n\nCons\n-Ends WAY to soon, only about 6 hours, took me 7-8 for 100%\n-Ending is pretty lame, could've been much better\n-Camera can be awkward at times, makes 4p local coop unbearable at times\n\nOverall, good game thats waaaaay too short. If it was longer it would be worth the full price, but unfortunatley its too short to recommend at full price. Perfect game to get on sale!","May 30","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
