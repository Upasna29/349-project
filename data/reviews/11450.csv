The reasons? The minions obviously! They are just hilarious! My favorite part of them is the fact that they can loot equipment so you can have 50 brown fighter minions that look unique and barbaric. Did I mention that they have a hierarchy system too? The strongest minion (and probably your favorite) always goes next to the dark lord and the other line up behind him so at the furthest back you have those newly spawned grunts. You must be careful about the minions that you do care about because if they die they are gone forever. I once had my favorite minion who was wearing a golden crown which he looted from a fat hafling king get smashed by a succubus, oh god did I miss him!\n\nI originally got the game on disk hence the play time.","December 26, 2013","true","0.2"," 155 of 168 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","155","168","0","0"

I was excited to see it on sale here on Steam with its addon and sequel, so I picked them up dirt cheap.\n\nThe game is pretty fun, with the story being staged with you in the role of the villain out to subjugate any and all you come in contact with. You get the option to choose between good and evil, but it's more accurately evil and really, really evil. The game play is fun, though a bit frustrating when you can't quite find how to get to the next area. I realized how much I've come to rely on the objective markers in newer games (Skyrim and such), when I had to actually think about where to go. Once you get all four minion types, the game really starts to move, because more paths to success are open to you.\n\nThe primary negative to the game, I feel, is the minion control when using the keyboard and mouse. Controlling minions is often clunky, especially if you are standing just a bit too close to something you want them to interact with. It is exceedingly difficult to control the minions when they have to lure enemies to certain places or take timed explosives to certain points before they detonate (both happen a lot late in the game). It was really hard to move around while directing a minion, which made a couple of challenges lose their entertainment value quickly.\n\nBesides those few specific examples, however, I found the game to quite fun all these years after my first playthrough. The graphics are dated, and the story is very shallow, but it was worth the couple of bucks I spent on it. Just remember you are playing an older game when you start!\n\nEdit: It was mentioned in comments that I might need to note that my hours recorded playing are inaccurate. I have a tendancy to leave games running overnight while I'm sleeping or while I'm at work, so the hours logged never match my actual hours played by a long shot. Do NOT expect to get over 300 hours of playability out of this game. I have no idea exactly how many hours I've put in.","October 26, 2014","true","337.9"," 107 of 114 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","107","114","8","6"

It is more like a tactical action RPG than a hack-and-slash game. In the first part of the game you will have to heavily rely on your minions in fights, and you can only slowly afford to enter melee as you upgrade your armour and weapon.  And the game makes sure you have to keep some minions around all the time.\n\nThe graphics are still pretty, with beautiful landscapes, though you can spot some tricks wich were required in 2007 to decently run a game on an average engine by that date. The music was not memorable, but had some catchy accords, the voice acting was done wholeheartedly. The story was not bad, and though it had some great ideas, like incorporating the seven deadly sins, it wasn't the best, either. Linear, but enjoyable.\n\nMy 33 hours of play include one playthrough with some farming, but dedicated players will want to play it to the end two times: with 0% and with 100% corruption as the goal.

Although dated, Overlord provides an alternative take on the fantasy genre. Instead of being a hero out to save the world, you start out as an evil lord who needs to rebuild his tower that was previously ransacked by heroes in the past. Throughout the course of the game, you are provided a handful of moral choices that will either raise or lower your evilness also known as "corruption". The higher your corruption, the more evil you will look. Don't take the game too seriously though as it has a quirky, satirical humor to it.\n\nThe gameplay is very basic. Controlling the Overlord is as simple as moving and pressing the attack button repeatedly. The complexity is in controlling your minions. There are four types of minions based on color that you recruit into your army: fighters, mages, assassins, and healers. As long as you're willing to collect enough life-force, your minions will have an infinite number of lives and you can spam them carelessly against each enemy to beat the game. To add a little more difficulty, you can employ tactics to beat the game with the least number of minion casualties. This will help reduce the grind for life-force, which is also used in upgrading your equipment so using tactics will help you become stronger much faster.\n\nOnce you have fully upgraded your weapons and armor with Arcanium and their life-force upgrades, the difficulty of the game becomes laughably easy. You can literally kill everything in your path without even using your minions at all.\n\nThe game does have a couple of issues. The audio and voice-acting is fairly bad. There are some characters that you will come across that will make you want to turn off your speakers when they talk. Not a huge deal if you play with subtitles. Gameplay can get very repetitive about halfway through the game. Controlling the minions can also become frustrating, especially when navigating complex routes. Sometimes they just don't go where you want them to or they just do what they want to do. It definitely fits the description of a "chaotic" army.\n\nThe most glaring issue is the lack of any kind of map. You will need to either memorize your way around, which isn't too difficult, or wander aimlessly until you find what you are looking for.\n\nOverlord has a Steam sale just about every other month. This is an unbeatable value for only a couple of dollars.","December 14, 2013","true","16.0"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","3"

(Because it contained both Overlord 1 and the Raising Hell Expansion):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/12710\n\nTL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Overlord is a third-person action/adventure game developed by Triumph Studios and published by Codemasters. The game was originally released for the PC Platform and the Xbox 360 in 2007 with a PS3 release the following year. The game's plot primarily serves as a parody of generic fantasy themed worlds. The game also heavily relies on its primary game feature called 'Minion Control' where the player does 20% of the work and the other 80% by ordering small goblin/gremlin/imp like creatures collectively called 'Minions' to do stuff for you.\n\nThe game puts the player in the horned helm of a recently resurrected warrior whose name is never mentioned but is generally known to everyone as “The Overlord.” Having been recently revived, he is informed by an old minion named Gnarl that a group of adventurers killed the old Overlord, ransacked the Overlord's Tower and 'freed' the previously controlled domain of his predecessor. As the new Overlord, the player is now tasked to take back the lost territories and exact revenge on the unsuspecting 'heroes'.\n\nPROS:+ The graphics, although aged, still looks good. The art style is reminiscent of Fable 1 which was nice for its time.\n+ Interesting new concept of minion control which was more or less implemented well\n+ Great minion control mechanic despite some minor annoyances\n+ Dark humor with obvious parodies and easter-eggs\n+ Good weapon and armor design but...(See CON #6)\n+ Good story with a good plot twist\n+ Nice voice acting (that goes well with the humor) and sound effects\n+ Good level design with a lot of environment variation\n+ Fun little mini-games and puzzles\n+ Healthy game time\n\nCONS:- Cutscene animations needs improvement\n- No Overlord's Tower defense quest (I expected that adventurers would attack my tower and I would have to setup defenses but no such event happened)\n- The Overlord's Tower has little to offer aside from the Dungeon and the Forge: Most of the tower upgrades are cosmetic with no bearing on character progression.\n- Can't talk to the NPCs outside of quests and stories: Disappointing specially if you want to know more about them or want to ask questions\n- Limited corruption events / triggers\n- Limited selection of weapons and armor\n- Can't do much in terms of exploration\n- Fixed camera that sometimes bug out when sweeping minions\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and comes highly RECOMMENDED. Overlord is a game that came as a surprise on how good it actually is. It may not be a Triple-A title but it certainly delivers a fun and enjoyable experience with its interesting game mechanic, good story backed up by good level design, good humor and an overall wonderful experience.\n\nIt does suffer from a few flaws, one of which is that it lacks essential RPG elements that would have made the experience much more entertaining. Another issue I had with the game is that, aside from the main quest and story, there is virtually nothing to do aside from minor Tower upgrades and occasional dungeon farming. The game also starts a bit slow, but after the first few levels, it starts to pick up the pace. Despite these flaws however, the game is still an enjoyable experience that is both well paced and well constructed and is enough to get your money's worth.\n\nI can easily RECOMMEND this game at FULL price because its relatively cheap but instead I urge you to BUY THE OVERLORD COMPLETE PACK which contains Overlord 1, Overlord: Raising Hell (expansion), and Overlord 2. If, for some reason, you don't want Overlord 2 then purchase both Overlord 1 and Overlord: Raising Hell because the expansion does add a substantial chuck of story to the main title and serves as a prologue to the events of Overlord 2.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The landscapes look fantastic and the characters are very well designed.\n\nYou get to play as the evil Sauron (pre-eye transformation), and control a whole bunch of cutesy gremlins to do your evil bidding. It's always a joy to interact with your minions, ordering them to pillage, kill, steal, or to even (accidentally) commit suicide!\n\nUnfortunately, the controls are a little unresponsive at times, the levels are very linear with too many backtracks, and the gameplay gets a little bit monotonous after a while. There's a little bit of grinding involved as well, if you want to craft better stuff (and you probably should). The online multiplayer mode is pretty much dead.\n\nDespite its many flaws, it's still a fun game. Drowning your first minion will probably become your most memorable and funniest moment in your whole gaming history.","November 26, 2013","true","9.6"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","34","35","0","0"

Great for ambushes and traps.\n\nBlue Minions - They are literally the worse for combat,they got extremly low health,armor and attack.The good side is the fact that they can actually swim in the water without drowning,that may allow them to follow you trough rivers and swamps,they also got some magical powers,wich allow them to resurrect dead minions,and they are the only kind of character wich can actually hurt magical beings like ghosts or whisps.\n\n\nYou can control an army of minions by spawning them from magical-holes linked to your tower,to spawn minions you will need certain lifeforce that can be gained by killing enemies (For example,if you will kill sheeps you can gain brown lifeforce,wich you need for spawning brown minions,and if you are going to kill fire bugs you gain red lifeforce,to spawn red minions) You can stock as many lifeforce you want but you have a limit by the minions that can follow you,you can increase the limit by collecting objects,by myself,i reached 35 max minions.\n\nMinions can also collect stuff from the ground like weapons,axes,piece of armors,helmets to increase their power and attack but they will also collect useless stuff like broken pumpinks.\n\nThe minions will always give you the lifeforce they harvest and the gold they found by pillaging,we need to mention that the main character is extremly weak and you will almost-always need your minions.\n\nGood/Bad sides\n\n+Interesting Story full of surprises\n\n+You may choose certain paths trough the story to determine if you are going to be an Evil Hero or an Evil Evil (that's shown by your corruption level wich increases for each innocent creature killed or with each extremly evil thing you do)\n\n+Detailed Minions\n\n+Original concept\n\n+Funny story and lots of funny scenes\n\n+You got your own mistress OwO and a jester (I named him box-sack)\n\n- The character never talks (All you can hear are some grunts from the helmet from time to time when you swing your weapon)\n\n-Linear levels (Even if you may choose to take some paths,you have to follow linear levels,wich imposes you to go trough certain areas and complete certain quests)\n\n-Extremly poor character customization (You can forge new helmets,weapons and armor by sacrificing your minions into a smelter,but there are only 3 types of weapon,1 helmet,1 armor and 3 materials for each one of those)\n\n-Main Character fight system extremly poor (All you can do are 12 spells,and swing your weapon,without making any other types of attacks,you just swing your weapon in front of you and deal some damage,nothing more)\n\n\nNow that i finished Overlord i'm going straight and definitely to play Overlord 2.

To give you an idea of how much I adore this game, I've played through it about four times by this point.\n\nThere's always question about which Overlord you should pick up if any, the first or the second? Personally, I say both. Here I will just review the first one though.\n\nA fantastic singleplayer RPG with clever humor, good boss fights, enticing story and an interesting combat system that I can't say I've seen in any other game.\n\nYou are the Overlord. Your job is to restore your tower to its former glory, convince the lowly townsfolk that you are indeed the Overlord and to wreak havoc with your minions (although sometimes you might decide to be nice to the citizens of your domain to make them praise you rather than fear you)\n\nBut what is an Overlord without his minions? There are four types of minions, which you unlock over time, but pretty early in the game you have all four. The first type is your default melee minions that just love to get in trouble and start fights, the second is a ranged type that are terrible in melee but can put out fires and throw fireballs, the third is a sneakier kind that can be used with clever positioning to take out key targets rapidly, but they suffer in direct confrontation, and the fourth is a healer that can resurrect your fallen minions for a while before their corpses decay (They can also swim, unlike all your other minions)\n\nThe overlord himself of course also has combat potential. He can hit people with his melee weapon of choice and cast spells that he has unlocked, there are plenty of spells ranging from direct damage (throwing fire at all your enemies and watching them burn to death while laughing horrifically) to buffing your minions (and watching them claw your enemies apart in a maddened frenzy before they start tearing each other apart)\n\nThere's also a crafting system that lets you craft weapons and armour with special stat bonuses given by letting your minions throw themselves into the flames to enhance your equipment.\n\nThis is definitely one of the most overlooked games that I know of, and that couldn't be a more undeserving title to have.","September 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","21","25","3","4"

Two words would be "gleefully mischievous." Imps and goblins usually annoy me - like the sidekick in The Darkness II - but these little fellows manage to be endearing.\nAnyway, this game has its tongue firmly pressed to its cheek, in a good way.\n\nIt parodies LOTR - except you are playing as pseudo-Sauron, sweeping your minions across halfling villages and elven forests with an evil grin on your face.\n\nYou (the Overlord) are slow and lumbering, but your minions - whom you can guide with an invisible hand or more precisely assign tasks to - are fast and fluid.\n\nIt's sort of open world - open enough to let you revisit previous (respawning) locations to replenish your gold and Souls.\n\nNegatives: Lots of backtracking. No way to sprint or speed up your Overlord character. And no mini-map of any kind.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DroP90/recommended/11450/","DroP90","DroP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DroP90/","414 products in account","Fun game, with a different proposal from the usual. It's an action RPG that the focus is on controlling minions to perform much of the dirty work while you just give support. It is not a game to be taken seriously, with a hilarious storyline in which you are the incarnation of evil, but you have to choose if you are completely bad, or just a little, and will define the end of your game.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, control your minions and develop strategies to overcome challenges and enemies, the beginning of the game is not exciting and gives the impression that it will be repetitive and boring. But by the time you will acquire new types of minions with different characteristics to be used together, and you can upgrade your equipment (weapons and armor), which makes the game more fun and challenging. The graphics and animations are poor, as well as the sounds. But as a whole the game is polished and well done.\n\nThe most negative points for me are the controls, which are sometimes complicated to get used, mainly controlling the minions. Did not like the UI too, I missed a map or mini-map. Despite this, I would recommend.\n\n7/10","February 10, 2014","true","18.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spectreSD/recommended/11450/","spectreSD","spectreSD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spectreSD/","212 products in account","Building an evil empire is hard work. Fortunately, minions love to do trivial tasks such as carrying heavy things, beating sheep to death with sticks and blades alike, putting stuff on their heads, immolating halflings, and smashing, well, everything in sight. It makes the tedium of smiting and being feared much more enjoyable.\n\nBetween Steam and my console version of this game, I probably have about 100 hours in it, and every playthrough was fun. The four kinds of minions (conveniently color coded for an Xbox controller, which I do recommend using a controller given how laid back this game is, but it is hardly required) add a great layer of strategy to the game if you take the time to utilize them to their maximum efficiency. Of course, you can always just send them all rushing in to smash smash smash, and they will happily die for you, but they will die quite often this way. And you just don't want that when they're so adorably evil. Unless maybe you're just extra evil, and that's actually encouraged around here.\n\nI would not call this game particularly challenging (although Legendary mode added in the Raising Hell expansion surely amps up the difficulty), but it is pretty forgiving overall. This is definitely a pick up and play game that is not going to drown you in the details of lore, equipment, crafting, etc., but it has just the right amount of strategy involved to keep it interesting while allowing it to remain a game you can lounge back and play just to unwind and enjoy the ride.\n\nFact is, sometimes you just want to be the bad guy. This game lets you be a brutal tyrant, but does so in such a charming way it just feels so right to be evil. So pick it up, build a horde, claim a mistress, restore your Dark Tower to all it's inglorious..er...glory, literally fill a room with gold and treasure, and sit back on your sweet evil throne, sipping wine made of fermented peasant tears, and debate how to punish your godawful jester.","February 19, 2015","true","17.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","8","10","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/11450/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Very original idea and runs smoothly and is funny seeing your minions do stuff like jump on a sheep and ride it around while hitting it in the back of the head with a club. It's fun to be the evil overlord and command your minions to run around and murder and ♥♥♥♥ everything up left and right. Pretty funny game. Overlord 2 is cool too and a even better version of the first game. The best part about the game are the fantastic graphics; they are very well done for its time and very pleasant too look at, very colorful, bright and glowing without being offensively bright and colorful. The game looks great.\n\nThe only two really bad things I can think of are that 1. it does not have a map, so you just run around till you find what to do and 2. when your health gets low it does a loud heartbeat sound which is horribly annoying and there are never any health shrines near so to make it ♥♥♥♥ing stop I just warp back to the main tower then come back where I was. Never, ever stop playing this game for an extended amount of time or you will forget where you have gone previously and have to do a ton of walking around until you find where it was to go next. It was 5 months in between the last I played and I regret doing that big time after spending two hours walking around until I found the right place. Another problem with the game which actually is not too bad at all is bugs. Sometimes the minion counter will get bugged and show 0/5 when I have 20 standing next to me. It makes them not control right so I have to warp to the tower then back to the area I was in to fix it. Sometimes I can command my minions to go over a bridge to turn a wheel and they get killed by a enemy who I can't make them attack because he isn't quite in the line of sight, making me backtrack a long way to get to a minion summoning mound. Anytime you have to go back a long way to get to a summoning mound to get more minions, which is more often than it should be, it is painfully boring and unfun. The game is alaso very basic. You just give minions commands and can fight a little and that is about it. It can get boring if you play for long sessions but it is still a great game nonetheless.\n\nOtherwise, it is a great simple idea that is different from all of the other games out there and like I said it is hilarious to command your minions to run up and destroy everything, breaking pots and crates to find gold and carry it back to you saying things like "for you, master!" and knocking down halflings homes and setting them on fire, killing enemies, and whatever other tasks.\n\nThe game is predictably somewhat linear, but hey, what game isn't. I am usually having too much fun to notice. Could've been a 8 or 9 out of 10 game, but because of all its issues I mentioned, 7/10.","May 16, 2015","true","3.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

FANTASTIC!\n\n-and the soundtrack that blends perfectly with the atmosphere even if it'd contrast the game main theme.\n\n\nThis game is a little masterpiece, buy it.\n","May 26","true","21.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was excited to see it on sale here on Steam with its addon and sequel, so I picked them up dirt cheap.\n\nThe game is pretty fun, with the story being staged with you in the role of the villain out to subjugate any and all you come in contact with. You get the option to choose between good and evil, but it's more accurately evil and really, really evil. The game play is fun, though a bit frustrating when you can't quite find how to get to the next area. I realized how much I've come to rely on the objective markers in newer games (Skyrim and such), when I had to actually think about where to go. Once you get all four minion types, the game really starts to move, because more paths to success are open to you.\n\nThe primary negative to the game, I feel, is the minion control when using the keyboard and mouse. Controlling minions is often clunky, especially if you are standing just a bit too close to something you want them to interact with. It is exceedingly difficult to control the minions when they have to lure enemies to certain places or take timed explosives to certain points before they detonate (both happen a lot late in the game). It was really hard to move around while directing a minion, which made a couple of challenges lose their entertainment value quickly.\n\nBesides those few specific examples, however, I found the game to quite fun all these years after my first playthrough. The graphics are dated, and the story is very shallow, but it was worth the couple of bucks I spent on it. Just remember you are playing an older game when you start!","December 24, 2014","true","14.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

It revolves around being an evil hero who quests through the lands slaughtering innocents and using your minions to do your bidding.\n\nIt's strange since Overlord isn't just a hack and slash, which it is. It's also an action RTS, which comes into play while ordering your minions into combat. This is a fairly intuiative feature on the gamepad but not so much with mouse/keyboard. If you're at all interested in this game I recommend using a gamepad due to this.\n\nHowever that's where all my favorite bits end, as it stands Overlord is linear and fairly simple. It lacks RPG elements and any complex RTS/Sim elements. It is basically a darker version of Fable with elements of the Darkness thrown in. Only enter if you crave simplicity, which isn't always a bad thing.","October 20, 2013","true","1.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyMoomin/recommended/11450/","LadyMoomin","LadyMoomin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyMoomin/","104 products in account","Theres very few games i can honestly say i love, and get completely drawn into, i can probably count on one hand the few games i've become a nerdy addict too. One of those games is Fable, so i wanted something to fill that little humourous funny game void thingy left in my gaming heart after finishing those games. This is when i stumbled upon Overlord.\n\nOverlord is the best game i've played on PC so far, and considering i've only been playing for a few weeks i suppose that isn't saying much. But this game has the fun of an action'y fight'y kind of game. plus it has all the benefits of something thats relaxing and humourous, this game has made me laugh a few times, which is sad really... but thats beside the point.\n\nBasically you play as an Overlord (what a surprise) You have a selection of minions, and to clarify, no they're not yellow and they do not wear dungaree's and goggles! They are however, blue, red, brown or green, they each have their own special 'powers', which i think is in a way what gives this game a slight sense of strategy, in a weird deluded way.\nYou must pick the right minions for each quest, inevitably some minions will die, or you'll kill them, so you or your minions kill different bugs to get 'orbs' of minion life, these orbs get stored at little colour co-ordinated crators where you can summon them at selected points in the game, you can also convert your minions back into orbs, or trade your minions in for health,  thus killing them.\n\nOnce you've selected your minions you purse through quests, throwing them into battles with a range of different creatures, and occasionally lending them a hand yourself, although the overlords fighting isn't the most thrilling and he doesn't have a wide range of weapons to chose from, he does have the benefit of 4 spells that can be cast, using your 'mana health bar' that can add a bit of a punch to otherwise space bar bashing when the minions need a hand.\n\nThe quests follow a simple story line and you can pick up and drop them as you wish, which really adds a sense of Free roam to this game, you can simply teleport to most areas and view open quests in these areas from you're main tower which you can revert back to from the main menu or tower crator, this tower is also something you can upgrade through in game currency as you progress which is a nice little back feature, but not something i think the game necessarily needs and certainly isn't a big feature, just an added bonus.\n\nSo in summary, If you've played fable and enjoyed it, you're 99.9% likely to enjoy this game, (You can even kick your minions if you miss days of kicking chickens!) if you havne't played fable, what is wrong with you? But just buy it anyways. There is nothing to not love about this cute little devious game!","September 11, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I took a break from the game, then came back not knowing how to toggle the different spells, so I ended up having to look it up online.\nRan out of use for gold.

And you wont be short of fun little characters to interact with.\n\n-The game suffers from horrendous pacing however. You'll spend hours figuring out how to progress, or just get bored tramping over what seems like endless streams of stuff to smash. Not to mention the insane amount of backtracking, although there will be new ways to interact with the environment thanks to new minions you might have unlocked.\n\n-Graphics are decent. Nothing more, nothing less. They serve there purpose well. There are however, some rather sinister design choices, and some of the characters look downright morbid and desturbing, and not in the good way.\n\nAll in all, if you want to splash out in a sale, you could do a lot worse than this game.

The great thing about this is you get to play as "Sauron" and control little smeagol looking minions. There are 4 different kinds of minions, brown, red, blue and green. Each type of minion is needed to complete almost every mission. You can also sacrifice hundreds of minions to empower weapons and such. Somehow, strangely enough, the minions are cute as they will pick up random things (like pumpkins) and wear them as armor, use zombie arms to attack whatever (yes this game has zombies), and keep gold crowns for themselves. Some tactics are needed when fighting large amounts of opponents or bosses. It's also cute (and makes you lazy as hell), that the minions will bring you gold, "xp" (used to summon more minions) and potions and offer them to you. (aka your a minion god to them). It's a lot of fun and well worth every freaking penny. My favorite part? Kicking the Minion Jester around.\n\nPros:\n-A wonderful blend of LOTR and Pikmin (and zombies)\n-Amazing graphics (think Fable on steriods)\n-Great music\n-Fun interactions\n-Wonderful style of game\n-You get to be as evil as you want (and that's the point of the game)\n\nCons:\n-What cons? lol\n-Maybe casting spells can be a bit of a pain.....but that's what minions are for.

While it has its fair share of flaws (minions occasionally spawning in areas they can't get out of, dumb enemy AI, cheap "difficulty" boost which only serves to make the game more tedious), there is too much to like to really dwell on the negatives, but you should be aware they are still there. The story isn't immensely deep but deep enough to thoroughly enjoy, music can be good at times but it is just okay overall despite always being fitting, the minions are a blast to watch when pillaging nearby homes, scenery, and sheep... Being able to condemn your enemies with a simple hand gesture really immerses you in the Overlord character, and the minions are so full of personality you could just rip them out of the game and squeeze them. Despite being ugly little creatures, they're awfully adorable.\n\nThat being said, I have played the game once as a good guy. Playing again as a massive jerk on Legendary difficulty (not something you should ever do unless you just want to say you did it) even after countless hours is more fun than the first time through. It has the charming replay value of a platformer along the lines of Spyro the Dragon.\n\ntl;dr play this\n","March 20","true","169.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll find yourself perhaps just on the edge of your last bit of health and most of your minions dead, when you'll come across a  summoning spot or a crate with health in it. It is challenging and rewarding to play, and the humour is fantastic.\n\nIf you're not a fan of grinding, make sure you take the time to learn when to recall your gremlins back at soon as you notice they might be in trouble - like drowning, or a boss about to do a strong attack. Losing too many will deplete your amount you can summon, forcing you to go back to old maps and grind down to collect life force. The good news is, most of these 'grinding' locations are very close to the map entrances, so you won't be there for too long.","January 22","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kenomica/recommended/11450/","Kenomica","Kenomica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kenomica/","413 products in account","Overlord has you take the role of the almighty Overlord, an evil presence who is set to rule over the land.\n\nYou begin the game, a newly awakened dark force – tasked with rebuilding your dark tower. You raise an army of minions, terrorize the local population and craft your own armour and weapons. You can even customize your dark tower, which is a nice touch. The narrative and environment are very reminiscent of Middle-Earth, in the sense of a twisted parody where you play as Sauron. The setting is very light-hearted and comical, despite playing the villain in a Tolkien-esque world. The graphics aren’t exactly stellar and there are issues with pop-in, but it does a nice job of portraying the theme of the overall experience. It’s similar to World of Warcraft’s style of softly lit and stylized environments and characters.\n\nAlthough you are a dark and powerful Overlord, you start off fairly weak, which is where your minions come in. Like Pikmin, you need to gather a force of followers who can aid you in your quest. You need a certain amount of minions to perform specific tasks for you - such as moving obstacles, pulling levers and of course, combat. They can also access smaller areas otherwise inaccessible, revealing secrets and other goodies. There are also various colours which specialize further. Brown minions, for example, are your standard fighting force, whilst red minions are your ranged attackers; greens are your stealth attackers and blues are your healers.\n\nOverlord plays like a very old game; now, I do not mean this in a negative sense – not dated or “retro” – I’m referring more to the game design and ideology. Although there is a main thread to follow, you’re not held by the hand from point A to point B, you are encouraged to explore and find things for yourself. The world is rather large and full of secrets and puzzles, which need actual work and thoughtfulness to find. It makes a very refreshing experience compared to more modern games full of set pieces and elaborately staged corridors.\n\nThe controls are very well done, both with keyboard & mouse and a controller; although camera control is limited with a controller. You control your Overlord as you would expect, attacking and using magic but you can also control your minions directly as a horde, allowing finer control, such as sweeping them through inaccessible areas. You are also able to set guard points, sending your minions to station there until you recall them; this allows you to set your fire throwing reds at the back, set up an ambush with the greens etc. It’s nice how much control you have.\n\nThe game lasted me roughly 25 hours, which felt very well paced. Some games feel too long, others too short. This game fits neither of these categories.\n\nI highly recommend this game, as I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it.","February 13, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its difficulty is very simplistic, and despite the variety of enemy types and locales you can visit, there's very little in the way of environmental hazards and actually difficult monsters. The biggest danger to your minions is their own poorly-designed AI and the frustrating control scheme that restricts the ways you can order your minions and increases the likelihood of accidental - and unavoidable - death. The only areas or enemy types I truly found problematic were the cases where my minions would accidentally commit mass suicide by walking into a beholder's p*nis or taking a flaming d*ck to the forehead by those exploding dwarf archers. Oh, and that f*cking baron nashor c*ck pit p*ssed me the f*ck off, even after I figured out how to do it properly. What a gay area. That whole desert segment was unnecessary.

If you have any liking whatsoever towards the Tolkien Universe and don't mind a game that actually succesfully makes fun of it I would recommend it. This is not just a uninspired shoddy attempt for a parody, the developers have taken their spoof seriously. The graphics are bright and detailed and the engine runs smooth. Character models and animation are great and I can't help but enjoy the sound of breaking pots and dishes. There are lots of mechanics to be explored as you progress in the game and you'll have a good sense of satisfaction once you're done.\n\n- The world is not exactly an open one, but not entirely linear either. You can walk about and kill sheep or loot places at your own leisure, although that might get a bit boring if you choose to do so for a long time. Some parts of the game you can do in a different order, but you won't get further until you've reached certain goals in certain areas.\nIf you're not playing with a controller you'll experience some annoyance when trying to swipe your flock of gremlins to the back of the field, but it's far from gamebreaking and at least you don't need to do it all the time. However if you do use a controller there are far worse issues with camera angles and target selection, so I just really wouldn't recommend that (unless you actually manage to get used to it somehow).\n\nI think the game is worth its full price including the raising hell expansion pack, but if you're not sure wait for the sales.","September 6, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Again?\nRemember, this game is already old - yet it also is a classic game of the genre "Play Evil". The graphics are still fresh and crisp even on newer machines, the game is also less laggy now - because of the better hardware.\n\nThe story is told fast, you are an "evil" Overlord, who uses his horde of Lackeys to the best effect of his own will, get as corrupt as you like and fight against... Well... Who would have thought: Maneating Hobbits, Bloodthirsty Unicorns and other vile stuff of ...\n\nWell you see already where this is going, Hobbits and Unicorns normaly are considered good or heroic creatures, but not in this game, not at all. You'll meeting some of the most original character in any Fantasy game that was published over the years, and you'll be surprised by the sometimes black humor, irony and sarcasm that this game has to offer to the player.\n\n...and they lived unhappily ever after.\nOr so you might think, but no... In fact, in this twisted world it is a real pleasure to be an "evil" overlord, because evil sometimes is the exact oposite of what you might think in this game...\n\nKick your Jester, punish him for good... Be as cruel as you can be against your enemies, and frighten the masses by displaying the most cynic abuse of power. And don't wince, because you don't look powerful when you wince, you just look foolish.\n\nHave I forgotten something? Oh yes, the recomendation.\n\nIf you are not into this kind of genre you will find the game maybe a little frustrating, even ridiculous. But if you are either a fan of Fantasy games (Roleplay, Strategies, Sims ... whatever) or you are an avid fan of Villains before Heroes, then you would be pleased by this game - and it also offers a lot of riddles and puzzles too. Even it is not new, it still has it's bite... and once it's poison is in your veins ... you're poisoned!

And it's a Dutch product, which instantly makes it about 5x better ! For those who don't know what the idea behind Pikmin (and therefore Overlord) is (shame on you !); you control a character who's being followed by 4 different kinds of creatures. In the case of Overlord you have blue ones (for water traveling), red ones (for fire traveling), green ones (for sneak attacks) and brown ones (for basic fighting really). You can send them all to the same location, or you can send only a specific group of minions to do something for you. You start with the brown ones by the way, and you'll have to unlock the rest during your playthrough. Anyway, you use them to kill enemies (the boss fights are excellent and very fun !), collect items and solve puzzles. The controls are frustrating when using the keyboard and mouse so I recommend using a controller, to those who have one. So, buy Overlord AND a controller.

And it's a Dutch product, which instantly makes it about 5x better ! For those who don't know what the idea behind Pikmin (and therefore Overlord) is (shame on you !); you control a character who's being followed by 4 different kinds of creatures. In the case of Overlord you have blue ones (for water traveling), red ones (for fire traveling), green ones (for sneak attacks) and brown ones (for basic fighting really). You can send them all to the same location, or you can send only a specific group of minions to do something for you. You start with the brown ones by the way, and you'll have to unlock the rest during your playthrough. Anyway, you use them to kill enemies (the boss fights are excellent and very fun !), collect items and solve puzzles. The controls are frustrating when using the keyboard and mouse so I recommend using a controller, to those who have one. So, buy Overlord AND a controller. Trust me, you'll love it !\n\n[Rating: 87/100]","September 23, 2011","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is well done in my opinion but very very very tedious. Its just pikmin with a gimick. Also some logic to me is flawed. Like the fact your supposed to be some powerful villain yet your minions en masse are stronger than you and so are many enemies. How the hell can no minions realize they can easily womp you? No sprint so if you have to get more minions because of a mess up its a long trek to a spawn point if there are none nearby so if your not an expert get ready for tedious back and forths constantly especially in certain maps. Minion ai sucks. Its touch and go on any of them but the browns. the browns are good but the others are always touch and go. A damn compass or map would help too since I had to spend 2 hours trying to remember the map for the first area since it all looks the same. Oh and get ready for a bunch of tedious grinding on life force to spawn minions. Also the minions are humorous......BUT GET OLD VERY GOD DAMN QUICK.

The game is fairly old and isn't the best looking title however that is not what the game is about. It's about going around with your horde of minions and killing everything insight. The game has a little sense of humour which is fairly light and is not that difficult and you can simply send waves after waves of minions to beat enemies. The game has a very linear range of minions Brown(basic starting units mainly for straight up fighting), Reds (Putting out fires and ranged units), Greens (Stealth weak units which can remove poisonous  plants) and finally Blues (weakest unit with the abilty to revieve fallen minions). You must unlock the Reds first then it is up to you if you want to unlock the greens or the blues. I perfer to unlock the Greens then the Blues as i perfer the Greens. The game has you go around killing "Heroes" who have fallen to evil. The heros are a Halfing King, an Elf hero (who has became a tree), Paladin, a Dwarf king, a huge warrior and a Wizard. The game then decided what ending to give you depending on your corruption level (if you have been evil or not during the game). That's it really other than you can forge three types of linear iteams (armour,helmet and weapons), fight fallen enemies in a dungeon, upgrade your tower (no really need to) and collect relics (statues to upgrade health and mana as well as unlock new spells). So to me Overlord is a fun simple game worth yout time and money as it is enjoyable and relaxing.","November 10, 2014","true","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You control goblin-like creatures called "minions" to kill creatures or humans to gain tiny orbs called "life force" which in turn gives you more minions to summon. Now i say its kinda like Conkers Bad Fur Day because of the theme. It has some dark humor portions ie. there was a mission in the game which is encountered early which you make a giant enemy explode by hitting it with your melee.  Every game has its flaws which they have fixed in the second game Overlord II for example you cant turn the camera it turns on its own as you move. Also there is no minimap which means it can be difficult to find your way in the maps. overall i think it is a fun and entertaining game is it the best game? no i would not say so but it is worth trying out if you want something to do it has some elements of strategy. the hardest part of this game i would say is controling resources in this game. you need money and minions to craft and upgrade your weapons and armor.","July 9, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It really feels like a bad console port. If you are the kind of person who replays a level they didn't get a perfect score on this game will drive you insane. I find myself running into a battle and losing all controls for a solid ten seconds; once everything is working again, after frantic clicking, most of my troops are dead because they stood around waiting for me to issue commands...\n\nThe reason I say bad console port is because most of the controls are just clicking differently with the mouse and for some reason if you click to fast or click to many times or click two different buttons within a few seconds of each other the game just gives up on interpreting what you are trying to do. Minions will just run around locked in whatever command you gave last or they will just stand around you and die. The further you get the more challenging the game and in turn the more frustrating the in-operability of the controls.\n\n\n\nI really do want to enjoy the game :(","October 24, 2015","false","11.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

Overall I'd probably give it a 5/10.\n\nVoice acting: Pretty terrible.\nGraphics: passable\ngameplay: quite fun, single redeeming feature\nmusic: forgettable\n\nYou are dug out of a crypt with no explanation of how you got there. It's time to be an evil overlord. Teleport around doing...stuff and building up armies of minions. The game was on sale for a few dollars so I figured I'd try it out.\n\nThere were a lot of side features to this game that I didn't get into simply because I wanted to finish it. The plot hooks felt a little desperate and unnatural. I think a game in which the protagonist is evil requires a different kind of reason to go somewhere beyond "there's a plague there."\n\nThere is a crafting system that requires you to sacrifice your minions to improve your equipment. However, the number of minions that I had to sacrifice to get some mediocre improvements actually backfired in the last level because I ran out of minions and had to grind/farm up some more.\n\nThere's a few puzzles in this game, which frequently are a grind to get through. Combat is typically over very shortly when you overwhelm the opposition with your minions, or some new enemy wipes out large numbers of minions until you figure out how to beat it.\n\nI ran into a few annoying bugs, one that went in my favor and one that killed a lot of my minions.\n\nThis game reminded me of Fable meets Pikmin. The whole game took me about 10 hours to beat, and for the last 4 of those I was getting antsy to see the end because I wasn't having much fun. Frankly I would have gotten more enjoyment from playing Pikmin again. The controls were a little clunky. Virtually every piece of dialogue was so tropey/cliched/badly voice-acted that it made me wince on a few occasions. This game wasn't bad, but felt like a chore to get through, and I beat it in 10 hours.\n","March 18","false","9.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ooMIGIToo/recommended/11450/","ooMIGIToo","ooMIGIToo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ooMIGIToo/","307 products in account","3/10\n\nWith all the hype I heard from this game I expected an enjoyable experience involving me controlling my minions, tormenting local villagers and their livestock, and being the badass I suspected I would be. No. That exists, but the game is so much worse than that.\n\nThe mechanics work when they want to, the collision detection is either there or not, the combat leaves a lot to be desired, and the writing and voice acting is EXTREMELY poor. After spending hours roaming the forest, lost, and then later the dwarven hills, lost, it was apparent that this game needs a mini map in the most DESPERATE way. Even a normal map would have been fine just so I could know where the ♥♥♥♥ to go! Controlling my minions was enjoyable until I had 30+. Then it became an annoyance of trying to get all of them to cooperate together to get from point A to point B. They also like to drown in water. That’s fine I get it. However when the water is ankle deep and the minions are knee high and they drown I’M CALLING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!\n\nThe combat is extremely bland, Most of the time you send your minions out to fight and only need 10 at most to destroy the living hell out of everything, but there comes a time where you just gotta get your hands dirty. ♥♥♥♥ THAT! The amount of times I had 5+ enemies surround me and I swing my weapon thinking, "I'll get a hit on all of them and take them out in no time." WRONG! You get surrounded be prepared to take some more damage than you thought. Each hit focuses on one enemy at a time. ONE? I'M NOT POKING THEM INDIVIDUALLY! MY SWORD/AXE/WHAT EVER I FEEL LIKE USING WILL HIT ALL OF THEM! NOT JUST ONE!\n\nI thought that maybe the forging system could help this in that I could get some bonuses and become even MORE of a badass. Wrong again. To upgrade and forger items you have to infuse them with the souls of your minions. And only certain creatures have souls to drop which doesn’t make sense since every enemy should drop some soul! So because I only get a limited amount of souls from creatures that destroy my minions easily you end up having to grind your face on a wall for an hour only to get 400+ souls. 400 is a pretty big number, however when crafting you can infuse up to 2000 souls. 2000?! This is for only 1 item. NOT EVEN AN UPGRADED ITEM! A BASE ITEM! SO I THEN HAVE TO SPEND MORE SOULS TO UPGRADE MY WEAPON! 3000 SOULS! I’m sorry, but having me use my 50,000+ gold would have been enough.\n\nWhich brings me to the money system. You get money which you use to upgrade your tower and to spend on the crafting items. After spending all the money I could to upgrade my tower I ran out of useful things to spend it on and accumulated 50,000+ by the end of the game. I don’t see how they could have run out of things to use money on. Every time you summon a fresh minion it will either have armor it gathered from a previous mission or come out naked as the day it was born. Why not use the money to give any minions better armor? Better weapons? No you upgrade that by choosing a specific wench to join you in the tower. Wow. One upgrade. Don’t want to make you too overpowered in a game where your minions literally get ♥♥♥♥ on around every corner.\n\n"SPOILER ALERT"\n\nThe story I thought was going to be pretty straight forward. Show dominance and you win when you become the OVERLORD! Not exactly. You go about finding minion nests, then take out some of the local annoyances and the come back to the tower to discover that you were just helping an evil wizard, aka the REAL Overlord, to sneak back into the tower and everyone to stab you in the back because ♥♥♥♥ you the other guy was here first a long time ago. You have one last puzzle with some loyal minions help and then fight said wizard in a fight that will be long forgotten by the time I read a text message.\n\nWith all this I give the game a 3/10.\n\nA game with dodgy mechanics, unmemorable bosses, poor story and voice acting, maze like levels with NO maps, and systems that become redundant.\n","December 17, 2015","false","9.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

I originally played this game on PS3 and it worked was fun, not the best game to exist but was fun.  Well the PC version is different!  This version is so filled with small glitches causing you to restart the game over and over again which just breaks the fun.  If the dev who long since dumped this game fixed those gitches it would be a decent game.  They have not and will not!  The worst glitch is when your minions are holding something to bring back to your castle (to a portal) they sometimes randomly stop right at the portal and won't move further to put it down on the portal.  This glitch alone has made me restart the game several times.  If you have a PS3 get it on that.

And there's a crafting system that you can use to make armour and weapons but the problem is that you use Souls two upgrade you get for killing enemies ok but when you make two armour pieces for example and then you want put fire on one and say poison on the othet and it is hard to see what chest piece you have on so you have to go back and forward from your forge to your wardrobe and check to find out what one you have on it is a Absolute nightmare and if you want to give you chest piece a health boost so you have to collect like a round 600 souls i know not quite right number but you end running around the same over and over again to get the Souls.  And you use the Souls two summon you minions and so you have to go back and kill things like sheep to get more souls and all sorts of things over and over and over again to get those that you have to go back and do it again and again it is crazy how many things you have to do in this game over and over again\n","February 24","false","48.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

And honestly, they do a decent job, because that's a hard task. When you first start this game, it seems like it's going to be some form of an RTS; you controlling The Overlord directly, but also directing his growing band of minions.  The Overlord uses magic and melee, while different kinds of minions attack physically, magically, stealthily, etc, and you control it all directly. Pretty cool.\n\nWell, it should be. Despite doing a surprisingly good job as I said above, there are still many problems. I've quit and reloaded several times (irritatingly limited save system) because my minions have all charged into fire or poison gas or a lake and died immediately because of a button press. My fault, yeah, I did it. But why should it even be possible to murder all your followers by ordering them into a river? Just make them stop at the water's edge so that if I accidentally, even one time, forget to change over to just the minions who walk on water, I don't lose the whole level and die. And this happens more than you would think, because this game is not a strategic combat game, it's an action/adventure game with puzzle elements. The minions are mostly there to get through puzzles that become increasingly irritating. Because the perspective is directly on the Overlord, it can be difficult to control the minions at a distance (in fact, you lose all control after a surprisingly short distance). They run into things, they aren't standing quite where you thought they were, they get lost. It's also kind of annoying to do things like seperate the minions, position them, recall them out of comabey they have been "locked" in to, etc. Really, the Overlord is actually a pain in the butt; he's a hindrance and a distraction, as he's not very tough or useful most of the time. If he was not there, or just there as a Wizard with a magic barrier who follows the minions around and you just control THEM, it would be far better, because you'd have more buttons to work with, instead of several just to control the very basic avatar. And the puzzles are not hard; it's one of those games where you know what to do immediately, but can't effectively do it. Constantly fighting with hit-and-run tactics, trying to navigate over terrain that's difficult to see (although you can change the camera angle, that robs you of the ability to see more than 20 feet away), it really just drags. The combat parts are the fun parts, and with some tweaking to the mechanics and different levels design, it would of been a fun and somewhat unique combat game. Instead it's an average action-adventure title combined with an easy puzzle game.\n\nIt's not terrible, but it's frustrating, and straddles too many fences to offer any depth or satisfaction in any field. The first 2-3 hours were fun, then it starts to slow down, and by ten, I just threw down the controller in frustration, as I couldn't get through 30 minutes without something going royally wrong (including freezes, enemies cheaply spawning right behind you and killing your weakest guys in a flash, and the fact that you can't unsummon your minions when needed). Good effort, in a way, by the devs, but it's not enough to make the game really worth playing.","March 11, 2015","false","10.0"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

Its a budget game so don't expect a whole lot either.\n\nI would say Overlord was like Pikmin, if I had ever played Pikmin I think.  Unfortunately like some other games where you command units while being a character yourself the actual gameplay that you do (you directly hacking and slashing) kinda sucks. There isn't a real fighting mechanic here, not even any rolls (the stuff popularized by Dark Souls) you just hammer the attack button or take a few steps back or use a magic spell.  This is really more of an RPG and a puzzle game than something about combat...or atleast thats what I think its supposed to be that. The puzzles thus far have required ridiculous amounts of back tracking at times and basically trying every path in the game till I find the one I need to go down or till I look up a guide.\n\nThe announcer/narrator is basically useless most the time in helping you solve problems. He will make a statement that will make absolutely no sense and its impossible to tell if this is applicable to the issue at hand or if its just random lore that dousn't actually matter. Am I supposed to just brute force and kill an enemy or use the narrators information to beat it more easily, tough ♥♥♥♥ figuring it out when theres no items or items of context in the area.\n\nControls are a pain, it can be hard to get minions to do what you want them to do and thats using a joystick/gamepad/controller. This can mean they stand there and let themselves get killed one by one or they end up running into a wall or getting stuck at a waters edge or to far from you. Its just a major pain in the ♥♥♥ managing them to the point between this and the pisspoor quests/backtracking and uninteresting combat that whatever good features this game has dousn't even seem to be worth it. It looks and sounds good enough, but gawd its a boring and uninteresting game and not a particularly good RPG either.\n\nMaybe I'll find a gem in the rough if I play later, but this is one budget title thats really padded out.","August 7, 2015","false","13.5"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","8","1","13","0","0"

Time needed to complete one playthrough: 16h (all content).\n\nA very long time ago I remember picking up Overlord for forty euro's on launch day at the local game store. How that seems to feel like ages past. I first played Overlord when I was very young, and when I played it I was immediately hooked. I still have the physical retail copy sitting in my closet, still filled with maps of every single dungeon that I myself drew, because I loved this game THAT much. Now that I finally replay it more than seven years later I have absolutely no idea why I loved this game, and that goes to show you that time doesn't wait for anybody.\n\nOverlord is a buggy game, as it has crashed multiple times on my system. Overlord has absolutely abysmal controls. Not because the concept of moving yourself around and controlling minions is difficult, but because the controls are unresponsive and clunky. Sometimes the controls simply would not work: I made the input and nothing happens, often leading to your plan being ruined and causing much frustration.\n\nOverlord is also a game of high promises made shallow and paper-thin. You control a poor man's Sauron through a parody of popular fantasy landscapes in search of a plot. You aren't doing this alone, as you have a small and unintimidating number of brain (and AI)-challenged minions who follow you around and "obey your every command".\n\nWhile I jokingly said that you were in search of a plot, I was only semi-serious. Your quest is to avenge your predecessor by slaying all seven Heroes who vanquished him, and, while you're at it, re-take over the world. All seven Heroes have become corrupt due to wealth and fame bestowed upon them for succeeding in the quest they undertook. Rhianna Pratchett of all people wrote this game, and while there are occasionally a few "Haha. That's funny. I guess."-moments in the game, most of it honestly feels very forced. It REALLY doesn't help that every single character looks the same, and looking at the lip-synching too long may make you go blind. Seriously, the lip-synching in this game is the stuff of belly-aching hilarity. Or just horror. When anybody talks, it looks as if the game is honestly glitched, of if the animator had a mouth-foaming seizure that day and the janitor had to fill in the blanks.\n\nGraphically the game still looks okay in my book. But be warned, people: 2007 was still in the age of overused bloom and plastic looking textures, though the developers DID try to avoid this in Overlord. The screenshots do a very good job at showing you the actual visuals of how the game is going to look on your screen, minus the UI, of course.\n\nThe real problem with this game is that it's overly ambitious to make you feel like an Overlord, a true Dark Lord of Evil, but this promise rings just as hollow as any cave because the Overlord:\n\n-can be easily stunlocked in combat by slugs;\n-controls and fights like he has a broomstick up his an*s;\n-has an EVIL TOWER OF DOOOOOM that only has four "large" rooms to explore;\n-(said tower can also not hold more than one mistress for a reason that's never explained to us);\n-can at the very maximum carry 50 weak minions with him;\n-has to find the objects that ALLOW him to carry more minions with him, because he starts out with a maximum of five;\n-has four types of Minions to choose from, yet out of four, three of them can die almost instantly in combat;\n-has a Minion Master that apparantly runs every single decision for him, not making him as an Evil Genius but more of a a Silent Dumb Soldier.\n\n... but I guess "Silent Dumb Soldier" as the title of this game wouldn't have broken the bank in terms of sales numbers (as if there wasn't enough of that back in 2k7). All joking aside, I do hope you guys see my problem here. This is a game that just brings the bare minimum of what is promised and after playing it again it just isn't my idea of what a fantasy evil master would do. That's not to say that this game is worthless though, there IS hard work poured into it, but it's 'One of Those Games' where you have to make your own fun, because the game certainly won't make it for you.\n\nAs always, only buy it when it's on sale. Hopefully Overlord III will make some of my evil ambitions come true.\n\nMy specs:\nWindows 7 64-bit\nIntel Core i7 920 2.67GHz\n6GB RAM\nMSI 660Ti OC Power Edition","January 6, 2015","false","23.2"," 22 of 65 people (34%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","34","22","65","6","0"

The Overlord himself is quite weak while the character building is mainly focus on the minions the player command. This tests the your ability to strategize your minion types and how well you control them. It makes the game quite fun when you overcome a challenge that overwelms both you and your army. But I wouldn't recommand (or try to get it at discounted price) because of some major (imho) flaws.\n\nI am 8 hours into this game while writing this review. That is because this game makes you run around way too much. It feels like this game is designed to deliberately waste your time. First of all, there is no map feature. No compass of any sort. I sometimes agree that map is distracting in a HUD, but this game requires you countless times to obtain a specific item (those ♥♥♥♥ing sticks) in a dungeon in order to progress to the next part. Without a map, you will make a wrong turn occasionally. Sometimes you are just completely lost and you have to go through every room to find the place you want to go. There should at least be some kind of indicator for me to find my way back to my objectives, but there is none.\n\nThe WORST THING about this game is how useless the waypoint gates are. They are completely not accessible at all. It's like a handicap parking stall with only enough space to park a small hatchback. Seriously, it makes me mad everytime i see one waypoint because they are useless. Unlike waypoints in other free roaming rpg games, you cannot use them to travel freely between waypoints. It's only use is to take you back to your tower (home). Well wtf, now they just waste my time for no reason. But wait, it's EVEN WORSE than that. From your tower, you can only teleport to major towns (which so far I only have three) and the last visited dungeon. The lifeforces (used to summon minions) are area specific, so when you run out, even when you know where to find them, you cannot go there directly. You have to teleport one of your major waypoints (which all of them are super far away from the location you want to go) and WALK. This is very serious, this is like the game breaking flaw that might render this game unplayable.\n\nFinally, the puzzles in the game are quite dull (so far). Feels like a cookie cutter design. It follows a formula of: you can't pass area until you get the red minion. You get the red minion, but look this green gas will require you to get the green minion to pass. so on and so forth. Even after I unlocked all 4 minions, the puzzles are still boring.\n\nThis game is not bad by all means, but it could use a lot of serious work. Now I feel really relucant to continue playing because I feel this problem will add onto itself when I unlock even more playable areas. I really don't want to waste time doing things that make me not enjoy the game. Plus that old imp is just ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Try it out if you have the $$$ since its not that expensive, but if your serious about how your time is spent, stay the heck away from this.","November 6, 2014","false","21.4"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","24","0","0"

You control little little minions to do your biding, ala pikmin style. Except you're evil. Really evil. There is even a mechanic where if you go out of your way to do evil things, such as kill peasants, you receive a certain percentage of corruption. This corruption ultimately determines a 100% chaotic ending, or a good ending. If you lean towards being good, the appearance of the overlord changes. If you however choose to do evil deeds, such as kill NPCs, your appearance will also change. Spikes grow out of your armor and the overlord emits an unsettling red glow.. As charming as this all was, many things brought down my experience with this game.\n\n1. Combat & Controls. Oh dear, the combat. It feels quite clunky. Especially how the overlord swings his weapon. It feels as though it doesn't have much weight to it. You have one standard combo. Also, attack is bound to the spacebar with no way to rebind keys! In no way is this acceptable! I would prefer to attack with my left mouse button. I know that the minions are supposed to fight for you, however, I would at times like to do some fighting of my own. Controlling the minions wasn't so bad at first, until I was controlling a large swarm of them. The clunkyness of the controls becomes evident later on as you gain access to more minions. You are however able to split them up into groups, which helps to a certain degree, but I still had issues when I would have 30-40 of each, all trying to collect something or kill a big monster. It felt like attempting to control a mouse through a maze that has a strong will of its own. You want it to do this, or go this way, but it just won't obey.\n\n2. Graphics: Being a seven-year-old game, it will of course not look as gorgeous as modern games. The art style is charming and fits a comical fantasy world such as this. I find certain character models to be humorous, especially the halfings. There are graphical issues, though. All of which I will mention below under the bugs section.\n\n3. Level-design: This aspect of the game really affected my enjoyment. Areas were quite large, thus requiring much backtracking. One of my main gripes in any game is excessive backtracking. About halfway through, I was in a forest. Without giving away any major spoilers, the task at hand was to take down some roots connected to a peculiar tree. Halfway through this ordeal, I had to go to an entirely new area to gain new minions just so I could progress in the previous aforementioned area. While it is nice to be introduced to new areas, having to move onto a new one abruptly was jarring.\n\n4. Characters & Story: I wish the overlord could speak. It would make for some interesting situations. While some interactions are amusing, most of the characters are forgettable, annoying, or just plain cheesy. As for the story, you are given quests for each area with more quests given to you along the way, which all contribute to a story in each area. Which, in turn, contributes to the overarching story of the big evil baddy conquering the world. There however isn't much to the story, nor much depth. A shame since a story is a big aspect when it comes to the overall experience of a game such as this.\n\n5. Bugs: This is what truly broke my experience with the game. At times there would be graphical glitches. Parts of the ground would't render properly as well as walls. There were Random crashes aplenty as well as random slowdowns on a high-end computer. Then came the infamous elevator bug\n\nElevator Bug: In order to progress in a later part of the game, you are required to find two missing levers to complete a rotating wheel. This wheel is used to raise an elevator. With the levers found, I directed my minions to move the wheel. The elevator arose. But something was wrong. When I tried to go inside, it would not go to the next area. I tried leaving the area, going back to the tower, even exiting the game and going back. Nothing worked. While not everyone may encounter this bug, is it one I encountered that stifled my ability to even finish the game.\n\nSidequest Bug: For contribution to the 100% chaotic ending, there is a sidequest in the starting area where you have the option to capture maidens for your tower. You must capture 10 of these maidens spread throughout the area. After finding 7/10, I came upon the next two. So I did what any overlord would do: Swarm them with 50 minions and have them carry her to the nearest portal! Muahaha! But, something was wrong. My minons carried both maidens to one specific spot and then they wouldn't budge. I ordered different minions to carry them. I captured them out of order. I exited the game and went back in. No matter what, they would always carry them to the same spot and not move. Thus, I was unable to finish the sidequest.\n\nTLDR Version:\n\nWhile this game starts out enjoyable with many quirks and amusing moments, it is full of many issues. Most of which become prevalent as your progress. The incessant bugs, controls, excessive backtracking, lack of intriguing characters and story as well as repetitiveness ultimately bring this game down. I unfortunately cannot recommend this game.","October 30, 2014","false","11.5"," 14 of 50 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","14","50","0","7"

I am writing this review, begging people not to suffer through it. The controls are confusing and never work right. The combat is so unbelievably boring that you dread every fight, and there are enemies constantly, making the game extremely annoying. The fights seem to play out randomly too. Sometimes, you can breeze through enemies no problem, but if you die or restart, the same place could feature a completely new set of rules. Many times have I restarted somewhere after killing several enemies with ease, to find much stronger enemies of the same type that constantly respawn. Who needs consistency i guess?\nThe minions themselves are impossible to control. Each color does something unique in combat, but they never seem to want to do it. Instead they will just stand there and let themselves die. They are supposed to attack automatically when set to a marker, but that is rare.\nThe game has some good qualities, but I can't seem to remember them over all the bad. There are several weapons and armor you can upgrade to, and you can imbue them with powers depending on what minions you put into them. These powers do not work. So there goes that nice feature.\nThere is a variety of spells, but I can't ever remember which F key is which of the 12 and I just end up forgetting about them entirely. Some of the spells are confusing to use also and they all drain your mana so quickly, there's almost no point in using them anyway\nAnd the game is looooongggg. Maybe...I 'm not sure actually. Yeah it is, 20 hours in and I'm almost done, I think. It just feels super long because its so dull and boring. It feels like it never ends. There is no story driving the game, you just kind of walk around (very slowly I might add) and just do stuff, killing enemies over and over.\nThe worst part is the game starts out ok, but the more I play it, the more I hate it. If I didn't beat every game I buy, I would have quit this one long ago.","March 31, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","2","22","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/recommended/11450/","anterk","Anterk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anterk/","730 products in account","Overlord is an action/strategy hybrid that has you ordering masses of weak minions about as an equally weak evil (or just evilish, depending on how you respond to the binary "choice" system) Overlord (heh, eh). Without your minions you suck, and small masses or individual minions suck worse. However, together you and the little red/green/brown/blue imps can form an unbeatable team of chaos...so long as you can master the controls and don't have too many technical issues.\n\nThe worst thing about this game are the controls. Overlord is an experience that demands a level of precision and skill that my controller and I are incapable of. Initially pleasant and open levels give way to tight-corners and enemy puzzles that require quick and accurate adaptation on the fly, yet the camera is incapable of keeping up. On the controller, the stick you would normally use for controlling the camera is used to guide your brain-challenged minions around the environment. Using the mouse allows for easier camera control, but I couldn't "send" my minions at anything when I tried it. The camera follows either you or a minion you're controlling, and if you're trying to move and control minions at the same time in tight spaces it has a tendency to freak out or try abrupt and nauseating angles. The camera has two settings, behind the back and top-down, but neither is useful.\n\nA terrible camera isn't a killer, but poor minion controls are. Later levels have you coordinating your four minion types by role: Greens back stab, Blues heal, Reds throw fireballs, and Browns soak up damage. You can pin and recall groups of minions to/from spots, but while the pin function is individual to your selected units the recall function will recall ALL units, which can easily and quickly ruin any plans you might have. The challenge of the game exacerbates this, as all minions but the Browns die extremely easily. The Blues are almost useless if not for their healing, and many enemies in later levels are entirely immune to the Reds. Additionally, the only way you may replenish your army is by killing certain enemies, while every new encounter seems designed to go through a sizable number of minions to just get it done (figuring everything out is usually the easy part). So, by the second to last boss fight I managed to run entirely out of the only minion who could do reliable damage to ANYTHING in the level, and the only way to earn my minions back would be through extensive, boring, stupid, ugly grinding.\n\nFinally, the game lags on my computer. Mostly it seems related to if/when I run ANYTHING in the background, but other times it slows down for no apparent reason. It's extremely odd, and makes no sense given the number of things I can otherwise run just fine.\n\nI want to recommend Overlord for the opportunity to play the leader of a mob of idiots, but the controls just ruin everything.","December 5, 2014","false","3.8"," 3 of 25 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","3","25","0","0"

And that's a bad sign...\n\nbut the absolutely worse of this game (objectively, apart from being boring for me), is the lack of a map. seriously I kept wandering around the forest, just going round, passing a lot of times for the same place. also there are no good quality (as in you can actually see something) maps out there.... that could have done.\n\nall in all, I can't really recommend this game, since *for me* it gets boring after a while, and it has no map so you keep wandering around without going anywhere. but I can understand that some people  like it. in fact, the minions are quite fun.\n\nluckily I got it almost free in a bundle, so it's not a great loss.\n\n\n","June 21, 2014","false","10.0"," 4 of 28 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","28","0","0"

I wasted SO MUCH TIME wandering around trying to find what I'm supposed to do next (the quest list gives you nothing).  The game is appallingly lacking in any direction, instruction, and guidance.  Eg. Some areas will indicate where you are going when moving from one zone to the next, by showing what that area is, but most DON'T.\nYou have to blindly wander to the new zone, wait for it to load, see whats there, then have to retreat (and another load), because it wasnt where you wanted to go.\n\nAt one point the game crashed out on me (just after getting the red minions), and now I cant get them again, cant find anything else to do that doesn't require them.  ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME.\n\nIve tried playing this game a few times over the years, and every time it ends up just being a boring wander around the countryside.  Its a great concept, nice graphics and sounds, and a sense of humour, but the playability aspect SUCKS, the controls are dodgy and cannot be easily changed, difficulty curves are all over the place (mostly too easy, then some too hard).  There is no story either (at least as far as I've been able to tolerate playing this piece of crap).\n\nDon't waste your money or the download...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syhmortis/recommended/11450/","syhmortis","Syhmortis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syhmortis/","133 products in account","The game "Dungeon Keeper" by Bullfrog Productions changed dungeon crawling into dungeon creating whereby the player was the evil at the heart of the dungeon and the goal was to stop the heroes. "Overlord" is another variation of taking the player out of the role of being the hero and into the shoes of the bad guy.\n\nThe game parodies the typical heroic RPG and the goal is to conquer the lands surrounding your great evil tower, which you can upgrade using the treasures you collect. Also, there are decorative options to get your tower looking good as well.\n\nYou can control vast armies of goblins to terrorize the people, collect treasures, and burn villages but to what degree is up to you. The goblins will often make silly comments or jesters while adventuring or pillaging which will make you laugh and chuckle to the very end.\n\nThere are various options for upgrading your equipment using the forge in the tower while the goblins automatically equip gear found during raids on the villages or you can direct the horde with a mouse click to a stash of gear to which they plunder and equip if possible—I saw one goblin put a pumpkin on its head for a helmet.\n\nThe controls for the horde of goblins are very simple and easy to navigate. You even have the option of splitting the horde into smaller groups and covering more area. Several puzzles will make for a challenge and require you to adjust the type of goblin in your group like melee, range, or magic in order to move forward.\n\nWhile the main goal is to conquer the lands through ruthlessness or mercy, you also have achievements you can collect and a statistics which shows the amount of total devastation you brought upon the people, which encourages replay.\n\nI recommend the game if you want an action-adventure and RPG game that is hilariously witty but challenging. I also recommend purchasing the expansion which adds even more entertainment and fun.","July 12, 2012","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you ever admired the Dark Lord, looking badass, destroying world and killing those pesky heroes? Well, then, this game is for you! Without further delay, lets sink into the fantastic (and sarcastic) world of Overlord!\n\nThe "bad guy" game market is severelly limited. Everywhere we are feeded with either Goody McGood heroes, fighting to save the world or with shallow concept of being gray and developing our character the way we want to (shallow being either ♥♥♥♥ing rainbows knight in shining armor or baby killing maniac). You wont see that here. Instead, we are evil from the start. And that's what making this game fun.\n\nGameplay is really basic sadly. We are the Overlord. We need to rebuild empire. But Overlord doesn't just go around killing stuff, oh no. He have his minions for that. So we are running around with bunch of our Imps, killing things, collecting stuff to upgrade our tower and (of course) doing some fairly easy puzzles. The style is kinda like Zelda. We need some item or other thing to advance further, we collect it, defeat the boss with that, go to another area, rince and repeat.\n\nGraphics are really beatiful. This game aged well, giving nice vibe even so long after the golden release. Locations are colorful and alive yet distinct, there are things moving everywhere, light effects are well made. The olny thing I can really dissaprove of are the overall sugar-like appearances of every single location, but the game have it's (gigantic dose) of humour, and exaggeration pays a big role in that.\n\nMusic is on par with graphics. Really exaggerated, yet well made and distinct. Sounds are great. Every single detal from random people dialogs to battle sounds are great.\n\nStory is great. We are the Overlord, taking over the world yet again. At our path there will be much obstacles, including corrupted heroes, lack of resources and other natural or unnatural calamities. Narration is smooth and plot twists are well done. We even have the pleasure of having a wife here, and Overlord is not your average multihour RPG.\n\nBad things? Well, for starters all our work is done by minions. I won't say its technically bad, but our Overlord can't do crap. Its kind of stupid, we are the antihero of this world. The other thing, because the game is strongly influenced by Zelda franchise, we can't really talk about open world RPG or exploration all that much. Oh, we can go to the previous locations to loot additional stuff with our new powers (it's unattainable otherwise, the easiest example would be Imp Pillars in the water, we can't get them, until we get Blue Imps), but we need to go from point A to B on a series of semi-linear locations in order to progress with the story. Also our Overlord can't be developed all that much. More minions, stronger armor and weapon and minion types. Sadly that's all.\n\nWell, if you we're spending all nights in Dungeon Keeper, this game is for you. It have great sense of humor (and a bit of self awareness), nice graphics, enjoyable and easy gameplay, and, of course, you play as the bad guy. Its a good piece, althou technically not a RPG, and sadly, kind of short. But hey, its Zelda on crack, so it can't be all that bad! I would recommend this game to anyone from new to experienced players. Go! Conquer the world, Overlord!\n\nZawisza out.","January 19, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that is because no other game has a control scheme quite like this and it takes some getting used to. The game helps as much as it can in this regard, sucking you in and immersing you with appealing visuals and audio. Before long you will have a firm grasp of the fine art of minion swarming and will be well on your way to becoming the Dark Lord you always wanted to be.\n\nThis game is so original and fresh.

It just makes me smile every time I load it up. It's always satisfying to watch your horde of minions smash things, swarm enemies and gosh darnit, they're just so happy to serve you. It's the most warm and fuzzy game you'll ever play while being a maniacal, all powerful villain. The sequel and spinoffs are good too, but in my opinion? This one will always be the best. The gameplay is solid, the minions are lovable little boogers, it's funny and has endless charm. It's a great game for 5 bucks. And if you can get it on sale? It's an even better deal for hours of gameplay.\n\nOn another note, I used to own this game for a console, and I personally like the mouse and keyboard setup better. It makes it easier for me to think of The Overlord and the Minions as two seperate entities rather than bunching them together on a controller. But it'll probably come down how you personally prefer it.","September 6, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful for its time and it reminds one of Fable when playing. (Though I'm not 100% sure, I believe some of the same voice actors are present in this game)\n\nBasically, you are awakened as the new Overlord and your first priority is to retrieve the 3 lost Minion clans which each have special powers of their own. Browns (Your starters) have all the power. Greens (Your assassins) are a lethal group, though they can't take the hits as much as the browns. Reds ( Can dish out the long distant damage and are great for area advantages such as ledges and whatnot) One hit and they are goners. Lastly, the Blues (Revivers) that's pretty much all they can, oh and they're the only ones who can defeat magical creatures.\n\n6 hours in and there is already a mass amount of content. For starters, you can customize your very own tower. Everything from banner colors to so much more. Then there is the arena, in which you and your minion horde takes on foes in which you've already defeated. There is the smelter, in which you make new armour/weapons and upgrade your current armour/weapons as well as your minions attack and defense as well. And also..well so far..that's I'll I've gotten.\n\nIt's exciting viewing the beautiful scenery as well as the hearing the crude humor which this game offers. It's a great laugh. Though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of story present, that's not a problem. You are mostly doing random quests and deciding whether or not to grow your corruption level. Killing equals more corruption. Not killing..is pretty much being good.\n\nThere is quite a bit of strategy involved which is nice. Example, certain trolls will wave their arms before hurdling themselves in the air and doing body slams. Your job is to notice this signal, call your minions back (sparing them such a horrible fate) an finally throwing them back in their after it's landed. Figuring these things out is exciting on it's own.\n\nOverall, the Fable nostalgic feel I get from the graphics and certain characters in this game make it a pretty great game, for me at least. Also, the gameplay as well. I start feeling connected to my little guys and though it's not necessary, I always tend to see myself in the mix of battle. The content which you get for the price in fantastic, but if you want more, it's worth the cash to get Raising Hell instead, simply because it's an expansion to this game.\n\nThe only cons for this game involve the random minion glitches. Occasionally, the minions will be carrying items and simply stop. Even if nothing is blocking their paths. Also, minions themselves tend to get stuck in or under objects as well, but not too often. This usually occurs when some of your other minions are carrying items and they just happen to get in the way. Overall, They do a phenomenal job following your orders, only 1 time have I had a minion lost and I've had to backtrack it.","May 25, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humour is what sells this game.\n\nGiven that FUN is what many (almost all) consider the point of video games (and that's wrong mind, but irrelevent here), you'd really expect more games to be funny. I really don't get why they're so sparse. Granted, big difference between comedic elements, comic relief, and comedy -- even bigger difference between a comedy and a full-blown . . .giggle-fest? Yeah, giggle-fest.\n\nThis game is a comedy, through and through -- in an almost classical (Greek) sense actually. Snarky wit, situational juxtaposition, exaggeration, and something that in a twisted way could actually be called romance.\n\nBasic RPG elements, and that's all it needed -- it's a nice little adventure.\n\nCheers for a good romp and no few laughs.","February 13, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are pretty good with a bit of tweaking, and the graphics, while nowhere near the level of Skyrim, look good for most aspects. The quirky humor thrown in is often rather entertaining.\n\nThe main downside for me would be the controls. If using an adapter and (I assume) non-360 controller, the defaults are awkward and incomplete. The game also doesn't explain a few functions, making some abilities a bit challenging to find - particularly, actively repositioning the stationary "guard marker" to move your goblins around; I thought it was stuck where it was set for most of the game.","December 27, 2011","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The minions are quite hilarious and you grow quite attatched to some of them, even though they are all generic and exactly the same in appearence (they only differ by what random objects they pick up to wear as armor, or weild as weapons. My favourite was having an army of Minions wearing feoras and weilding boquets of flowers).\n\nTL;DR - The game has a great sense of humour and stylish presentation.

It has good gamplay and a nice chunk of humour. Keep in mind though that there is no serious plot in it, as it relies on its humour.\n\nIn the game you control minions along with the main character, which is, the Overlord. The Overlord is fairly squishy alone, but is capable of doing decent damage. This is where the minions come handy. They can overwhelm opponents with their numbers, leaving the Overlord out of harms way.\n\nThere are four types of minions. Brown, Red, Green and Blue. Every type has their own special abilities and uses. Brown minions lack a special quality, but are the thoughest in a fight. Reds throw fireballs, are immune to fire and can extinguish fires blocking your way. Greens are immune to poison and can remove toxic fumes. Blues can go into water without drowning.\n\nThen there is your tower. In the tower you can forge armor and weapons for the Overlord to use, customize its looks and you can even get a mistress there. Yay. There is also a teleporter, which you can use to get to places you have visited previously.\n\nThe music in this game fits it very well. The soundtrack is not awesome, but as stated, it fits the games setting and helps set up the atmosphere. Visuals are nice for such a old game. The animations looked a bit awkward in certain situations, but it kind of just adds to the humour. One might even think that they were made awkward on purpose. Heh.\n\nOverall this game has a lot of good points and a very few bad ones. The controls for the gamepad did feel a bit "iffy", so I'd recommend using a keyboard and a mouse. If I had to name to biggest issue I have with the game, I'd have to say it's the fact that you can't save manually. Anywho, this game is definetly worth picking up if you're looking for a humorous and lighthearted RPG.","September 7, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It just makes me smile every time I load it up. It's always satisfying to watch your horde of minions smash things, swarm enemies and gosh darnit, they're just so happy to serve you. It's the most warm and fuzzy game you'll ever play while being a maniacal, all powerful villain. The sequel and spinoffs are good too, but in my opinion? This one will always be the best. The gameplay is solid, the minions are lovable little boogers, it's funny and has endless charm. It's a great game for 5 bucks. And if you can get it on sale? It's an even better deal for hours of gameplay.\n\nOn another note, I used to own this game for a console, and I personally like the mouse and keyboard setup better.

It has good gamplay and a nice chunk of humour. Keep in mind though that there is no serious plot in it, as it relies on its humour.\n\nIn the game you control minions along with the main character, which is, the Overlord. The Overlord is fairly squishy alone, but is capable of doing decent damage. This is where the minions come handy. They can overwhelm opponents with their numbers, leaving the Overlord out of harms way.\n\nThere are four types of minions. Brown, Red, Green and Blue. Every type has their own special abilities and uses. Brown minions lack a special quality, but are the thoughest in a fight. Reds throw fireballs, are immune to fire and can extinguish fires blocking your way. Greens are immune to poison and can remove toxic fumes. Blues can go into water without drowning.\n\nThen there is your tower. In the tower you can forge armor and weapons for the Overlord to use, customize its looks and you can even get a mistress there. Yay. There is also a teleporter, which you can use to get to places you have visited previously.\n\nThe music in this game fits it very well. The soundtrack is not awesome, but as stated, it fits the games setting and helps set up the atmosphere. Visuals are nice for such a old game. The animations looked a bit awkward in certain situations, but it kind of just adds to the humour. One might even think that they were made awkward on purpose. Heh.\n\nOverall this game has a lot of good points and a very few bad ones. The controls for the gamepad did feel a bit "iffy", so I'd recommend using a keyboard and a mouse. If I had to name to biggest issue I have with the game, I'd have to say it's the fact that you can't save manually. Anywho, this game is definetly worth picking up if you're looking for a humorous and lighthearted RPG.","September 7, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its hilarious approach is similar to that of Dungeon Keeper. The Overlord you control has the ability to control dozens of so-called minions - creatures that do the fighting and looting on behalf of you. This is a must as the Overlord cannot kill a handful of enemies single-handedly.\n\nThere are 4 types of minions each with unique abilities so the game requires you to carefully think about which race you want to send into battle against what kind of an enemy. The blue ones can cross water while the green ones are good against giant ogre-like creatures as they can jump on their back to swiftly eliminate them. Reds prefer ranged attacks while the browns are best at melee - and if all else fails the blue ones can revive your fallen soldiers.\n\nYour minions are hilarious along with some of the sidequests you need to complete. The main quest is basically a quest for revenge - your predecessor was killed by heroes and you need to take revenge for what they have done. It is a nice touch that the developers included a so-called corruption level: you can eliminate innocent townsfolk that will only make you more corrupt. This will eventually change the way you look like and the behaviour from these people around you.\n\nYou can retreat to your own tower occasionally where you can carry out some upgrades depending on the looted items you have found throughout the game. There are also visual upgrades such as changing banners or statues. Single-player campaign offers a long and funny story and the game is getting gradually more challenging along the way.\n\nOverlord is a funny game! Other than Dungeon Keeper I cannot recall anything with a similar approach towards being evil which can only be fun in such games. It's worth picking up its bundle version which includes an expansion pack as well as the sequel to Overlord.\n","March 28, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Minnions are so well developed, with personality, wit, and very funny actions. The story is well told but a bit lite. The world is very well designed and allows plenty of adventuring and revisiting areas is even encouraged. The colors and objects are bright and bold. This game takes some tactical strategy to play well. You can fight each encounter in many different styles depending how you mix and match your 4 different minnion types. They four are very different and your decision on how many of each type to travel with changes every encounter. There isn't another game like this ... and that uniqueness really makes this game stand out. The RPG element of improving your armor and weapons also extends to improving your different minnions and your own magic spells. I played for hours just because it was so much fun. I never felt compelled to advance the story any faster than I felt like going. The replay value of this game is very high. Even when you know all the plot points that will advance the story there is still some much variety that you can try to complete area's time and again with different mixes of minions and new tactics.

Seems like it would be a micromanagement game, but ends up more being about 'look how many things I can put on one thing'. Reasonable difficulty curve later in the game, but the pace is fair. Controlling different types of minion for different jobs is pretty neat, and doesn't get clunky or frustrating. Using left and right click to move an entire unit of minions gets frustrating at times. Moral choices seem out of place a tad, choosing to be either 'evil but fair' or 'total ♥♥♥♥' isn't really satisfying more than just the cosmetic effects of 'my armor is now shiney or spikey' in which case the Raising Hell DLC totally removes for a unique armor set that makes the moral choice entirely pointless for the visual feedback as it stays the way it looks from crafting, rather than evolving to suit your level of evil.

I remember playing it with my friend when it first came out. The 75% off deal on Steam was a no brainer for me.\n\nMy minions are quite an interesting bunch, some of them have actual helmets, but the rest thought that frying pans, a crown, skulls, dead possums or pumpkins would probably give decent head protection. Other than that, the voice over and cut scenes are great.\n\nIf you want to take a break from being mr. niceguy, and need a good laugh to forget about your day; buy this.\nJust don't expect this to be a game you will be playing for weeks on end.","February 21, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But seeing how it was only a dollar, and has very favorable reviews, I decided to take the plunge and blow my pocket change.\n\nLet me tell you, that was the best dollar I ever spent.\n\nThis game is just amazing, addicting, and hilarious. It is a parody/satire of the traditional RPG genre, and at the same time somewhat of a RTS. Even though the graphics are a little dated, you won't notice once you start smashing villages and goons around with your gremlin army. In most ways it is just a normal RPG, while there is no "leveling", there are upgrades to make you more powerful for your armor and your minions, who will be doing mostly ALL of the fighting for you. Infact, your character is really just there to provide support, as the bulk of the combat is mainly just you micro managing your minions and making sure they dont suicide dive a group of goons. But with that being said, the minions are very well polished and dont often do stupid things unless you tell them too. I really am shocked at how well they are programmed, considering this game is almost 8 years old from the writing of this. It really does hold up very well, and as I am sitting here I can't think of one bad thing that bothered me over the course of me playing it.\n\nMy favorite part though isn't the unique combat system, but the characters and the world in general. The game is just one big parody on almost every typical RPG ever made. This time around, you are the "anti" hero, whose sole goal is to be evil. But trust me, the only evil that is being done is too your gut, because I found myself laughing very often at the general silliness of the characters and the narration by Gnarl, your guide of all things evil, and the simpletons who guide your quests- erm sorry your "evil" conquests. The whole world is just tongue-in-cheek really, it is just a goofy atmosphere to be in and it is simply marvelous.\n\nThere really isn't any reason not to buy this game, I can safely say that many people will not have had a previous experience like this before. I sure hadn't and I've been playing RPGs for a very long time and have played QUITE a bit of my fair share of them as well. Even if it's not on sale, I still urge you to take the $5 hit, which is still relatively cheap really for a game of such calliber.\n\nI really hate putting numbers on VG reviews, but in this case I will make a rare exception. For the sheer shock of finding such a quality game, and at the price I paid for it. There is only one score I see fit for it.\n\n10/10\nEvil always finds a way ;)","February 21, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HaunterInk/recommended/11450/","HaunterInk","HaunterInk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HaunterInk/","24 products in account","This is an amazingly fun game. The graphics are beautiful for its time and it reminds one of Fable when playing. (Though I'm not 100% sure, I believe some of the same voice actors are present in this game)\n\nBasically, you are awakened as the new Overlord and your first priority is to retrieve the 3 lost Minion clans which each have special powers of their own. Browns (Your starters) have all the power. Greens (Your assassins) are a lethal group, though they can't take the hits as much as the browns. Reds ( Can dish out the long distant damage and are great for area advantages such as ledges and whatnot) One hit and they are goners. Lastly, the Blues (Revivers) that's pretty much all they can, oh and they're the only ones who can defeat magical creatures.\n\n6 hours in and there is already a mass amount of content. For starters, you can customize your very own tower. Everything from banner colors to so much more. Then there is the arena, in which you and your minion horde takes on foes in which you've already defeated. There is the smelter, in which you make new armour/weapons and upgrade your current armour/weapons as well as your minions attack and defense as well. And also..well so far..that's I'll I've gotten.\n\nIt's exciting viewing the beautiful scenery as well as the hearing the crude humor which this game offers. It's a great laugh. Though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of story present, that's not a problem. You are mostly doing random quests and deciding whether or not to grow your corruption level. Killing equals more corruption. Not killing..is pretty much being good.\n\nThere is quite a bit of strategy involved which is nice. Example, certain trolls will wave their arms before hurdling themselves in the air and doing body slams. Your job is to notice this signal, call your minions back (sparing them such a horrible fate) an finally throwing them back in their after it's landed. Figuring these things out is exciting on it's own.\n\nOverall, the Fable nostalgic feel I get from the graphics and certain characters in this game make it a pretty great game, for me at least. Also, the gameplay as well. I start feeling connected to my little guys and though it's not necessary, I always tend to see myself in the mix of battle. The content which you get for the price in fantastic, but if you want more, it's worth the cash to get Raising Hell instead, simply because it's an expansion to this game.\n\nThe only cons for this game involve the random minion glitches. Occasionally, the minions will be carrying items and simply stop. Even if nothing is blocking their paths. Also, minions themselves tend to get stuck in or under objects as well, but not too often. This usually occurs when some of your other minions are carrying items and they just happen to get in the way. Overall, They do a phenomenal job following your orders, only 1 time have I had a minion lost and I've had to backtrack it.","May 25, 2014","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is so fun because not only do you feel powerful. but you feel unstoppable! The game has tons of quests! It took me five hours to complete all the quests in  the first area. You can choose to be an evil force to be reckoned or a heroic force to be reckoned with. You can even customize your tower! How freaking cool is that! It's a pretty funny game as well. You can beat the crap out of your court jester, feed your minions and watch them pee after they finish their food and drink, slaughter hobbit-like creatures called halflings and their morbily obese king, and a whole lot more.\nThe game is kind of linear but the areas are pretty big. I say they're linear because usually the way of traveling around are pathways that connect in someway.  Still it doesn't bother me because there is a lot to explore. Now, about forging. Whenever you forge and item whether it be weapons or armor, you have to use minions to do so. The more minions you use the more powerful the item you are making or upgrading will become.\nMinions come in four types. Brown, red, green, and blue. Brown are your standard minions. They are just mainly used for fighting. Red are invunrable to fire. Green are invunrable to poisonous fumes, and blue can enter water.\nI highly recommend this game!","January 24, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you ever admired the Dark Lord, looking badass, destroying world and killing those pesky heroes? Well, then, this game is for you! Without further delay, lets sink into the fantastic (and sarcastic) world of Overlord!\n\nThe "bad guy" game market is severelly limited. Everywhere we are feeded with either Goody McGood heroes, fighting to save the world or with shallow concept of being gray and developing our character the way we want to (shallow being either ♥♥♥♥ing rainbows knight in shining armor or baby killing maniac). You wont see that here. Instead, we are evil from the start. And that's what making this game fun.\n\nGameplay is really basic sadly. We are the Overlord. We need to rebuild empire. But Overlord doesn't just go around killing stuff, oh no. He have his minions for that. So we are running around with bunch of our Imps, killing things, collecting stuff to upgrade our tower and (of course) doing some fairly easy puzzles. The style is kinda like Zelda. We need some item or other thing to advance further, we collect it, defeat the boss with that, go to another area, rince and repeat.\n\nGraphics are really beatiful. This game aged well, giving nice vibe even so long after the golden release. Locations are colorful and alive yet distinct, there are things moving everywhere, light effects are well made. The olny thing I can really dissaprove of are the overall sugar-like appearances of every single location, but the game have it's (gigantic dose) of humour, and exaggeration pays a big role in that.\n\nMusic is on par with graphics. Really exaggerated, yet well made and distinct. Sounds are great. Every single detal from random people dialogs to battle sounds are great.\n\nStory is great. We are the Overlord, taking over the world yet again. At our path there will be much obstacles, including corrupted heroes, lack of resources and other natural or unnatural calamities. Narration is smooth and plot twists are well done. We even have the pleasure of having a wife here, and Overlord is not your average multihour RPG.\n\nBad things? Well, for starters all our work is done by minions. I won't say its technically bad, but our Overlord can't do crap. Its kind of stupid, we are the antihero of this world. The other thing, because the game is strongly influenced by Zelda franchise, we can't really talk about open world RPG or exploration all that much. Oh, we can go to the previous locations to loot additional stuff with our new powers (it's unattainable otherwise, the easiest example would be Imp Pillars in the water, we can't get them, until we get Blue Imps), but we need to go from point A to B on a series of semi-linear locations in order to progress with the story. Also our Overlord can't be developed all that much. More minions, stronger armor and weapon and minion types. Sadly that's all.\n\nWell, if you we're spending all nights in Dungeon Keeper, this game is for you. It have great sense of humor (and a bit of self awareness), nice graphics, enjoyable and easy gameplay, and, of course, you play as the bad guy. Its a good piece, althou technically not a RPG, and sadly, kind of short. But hey, its Zelda on crack, so it can't be all that bad! I would recommend this game to anyone from new to experienced players. Go! Conquer the world, Overlord!\n\nZawisza out.","January 19, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're evil, and so are your minions, so you don't feel bad when your minions die, and the gameplay tends more toward the dungeon aspect than the overworld part, with conquest being your main goal and treasure a side bonus, rather than the other way around.\n\nAlso you have an overlord base and it's amazing.\n\nMinions are somehow adorable and hideous at the same time, it's creepy.\n\nControls can be a bit clunky at times, but you only really notice it when your minion squad keeps running into walls when you're trying to make them pick up their weapon bonuses.","April 9, 2012","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well firstly, there are very subtle, but interesting RPG elements. Yeah, there’s the usual stuff like finding upgrades, but you can also sacrifice minions to make more powerful equipment. You also have the ability to completely remodel your fortress from the ground up, get maidens, and all kinds of fun stuff.\n\nNevermind that the games are hilarious. Everything from the minions to the townsfolk to the corrupted heroes to the “good guys”…just plain funny. It’s almost like Warioland, except medieval, and less about platforming. Really, the only way the games fail is in the fact that they doesn’t do RTS very well.

And they are just so incredibly enthousiastic at sacrificing themselves for you that you just have to smile (In an evil way of course).\n\nYou will even use them to create better armor and weapons for your lord by throing them directly in the furnace in your forge.\n\nThe game world is a nice "classical fantasy gone wrong" wher you finally get to play as absolute evil, or just slightly evil if you prefer. Both have their up and down side.\nTrue, hearing "For YOUUUUU!" a lot can get a bit annoying at times, but that is a common problem with soundbytes in games isn't it.\n\nIf you can get it with the expansion pack, do so because it contains a few of the most excellent levels in the game and leads to the events of Overlord 2.","December 5, 2015","true","50.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is packed with some decently dark and impish humour, the setting is glorious and the gameplay is fun and addicting. Unlike other games, which put you in place of the hero, you deliberately play a villain in this one. Why is that so important? Because this game lets you play this role any way you like. Keep the civilians alive and you get access to certain areas and some upgrades, kill them off and you get corrupt, causing you to become stronger yourself. Every choice you make has an impact on the game world, and this game knows how to make you feel that it actually had an impact.\nThe gameplay needs some minor tweaking on the minions' AI, but else it plays well, even with the Keyboard and Mouse. The controls are complex, yet easy to learn, and it has a significant level of challenge at some points in the game.\nThe graphics still hold up today, which is a hard thing for a game from 8 years ago. And best of all: You can even kick your own minions around if you feel like beating someone's face without killing anyone.\n- - - - - - - - - -\nGameplay: 8/10\nControls: 8/10\nDifficulty: 7/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nAddictive: Definitely, it's so much fun to play\n- - - - - - - - - -\nWorth buying: Of course.

Aight? THIS game. Lets you become an overlord.\n\nI mean sure, it's the only successful Overlord game that CodeMasters made at the time I am writing this review, but this one holds a special place near my heart.\n\nSo here is my review of the game!\n\n-Synopsis-\n\nBasically, you play as an amnesiac that has been saved by these little goblins/gremlins/imps/fiends known as 'minions'. ... And no, not the yellow pill/potato shaped guys in the Despicable Me Franchise. Technically, this game came before Despicable Me, so I would like to think that Gru is more ripping off of the Overlord. The guy YOU play as. He is ripping YOU off! ... But anyway...\n\nAs a result from being saved by them, they expect you to command the horde around for the purposes of killing your foes, breaking objects, stealing valuables, and harvesting resources.\n\nKill your enemies with an axe, the most balanced melee weapon you can wield in the early game, where later, you can upgrade the weapon or get new weapons made from better metals with better smelters you find in your travels. Or alternatively, use your minions to kill your enemies for you. They are the backbone to your evil rule after all! But if you find that your enemies need a more 'personal touch', magic adds a little salt to their injury.\n\n-Pros-\n\nThe gameplay is wonderfully simple, as all you need to do is just be evil! The game even gives you the choice of being merciful or tyrannical. Choosing the corrupted tyrannical path has instant gratification and can get you a lot of resources early. Or you can choose to be merciful. I won't judge you if you would rather save some people and forgo the money. ... But it's still a waste of that money that would be more useful being in your treasury.\n\nSimply put, you are the Overlord, and you lay waste to the land on how you see fit.\n\nAnd the DLC known as Raising Hell? A recommendable buy as it adds more items and more places to adventure.\n\n-Cons-\n\nThis game goes far back to the age of 2007, so expect the graphics and animations to be slightly... lackluster. The control scheme on the keyboard feels unwieldy than being on the controller since I can look freely around using the mouse, though using the F1-F12 keys to select spells felt very awkward. This game WAS designed to be played on a controller of course.\n\nThen there is the grind for resources. Ooooooh the grinding can take a long time if you don't know what your doing. Even though the resources are easy to get, they usually come in small quantities in most areas, and one would find oneself returning to your tower and then coming back to the land to raid more things. Or simply go to the dungeon and fight enemies in there. Another sad con that I noticed was that there is absolutely no mana regeneration. I mean sure, you can find mana potions in chests and can sacrifice minions to a mana pit to regain mana, or alternatively go back into your dark tower to instantly restore all your health and mana. There is even an armor upgrade that enables you to regenerate your health, but not your mana for some reason. And I do like to cast my most destructive spells sometimes.:3\n\n-Rating-\n\nI give this game a 4/5, and recommend this game to those who would want to tickle the evil bone in their body someday.\n\n(Hell, I even like this game so much that I wrote some fanfiction on it. YES. FANFICTION. I ADMITTED IT.)","February 28","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play the villain out to conquer various heroes and the Overlord world.  You have four groups of minions at your disposal each with their own unique ability.  The game requires a bit of strategy and puzzle solving, it's not just a brute force type of game, though in certain situations, brute force does work.  Fantasy and dark comedy elements also had to the gameplay.  Great visual colors and a decent story that comes through at the end. Classic game.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nOverlord I is much harder than Overlord II, not sure why.  The minion AI isn't as good as II and sometimes the armored ones will dies because of camera difficulty or they will do something you do not want, which requires constant monitoring of minions during battle. This becomes annoying and time consuming, but that's really my only complaint.

Overall, I had a lot of fun playing, the biggest drawback to me is a lack of replayability. You have a few choices to make in the game, and they do affect the game to some degree, but they're pretty superficial, and did not make me want to see what happens if I choose differently too much.

Frustrating Gameplay & Conflicted Themes Doesn't Make One Evil.Genre: 3rd Person Tactical RPG.\nDeveloped & Published by: Triumph Studios and Codemasters\nPlatform: Windows only.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Expansion.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nOriginally posted by Overlord: Raising Hell Steam Description:How evil can you get? Discover how corruptible you are in Overlord, the twisted fantasy action adventure where you can be evil (or really evil). In the game's seriously warped fantasy world, players will become the Overlord and get first-hand experience of how absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nTo me, this paragraph is describing another game entirely. It's one case of marketing that I could argue negatively affected my impression, and eventual review, of a game. I did create a review several years back but I've returned after several years to make it informational and useful to you, the reader. So, let's begin.\n\nOverall Story Thoughts\nOverlord is a quirky cartoonish game sure, but a dark twisted fantasy adventure where you get to be really evil? I disagree. It’s true that people who do evil deeds don’t feel evil or in the wrong when they’re doing them. But...well...let's talk about the story. In the game, you're setup as some sort of evil Overlord, tasked with bringing darkness and ruin to the world along with the help of your minions. So, you go out into the world and destroy people who are more evil than you and bring peace….and prosperity….to the land. Ok, that's one way it ends. The other way the story ends is that you create a land ruled by fear and your power's corruption and devastation of the lands. But all it does is affect the ending cutscene, not the game itself. Well, it doesn't affect it that much. I really don't like games that set me up to think that my in-game actions will affect the world when all it really does is affect the end cutscene.\n\nThis game doesn't really let you be an evil overlord during the course of play. Part of which is to be blamed on the more comedic, cutesy tones present throughout the story. You can’t just randomly kill people if you wish, only in special circumstances. While you can set fire to wheat fields, slaughter sheep and destroy all the kegs of beer you can see, they just regrow back as soon as you leave. I get that it needs to be that way for gameplay reasons but it’s hard to feel evil when you know what you’re doing isn’t really harming anyone. If anything, I just feel more like a destroyer of boxes than a ruler of all that is dark and evil. I can’t even make children cry at the sight of me! I mean, c'mon. What is this...\n\nAll that said, it does make for a decent time as more of a comedic/light fantasy story than a dark tale of power & corruption. Characters are two dimensional and stereotypical but the interactions can be somewhat amusing at times. Especially between the Overlord and the town citizens. All typical fantasy creatures can be found here. Drunken Dwarves, Ethereal Elves, Portly Halflings, Dumb Trolls and more are in this world, serving the part they play in most any other fantasy genre. You get to see a decent variety of locations too. But there wasn't much that surprised me.\n\nGameplay Thoughts\nYou control up to 100 minions and an unnamed overlord at the same time. The overlord gets a melee attack chain and the use of spells but he should generally stay out of the fight. Otherwise, you'll wind up running out of health and mana extremely fast. So, you'll be playing most of the game through your four types of minions:\nBrown melee minions that will generally make up the cannon fodder of your army.\nRed fireball throwing minions that are immune to fire.\nGreen poison immune minions that will backstab enemies.\nBlue minion reviving ones that are immune to water and have weaker attacks. It’s a decent variety of minions but the game lacks in tactical decision making. Just send swarms of minions at your enemies and recall if you notice a big telegraphed attack coming. That’s really about the sum of the combat. Most of the time you’ll be losing minions because the controls didn't respond or you didn't see a hazard in time. That or they become stuck on doing whatever activity you "assigned" them or in the terrain. The sweeping function doesn't help matters either as it has the same issues. It’s more tiresome than enjoyable to deal with these controls when multiple types of hazards/enemies are present in a level. One last thing: I was fighting the camera more than I felt necessary for a 3rd person game which doesn't help the already frustrating gameplay. You have very limited control over it.\n\nPC Settings & Multiplayer\nI never did get a chance to experience multiplayer because the servers were shutdown after Overlord II was released. You can play online through Hamachi but the community has no doubt suffered. There is a split-screen mode though, that’s rather unusual for a PC-centric title. Graphics settings are solid. Resolution options, AA slider, V-Sync, Texture/Debris/View distance sliders are here as well. FOV is missing but you probably won’t need it. Audio sliders are present as well and it supports up to 8.1 speaker systems which is nice. Mouse and Keyboard function well enough but I think controller is the preferred control scheme. Even with a controller, the game feels like it’s fighting me the entire time. The game is getting on to be 8 years old now and it is rather disappointing that the framerate doesn't stay consistent. I noticed even on my current machine that it would fluctuate between 50-60 fps during the first level. I don't think it's enough to be a deal breaker but I wonder how bad it would be to play some of the later levels again.\n\nOverlord: Raising Hell Expansion Thoughts\nIt’s not worth it. Half of it is challenge levels with a minor amount of story attached and the other half of it is maps for the now non-functioning multiplayer. Unless you really enjoy the mechanics of controlling your minions and want to challenge yourself to a new level of frustration, this expansion is a pass. Oh and keep in mind that the original game won’t launch if the expansion is installed. Not a big deal but something I should mention here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI don’t recommend Overlord or Overlord: Raising Hell. While there are glimpses of really fun gameplay, it eventually gets worse over time. Frustration set in long before the game ended and there’s a constant sense of repetition and I want this to end already that plagues the latter half. It just becomes a long grind. Between that and the quirky controls/minion behavior, it leaves a lot to be desired. Additionally, there is a ton of backtracking. The story itself is...ok. Its not awful but its not very memorable either. It seems at odds with itself on whether you're a good guy or bad guy. Outside of smacking minions around, destroying some buildings and killing a few people, you don’t really feel like a true Overlord to me. You just feel like an anti-hero who's a jerk when all I'm doing is defeating corrupted heroes, saving the townspeople from starvation and being a generally good guy. It's a decent enough 3rd person "RTS" game but I think it could have been much better given more attention to its gameplay.\n\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]A Paladin's Review: Overlord 2.

After beating it I can say it's not bad at all. If you liked Fabel, you will love this. You play a rescued Overlord who is made to rule over his minions. The gameplay is alot like a hack and slash RPG meets Strategy. The games currency is split into Gold and Life force. You need lifeforce to spawn minions, so you can expect a bit of grinding....\n\nYeah the game gets that whole "Third Person action game with RTS elements" right, unlike Brutal Legends. Controlling minions takes a bit of learning, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bothersome at all.\n\nThe real joy is the core parts of the game i.e. the minion controlling and puzzling. The remaining parts of the game aren't exciting...I'm talking about the action, story, upgrading and customizing part. The Upgrading and customizing part are More like "They're there so I'll take it". The Overlords combat mechanics are silly, but minions make up for it.\n\nLastly, the part about you being Evil.

A game where you take on the role of an evil overlord commanding a group of less-than-civil goblins, this game combines interesting story, solid gameplay, and strategy with a taste of laughing gas. It's hard to take anything seriously in this game when your goblin minions are more intent on being silly and disruptive than killing (unless you command them, of course-they always listen to their eeevil Overlord), especially when there's an entire mechanic around booting your minions to the ground. Seriously, those goblins are so adorable, it's actually heartbreaking when one that's been with you on many adventures falls dead. Which happens often.\nThis really is a feel-good game. It's always good for a laugh and brightening your day... although it may be a bit rough jumping back into the middle of it if you take a long hiatus.","March 24","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aight? THIS game. Lets you become an overlord.\n\nI mean sure, it's the only successful Overlord game that CodeMasters made at the time I am writing this review, but this one holds a special place near my heart.\n\nSo here is my review of the game!\n\n-Synopsis-\n\nBasically, you play as an amnesiac that has been saved by these little goblins/gremlins/imps/fiends known as 'minions'. ... And no, not the yellow pill/potato shaped guys in the Despicable Me Franchise. Technically, this game came before Despicable Me, so I would like to think that Gru is more ripping off of the Overlord. The guy YOU play as. He is ripping YOU off! ... But anyway...\n\nAs a result from being saved by them, they expect you to command the horde around for the purposes of killing your foes, breaking objects, stealing valuables, and harvesting resources.\n\nKill your enemies with an axe, the most balanced melee weapon you can wield in the early game, where later, you can upgrade the weapon or get new weapons made from better metals with better smelters you find in your travels. Or alternatively, use your minions to kill your enemies for you. They are the backbone to your evil rule after all! But if you find that your enemies need a more 'personal touch', magic adds a little salt to their injury.\n\n-Pros-\n\nThe gameplay is wonderfully simple, as all you need to do is just be evil! The game even gives you the choice of being merciful or tyrannical. Choosing the corrupted tyrannical path has instant gratification and can get you a lot of resources early. Or you can choose to be merciful. I won't judge you if you would rather save some people and forgo the money. ... But it's still a waste of that money that would be more useful being in your treasury.\n\nSimply put, you are the Overlord, and you lay waste to the land on how you see fit.\n\nAnd the DLC known as Raising Hell? A recommendable buy as it adds more items and more places to adventure.\n\n-Cons-\n\nThis game goes far back to the age of 2007, so expect the graphics and animations to be slightly... lackluster. The control scheme on the keyboard feels unwieldy than being on the controller since I can look freely around using the mouse, though using the F1-F12 keys to select spells felt very awkward. This game WAS designed to be played on a controller of course.\n\nThen there is the grind for resources. Ooooooh the grinding can take a long time if you don't know what your doing. Even though the resources are easy to get, they usually come in small quantities in most areas, and one would find oneself returning to your tower and then coming back to the land to raid more things. Or simply go to the dungeon and fight enemies in there. Another sad con that I noticed was that there is absolutely no mana regeneration. I mean sure, you can find mana potions in chests and can sacrifice minions to a mana pit to regain mana, or alternatively go back into your dark tower to instantly restore all your health and mana. There is even an armor upgrade that enables you to regenerate your health, but not your mana for some reason. And I do like to cast my most destructive spells sometimes.:3\n\n-Rating-\n\nI give this game a 4/5, and recommend this game to those who would want to tickle the evil bone in their body someday.\n\n(Hell, I even like this game so much that I wrote some fanfiction on it. YES. FANFICTION. I ADMITTED IT.)","February 28","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it mostly lives up to that name, albeit more about killing things than collecting stuff. There are a few areas in the game that appear unfinished or just badly made which make it feel like this first in the rather amusing series wasn't intended to become a series, rather a quick cash in on pikmins popularity, that said it holds its own and will give you a few good hours of gameplay, granted some of that time will be wandering around dumbfounded and unable to find the way forward, a couple area's don't explain very well how to progress but persistence will eventually reward you with progress. I mostly recommend Overlord 1 if you want some small context on the overall story, which to be frank a game about being evil and sending ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ half breeds of pikmin and gremlins doesn't really need explenation or backstory, just ♥♥♥♥ to kill heh.","March 4","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sacrifice your minions to create a mighty set of armour and a weapon, upgrade and cast 4 different spell types (basically firebolt, beserk, shield and fear), slaughter sheep and villagers to harvest souls and spend your vast fortunes to improve your tower - in short, awesome fun! *****","April 7","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After beating it I can say it's not bad at all. If you liked Fabel, you will love this. You play a rescued Overlord who is made to rule over his minions. The gameplay is alot like a hack and slash RPG meets Strategy. The games currency is split into Gold and Life force. You need lifeforce to spawn minions, so you can expect a bit of grinding....\n\nYeah the game gets that whole "Third Person action game with RTS elements" right, unlike Brutal Legends. Controlling minions takes a bit of learning, but once you get the hang of it, it's not bothersome at all.\n\nThe real joy is the core parts of the game i.e. the minion controlling and puzzling. The remaining parts of the game aren't exciting...I'm talking about the action, story, upgrading and customizing part. The Upgrading and customizing part are More like "They're there so I'll take it". The Overlords combat mechanics are silly, but minions make up for it.\n\nLastly, the part about you being Evil. It doesn't get portrayed well. All you feel is Anti-Heroish. It always comes out as you are a jerk who does good and is saving the world.","December 26, 2015","true","49.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An extremely fun game where you play as the Overlord and get to control a small army of minions with different abilities. Your various minions are used for combat and for solving simple puzzles. The game controls kinda like an rts but is also a 3rd person hack n slash game. Your main Overlord has spells and can fight but the majority of your strength will be coming from your minion horde. The story has some choices where you can decide whether to be a benevolent dictator or a true evil overlord.\n\nThe graphics are starting to show their age but the art style and world design are still more than capable of presenting some pretty cool environments. Overlord is set in your average run of the mill European Medieval fantasy setting but that doesn't stop it from being a very fun world to explore as you look for upgrades or gold. Animations for your Overlord are stiff but the minions on the other hand are all full of life. The music and voice acting are also both really good at bringing the world of Overlord to life.\n\nMy only gripes with the game are that there is no map which isn't really needed but would still help. Multiplayer has been shutdown and is now only playable through 3rd party tools such as Hammachi and that the game only saves your progress once you go back to your evil dark tower which is like your main hub that you can upgrade and decorate. This means that if you die in the middle or even the end of a mission you will lose all of your progress.","January 19","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overlord is what happens when you mix a third person slasher with a very light resource based RTS. Your primary striking force for the vast majority of the game is your minions, and you can spawn increasing amounts as you become more powerful. Each type of minion has different abilities and strengths, and utilizing them correctly can be the difference in total victory or total annhilation.\n\nThere really isnt much to complain about when taking into consideration the age of the game. Released in 2007, it actually plays pretty well for a game nearly a decade old. Because of its age, the graphics suffer a bit, and there are only 2 movement speeds: walk and walk faster. Something else that could have helped, but wasn't really necessary was the inclusion of a map. Other than that, my only quip is that once you get the hang of how to play the game properly...it becomes very easy.","January 26","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never had I seen an elf engufled in such despair, nor had I seen a dwarf so drunk (And I've seen many a dwarves lost at the bottom of their pints).\nIf you're looking for a game marrying comedy and fantasy, you should definitively try Overlord.","November 29, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you give the food back to them, the peasants will like you more, and there will be more of them alive throughout the game. If you kill them to get rid of the witnesses and steal the food, there will be less alive, and there will be graphical changes in the town to reflect that there is no food.

Frustrating Gameplay & Conflicted Themes Doesn't Make One Evil.Genre: 3rd Person Tactical RPG.\nDeveloped & Published by: Triumph Studios and Codemasters\nPlatform: Windows only.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Expansion.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nOriginally posted by Overlord: Raising Hell Steam Description:How evil can you get? Discover how corruptible you are in Overlord, the twisted fantasy action adventure where you can be evil (or really evil). In the game's seriously warped fantasy world, players will become the Overlord and get first-hand experience of how absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nTo me, this paragraph is describing another game entirely. It's one case of marketing that I could argue negatively affected my impression, and eventual review, of a game. I did create a review several years back but I've returned after several years to make it informational and useful to you, the reader. So, let's begin.\n\nOverall Story Thoughts\nOverlord is a quirky cartoonish game sure, but a dark twisted fantasy adventure where you get to be really evil? I disagree. It’s true that people who do evil deeds don’t feel evil or in the wrong when they’re doing them. But...well...let's talk about the story. In the game, you're setup as some sort of evil Overlord, tasked with bringing darkness and ruin to the world along with the help of your minions. So, you go out into the world and destroy people who are more evil than you and bring peace….and prosperity….to the land. Ok, that's one way it ends. The other way the story ends is that you create a land ruled by fear and your power's corruption and devastation of the lands. But all it does is affect the ending cutscene, not the game itself. Well, it doesn't affect it that much. I really don't like games that set me up to think that my in-game actions will affect the world when all it really does is affect the end cutscene.\n\nThis game doesn't really let you be an evil overlord during the course of play. Part of which is to be blamed on the more comedic, cutesy tones present throughout the story. You can’t just randomly kill people if you wish, only in special circumstances. While you can set fire to wheat fields, slaughter sheep and destroy all the kegs of beer you can see, they just regrow back as soon as you leave. I get that it needs to be that way for gameplay reasons but it’s hard to feel evil when you know what you’re doing isn’t really harming anyone. If anything, I just feel more like a destroyer of boxes than a ruler of all that is dark and evil. I can’t even make children cry at the sight of me! I mean, c'mon. What is this...\n\nAll that said, it does make for a decent time as more of a comedic/light fantasy story than a dark tale of power & corruption. Characters are two dimensional and stereotypical but the interactions can be somewhat amusing at times. Especially between the Overlord and the town citizens. All typical fantasy creatures can be found here. Drunken Dwarves, Ethereal Elves, Portly Halflings, Dumb Trolls and more are in this world, serving the part they play in most any other fantasy genre. You get to see a decent variety of locations too. But there wasn't much that surprised me.\n\nGameplay Thoughts\nYou control up to 100 minions and an unnamed overlord at the same time. The overlord gets a melee attack chain and the use of spells but he should generally stay out of the fight. Otherwise, you'll wind up running out of health and mana extremely fast. So, you'll be playing most of the game through your four types of minions:\nBrown melee minions that will generally make up the cannon fodder of your army.\nRed fireball throwing minions that are immune to fire.\nGreen poison immune minions that will backstab enemies.\nBlue minion reviving ones that are immune to water and have weaker attacks. It’s a decent variety of minions but the game lacks in tactical decision making. Just send swarms of minions at your enemies and recall if you notice a big telegraphed attack coming. That’s really about the sum of the combat. Most of the time you’ll be losing minions because the controls didn't respond or you didn't see a hazard in time. That or they become stuck on doing whatever activity you "assigned" them or in the terrain. The sweeping function doesn't help matters either as it has the same issues. It’s more tiresome than enjoyable to deal with these controls when multiple types of hazards/enemies are present in a level. One last thing: I was fighting the camera more than I felt necessary for a 3rd person game which doesn't help the already frustrating gameplay. You have very limited control over it.\n\nPC Settings & Multiplayer\nI never did get a chance to experience multiplayer because the servers were shutdown after Overlord II was released. You can play online through Hamachi but the community has no doubt suffered. There is a split-screen mode though, that’s rather unusual for a PC-centric title. Graphics settings are solid. Resolution options, AA slider, V-Sync, Texture/Debris/View distance sliders are here as well. FOV is missing but you probably won’t need it. Audio sliders are present as well and it supports up to 8.1 speaker systems which is nice. Mouse and Keyboard function well enough but I think controller is the preferred control scheme. Even with a controller, the game feels like it’s fighting me the entire time. The game is getting on to be 8 years old now and it is rather disappointing that the framerate doesn't stay consistent. I noticed even on my current machine that it would fluctuate between 50-60 fps during the first level. I don't think it's enough to be a deal breaker but I wonder how bad it would be to play some of the later levels again.\n\nOverlord: Raising Hell Expansion Thoughts\nIt’s not worth it. Half of it is challenge levels with a minor amount of story attached and the other half of it is maps for the now non-functioning multiplayer. Unless you really enjoy the mechanics of controlling your minions and want to challenge yourself to a new level of frustration, this expansion is a pass. Oh and keep in mind that the original game won’t launch if the expansion is installed. Not a big deal but something I should mention here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI don’t recommend Overlord or Overlord: Raising Hell. While there are glimpses of really fun gameplay, it eventually gets worse over time. Frustration set in long before the game ended and there’s a constant sense of repetition and I want this to end already that plagues the latter half. It just becomes a long grind. Between that and the quirky controls/minion behavior, it leaves a lot to be desired. Additionally, there is a ton of backtracking. The story itself is...ok. Its not awful but its not very memorable either. It seems at odds with itself on whether you're a good guy or bad guy. Outside of smacking minions around, destroying some buildings and killing a few people, you don’t really feel like a true Overlord to me. You just feel like an anti-hero who's a jerk when all I'm doing is defeating corrupted heroes, saving the townspeople from starvation and being a generally good guy. It's a decent enough 3rd person "RTS" game but I think it could have been much better given more attention to its gameplay.\n\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]A Paladin's Review: Overlord 2.
