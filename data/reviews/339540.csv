I sooo wanted to give this game my thumbs up.\n\nThe creativity part of this game is awesome, and unique.  I even enjoyed sketching out the different parts of my avatars body and could see how special that aspect of this game is.  Once you click create to any body part or weapon, shield, bow etc, it is instantly uploaded and shared with all other owners of this game.  I really like that, and would only hope they add the ability to go back and edit the objects you've drawn after you have clicked "create" to finish one.\n\nThe monsters are really fun looking, and fight with a lot of interesting, even funny attacks.  The world ehhh, it looks okay I suppose for a 2D game like this.  I had some difficulty making jumps that I should have been able to make without spamming my keyboard keys until the game finally decided to respond.\n\nBy far the weakest link of this game is the combat.  The controls and movements are fine, if not a tad slow, but it's the sluggish responsiveness of the combat that is the disappointing part of this game as it is now on early access launch here on Steam.  This is the part of the game that needs the most work and attention, and the reason I have to give this game my tumbs down right now.  If they speed up character movement, and make it as responsive as it needs to be, then I will change my thumbs down to a thumbs up for sure.\n\nUntil it gets more work in the combat area, as much as I want to recommend this game just because of the creative side alone, I just cannot in all honesty.  I will certainly come back and keep a watchful eye on this game however, and hope they can change my opinion soon!\n\nKeep up the good work devs.. You have a special gem here I do believe, it just needs some work and polish... and that is exactly what early access is for.  Right now however, for people wanting to feel they are receiving a good gaming value for their dollar, I cannot recommend this game at this time... unless someone just wants to support this game and give feedback etc to try and help make it better.\n\n\n-  Zaxx","March 5, 2015","false","2.3"," 43 of 66 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","43","66","3","4"

It's in a very early state right now, and while you might get a kick out of it for a bit, there isn't much in the way of content as this is more of a testing grounds for when more stuff can be added. Buy this because you support the idea of a 2-dimensional Monster Hunter with the ability to draw your own armor and weapons and take down giant things with buddies. As I said, there's not much in the way of content so if you buy it, buy it as an investment in the idea. In time, the devs will make it worth your 10 bucks, I'm sure of it, having followed this project since the beginning. If this appeals to you, grab it now and make a character so when the game gets farther along in development, you'll be all set.","March 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","3"

The more players that get the game the better the game will be and the more support for the developers to push more and more great content into the game.\n\nI really do have great trust in the developers as i am an original kickstarter backer of this game and i have seen the constant improvement and progression by the devs and how they are willing to listen to the comunity/player base and mold the game around us (with our feedback).\n\ni dont believe minor fixes/changes being needed to the game should warrant a thumbs down because that will only steer other people clear of the game and stunt the growth of the game.\n\nThis game will only continue to get better and better with each update and i look forward to seeing the end product.\n\nGoodwork devs and thanks for the great game so far.\n\nThe game is truly unique and a great concept and i am definitely keen for all the future content.","March 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","10","10","3","0"

Let the bells ring and the banners fly! I've been waiting for this game for well over a year now, and was jazzed to suddenly see it on the steam store! Now mind the fact that this is early access, it has great structure, whimsical charm, and a decent combat system. There are still some kinks to work out, but ultimately I'm very enthusiastic to see the progression of this game. If you have patience and want to be involved on the ground floor of something truly unique, I'd highly recommend this title!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonahaidan/recommended/339540/","jonahaidan","jonahaidan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonahaidan/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I used Kickstarter for the first time, I saw this game and almost immediately backed it. The idea was just so incredible, how you could draw any weapons or armor that you made. Now, it's in Early Access, and I somehow didn't get the Steam key for it, even though I backed it. So I bought it again, just for extra support to the developers. Right now, there's barely anyone on any of the servers (at least when I play), but I'd say that it's still worth it. There's a decently sized world to explore, and very challenging boss monsters to fight. However, it's quite obvious that it is still in Early Access, as most of the planned features aren't there (or at least, I couldn't find them). Due to some technical difficulties (on my part, nothing to do with the game), I haven't played as much of this game as I'd have liked to. Still, I'm excited for what this game is going to become. I'd definitely recommend playing with others, as that is the most fun I've had with it. Also, the soundtrack is fantastic, I'd say that it is one of the best parts of the game. I suck at drawing, but it doesn't matter, because you can just use other people's parts. Overall, it's pretty empty at the moment (because almost all of the servers are empty), but I'd still recommend it because of what it will become.","January 29","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, these are both pretty important and the implementation of the drawing tool is actually quite impressive. But, I was still hoping for some updates to the combat and overall fighting experience in the game.\n\nDodging seems pretty hard to pull off still, I can't seem to time it right with monster attacks most of the time. This also probably has something to do with the hit boxes and the issues surrounding them. I also noticed that with the Humdinger monster he has a tendency to knock you very far away with his attacks which produces this jarring sensation on my end that disrupts combat. I think you are making it out to be like he is knocking me down, but being that there is no animation for that at the moment, I cannot tell what is happening. I'm just standing there for a few seconds after being thrown across the map by him. Tritt was a fine fight, however, and same actually goes for Spangly Tom.\n\nThose babies, however, they seem a bit broken with their hit boxes. I felt like I was being trapped on several occasions as they constantly hit me after I was surrounded by them. The cart wheel attacks from the little Tom's where very annoying in particular.\n\nI have noticed some minor cosmetic touch-up's, however. I see the icons you have put in place when you stand next to the buffing flowers in the environment. It was a nice surprise to see effects given their representation; I did not expect that in the game at this moment and it was a pleasant surprise.\n\nAnother issue I have that has not been improved on since the very first launch of the game is the server stability. I have only played .3 hrs according to steam, but I have already crashed once. I would enjoy seeing some improvements on this soon.\n\nI still have great faith in this game. We just passed the second year anniversary and I had my doubts for a while. I never imagined I would see it on steam. This has renewed my dedication to this project and I know things are only going to get better from here on out.\n\nThis review will be a "yes" if we all keep up the good work on this.\n\nThanks, Team. Keep on truckin'.\n\n-Kamebos\n\n","March 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

The pitch video seemed a lot like monster hunter, with a little splash of shadow of the colossus, but with a lot more focus on character customization and interaction.  I played all the alpha releases, I checked in every few months. they gave us a steam release and my hopes soared. but now i've given up. this game is empty all of the time. literally nobody plays it. the in game music and sounds are loud, repetetive and annoying, the monsters aren't really challenging, they're more frustrating, and they just seem to absorb any amount of damage you throw their way. since the writing of this review they decided to move the game to a new engine, and then have started looking for a publisher to help push the game in a different direction i guess? either way they're starting from ground zero.\n\nI'm not sure if i bought into the hype and was let down by my own expectations, or if the game is just not good. either way i wouldn't recommend this to anybody.\n\nThe in game character editor could benefit from some templates, and maybe some options for backdrops to help see what you're doing a little bit better. it's important for something THIS focused on customization.\n\nhopefully i'm wrong and this game turns into something better than it is now. but at the moment. i don't have high hopes. the version we have now is in absolutely no way what the trailer for it on kickstarter presented to us.","January 7","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I usually use powerpoint when I draw (I know, an odd choice) and extracting existing parts takes long and it's a bother to make the pre-drawn parts I made fit on the model, so I hope they add the option to resize part in the editor.\n\nI'd like to put an emphasis on the next sentence, once more:\n\nAlthough I CURRENTLY do not recommend this game, it is in early access game, I recommend waiting for the beta phase to begin and perhaps then I'll re-sumbit my review with new information and perhaps conclusion. I still think this game does have a lot of potential.","October 24, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
