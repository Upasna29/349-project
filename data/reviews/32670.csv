But also a game that you could carry your team if you were a good enough shot and player!\n\nThis was an FPS with close quarter maps and open maps... that required skill, compensation for recoil, and above all more teamwork. An added feature was the ability to lean that has disappeared in modern fps which typically was a sign of a better player. (Being able to lean left and right while moving side to side and maintaining your accuracy would put you far above the competition).\n\nThis game and Novalogics Joint Operations series are by far my most favorite and memorable FPS games... it is uncomparable to modern FPS and which Novalogic did not just "vanish".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/32670/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","You're probably familiar with the budget tactical shooter series called Delta Force. Black Hawk Down is the 6th installment of the series and inherits all the good things about the previous titles and executes them pretty well. Unlike the previous titles all your campaign missions take place in one country: Somalia.\n\nThe Visuals.\nBHD has it's own engine and runs at DirectX8, 4:3 aspect ratio resolution. I managed to get it up to 1200p, it refused to go above. All widescreen solutions stretch / cut off the screen. Considering that it's budget titles made in 2003 the visuals are fine. Decent textures, fine poly count and nice drawing distance (like in every other DF title). Framerate is unlimited. Game is compatible with pretty much all Windows versions.\n\nThe Mechanics & AI.\nYou can switch between first and third person. You can lean around the corners, crouch, go prone. Before the mission start you have a loadout screen where you can choose your equipment (depending on the mission sometimes it's limited to 2-3 weapons). You have a map/radar that shows friendlies and items. There's no health regeneration, you can be killed in 1-3 shots. You can't pick up weapons from enemies, but you can use ammo and health boxes that are scattered around the map.\nThe enemy AI is simple. it gives as soon as a hostile sees you it gives a few seconds to react. If you don't eliminate the hostile during those seconds, then the hostile will start shooting at you. The enemy accuracy has been nerfed, but you have a high chance of getting killed if you simply stand without taking cover.\n\nThe Audio.\nBHD is the first title to feature a lot of chatter between teammates and music tracks during mission.\n\nThe Gameplay.\nThere are 16 campaign missions. Your goal is to follow the orders, complete objectives and eliminate hostiles while avoiding any friendly or civilian casualties. You're given waypoints to help you navigate through the maps. Unlike previous titles BHD doesn't have much of long range fights in open areas like fields and mountains. During the campaign you'll be advancing through villages, cities and even bunkers. For each mission you're given a limited amount of saves.\n\nDelta Force series are not for everyone. I'd recommend to actually trying one of the titles to see if a tactical shooter is your thing. It doesn't have fancy visuals or AI, but it's fairly enjoyable.","November 11, 2014","true","14.0"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

Shortly after the assault began, Somali militia and armed civilian fighters shot down two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The subsequent operation to secure and recover the crews of both helicopters drew the raid, intended to last no more than an hour, into an overnight standoff in the city. The battle resulted in 18 deaths, 73 wounded, and one helicopter pilot captured among the U.S. raid party and rescue forces. One Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed as part of the rescue forces but other resources claims there were more loss of life. American sources estimate between 1,500 and 3,000 Somali casualties, including civilians; SNA forces claim only 315 killed, with 812 wounded. The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu of 2006.\nCasualties and losses\n-U.S.-\n18 killed[2]\n73 wounded[2][3]\n1 captured\n-Malaysia-\n1 killed\n7 wounded\n-Pakistan-\n1 killed\n2 wounded	SNA Militia and civilians\nSNA claims a range of 315 to 500 Somali casualties, 812 wounded.

With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.","April 2, 2011","true","10.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pognivet/recommended/32670/","pognivet","Fuck S͘team","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pognivet/","570 products in account","a fun old game with flaws. it has a lot of crazy features like animal attacks. on levels where you're in africa for instance there are alligators/crocodiles that swim around in the water and lay on the banks of rivers. if you come too near them or aggravate them they might attack you, even while youre already fighting other humans. i dont think you can drive any vehicles in this game, but you can use the gunner's position on humvees, blackhawks and rhibs. the levels are all pretty linear but you usually have a decent amount of room to maneuver. this game is somewhat realistic in that on the higher difficulties you die in one or two shots and most enemies die with the same number. there are also civilians in this game. some cry and hide, some throw rocks at you, some yell insults. theyre pretty hard to distinguish from the enemies. usually the only way you can tell a civilian from an enemy is by what theyre carrying. one cool thing about the delta force games is that the helicopters are done similar to certain counter-strike maps in that you can walk around inside the helicopter while its flying and you arent strapped into a seat like in a battlefield game. the delta force games also have the coolest scope system ive ever seen in any game.\n\nthis game is heavily propagandized of course but it has very little "hollywood" in it. your cause is always portrayed as just or righteous without question or doubt, but its never easy like in the movie Blackhawk Down. you have real world military objectives with elaborate briefings. usually it involves raiding a warehouse, blowing up a radio tower or capturing some guy. the original campaign is based on supposedly real missions that took place in somalia in the 90s. theres two other campaigns that come with team sabre, one where youre in colombia fighting drug lords and another where youre in iran for some reason. these arent usually run and gun missions. they're slow, nightmarish slogs where you might spend several minutes in one place shooting and checking corners before moving forward.\n\nthe most major flaw with this game as opposed to other delta force games is the vehicle sections. you are on a rail shooter essentially, sitting on a mounted gun on a vehicle that goes on a path. kind of like in call of duty modern warfare 2 on the first level where you drive in the humvee with the minigun. i dont think you cant get out of the vehicle and theres virtually no armor on anything except the blackhawk helicopter. youre a sitting duck and you have to constantly shoot without letting go of mouse 1 for up to five minutes or more at a time. sometimes youll be swarmed by tons of enemies and it will take a long time to kill them all. on the harder difficulties ONE bullet from a .50 cal will kill you even if you have full health. in the main somalia campaign you can usually (with great skill and calm) pick off any RPGs or .50 cals before they take you out. however in the addon campaigns, specifically the first mission of the iranian one, you might get sniped in one shot and killed by a .50 cal machinegun right when it spawns, when its so far away it hardly even shows up on your screen. i wish the devs at least let you duck during these sections.\n\nother than that its a pretty hardcore and straightforward light-realism military shooter.","May 19","true","35.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Let's take this trip down the memory lane, shall we?\nDelta Force: Black Hawk Down, developed by Novalogic is a semi-tactical first person shooter where you play throughout the game part as a 75TH Ranger grunt and, later on, as a member of the SFOD-D, deployed in Somalia during the dictatorsip of a pretty notorious warlord, Mohamed Farrah Aidid, and you're ordered to hunt him and take him down. As the title clearly says, the game is focused on Restore Hope and that fatal day october 3rd 1993 that was to live up in history. Yes, the graphics were outdated even at launch, but should we judge a book by its cover? Heck no! This game lets you dive head first in the urban guerrilla that raged on in eastern africa and if it's sweeping a block as a HMMWV gunner, get deployed on the target buiding's top by a 160TH SOAR's little bird, cross an alligator infested river or just storm a beach dodging incoming mortar fire and navigating through a minefield, you will definitely have a blast! Literally!\nI don't know about you, but Delta Force really hit the target with this game.The story is amazing, it even gives you goosebumps at times, the gameplay is amazing, the enviroment is immersive despite the graphical quality.\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. The game overall is brilliant and unique in its time location. In an fps' scene dominated by sci-fi shooters and wannabe realistic ones where you can run around with 'camos' that are anything but camouflage, playing this game you will almost taste the dirt of somalian and smell the cordite of your colt armalite 15 mowing down 'skinnies'.\nEven without the nostalgia factor, this game is a must have in your steam library, overall vote of 9.5/10\n(sorry dfbhd, that 0.5 is for the fact you can't go 16:9 without modding your .cfg, love you long time tho)","May 17","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
