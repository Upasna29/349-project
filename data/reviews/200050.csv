I have seen AIM120D hitting a Su35 after flying 1000+km with the speed of 4M on 100m height.\n5) Neither torpedos nor ASM (Air to Surface Missile) can hit surfaced subs\n6) Passive sonar mechanics utterly broken: it seems just a random dice roll if it detects a sub or nor.\n7) Damage mechanics are broken too: nope, most frigates cannot survive a hit from a Harpoon II missile. Nope, it can really happen that an aircraft survives a missile hit.\n8) Aircraft rearm/refuel timers are mad. Landed aircraft can be checked, reloaded, refueled in 30 minutes (no matter how  big the fire is on the base), while fueled aircraft rearming always 1 hour.\n9) You cannot outmanouver anything. It will hit or not hit and seemingly it was decided at launch time.\n10) Aircraft fuel range is madness as well... F22 and F35s sometimes can fly from Canada to the UK with afterburner. Air refueling sometimes garbled, aircraft get seemingly too much fuel.\n( 11) Comparing Harpoon II. In Harpoon II you could read about the missiles, ordanances - these are also crap in this game ofc - ships, aircraft. Read the story, the capabilties etc... Nothing similar could I found in Naval War: Artic Circle...)\n\n\nSo overall, the game is a bait and a big personal disappointment.","July 14, 2015","false","33.1"," 103 of 114 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","103","114","7","0"

They are gamers, not simmers, who picked the sim up for novelty, not love of military simulation.\n(The ones from people with more gameplay is usually due to PC issues)\n\nNOTE: This game requires a powerful CPU! There is a lot of simulation going on, and if your PC is weak, you will experience freezes. The system requirements listed above are way too low.\n\nWhat I Like\n> Intuitive, easy to use interface\n> Great solid simulation of ships, submarines, aircraft, missiles, and weapons\n> Scenario editor and workshop integration\n> Potential for modding (I'm working on one)\n> Smooth realtime, not interval based like competitors\n> Functional multiplayer\n> Most, if not all, bugs were fixed in patches\n\nWhat I Don't Like\n> Limited range of units\n> The map is only Northern Europe, Greenland, and Eastern Canada. Nothing south of Belgium\n> In some places, realism is sacrificed for balance\n> Limited default scenarios (but there are lots on Steam workshop)\n\nWhat I Don't Mind, But Other People Might not Like\n> Rare freezing (temporary, usually 15 seconds or so) when lots of units being simulated\n> There is no savegame function (GET OVER IT PEOPLE. JUST GET OVER IT!)\n> 3D graphics are simplistic (it's a £15 SIM, not a flashy £50 game!)\n\nConclusion: DO NOT BUY unless you love modern miltiary strategy/tactics. It's niche as niche can be, NOT for everyone, but if you're an armchair admiral, you'll love NWAC.","October 20, 2014","true","69.8"," 90 of 132 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","90","132","7","1"

However, as many other people have pointed out, it comes with a few problems...\nFirstly is the lack of save during the game.  you have to start each every scenario / campaign step from the beginning, so, put aside plenty of time to play.  Secondly I hate the introductions to each scenariom why?  I do not care about two admirals who played Yahtzy (annoying spelling), I just want to start the game.  Thirdly, amd more important, and what stops me from recommending this game is that it just crashes far too often, meaning you have to start the scenario from scratch, and sit through the annoying pre game chit chat (why do game designers think we want to sit through that?)\n\nGet Janes Fleet Command if you do not have that, if you have that, this may be worth it, but be prepaperd to swear at your PC.","July 27, 2015","false","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And also because of the complexityof the calcs I seem to remember it would run slowly if too much was going on. But other than those two matters its a really good game and you get to play subs, ships, helicopters and a variety of planes in modern day scenarios. And the game isnt massively complex its got fairly deep gameplay but its still fun for light gamers like myself, unlike other similar more hardcore games ie you dont have to be a naval engineer to understand it.","March 13","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do not listen to the haters who played this in the past.  It has now been fixed.\n\nPros:  I have played the tutorials which make the game very easy to play.  I have not found any bugs so far.  This game is very like Jane's Fleet Command, but a little more modern.  I am now playing one of the campaigns and have also played one of the single missions.  There are loads of missions/campaigns on Steam and elsewhere.  The AI is very good and the game can be quite tense, though a bit slow for any younger gamers who love lots of action and shooting, etc.  This is a sedate game for older players like me who are middle-aged and no longer have the reactions of the younger generation (no problem, as most Admirals are middle aged!?).  The Steam version has obviously been heavily patched and seems to work a dream.  I have no problem with gameplay/framerates, but I must admit I have a fairly high-end machine and can run it on full graphics without any problem so far.  Far from being quirky, the interface is a doddle to use, despite reports from other reviewers.\n\nCons: The graphics are rubbish!  They are better than Fleet Command (which I own, so they should be now after all these years) and a bit better than Dangerous Waters (which I also own).  However, unlike Dangerous Waters, though the models look much better, the ships do not even have wakes behind them!?  The use of towed array sonar and dipping sonar is not animated!!!  I have yet to see a ship moving up and down with the waves.  The music is mind-bendingly monotonous as well as being completely inappropriate - it is gentle guitar music during a battle which involves Billions of Dollars/Pounds and countless lives!!!!!\n\nConclusion:  I bought the game for less than £4.00/$7.00.  Well worth it during the 'Lunar' sale.  It is now £15.00/$19.00.  Worth it, probably not.  However, for Naval Strategy fans, this is still a gem and a bit more updated than Dangerous Waters/Fleet Command whose graphics are atrocious.  I will definetely be buying the DLC and downloading the many workshop missions/campaigns","February 12","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a naval officer who likes to dabble in naval sims like JFC and Dangerous Waters, I thought this looked like a promising entry in the genre, but was sorely disappointed. Lacks depth, providing a very shallow depiction of certain capabilities and warfare areas, and it's buggy and slow as hell. After its failed release, Paradox tried a few fixes, then just gave up on it despite unresolved problems documented by frustrated customers. Concordantly, I think this game is not worth the $20 price currently listed here on Steam.","January 22","false","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's a good choice, when you're  looking for the way to get to know basics of naval warfare. The main rival, Command Modern Air naval Operations (CMANO), is a truly hardcore game and Jane's Fleet Command (JFC) may look annoyingly outdated. The interface is clear and player-friendly. The missions are interesting. The graphic is good for a wargame: ship models are nice, but transient conditions (missile starts, hits, aircraft launches etc.) are made roughly. So I highly recommend it for beginners.\nThe drawback is that after having played it for some time, or looking through the literature, you'll find out how unrealistic it is. Mostly it's connected with simplified radio-electronic warfare & aspects issues. You'll literally feel you're bound to these limitations. That's why I prefer CMANO now.\nThe game has some performance issues, though I had not experienced any bugs during the gameplay, that are worth to be mentioned. The fact is that when lots of aircraft, anti-ships and anti-air missiles are in the air (I'm talking about 100-200+ object), the time compression lost it's effect, and the game tends to slow down and run close to the real-time. However, there's a video-guide on performance optimization (haven't used it) and you may meet similar  difficulties in CMANO too.","May 31","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First off, no save game. You heard that right, no saving. You give general orders to your units, but the AI is to dumb to handle tactics properly. You can have a group of planes attack another group of planes, but they will only fire missiles once. If those missiles don't destroy the enemy, the planes won't attack again. If you give orders to a group of aircraft to attack all enemy targets, it will only attack the first one it sees. If you have two groups of enemy aircraft coming at you, it won't fire on the second group. There are many items like this. There are also bugs. I had the game tracking/observing a friendly aircraft. That aircraft was shot down and I saw that in the 3D window, but the plane remained on the 2D map and was even selected/highlighted when I clicked on another unit.\n\nI purchased this game on sale even after having read a few reviews that complained of some problems. I figured that they could be tollerated and played through. I was wrong. This game is broken in its present form (the source code has been released, so there is some hope) and not worth purchasing at any cost.","November 19, 2014","false","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It is not the prettiest under the sun but its good enough. The interface is a little sluggish and aircraft have the tendency not to do what they are meant to but it seems to balance out well the desire for an accurate simulation and the desire for fun. If I want an all singing all dancing simulation where I can set up any scenario under the sun and run it to see what happens then C:MAN is the clear winner but you don't get the feel from that of blazing ships and harpoons slamming into tankers. For a quick fix then NW:AC meets that.\n\nNo one has yet come up with the perfect game. C:MAN would come close if it had more 3D models and had an AI capable of handling itself from a cold start with just named resources. The best for years was Harpoon Classic with Jutland being the state of the art for 3D but some of the other games by people like NWS showed what could be done with minimal graphics. What is needed is someone to join everything up.\n\nAnyway, I digress.
