You need to be a particular kind of person to get into this game. And if you are not, you will definitely not enjoy this game.\n\nThis game is hard, very hard. I managed to finish it, but one of the last levels took me 2 weeks to solve, probably about 30 hours of trial and error, for just 1 level. It had me working with a pencil and a sketch pad as I sketched out little subsections of possible solutions. This is the only game ever that did that. The joy of finally solving it, was incredible, naturally, but you have to be able to put in the effort. Looking at a problem and going "ah, I'll just look up the solution on Youtube" is not the way to play this game.\n\nAt some point, every puzzles seems impossible, that is, until you solve it. And then the next seemingly impossible puzzle is presented to you. You can approach this in two ways, as the very best puzzle-challenge you will ever play, or as a game that makes you feel stupid. If you are the latter kind of person, do not get this game, obviously.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a genuine challenge that will push your creativity and out-of-the-box thinking to its limits, if you are tenacious and willing to be immersed so deeply that you'll start dreaming up solutions while you sleep, this is hands down the very best puzzle game you will ever play. If you are not, then this is definitely not the game for you.\n\nDo I recommend this game? YES, just not to everyone.","February 21, 2014","false","127.2"," 761 of 891 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","761","891","7","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Obawan/recommended/92800/","Obawan","Obawan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Obawan/","283 products in account","I hated chemistry in school. You know that meme about math problems? The one about word math problems and the answer is "Purple because aliens don't wear hats". That one. That is how I felt and still feel about chemistry, engineering, and math. I have no idea where I even got SpaceChem, because I sure as hell wouldn't have bought it, unless I now have a sleep-buying condition I don't know about. At any rate, SpaceChem sat in my library for a very long time and it was only because I wanted the trading cards did I fire it up.\n\nIt sat playing in the background for a little bit, and then I noticed the soundtrack. Such an elaborate soundscape, I had to take a look at this game, even if it fried my brain.\n\nThe UI is stylish and minimalist, everything I would expect from a game with the words "Space" and "Chemistry" referenced in it. What I wasn't expecting was the rich story unfolding within the game. Like a science fiction unraveling through the planets explored with the completion of a set of puzzles found on each planet.\n\nI won't lie, the puzzles involve chemistry and engineering (to a degree... hur hur) but don't let that put you off. Initially, I could feel my brain melt out of my ears as my senses felt overloaded with symbols, flashbacks to chemistry lab and purple because aliens don't wear hats.\n\nBut that soon subsided as I got stuck in with the tutorial and slowly tackled a couple of the earlier puzzles. There is a fluidity and beauty to this puzzle game that is perhaps what makes mathematicians, scientists and engineers smile when something goes right. I hate to admit it, but I felt it compelling at times to just watch a result replay. And there is a great sense of achievement when you solve a puzzle!\n\nThere is a lot at your fingertips within this game - there's even a periodic table that you can review - but don't let that put you off. I can only play the game in doses, but the music is perfect to thinking and solving a logical puzzle, and that is ultimately what this game comes down to: logic with chemistry elements. I imagine anyone studying engineering or chemistry may find great joy within this game - and it could even be a great learning tool to someone trying to master some of the key concepts of the subject.\n\nIf you can get pass some of symbols and terminology (and stop giggling at the term "waldo") then you will not be wasting your time exploring the puzzles and story within SpaceChem. The soundtrack alone is worth it.\n\nI never thought I would say it, but SpaceChem is a little gem of a puzzle game.

This game is a logician's wet dream.\nSure, it's an exercise in humility, but I feel I can safely say it's also the most compelling puzzle game I have played to date.  There is no chaos whatsoever--only increasingly complex order and efficiency.  If ever there were a game that captured the passion of engineering, this is it.\n\nThe music is deeply inspired and provides a suitable background to your work.  The story has some enrapturing quality as well, a smidge of suspense and intrigue enough to give you that extra nudge forward.  This may sound insane, but reading the story between puzzles feels physically relieving, as though the stress on your mind is shifted to different regions, much like those atoms are shuffled so smoothly around the reactors, so orderly, clean and calm.\n\nWait, did I say 'work'?

To put this game into simple terms, SpaceChem is basically a visual programming game. You receive various inputs and using various tools within the game, the goal is to generate a specified output. Loops, if/then statements, arrays, and many more tools are at your disposal. The game starts simply, but the difficulty increases quickly. Pretty soon, you will find a puzzle that completely stumps you.\n\nThis game is not for the feint of heart, the puzzles are hard. But since the game operates within a well defined set of rules, you will find yourself thinking of solutions throughout the day. I found myself drawing sketches to solutions that I had brainstormed while at work. Then I'd eagerly wait until the day was over to get home, try out the idea, and refine any issues. Like I said, the game consumes your life. But when you find yourself stumped on a puzzle for hours, only to conjure a solution during the day, and implement it to great success, you will feel an immense amount of accomplishment.\n\nQuite simply, this is one of the best puzzle games I have played. I wish there was more, I must have more. My only disclaimer is that if you don't like steeply difficult challenges, then you likely won't enjoy this game.

Each chapter will introduce one or two new new gameplay features. The levels take you through an easy tutorial of how to use the new element, and gets progressively more challenging. This learning curve is very good.\n\nAs for how the levels themselves work, you are given various tools and a grid. The job is to move elements (like hydrogen/carbon etc.) around, and join them to form molecules which you then pipe out. It initially seems easy but once you add mulitple reactors piping out to each other it quicky adds more of a challenge.\n\nMy only issue is, if I find myself becoming fixated on ridiculously complicated solutions. You can't skip levels if you are finding them too complicted. This means if you are completely stuck and can't progress unless you can solve each level sequentially.\n\nThis game is controlled with a mouse, but has keyboard shortcust to make things easier to control. This works really well, in my opinion.\n\nThe graphics are very simple, which is good as it makes it easy to see what exactly you're doing.\n\nThe music and sounds in this game are very nice.\n\nThere are extra challenges included once you complete the game, and ones that can earn you extras in TF2, it seems.

It casts the player as an engineer working for an outer-space industrial operation—your job is to program and arange the reactors that recombine chemical elements for various industrial purposes.\n\nRight up front it’s worth noting that SpaceChem isn’t actually a chemistry game. Ignorance of actual chemistry isn’t a hindrance. The actual game play consists of setting up tracks which carry chemical components around within a reactor, and inserting commands to make sure that what you want ends up where you want it. In some stages there is a further level of complexity where you must set up and connect multiple reactors to be used together.\n\nAll this has a lot more to do with computer programming than it does which chemistry. In fact, it seems fair to say that SpaceChem is like the fun part of programming separated from all the arcane knowledge and headache that go along with it. You are, in essence, issuing simple commands to a machine to enable it to complete complex tasks. (People who have coded may also feel some déjà vu as they set about finding the bugs in the operation of reactors they’ve already set up—it feels just like debugging code.)\n\nHere is where SpaceChem is so different from most other puzzle games. Instead of being faced with a problem to which you must FIND a solution, here you are faced with an objective and you must DESIGN a solution. These stages are less puzzles than engineering tasks. And possible approaches to the SpaceChem stages are innumerable and call on your creativity as much as your deduction. This is emphasized by the feedback you get once you’ve completed a stage which compares your solution to all the others on record along several dimensions. For me, this added an incentive not just to beat a level, but to keep returning to my solution: surely I could find a way to do it faster, or with fewer instructions than the others who’d solved it. Thus the replayability of even a single stage is vast.\n\nThat is the real strength and focus of the game, the core structure of the problem solving. Some other elements are less strong. The visuals are very simple, though, for the most part, I think this brings an abstract elegance. The story, such as it is, is darkly comedic but tacked on and not really worth your attention. And the boss battles, essentially normal stages with some sort of twist in how you apply your chemistry, are awkward and un-compelling as if an afterthought to the game’s design.\n\nBut these complaints are peripheral to the core excellence of the game as an opportunity for creative, structured problem solving. (And don’t take the creative bit to mean it isn’t challenging. The difficulty of the game has been widely noted. Things start off easily enough, but don’t feel bad if you find the later stages very challenging—you have a lot of company.) So if you like puzzle games, coding, or a good challenge, SpaceChem is for you.\n\n(In addition to my Steam copy, I’ve put in many hours on a DRM free copy, and a number on a copy for my tablet. The game's that good--I've acquired it more than once.)","July 24, 2015","true","59.9"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","2"

They become increasing harder as you go along, but it is pretty steady. Each set of puzzles build on skills you have acquired from the previous. There are challenges associated with many of the puzzles. You do not have to complete them to beat the game, but they really make you think and work for the achievement. They can be tough, but I enjoyed solving them. Nothing in the game is forced on you with the challenges and achievements. It saves your progress so you can keep moving forward in the game and go back later to beat the challenges. I really felt a sense of accomplishment finishing this game. Many puzzle games become the a+b =c formula and thus, boring. Space Chem held to the end.\n\nThe controls and UI worked really well. Learning the hotkeys helps. There are many videos on You Tube. Really cool after you beat a puzzle, you can see how others did it. I did not see any of my solutions online and there are may ways to solve each one. The instruction on new tools were good. Told you what you needed to know and left you to figure out how to employ them. The periodic chart was a useful addition.\n\nCons – The story outside the puzzles was a cheese sandwich with the crust (Try eating one and you'll see what I mean, dry and chewy, just sayin').

In the course of the game you use reactors to combine elements into molecules - that's pretty much the gist of it. However, it's done via timing mechanisms where you take in molecules and atoms and manipulate them via a series of steps - adding/removing bonds, fusing them, splitting them, teleporting them, the list just goes on. From an actual chemistry standpoint it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, but what's really intriguing is that this takes the essence of programming/circuit design and distills it into a fascinating game. Engineering students/programming students should CONSUME this game - it's a wonderful example of the sort of work we try to solve.\n\nI got hopelessly addicted to this game for a good long while. It gets hard - REALLY hard. But the feeling of satisfaction upon finding a solution is just....so fantastic. Even more if you've got some friends who you can compete against trying to find more and more efficient solutions.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.

Probably because you are intimidated by the trailer and think it's too complicated, or because you didn't know it exists. Well, this game does exist, and now you don't have an excuse anymore to not at least try the free demo.\n\nSpaceChem is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It uses fake chemistry only as a backdrop for its puzzle mechanics. So don't worry, you don't need to know anything about chemistry in order to play this game. Your job is to design machines that transform a given input into a required output. For example, the game gives you single hydrogen atoms and demands hydrogen molecules (two hydrogen atoms bonded to each other). You can then use functions like grab, drop, input, output, bond, etc. to create a machine that automatically turns hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecues. How you do this exactly is up to you. It can be very satisfying to watch your solution run, because it is YOUR OWN creation. You are not simply following a strict path the puzzle designer wanted you to take. And after each completed puzzle, a graph will show you how efficient your solution is compared to others, giving you extra incentive to make your solution work just a little bit faster or use less functions.\n\nAs you progress, more functions will be available like fusion or flip-flop switches, allowing you to create even more complex machines. Some levels let you link several machines together, so the output of one machine can be used as an input for another machine. The last couple of worlds are very challenging, but even if you give up there, you'll get your money's worth. And if the campaign isn't enough for you, there are still tons of user created puzzles to solve and challenges to master.\n\n\nIf you like puzzle games, or if you like programming, buy this game now! If you are uncertain, play the demo. It's pretty long and gives you a good look into the game. For some people the demo might even be enough.\nI have finished the GOG version, and that's the one I'd recommend, because it includes the DLC.","June 27, 2014","true","2.2"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","1"

The depth available to the game has spawned a community that has still not managed to perfect solutions for every level leaving plenty of room for the enterprising chemist to dazzle and impress. In short, if you're looking for a puzzle - this is the game to get. It's fun from the start and only gets better.\n\nDo not buy this game if you can't program. Turing completeness makes for some of the most engaging puzzling we will probably ever see in a video game, but it also unfortunately means that I cannot in good faith recommend this title without that massive caveat. The game makes no pretenses about its true nature and the introductory challenges are little more than cues to familiarize yourself with the game's controls and the puzzle mechanics. The experience with the demo version is only a portion of what the game has to offer: a lack of confidence in tackling the game's challenges will frustrate you and copying other people's solutions will leave you with no understanding or appreciation of the game.","December 20, 2013","false","68.1"," 69 of 107 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","69","107","2","0"

It was also bundled bunch of times, so you can grab it, if you so desire, for almost nothing. TL;DR (regarding gameplay itself) at the end.\nBut what it's all about? I wouldn't say "chemistry" like others (and whats funny - also title) says. In chemistry, at least for now, you have to use reagents to get specific products (for example Na + Cl2 -> 2 NaCl). Here, you can operate on atomic level to manipulate what are you getting.\n\nYou have something in your inputs and there is requirment to get something specific to output. Sounds easy? At first it is, only thing you need is to "spawn" molecule, grab it (with weird looking circle-like thing), drop it, "despawn" it and do it periodically. After that? Get 2 molecules, bound them and send them out. Next? While having only single H (hydrogen) and single C (carbon) make not CH but CH4 (methan) instead. And you can't simply spawn 4 H's (they appear in the same spot - causing an error), grab every one of them (only one atom with its bindings can be taken at the time) bind them with carbon...\n\nI would say playing this game literally using YT to pass levels is pointless (and I saw it in leaderboards that its common practice) because difficulty level grows quite quickly, you will need those YT clips to pass next level... and next one, and next and so on - which will become boring very quickly, you won't enjoy it as much etc. It is logical game for a reason. It took me good hour to do one level, but it was so good feeling I did it MYSELF without external help.\n\n(almost)TL;DR:\nPros: good (but not great, mind you) design\nleaderboards (doing levels over and over again to do stuff even faster or with less "parts" is amazing)\nit's clear regarding what is actually happening/will happen\nrequires carefull planing\ndifficultyCons: well... difficulty\nwould love to see some kind of small guide in the game how exactly everything works\nsolutions are sometimes hard to pull off due to...\n... limited amount of complication you can haveRegarding my last point - each waldo can "go" into specific point at best 2 times during one cycle. No more, due to how the game itself is constructed. Its painful when I want to drop 3 specific atoms one after the other in the same place, but I simply can't... Of course there is way around it but it makes things even more complicated.\n\nOk to sum up - this is great game that requires huge amount of thinking, planning and almost literally debugging to make things work as intended.

You’re hired as a reaction engineer for SpaceChem Industries, the galaxy’s leading chemical supplier.  You’re going to be shipped off to far-flung worlds, harnessing their resources to generate the molecules that our space-faring society requires.\n\nSpaceChem is a game about molecules.  No, that’s not right.  It’s a game about programming.  Well, that isn’t exactly true either.  SpaceChem is a game where you will take an impossible-seeming assignment, deconstruct it and build an incredibly complex engine to complete it, one bit at a time.  This is a game of puzzles, of organic problem solving, of creativity.\n\nIn the most boring terms possible, here’s what you do in SpaceChem.  Take input molecules, break them down or combine them, and then output a target molecule.  Your “waldos” can manipulate the molecules on the board, but you have limited space to work in.  After a few easy introductory levels, timing and layout become incredibly important to your success.\n\nThe best thing about this game is how open-ended it is.  There is no “correct” way to solve each level.  You could solve it with a small number of instruction symbols.  Or you could strive to limit the cycle time of your reactor.  Either way is valid, but you will hardly ever be able to minimize everything in one single solution.

You could revisit the problem again and try tweaking your reactors (as all of your solutions are saved when you finish them), or you could jump into the next problem right away.\n\nThe soundtrack is both familiar, and entirely new.  Its’ epic soaring highs and quiet methodical moments are both uplifting and encouraging, but it doesn’t distract  from the matters at hand.\nThe visuals are likewise very well thought-out.  This feels like an industrial console, and is likewise very simple and it is mostly very easy to grok what is going on.  This is critical, as your understanding of how the different objects interact and the sequence they will perform is your only hope of debugging your solution.\n\nSpaceChem is not easy.  In fact, it is one of the most difficult games I’ve ever played.  I couldn’t even beat the last few levels without looking on youtube for hints on how to set up my reactors.  But, it is not punishing.  Instead you feel joy whenever a little part of your setup finally starts working, and when you manage to finally get that last piece into place, its like you toppled an empire single-handed.\n\nIf you have experience programming, or want to try your hand at it, SpaceChem teaches you the most important skills that you’ll require.  Not syntax or coding.  But trial-and-error, debugging, and breaking a problem into smaller parts.  If you think you can crack some of the toughest puzzles in video games, this is for you.","April 5","true","26.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I found the mechanics kinda difficult to grasp at the beginning but the basic principles are fairly easy to understand.\n\nBasically, you are building molecules out of atoms (who would have guessed). You start the game with one reactor that has 2 "circuits" in it, you can modify shape of these circuits and put different commands on them that will input/output atoms, grab them, bond them together, you can also rotate the molecules and do other stuff with them that I don't know about yet since I am not too far into the game.\n\nLater on, you will be given multiple reactors that can all be "programmed" separately giving the game a whole new level. For instance, you can have one reactor that will be used to brake bonds between atoms, then it will output them to another reactor that will bond them together with different atoms to form the molecule that you need. Now all of this sounds like you need a degree in chemistry and physics to be able to play the game but that is absolutely not the case. It's all logical, you don't need to know absolutely anything about chemistry or any other science.\n\nWhat some people may dislike about this game is that it ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly but a nice thing is that all the solutions are always saved and you can revisit previous levels to go over the basics again, experiment or improve your designs.\nBecause unlike many other puzzle games where you are merely trying to find the single solution that the developers invented, in Spacechem there are hundreds if not thousands of solutions to every level and there is even online workshop kind of thing where you can download player-created levels and also upload your own (I hope that's what it's for, I have never actually used it :D), giving the game a HUGE replay value. I can imagine sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.\n\nEven though I am not very good at puzzle games and I doubt I will ever finnish this one because the difficulty gets absolutely ridiculous in later levels from what I've seen on youtube, I have to recommend Spacechem. It's extremely original, challenging, satisfying and fun. What more could you possibly ask of a puzzler? It even has a story! I haven't really followed it too much but it's there and sometimes you get a story-related mission like the one I recently got where I had to destroy a giant bulldozer closing in on our base by filling some tanks with methane causing them to explode in it's face!","August 17, 2014","true","34.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And a lot of satisfaction - of course as long as you won't look at the leaderboards. I've kept this game installed for almost three years, planning to finish it one day - because giving up, deleting SpaceChem wasn't an option. I was returning to some difficult, unsolved levels after months of not playing, totally forgetting previous ideas. I was making sketches and notes when not playing.

In fact, you don't even need to know any chemistry, as it manages to blend science fiction with chemicals to make a very interesting game. Use "waldoes" to take apart chemicals and molecules and reassemble them to spec, with the the parts colliding, and try to do it wtih the fewest steps, parts, and so on. The game gets fiendishly difficult in the final few levels, when you have to swap parts from molecule to molecule using very limited means. The lack of hint system, IMHO, is this game's only weakness, but it also encourages some VERY creative (and seemingly head-slappying d'oh! what didn't I think of that) solutions.

A modern 'The Incredible Machine'. If you want to think, play this game.\n\nPresentation: The Story is hilarious, if ultimately unimportant. The UI is clean and simple for the most part.\n\nThe gameplay is the heart of the game, in the puzzle solving. The puzzles curve well from easy in the beginning to mind-bending towards the end, not to mention the Research Net that's continually adding new puzzles. And beyond just solving them, the game challenges you to optimize your solutions in both speed and parts used, with online leader-boards for comparison.\n\nThe visuals are clean and simple, almost retro in how spartan they are. Nothing stands in the way of the 'puzzle' feel. Outside of the game board, it maintains a consistent, almost whimsical aesthetic. But don't come here looking for high quality 3D graphics, there simply aren't any.\n\nThe sound effects are largely very basic beeps and boops. The music is alright, but isn't particularly memorable, nor does it add greatly to the experience. I actually had muted mine early on, and forgot the game even had music.\n\nIn conclusion, this is everything a puzzle game needs to be, and little more. If you enjoy solving abstract puzzles, the game-play will carry this game, and you can completely overlook the points lost in other areas. There's a demo available, so there's no reason not to give it a try.","November 29, 2013","true","31.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It manages to capture the magic of computer programming and make its joys accessible to a wider audience.\n\nLet me talk about actual programming for a minute. Programming is 90% problem-solving, 9% frustration, and 1% elation over the feeling of dominance. You start with a goal in mind; creating a program for a specific function. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the computer to do what you want it to do. Once your program is finished, you run it, and find out it doesn't work. That's where the frustration comes in. You tweak your code, you run, it fails again. Lather, rinse, repeat about once per ten lines of code, then...VOILA! IT WORKS! It's a great feeling that I can't possibly describe sufficiently.\n\nSpacechem's gameplay follows the exact same process. You start with a goal in mind; taking given input molecules and turning them into given output molecules. Via problem-solving, you figure out how to tell the game what you want it to do.

It asks you, the player, to be creative and logical, to come up with your own answers for seemingly-intractable problems.  How well you receive the game will depend on how much you enjoy this type of challenge.\nIf you get stuck on the main storyline, your only real recourses are to 1. keep hammering at it, 2. search out a video of how someone else did it for inspiration, or 3. take a break and try some of the side-missions.  These are available in the 'research net' section, and are user-created challenges released periodically.  They can also be undertaken in any order you wish.\n\nThe only strikes against the game are:  Some features are not fully explained in terms of how they interact, so you have to do a bit of experimentation.\nThe working space and other limitations can be a real bear in some levels (i.e.. if you just had a bit more room to breathe, it would be a lot less frustrating).\nThey will frequently introduce some cool new feature in one mission series, show you how to use it, test you on it, then abandon it going forward.  You'll come to a level and think "ok, I just have to set this up with some switches/sensors/whatever, and I'll be good to..  they took those out?!

It can be wonderfully consuing and engaging for the right audience, and an infuriating nightmare for those who don't want to dive into the more challenging levels.\n\nIt's fun for awhile, and it's excellent in its design, though it's not something I want to spend too much time with, though those who enjoy various forms of engineering will find hours of enjoyment in this game.

But despite that it's extremely fun to play and also fun to optimize your "code".\n\nthat being said, I find that it isn't designed well for fitting on screens, and since that's how most people play video games, this is a problem. Furthermore, I tried the fullscreen mode and it was way too far zoomed in, so I could only see a small portion of the content. What's worse is that the portion I can see doesn't include the option to leave fullscreen. so now I'm stuck with an unplayable SpaceChem.

To be more precise, your job is to create procedures that assemble those compounds - yes, assemble. It’s not so much a game about chemistry as it is about creating factory lines, or concurrent programs.\n\nThe concept behind the game is nothing short of brilliant, and I don’t think there’s a single game in the market remotely like it. I was taken by it in the first few hours. After that, however, the difficulty ramped up considerably, and I found myself taking way too long to figure out a single solution.\n\nThat’s my problem with the game, it’s just too complicated for its own good. You have to spend massive amounts of time on details trying to make the solution work, and forget about the story because of how much time goes by between scenes. It ends up feeling like a job, not a diversion.\n\nSometimes, I wish I could have gotten into it. I admire people who play this game well. In fact, I spent a lot of time at Spacechem.net trying out different solutions for levels, completely taken by how brilliant they were. But I saw no joy in trying to figure them out myself.\n\nI guess SpaceChem can be compared to EVE Online in this regard. It’s a game that’s really fun to watch unfold, but only the most patient and dedicated can actually play. If you’re in that group, good, buy it, but if you’re like me, skip it. There’s not much for you here.","February 4, 2014","false","14.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

OK, forget the weird part, it's actually weird in a good sense. As Mortlach said in his review (check below, may still be there), you need to have a different taste in games to enjoy this. It is complicated and complex, plus, I find the format a little hard to read. Some enjoy it, but some don't. I don't. From the time it took me to try and, er, uh... fail one level, I assume that it must take a whopping amount of time to complete the entire game compared to other puzzle games. Still, as I said, it's not the game for me, but it may be the game for you. BE VERY SURE IF YOU WANT TO GET IT BEFORE GETTING IT. BE VERY, VERY SURE. $9.99 is quite a large amount to spend on a game you may, in the end, realize you do not like. Read reviews, watch YouTube videos and stuff. Is this the game for you? Maybe.

Bought it mostly to see if I could use it in teaching as most of my students were visual and I was not (verbal myself).  Installed and played now as saw I didn't have the cards for it (so holiday auction good for one thing at least though really valve - rather than focusing on nickel and diming those of us who use your system new games or dare I say it I think I do Half life 3?) and this is rather quite fun.  The chemistry is simple (Ag and F make silver flouride when bond together high school chemistry here in the us middle school I expect in Europe) the visual puzzles are not.  In the tutorial I am actually feeling acomplishment for figureing some out and beating friends to find better ways to do it.  When the chemistry picks up (large organic molecules requiring several reactors, having to worry about reaction conditions) this will be very challanging but fun.\n\nThe story is even good - son wanting to go into a dangerous job partly because it is dangerous mother not wanting him to (but seriously crying when your ten year old tells you what they want to do with their life ... harsh and I hope not from creators experience).\n\nBottom line want a game that will challange BOTH sides of your brain: visual, and analytical and still be fun?

Bought it mostly to see if I could use it in teaching as most of my students were visual and I was not (verbal myself).  Installed and played now as saw I didn't have the cards for it (so holiday auction good for one thing at least though really valve - rather than focusing on nickel and diming those of us who use your system new games or dare I say it I think I do Half life 3?) and this is rather quite fun.  The chemistry is simple (Ag and F make silver flouride when bond together high school chemistry here in the us middle school I expect in Europe) the visual puzzles are not.  In the tutorial I am actually feeling acomplishment for figureing some out and beating friends to find better ways to do it.  When the chemistry picks up (large organic molecules requiring several reactors, having to worry about reaction conditions) this will be very challanging but fun.\n\nThe story is even good - son wanting to go into a dangerous job partly because it is dangerous mother not wanting him to (but seriously crying when your ten year old tells you what they want to do with their life ... harsh and I hope not from creators experience).\n\nBottom line want a game that will challange BOTH sides of your brain: visual, and analytical and still be fun?  Look no farther!\n\nTo developers: Market this to chemistry teachers all levels - if I was still teaching chemistry would use though would take some creativity and maybe some modding to find ways to do it well.","December 12, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The logic of the game reveals itself pretty quick, but the really interesting stuff is when you have to figure out for yourself how to solve things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/recommended/92800/","yellowlab","YellowLab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yellowlab/","566 products in account","Back in 2000, CogniToy, now defunct, released a strange game called Mind Rover: The Europa Project. This game was of a genre I call a programming puzzle game. The object was to build a little car to complete certain tasks. However, the only thing you could do is put sensors and switches on your car and wire them together creating a program. After that, the car would run the course and either succeed or fail based on your program. Others have tried but not succeeded the way Mind Rover did, at least not for me.\n\nFast forward ten years and Indie studio Zachtronics Industries released SpaceChem. While the premise is different, the concept is the same: a programming puzzle game. In this game, you are a SpaceChem engineer whose goal is to program reactors to take input molecules and output other molecules. The goal is to create a reactor program that runs as efficiently as possible: fewest code instructions, fewest cycles and in production puzzles - fewest reactors.\n\nThe screen is split into a grid 20 by 20 squares. On the left are two inputs (alpha and beta) 10 by 10 each on the right there are two outputs (psi and omega) 4 by 4 each. There are two waldo’s, one red and one blue, that execute your program. During every cycle, the waldo’s move one square along the drawn route and execute the action (some actions, such as rotation, take an extra cycle count), if any, in the square. Each square can have one action and one redirection for each color. Actions that you can do include getting an input from the input feed, clearing the output reactors, rotating a molecule, bonding (or de-bonding) molecules together, sync the waldos’ movement. One other rule - molecules cannot bang into each other. From there, you create the program to complete the task, run the program, tweak the program, and around and around until you are satisfied.\n\nRunning through the campaign, there are several different modes: Research, Production, and Defense. In the research mode, you have one reactor in which to take the inputs and make the outputs. In production mode, you have a planet view in which there may be many inputs to many outputs. You have the ability to create multiple reactors (level dependant) and pipe them around the planet. In this case, the movement of molecules through the pipes costs one cycle count. The final mode is the last mode for each planet and is a modified production level in which there is a specific goal and sometimes a time limit. After you finish the campaign mode there are some other puzzles that can be completed for added challenge.\n\nIn all modes except defense, there is a graph that shows the results of your program. This shows how many cycles it took, how many reactors (1 on Research puzzles), and how many symbols used (every redirect or input counts as one). The big kicker is that is shows where you stand versus other players, and here is where the ultimate tweaking and optimization comes in. Slight changes in order of operations, distance waldos need to move, which waldos are waiting during sync instructions all of these can have drastic changes to how fast your program executes.\n\nI don’t know what it is about this game, but there are a couple of layers of challenge for me. On the first level, I just want to get a solution. The learning curve is fairly steep and there isn’t a user manual. There are about 10 tutorial missions, and the research usually gives some hint as to things you may need to use in future missions, but the puzzle difficult ramps up fairly quickly. The second is to optimize my solution. Moving things around and changing the order of operations can shave cycles off as well as reducing the number of symbols. The next optimization is to watch the reactor and see if one of the waldos is spending too much idle time. If so, can it be doing another task. This is easier to do in research puzzles as there aren’t restrictions on inputs and outputs. However, in production puzzles the reactors must wait to be fed (which takes time) and output pipes can only hold so much material. These reactors may stall while waiting to complete an instruction and in doing so create a jam. As you progress, you learn little tricks to get things to work more efficiently. These can be used in earlier puzzles to greatly improve times on earlier puzzles.\n\nI know that this type of game isn’t for everyone, but I love getting into the game and tinkering and tweaking on puzzle solutions to make it 2 cycles faster (obviously more is better, but any little bit is a victory). If you are a fan of puzzle games or like programming (even better if you like both) then I would suggest giving SpaceChem a try","July 3, 2011","true","95.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"almost" being the keyword. if you hate anything related to science this game is not for you as the games theme is very much related, in addition if you ABSOLUTELY HATE being put to the test with each level then again this game is not for you as each level after the tutorial just becomes difficult, even IF you know what your doing it still takes time to figure out the puzzle. Logic is a must for this game. otherwise youll NEVER be able to beat it. even then after logging 19 hours on it im only just now reaching the 15th level. in other words about 20% through the game.\n\npros: simple, completely logic based, nice progression.\n\ncons: almost nothing except the difficulty may not be for some.","October 14, 2014","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you complete a difficult mission and check out other solutions on youtube, you might find there was a way to solve it 5x more efficiently, and it will blow you away.

That learning curve may leave a lot of folks out in the cold, as I've found you need to learn specific techniques to complete the middle to later levels, and if you don't happen to think them up (or perhaps look them up) you might be left frustrated.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzlers and difficulty I heartily recommend SpaceChem.

Complex gameplay mechanics, insufficient instructions and a non-illustrated storyline (which looked like it attained quite some inspiration from a generic fanfic) is enough to bore even the most patient gamer. But behind all that, you can leave your fast-paced FPSes behind and take SpaceChem with an open mind, it's actually a rather interesting game once you scrape the surface and get to the inner layers. To be fair, I still don't quite get some of the in-game mechanics, and I'm starting to struggle on the second planet, but that's the purpose of a puzzle game. If a puzzle game is simple, it's not a puzzle game; it's a test to check your sanity.\nBut anyways, this game may seem uninteresting and even dreadful at times, but it's honestly a well-thought out puzzle game that simply doesn't have enough shine on its surface to keep players on the game for more than 10 minutes.

There isn't much actual chemistry in the game; it's used more as a basis for the puzzles. The storyline was good, the visuals were fine. The reason why this game stands out is the open-endedness of the puzzles; finding your own solution and improving upon it is the main thrill of this game, and the euphoria of completing a puzzle or optimizing your design to the most efficient possible is where this game gets its fun. There bell curves (usually) in the missions, which tell you how well your solution is compared to others.\n\nI've been told that this game is quite similar to programming, which may drive you away or towards this game. I find it more about making a machine and watching it work as it executes commands the way you programmed it.\n\nOn the other side, I'd say that the graphics in the reactors themselves are rather bland, but I can excuse that as it would become too complex if it weren't bland. I'd prefer if the game had told me what you can do and what you can't do with the molecules (can't collide), and there are some hidden tricks which are not mentioned at all (bonder priority, especially, though particle smashing to a lesser extent as well). The music also may get a bit repetitive (I personally can't get tired of it though).\n\nOther than that, this game is quite an amazing puzzle game.

But this game is different. This game feels like real world design challenges. This game feels like a combination of programming, proving geometric statements and (just a little bit, despite of its name) chemistry.\n\nThis game's logic works like this: you have two loops running at the same time, each can carry out certain commands in their courses; your task is to time those commands so that they do the right thing at the right time, and in the end find a way to synchronize the two loops so that they can loop back to their oriignal starting point and the whole process resets. You have limited space to place your commands so you have to really think hard where you place them (like the steric hinderance effect in real world chemistry synthesis).\n\nOverall, a really, really fun, thought-provoking game.","June 27, 2014","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will admit I am not very far in to the game, I also have to say that SpaceChem is really as boring as dirt, I doubt it will keep my attention long, and I am easily entertained! So why then you ask am I so willing to recommend it? Pure and simply because of its difficulty of course! Not often will you find a puzzle game that is so "simple" yet so hard, I think alot of it comes from them giving you so many different ways to complete each puzzle. You dont actually have to know chemistry to play this game. I think this is because the game is more pseudo chemistry really, so dont be afraid to try it.\n\nOverall I have got to say, SpaceChem is a "Simple Hard" puzzle game, that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of puzzle games. It really does take a special kind of person to enjoy this game, and not get bored almost immediately though. So be warned, if your not good at, or not interested in puzzle games, this is a game you may want to stay away from. To everyone else though, go take a look, you may be surprised.","September 17, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/92800/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I got this game when it was being offered for free, and I must say, it is easily the most challenging puzzle game I own. Zachtronics, the creators of Ironclad Tactics, also made this game, and you can count on them to consistently deliver unique, fun, and challenging games.\n\nIf you enjoy challenging puzzles - in particular, circuit-based ones, space themes, progressively challening levels (this is basically the Demon/Dark Souls of puzzlers), and pondering on what the solution is for hours (or even days) at a time, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - you will mostly be looking at a grid with blue and red circuits, however, the detail put into the land, structures, and "others" (usually the end of every planet) is well-done. The music is very good. There is quite a bit of lore that provides the story if you are interested - it's also well-written.\n\nThe controls are simple, as you can do everything with only the mouse. There is an option for using keyboard hotkeys, and I personally found it easier (and much faster) to use the hotkeys. The learning curve is moderate to extremely difficult - mostly depending on your understanding of circuitry (chemistry is actually not that important in the game, as you will be given instructions). The game does a very good job of presenting you with progressively more and more difficult scenarios, adding new mechanics at every planet. The tutorial is absolutely essential and will help you understand the basics of the game.\n\nBe advised, the game implements very strong scaffolding, so if you do not understand the mechanics in the earlier levels and resort to guides/walkthroughs, you will have an extremely difficult time completing the levels on your own. I recommend you take a look at some video walkthroughs only if you've been stuck for a long while, as there may also be a new mechanic you have not thought of yet. Admittedly, I had been stuck on a puzzle for over a week, so I finally gave in and looked for a solution online - I was then able to complete the next few puzzles with knowledge gathered from the stage I was stuck on (I had not fully understood the new mechanic that was introduced).\n\nThe circuit puzzles all consist of constructing an element/compound with your two starting circuits (blue and red), and dropping them into the output section of the grid. There are many restrictions and a large variety of different ways to solve each level.\n\nLater, you will need to take care of production, so you will not only be mapping out circuits (red and blue), but you will also be building reactors - and attaching them to things with pipes. Even more later on, you will be presented with "defense" levels, where you must power weapons to fend off enemies.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for an extremely good challenge and like circuitry, give this game a try. It will tease your brain quite a bit, and you may or may not love it. If you are intimidated by circuitry-based puzzles (and a minimal amount of chemistry), you may want to pass on this one.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 15, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tools you are given to create elements seems to never stop and the intense complexity of some of the later levels borders on a form of cerebral torture which makes the solutions all the more rewarding when you get there. I often find myself chanting "YOU CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT" before it's 3AM and I haven't inserted the right number of flip-flop sync cycles to detach 2 hydrogen atoms and bind them with Silicon and Phosphorous which come as inputs in a seemingly random order. Wut?\n\nThere are often many ways of doing things, but you are benchmarked for your efficieny in the leaderboards versus other players.

It's a fiendish and quite unique puzzle game that has you manipulating atoms and assembling molecules inside special reactors. The process of engineering the assembly lines, however, resembles the usage of a visual programming language. A friend of mine said that if you have any spark of a programmer inside of you, you will love this game. I agree with him. The 'language' that the Spacechem reactors use may be somewhat limited, but that's what forms much of the challenge of the game.\n\nAnd I mean it when I say it's fiendish. The tutorials are more akin to guidelines, and they don't tell you some of the tricks you will probably end up needing, meaning that self-discovery plays a fairly large role. Fortunately enough, the solutions are open-ended - seeing your solution work provides much of the satisfaction of the game. That's why if you get stuck (and you will probably get stuck a fair amount), it's best to find hints, go back to earlier levels to try and find inspiration from them or simply take a break.\n\nAnyway. Surprisingly for a puzzle game, it has a pretty good story, killer music and Team Fortress 2 promotional items. You'll need to use TF2's advanced crafting to make them, and you need to solve three puzzles to gain all the crafting ingredients you need. It's a pretty remarkable implementation, perhaps one of the most remarkable out of all of TF2's promos.","March 6, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

(EDIT: It seems to not be saving my progress. Dammit. Oh well, I guess I get to have more practice, then.)\n\nI've played a lot of programming puzzle games before. As a general rule, if you're teaching an aspect of computer science, it usually turns out fairly good, and if you're just teaching people how to bash directions into a small space, it usually sucks.\n\nAnd then you've got stuff like SpaceChem, RoboZZle, and Jahooma's LogicBox, which are a bit of both. And they turn out amazing.\n\n(There are other categories, although Hack 'n' Slash gets its own special category for pretending to teach you how to hack but you have to go through some cumbersome chores first and you get bored before you finish them. Avoid.)\n\nSpaceChem, from a computer science perspective, is a game about multithreading, and avoiding race conditions. Or something like that.\n\nFrom a non-compsci perspective, it's about moving atoms around, binding them together, and hoping you get the right results and also hoping they don't smash into each other.\n\nEither way, it's a puzzle game that holds your hand for a few tutorial levels and basically gives you the "standard" answer, and then leaves you to it. It has a rather sharp difficulty curve, but even if you're stumped on a later level, you can always go back to an earlier one and look at just how bad the "standard" solution you were given on a silver platter was, and improve on it.\n\nYou can also compute compete against your friends to see who can solve a puzzle in the fewest number of cycles, or use the fewest number of symbols... or the fewest number of reactors for some of the later puzzles that are still early enough to be in the demo version.\n\nDid I mention there's a demo version? You should play it, and then if you like it (and I will make you like it) then you can throw your money at Zachtronics and get the full version.\n\nIn short, SpaceChem is a really good programming puzzle game that teaches you the fun of dealing with race conditions, and there's more than one way to do each puzzle.","January 12","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh, Spacechem.. Where to start!?\n\nTax your grey matter to it's limit!\n\nDo you hear the words "Puzzle game" and get a general feeling of dis-interest? Do you think about chemistry and then immediately stop thinking about chemistry? Fear not! Spacechem is one of THE MOST unique puzzle experiences you will EVER have! Don't be afraid of it's chemistry topic, either - For while the compounds you'll be breaking down and assembling are real, with appropriate atomic bonds, you don't need to understand a lick of chemistry to play.\n\nThe puzzles involve you designing the interior of atomic reactors, using robotic manipulators called "Waldos" that move on paths you specify and obey commands you place on those paths to grab, rotate, bond & de-bond atoms and a host of other actions to transform raw input compounds - one molecule at a time - into the matter you need.\n\nThe game is free of bugs and has high production values. There are enough levels to keep you working for a LONG time, split into different chapters taking place on different planets with the beginning of each chapter introducing a new reactor [game] mechanic. The levels get devilishly difficult and due to it's nature, there are almost infinite ways to solve any puzzle. As long as you output the correct compunds to the waiting shipping barge, exactly the steps you take to create that compound are entirely up to you!\n\nThis game will tax your problem-solving, logic and lateral-thinking.

You will probably finish the first couple of levels in a few minutes each but as new concepts are introduced it get's increasingly complex and you'll really have to strain your brain and spend hours on a single level.\nIf you're stuck, try your hands on some user generated levels. SpaceChem has A LOT of content, easily hundreds of hours.","May 17, 2013","true","54.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Oh, Spacechem.. Where to start!?\n\nTax your grey matter to it's limit!\n\nDo you hear the words "Puzzle game" and get a general feeling of dis-interest? Do you think about chemistry and then immediately stop thinking about chemistry? Fear not! Spacechem is one of THE MOST unique puzzle experiences you will EVER have! Don't be afraid of it's chemistry topic, either - For while the compounds you'll be breaking down and assembling are real, with appropriate atomic bonds, you don't need to understand a lick of chemistry to play.\n\nThe puzzles involve you designing the interior of atomic reactors, using robotic manipulators called "Waldos" that move on paths you specify and obey commands you place on those paths to grab, rotate, bond & de-bond atoms and a host of other actions to transform raw input compounds - one molecule at a time - into the matter you need.\n\nThe game is free of bugs and has high production values. There are enough levels to keep you working for a LONG time, split into different chapters taking place on different planets with the beginning of each chapter introducing a new reactor [game] mechanic. The levels get devilishly difficult and due to it's nature, there are almost infinite ways to solve any puzzle. As long as you output the correct compunds to the waiting shipping barge, exactly the steps you take to create that compound are entirely up to you!\n\nThis game will tax your problem-solving, logic and lateral-thinking. Highly recommended for those with an above-average IQ and highly recommended for anyone who wants to sink their teeth into a real mental challenge.","January 8, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are loads of puzzles to do so there's no shortage of content. However it's more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch.\n\nI recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions.

Puzzles have a single solution that you must ferret out. This game presents problems that need to be solved with creativity and ingenuity. It's basically a visual programming game. It's for those who want a mental challenge and it provides that in spades. After you finish each challenge you're given histograms (histograms! Why don't more games have these? They're so much better at providing performance data than useless leaderboards) of how efficient your solution was compared to other players in how fast it is, how many reactors it uses and how many commands it uses.

It is a well crafted puzzle game that encourages creativity in its solutions.\n\nIn this game, there is a grid.  On this grid, you will place molecules, you will move molecules, and you will export specific, predetermined molecules.  The catch is, you have to do so by constructing a machine in advance, and then let it solve the problem for you.  Making such a machine is not easy, and it is rare that it will work as expected the first time.  The "machine" as I described it is composed of two tracks, with instructions along them.  A disc, which the game calls a WALDO, travels along each track, following the instructions as it comes across them.  The instructions include making an input molecule appear, making an output molecule disappear, grabbing/dropping a molecule, and bonding two molecules together.\n\nThere are many ways to beat each level.  Some are more efficient than others.  The great thing about this is that it encourages you to replay old levels to try to find the most optimized way of beating them.  You get to compare the efficiency of your solutions to the solutions of others.  This is probably the hardest puzzle game I've ever played (I still haven't beaten it, even on the iPad), but it is definitely the most satisfying.  There's a real joy when your contraption finally comes together and works as planned.  And the challenge is such that it ultimately feels fair.  There's always a "best" way to do it, but whatever you can come up with, so long as it gets the job done, is acceptable.\n\nIf you want a challenging, well made game that encourages creative solutions to puzzles, then look no further than this game.","November 27, 2013","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are loads of puzzles to do so there's no shortage of content. However it's more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don't know if it gets added in a later level or not (I'm about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch.\n\nI recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions. A nice feature included is a built-in youtube recorder and uploader to show off your own solutions too so they are easy to find.","July 23, 2011","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Zachtronics Industries proved that their sandbox games deserve a bigger scope. Spacechem offers dozens of puzzles in a story-driven campaign, where you need to design and optimize atomic assembly lines. Usually, you just need to produce given compounds, but the real fun begins when you need to manage the reactions in real time to defend yourself against exotic space monsters.\n\nFor serious players, the game offers achievements, an optimization race in leaderboard statistics, and hundreds of player-created puzzles in the Journal of Reaction Engineering.\n\nWhile the main game environment looks very technical, you will become absorbed in building, optimizing and debugging your reactions to achieve results that initially seemed impossible. The austere environment of reactor grids is accompanied by beautiful hand-drawn visuals of various planets and cosmic monsters. The music is original, fitting, I would even say motivational, yet another high-quality element of the whole impressive piece.\n\nSo, if you are actually reading this review, I cannot recommend Spacechem enough.

I can't emphasize how dumb this game makes me feel when I'm struggling with finding a solution. Then, suddenly I feel like Einstein! It works! I'm a genius! Then I proceed to the next puzzle, play it for a bit and go back to the one I just completed. It needs to be optimized. Then I shave off a few things, make it a bit more elegant and feel even smarter.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the most brilliant part of this game: you want to go back, making an even better solution. I'd equate it with programming. Even if you code a solution you always think that you might be able to tweak it just a bit, nip off a line here and a line there. That is this game. Programming in form of a game.\n\nThe story deserves a mention as well. While I can't claim to have seen all of it, due to being too stupid to progress at the moment, so far it's excellent.

The puzzles give you inputs, what needs to outputted, and the tools you can use. Since for most of the game you have more tools than you need, even the simplest puzzles can be solved in a myriad of ways. This makes you feel like you are actually creating something new, instead of just discovering the one correct solution.\n\nBe warned that this game is difficult. From the start they expect you to grasp new concepts rapidly, and the game never stops ramping up. I got stuck in this game many times. For some puzzles, I had to break out pencil and paper to get my ideas straight. For some puzzles, I had to sleep it over to get the solution. However, the thrill of finally being able to get my reactor to run made the struggle worth it.\n\nThere is a demo.

The game challenges the player to come up with the most elegant solution (using the least amount of resources). Being an IT engineer, when I first watched the tutorial video, admittedly I thought in my head "oh great, this is going to be like my job" and while the gameplay does remind me a little bit like writing code, it was actually surprisingly fun.\n\nThe game's overall presentation is nice, somewhat simple but it's tastefully done. The music is good, although at times it made feel like I'm watching a movie from the 90s. The pacing of the game is well done; the player is sanely and graciously introduced to game elements.\n\nThe game's design allows for any number of solutions and after solving a problem the player is presented with a bell curve as to how they compared to "other engineers" (ie players). I really appreciated this aspect as it let me know that a more efficent and elegant solution is possible.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that it actually did feel a bit like my job (but in a good way). The feeling of satisfation I got from completing a puzzle was similiar to the satisfaction I get when writing a piece of code I'm proud of at work. It's a good feeling but by the end of the day I'm usually more keen on relaxation instead of solving complex problems.\n\nOverall this game is nicely designed and definitely worth consideration. This game engages the mind and respects the player with interesting and challenging puzzles. The world needs more games like this.\n\nScore: 8.5/10\n\n\n","December 14, 2013","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You've been warned!.\n\nThe game starts with easy to understand tutorials and easy puzzles and then, difficulty increases puzzle after puzzle up to the hell.\nThe overall goal for each puzzle is to get some atoms or molecules and transform them, to send the results to some storage  later.\nTo transform particles, you use reactors. Each reactor can have up to two input and two ouput spots. You chain reactors and storages through pipes. You can chain reactors to produce the final product with the help of intermediate products.\nReactors have some kind of program, with some special instructions: wait for input, grab, drop, rotate, bind, unbind, sync, branch if certain atom is being detected, flush the output area, etc. You will have to "program" a sequence of instructions to solve the puzzle and, just with the instructions and tools available for each puzzle.\n\nGraphics are good and attractive enough for this particular kind of game. The User's Interface is clear, easy to learn and, easy to use, very straight forward. You can do everything with just the mouse or, you can use keyboard shortcuts if you like it.\nThe game was very well programmed, has no glitches, works smoothly and, seems to be very well optimized.\n\nThis game is one on its kind. The idea is very original and, even that game mechanics sound so easy that can end boring you, the real thing is that puzzles are so challenging that you don't have such a feeling.\nBut, be aware, if you don't like games that challenge your mind, don't buy this one; after a few of short easy puzzles you will face really challenging ones.\n\nI could say this is a casual game but, believe it, once you start a challenging puzzle, you will loose hours or days trying to figure out a solution. It's highly addictive.\n\nYou can learn from solutions already designed by other people, by watching some youtube video (and, yes, you will do that), To beat the rest of community of players, you should solve the puzzles by using the less ammount of cycles (production cycles), the less amount of resources (reactors, storages, etc.) and the less amount of symbols (programming instructions).\nIf to figure out a solution is challenging by itself, imagine how hard can be trying to beat other "engineers" (that's how the game calls to the player).","April 23, 2015","true","78.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While other games, such as the Contraption Maker, offer a wide variet of actions and tools, this game only offers 1 set of tools that mostly amount to: rotate, turn, up, down, left, right.  These tools offer no unique aspect of behavioral interaction like other puzzles.\n\nThat's ok, I guess.  It's a science game written by someone who loves the tedium of scientific endeavors.  It's accompanied by a short story/novel you can read as you progress.\n\nFor those who like this type of game, buy it, otherwise - you'll find yourself bored real fast.

In Spacechem the player must manipulate elements and chemical compounds into other compounds to proceed.  The method for accomplishing this boils down to a form of visualized computer programming, where the player transforms chemical compounds using a logical sequence that they create, modify, and optimize.  In addition to advancing to newer challenges, the game offers leaderboards to compare the player's solution to others using a couple of different metrics for efficiency.  The result is a somewhat unique experience and very rewarding feeling when finally piecing together or elegantly refining a solution.","July 12, 2012","true","50.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not for the faint of heart. Shortly after the tutorial levels your intelligence will be challenged. If you're one of the elite few who have what it takes to make it to the last levels of the game then your sanity will be challenged.\n\nI'm sure I've gotten hundreds of hours of quality puzzle time from this game (I was playing the Linux version before Steam was available on Linux) and I consider completing this game the greatest gaming feat I will ever accomplish. Mostly because no one makes games this challenging.\n\n"The second incorrect assumption we made was thinking that puzzle games need to be difficult and long to be good. Although challenge is essential to making puzzle games "work", the difficulty that emerges from the mechanics of SpaceChem can be bewildering, even if it's what makes the puzzles feel so open-ended. Combining this intrinsic difficulty with an abundance of puzzles that must be beaten to "complete" the game gives SpaceChem an oppressive 40+ hour difficulty curve that only 2 percent of players reach the end of."\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/172250/postmortem_zachtronics_.php","April 29, 2011","true","25.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've owned it for years and I've never gotten past the tutorial. The first thing they do is teach you how to construct a hydrogen molecule and get it out of the reactor. So then on the second step of the tutorial, it should be clear that when they ask you to build a hydrogen molecule, you should use the same format. Unfortunately that format, the only thing the player knows at this point, doesn't actually work and the game offers no hints at all as to how to fix your circuit.

It really isn't for me.\n\nEdit:\nI found out that, in addition to delays with pipes, you need to guess the orientation of the bonders.

They called their most trusted babysitter. When the babysitter arrived, the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later that night, the babysitter got bored and went to watch TV, but she couldn't watch it downstairs because they did not have cable downstairs (the parents didn't want children watching too much garbage). So, she called them and asked them if she could watch cable in the parent's room. Of course, the parents said it was OK, but the babysitter had one final request… she asked if she could cover up the angel statue outside the bedroom window with a blanket or cloth, at the very least close the blinds, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father who was talking to the babysitter at the time said, "..Take the children and get out of the house…we will call the police. We do not have an angel statue." The police found all three of the house occupants dead within ten minutes of the call. No statue was found.","January 8, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","2","22","0","0"

WOW! This game blew me away the first time I booted up with the first tutorial and the Physics and Chemistry we all know (and love, if you love Physics and Chemistry), the game is based in space where you create atoms and bond them, then later on you have to bond even more with the reactors and more stuff coming my way as the game unlocks even more surprises.\n\nThe first time I got this game with the PCGamer/BundleStars giveaway (June 2014), I felt that this game was rubbish, the first time I looked at it. BUT this game proved me wrong, and I feel guilty for calling this game rubbish because it is not!\n\nBUT BE WARNED! Don't buy/get this game if you don't like Physics/Chemistry, or very challenging puzzles as the game does focus around atoms and the bonding of atoms and all the substances from the Periodic Table etc... so if you don't like those types of games that have science in it, don't buy this game. PLUS, the puzzles are quite challenging, each puzzle from where I am which is still in the tutorial stage (Surprisingly this game is really long) are quite challenging, the puzzle length (from my end) take around 15-20 minutes each, so they are quite challenging... So if you don't like challenging puzzles such as this game, don't buy it!\n\nThe length... this game is REALLY long! REALLY REALLY long! Almost 44-55 hours to finish the game, as far as I know the first few planets are just some tutorial stages!!! Which comes to show how long this game and the dedication the people had in developing this game, which is great and shows in this game! Normally I don't play long games, but I am happy enough with this game, and I'll try and finish this game (maybe in 6 years time)\n\nOverall, this game is very different from your regular indie game, with Physics/Chemistry integration with its challenging puzzles and a nice and strange Sci-Fi story, this game is a TRUE indie gem, that should not be missed at all!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get "Best Game of 2014" or "Best Indie Game", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)","June 27, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a lot of people in the reviews will tell you, however, it **is** a game about programming, to an extent. The general flow of the game involves taking a fixed set of inputs and figuring out a specific set of instructions that will produce the desired output for the level. It's an extremely simple approach to puzzle design, but that's where SpaceChem shines. Because every level can generally be described as a brief list of inputs and outputs, puzzles will stick in your mind for long after you step away from the computer, and you can spend a lot of time thinking about solutions wherever you are.\nSpacechem's greatest, strength, though, is it's difficulty curve. The game does a superb job of introducing an enormous amount of unique mechanics at a rate that makes them feel exciting instead of overwhelming. You always feel like you're playing with a larger set of tools than you had previously, and it rarely feels like too much to handle. That said, the game is far from easy. It takes a lot of real, genuine thought to complete a lot of this game's levels, but the satisfaction that comes from seeing your convoluted series of instructions running in a perfect loop is immensely satisfying.\n\nAt the end of the day, Spacechem is a puzzle game, and a fairly challenging one. If you're looking for something to tickle your brain a little, you really can't go wrong with SpaceChem.","December 30, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps "High School Chemistry: Puzzle Game Edition." If that had been the case, I probably wouldn't have complained. What I got, though, was something rather different and much more impressive.\n\nAt its core, SpaceChem is a process engineering simulator. It has a very smooth learning curve, and gives players plenty of time to ease into the systems and mechanics. But the really interesting part isn't simply managing to "complete" one puzzle to the next, but how well you can complete each puzzle. There are multiple factors which are measured at the end of each level, which means that optimization is almost never a one-way road. You're balancing your emphasis on the time it takes to finish, the number of reactors you're using, and how complex the instructions within each reactor are. Of course, you could always take the lazy way and just try to get through each puzzle as fast as you can to see what's next, leaving optimization as something to look at in the distant future.\n\nWhy the interest in progression, though? Because SpaceChem actually has a good story. It's told largely through pure text logs at the start of every several levels, but it does an outstanding job of linking the player to the protagonist. You're not sitting at your computer or laptop solving some random puzzles, you're a chemical engineer working on complex problems with often less than adequate equipment and dire situations in the way of getting the job done. The way this is extended further to using your knowledge of the engineering processes to solve non-manufacturing problems is absolutely brilliant, and a fantastic example of telling a story through game mechanics.\n\nAs fair warning, though, even without working toward optimization, the game becomes quite challenging in the later parts. People looking for more casual puzzle games may want to think twice before diving into this one if they're planning to work through to the end.","January 3, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The curve is not straight, I'm telling you. I finished the five or six first worlds (planets), and damn have I been stuck for MONTHS! But I'll play that game anytime if I have new ideas (I refuse to look at the walkthroughs or clues).\nGreat, great, great, game.","October 3, 2014","true","45.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love programming, buy it. But most importantly, if you love a challenge, buy it. This game gets ridiculously difficult later on, and in a world where games are pandering to "casual" gamers more and more, that's a really important feature.\n\nThe game makes you feel dumb when you fail and really smart when you succeed.

The puzzles are very challenging and for some might be frustrating but if you are of an analytical mindset and enjoy programming or logic puzzles you will be in for a great treat with SpaceChem.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is that every single puzzle can be solved in a miriad number of ways (some more elegant and efficient than others) but each unique solution will take a lot of effort to complete and because of that you have a great sense of accomplishment with every one.  Even when you don't have a complete solution the progress you make toward that goal is very enjoyable even if 1/2 way through you realizes a better way to approach the problem and end up scrapping all your work up to that point only to start over from a new direction. The only negative I can give is that the story pane seems very corny and contrived and really unecessary to the game but you can really just ignore that wall of text as it has no bearing on the puzzles or their solution. Highly recommended for puzzle fans. Avoid if your easily frustrated, the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty quickly.","July 4, 2014","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is a puzzle game, it is nothing like the popular puzzle games out now (e.g. bejeweled and its many clones). The game looks like it should appeal to Chemists, but the people that seem to enjoy and do well in this game are typically software/electrical engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and the like. The underlying link seems to be an understanding of programing logic to some extent. (I'm sure there are people that play and enjoy the game that haven't had a lick of programming experience, but I haven't seen many.) Indeed, the chemistry mechanic of the game is secondary and extremely questionable in terms of the reality of it.\nWhile I really enjoy this game, there is a *sharp* learning curve. The tutorials can only teach you so much. This again reminds me of computer programing: you can know the basics, but that does not prepare you for the mental exercise of working out a complex challenge. That being said, there are few games that have given me the feeling of accomplishment and pride when I finally work out a solution.","October 14, 2013","true","142.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You accomplish this using a series of reactors which can add, remove or re-arrange the atoms of a compound: each of these is a puzzle in and of itself. Deciding how many and which type of reactor to use in each level provides a sort of macro puzzle. Many levels limit the type and/or number or reactors available, providing variety in addition to aesthetic and compound differences. You can save and load reactor layouts, allowing you to use them in different levels.\n\nEach level is so brilliantly complex in that you are not only trying to construct the most efficient way to modify the compounds within each reactor, you must also consider the overall purpose of each reactor in sequence: given that most compounds require several different reactors to change them into the desired result.\n\nAdditionally (yes, there is more: bear with me, it will be worth it!), each level must be completed within a certain time frame or 'cycles'. Transporting each compound from the start to the destination takes time, as does modifying them through each reactor. If not designed efficiently, you may end up with bottlenecks in your chain of reactors, leading to the overall level time being too slow. This is usually fixed through some minor tweaking and provides another level of strategic planning to the each levels.\n\nI found the muisic to be quite enjoyable and the astheic both functional and pleasing to look at. There is an overacrching story, which is told between levels. It is very well written, and quite interesting. I fear however, that I will never see the end of the story, due to my own incompetence and to the sheer complexity and intricacy of the puzzles.","February 10, 2013","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Likely, it's a periodic elemnts based puzzler. At first glance, it looks like something too daunting and requiring you to go back to grade school scient to understand whats going on, but the use of the periodic table is mostly for the theme amd a bit less scientific mechanics of what atom does what. You need to control the circles called "waldos" to grab and drop elements in a reactor to meet the ouput element requirement. This involves finding a way to path the waldos so they grab atoms, possibly bond them together, and put them in the proper output without having the items collide or break apart due to the instructions you give them. Realistically, it's still a bit complicated and I don't think I have the patience or smarts to finish it, but now that I dabbled with the tutorial and understand the mechanics a bit, I DEFINITELY see a solid puzzler for a gamer who wants to test their brain. I got a little joy and entertainment when I figured out how to use syncing of waldos to make the bonds act as needed.

Design solutions to problems.  You use a set of simple, visual programming commands to build a machine to change inputs into new outputs.  It starts simple, but the complexity builds quickly.   The small set of commands are easy to understand and the levels are designed well to introduce each new action in turn with a relatively simple puzzle before asking you to combine it with previous commands in complex ways.\n\nA successful solution isn't necessarily the end of that level if you prefer.  At the end of a solution, you are presented with your ranking against the averages of others based on things like how long your solution took, or how many commands you used.  You can continue the gameplay by working to optimize your solution.\n\nWho will like this game?\nProgrammers, engineers, fans of games like Incredible Machine, or people who like making crazy automatic things in Minecraft.  Lego builders who ignore directions.\n\nThe Good:\nLots of puzzle variety in the main game, plus a whole integrated set of puzzles that are online.  Histograms allow you to work to refine designs for different goals in each level allowing for good replay value on each puzzle\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's hard.  Very few people actually complete all the puzzles in the game (which has been noted by the developer).\n\nSpecial Note:\nIn addition to this Steam playtime, I probably have equal amounts of time played on the iPad version, which I take with me for travel.","July 12, 2012","true","85.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are very challenging and for some might be frustrating but if you are of an analytical mindset and enjoy programming or logic puzzles you will be in for a great treat with SpaceChem.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is that every single puzzle can be solved in a miriad number of ways (some more elegant and efficient than others) but each unique solution will take a lot of effort to complete and because of that you have a great sense of accomplishment with every one.  Even when you don't have a complete solution the progress you make toward that goal is very enjoyable even if 1/2 way through you realizes a better way to approach the problem and end up scrapping all your work up to that point only to start over from a new direction. The only negative I can give is that the story pane seems very corny and contrived and really unecessary to the game but you can really just ignore that wall of text as it has no bearing on the puzzles or their solution.

Then I go in and find a way to make those compounds when I'm back at the computer.\n\nVery great game, would reccommend to anyone.\n","November 5, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The object of the game is to use two pathways to assemble the atoms of elements in a grid from input to output, essentially programming a machine to create the desired output. This game is only for a certain type of person. If you're not prepared to have your brain explode, or you hate it when you can't get a puzzle right away, I don't recommend this game for you. It's really that hard. Solutions around mid-game will probably take you an hour or two. If you're not very inclined with logic and algorithms you may not like this game. However, even if any of these applied to you, I still think it's worth a buy, if only to experience the difficulty this game features, even so early on. If this kind of puzzler is your cup of tea, then do I have the game for you. Whenever you find a solution to a puzzle, the immense feeling of pride is overwhelming. As you're guiding the elements you'll actually feel like a scientist on a breakthrough project. When you do finally solve a puzzle after hours of planning, you'll want to make it more efficent and quicker than what you already have. You'll want to watch it work in front of you as you admire your handywork. If you enjoy working out difficult problems and like a programming-type style of puzzle then you are this game's audience.","June 25, 2014","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed it, but I ended up rage quitting an hour in. As far as understanding it the moment they introduce it to you, good luck. After experimenting with it for a while, you learn what the stuff does and how to organize it to make your cycles work...then the bonders came in...\n\nThe game looks easy, but it's hard to reach up and grab it while it's over your head. It has to click with you to be able to do...really anything. I loved how there is challenge even in the tutorial. If you're looking for hours and hours of puzzling strategy on how to get this atom to come over here, make this atom collide with it, use the bonders to make this molecule, get this molecule to that output, then cycle it back around without the wrong molecules touching, this is definitely a game for you.\n\nIf you're impatient like me, not so much....\n\nOverall, I think it is a great game. The graphics are fairly fun, the gameplay makes sense, yet is puzzling at the same time, and nothing is impossible if you keep thinking on how it works, which there are multiple ways. I won't say anything too biased on my patience, so I have to say the game works quite well, is fun, and keeps your mind working on end.

The premise is based on chemistry and the mechanics use the same types of math and logic skills as computer programming, which makes it a great game to throw at a kid to prime them for high school math and science classes... but since it's not actively trying to teach these things, they won't realize they're being edumacated at the same time.","March 8, 2012","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
