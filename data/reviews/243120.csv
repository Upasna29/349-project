In fact, I'm not entirely sure it can even be categorised as a 'game' per se... I shall try to explain.\n\nYou begin shipwrecked on a beach in 1604; all you know is that you sailed from England to join a colony in the Americas. You are met with an eerie, black-and-white landscape, devoid of colour and, apparently, life. You make your way up the beach, and from there you must begin to explore your environment in order to work out where you are, and what has happened here. Things are clearly wrong in this unsettling place. Your only ally is a mysterious woman in red who doesn't know her own name. Your enemies vary from Spanish Conquistadors with demonic red eyes to bow-wielding natives who utter unearthly howls as they stalk you through forests and grasslands; you barely see them coming before they are upon you, attacking and darting away before you can return fire. When you find and ring the fort's bell, the world around you shifts; just when you thought the daylight was scary enough, the night-world is ever more terrifying with skeletons and ghosts to be found all around you, shrieking in the darkness.\n\nSo, scene set, let's start with the basics. The monochromatic graphics are brave and striking; the rendering is gorgeous and you soon get used to looking at this greyscale world, as items of interest are vividly marked in red. But don't be fooled, this doesn't make anything easy to see coming, as realistic wind effects keep the trees and grasses shifting, fooling the eye into seeing movement where there is none, or covering the stealthy approach of a foe. The wind is both your enemy and your ally; you freeze when it blows, for fear that you've seen or heard something moving, or you can dash through the gusts, knowing the sound and movement of the wind will disguise the noise of your approach.\n\nAs if this didn't make things tense enough, sound is extremely important. There is no background music and no vocal acting; all you will hear is the wind, and the sounds around you - some enemies can be detected by the clanking of their armour, distincive howls, or gutteral roars. Early on you gain the ability to listen, using your HUD to follow sounds to be led to clues, locations and lost souls in need of rescue. Ring a bell to enter into the night-world and the sounds are amplified; the dull clanging of the bell, the screaming of wraiths, and having to use your listening ability to pinpoint the next clue... Seriously, play this game at night, alone, with the lights off and no other background noise, and you will discover a whole new level of immersion in this terrifying world. It will probably give you nightmares. And PTSD. Especially if there's a sudden noise in the house while you're immersed... honestly, last night, my cat sneezed while I was creeping up on a heavily-garrisoned fort area, and I had three kinds of heart attack all at once.\n\nOne of the hardest concepts to grasp in this game is that for pretty much all of the time you will not have a single clue what you are supposed to be doing - or even if you are supposed to be doing anything. Think about it - most games you play will have clear cut objectives, quests and story lines to follow. Betrayer doesn't give you any of that, and to be honest, why should it? It's realism at its finest - in real life, a stranger doesn't approach you in the street and tell you that the answer to all you seek is in the next town, here's a map, speak to so-and-so and report back to me so I can tell you what to do next... Betrayer expects you to behave as you might if you really did wash up on a beach in 1604. Figure it out for yourself! Take a walk - look around - collect clues - piece it together - find scraps of paper - talk to the friendly folk - kill the ones that try to kill you - trial and error; you'll get there in the end. Hopefully...\n\n...Which is why this game gets mixed reviews, it seems. Betrayer will frustrate you as often as it rewards you, because when you're missing a clue and you don't know where to look, then it's hours of map-trawling to try to work out what you've overlooked. There is no handholding here; once you get used to that and start to work things out for yourself you can really start to enjoy it, but this game probably loses a lot of players early on who don't like that style of play. However, the rewards for perseverance are exceptional; intense, involving play; clever use of stealth and strategy; incredible characters and a deeply shocking storyline that keeps you guessing until the end.\n\nSo when I said at the beginning that it can't be characterised as a "game", it is because of the incredible amount of realism involved, despite the supernatural themes. It is a media form in its own right; a cross between a game, a movie and a real-life action adventure where you have to work everything out for yourself. Betrayer will not even ask you the questions, let alone tell you the answers - you will literally have to suss everything out for yourself. The beautiful thing is that you will be vey pleased with yourself when you do!\n\nOne of my favourite elements of this game was in not knowing where the true evil was; in the deeds of the settlers you learn about, or in the shadowy realm of ghosts and monsters. The irredeemable acts that people do to each other in their own selfish interests and the ways in which those deeds come back to haunt them are intriguing, horrifying and tragic all in one go.\n\nBetrayer is, essentially, a simple game that can be incredibly difficult at the same time. For example, the combat is apparently straightforward in a point-and-shoot manner, but the nature of the weapons and the environment makes tactics important. Stealth is essential in many cases and reload times for muskets, pistols and crossbows have to be taken into account. You can only carry a realistic amount of ammunition so being able to recover spent arrows from fallen enemies is a nice touch and saves your precious resources. You quickly learn the best weapons to use against each enemy, and there is a grim satisfaction to be had in being able to "stealth kill" an enemy silently from a distance using your trusty longbow (my personal favourite weapon in the game) or by sneaking up and throwing a tomahawk at them.\n\nIn fact, it is hard to pick fault with Betrayer. Any frustration at not knowing what to do is negated by the fact that it is simply part of the point of the game; you just have to keep searching until you find something that takes you forwards. If you don't like the greyscale graphics, you can adjust the settings of the game so that it is in full colour; personally, I enjoyed the atmospherics much more without any additional colours. If you don't like the eerie silence of the game, you can ruin it with your own background music or something.\n\nMy only real nitpick is that it would have been nice to have some voice acting - if the Lady in Red and other "characters" could talk directly rather than using text boxes, then it would have made the game feel even more realistic. The text boxes were, for me, a jarring interruption to an otherwise flawless experience; even the HUD has been carefully considered to be as unobtrusive as possible, and can be turned off for ultra-realistic feel.\n\nOtherwise, I thoroughly recommend this game. This is definitely one for those with patience and tenancity who are looking for a real challenge. It is not something to be played through quickly or for light relief. If you invest some real time in working through Betrayer and give it - and yourself - a chance, then you will not be disappointed.","October 14, 2014","true","22.0"," 577 of 600 people (96%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","96","577","600","19","13"

It adds a lot(!) to the atmosphere (you can however play with the contrast, and color saturation yourself to make it  colorful again, though i wouldn't recommend it).\n\nAfter you have made your first steps, you encounter quite mysterious happenings.\nEnemies appear and will try to shoot you on sight, but they don't seem particularly human.\nAfter finding and entering your first settlement, you'll find burned corpses and try to find out what happened to these poor souls and then, there is also that mysterious maiden in red, which appears out of nowhere and then there is also, what i would call, the "ghost realm" (after ringing a bell in a settlement, everything darkens and you'll end up fighting skeletons and talking to souls, which got murdered).\n\nTogether with the visuals, the great sound and the spooky atmosphere it makes a quite good game.\nThe world itself is divided into larger hubs, where you can roam and explore freely, though, there isn't that much to find (graves, some clues and diary-entries which will give you a bit of backstory and few settlements or smaller places of interest).\nYou will find (or buy) different weapons throughout the game, like bows, crossbows, pistols and muskets to fight of the enemies (which you should do stealthy in most cases, as you can't take much damage).\n\nThe middle part feels a bit stretched and sometimes, it can be a bit frustrating, not knowing exactly what to do and where to go, but if you like exploring and a rather stealthy first-person mystery game which doesn't take you by the hand, then i would definitely recommend this one!","October 5, 2014","true","19.6"," 105 of 114 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","105","114","3","0"

YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKCqIYa8fiA\n\nThis is one of the best game's on the early access program and deserve's people's time and money but if you would rather wait until the full release who can blame you and let's hope that BLACK POWDER (who listen to all comment's that have been passed on the game and have made improvement's and hopefully will continue to do so in the future until release) can get it finished and release more update's soon as i wait for this game to come out in its entirity with eager anticipation.\n\nFULL RELEASE REVIEW BELOW (MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOLIER'S)\n\nOk so i was waiting the release of the full version of this game and had got my self into quite a fever pitch for its arrival.Am i dissapointed no not in the slightest.The full release contains all the element's that intrigued me in the early access and then expand's on this to the point that it has become so much more than what it allready was.\nYou start of on the beach after the shipwreck (no spoiler's so dont worry) and then proceed from there into a story full of both intrigue and mystery,you wander of up the trail and soon you reach the next area and then the game world expand's and you will be on the way to the first safe haven (WHO AM I KIDDING THERE ARE NO SAFE PLACE'S) Fort Henry and then the game start's to show you its otherwordly side.\n\nBetrayer - Cleansing the South Gate - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8iUHH15pg\n\nLet's just say that the game take's place in both the real and the not so real,but in both you will come across some pretty scary opponent's who need to be felled (in a lot of case's) for you to open up new area's and therefore expand the game world,which therefore open's more challenge's and yet more different (and hard to beat) foe's.\nThe graphic's in game do the job they set out to do perfectly and you often wonder why the world has lost its colour and why certain item's still have their's (mostly item's will have a redish colour to them,but you can mess about and change the setting's so that your world is more colourfull-i wouldent bother though as the game is more striking in black and white and thats how it was meant to be played).\nThe sound in game is (only one word for it) amazing and does its job to perfection,foes will grunt and howl and sometime's you will wonder if its a beast after you or an otherwordly spirit,the much talked about game play element of listening to the wind to adavnce both the story and aid you in quest's has been worked on and now works perfectly (sound was coming from both my speakers and got louder the nearer i got to my objective,also you find that if you heading the wrong way you can tell by the sound coming from your speaker's also).\nQuest's in game are both entertaining and will advance the story and allway's help uncover that little bit more about what is going on in the world and also why what has happened has "HAPPENED" (and trust me the ending will be one you wont forget in a hurry and will leave you with that "COME ON WHAT'S NEXT" feeling and an urge to play the inevitable sequel).\n\nSPOILER ALERT*****DONT WATCH IF YOU HAVENT FINISHED THE GAME OR WANT TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF*****SPOILER ALERT\n\nBetrayer -

Fine.\n\nYou end up shipwrecked on a beach in Virginia in 1604, as you get up and proceed to work your way to the colonies and small settlements you realized everyone is ♥♥♥♥ing gone except for a girl with a red hood, and Spaniards. And form there you must unravel what happened to the colony and everyone in it, that's the story right there.\n\nThe game is classified as horror, and this appears as you unravel the story, the history, and even in the enemies. I'm telling you right now that when you think you've seen it all, the game pulls another punch that catches you offguard. You'll also find that the game is split between two worlds.\n\nGameplay.\n\nGameplay is fantastic, it's a mix between Dark Souls and STALKER. Everything virtually takes away 50% of your health, you drink water to restore your health and can carry two charges of water with you to use, and it gets tougher as the game goes along. If you die you drop all your loot in that area, it disappears if you die before picking it up. You can change it to easy mode though but why would you do that?\nMoving around the map is also pretty damn nice, as you can run for as long as you want, no sprint bar or anything, and fast travel is an option, making traversing a breeze. Combatwise you don't get anything, you only get a knife for melee and that's it, you can stealth kill with it and you can upgrade the damage it does. Weaponry includes musket's (pistol and rifle), bows (short and long), and a crossbow, there are unique versions of it which overhaul how you fight, and the bows are silent for stealth killing, you also get a tomahawk, which you throw, also silent, it oneshots nearly everything.\n\nAs you go through the game you will find pages which explain more of the history, and areas that are buried, these hold clues for your investigation jobs, and items. Speaking of which, your investigations play a vital role in the game, seeing as how no one cane be talked to in the light world, they happen dynamically, as you find items or otherwise. They really help toward the end game as well as open up the history more.\n\nMoving on from that, we move to various tidbits, you can buy and sell, and you don't need to be at a merchant station to sell, you can sell from your inventory, pretty convenient. You also can retrieve arrows, ammo, and tomahawks off of killed enemies, as well as various loot items. And speaking of loot items, there are chests everywhere, and some hold upgrades to items, these include and extra tomahawk, and charms.\n\nAnd charms are the next part, charms are those items you apply for various additions to what you have. These include the ability to be harder to see, faster reload, and more health. The charms and weapons all come in various qualities, from crude to exceptional, there's also unique weaponry, which upgrades on a different scale. You can carry three charms, and three weapons, and all weapons are tied to hotkeys and of course, the scroll wheel. Oh, and I forgot to mention, you do get set amounts of ammo, such as 10 arrows, but your ammo count is also upgradable, ♥♥♥♥in' A!\n\nThere are also bells in every section of the map, that lead to the Otherworld/Bell World/Purgatory. This is also a major area in where the horror manifests, as well as a whole different map to explore for loot, enemies, and the story of course! It's shrouded in fog and everything else you saw in the video on the store page. It's fun! You can also hit X for help, no waymarkers are used, despite having a compass, and hitting X will give you some creepy audio which leads you to clues and objectives, it can't be used constantly though, mashing X won't give you a stream of the audio; it "recharges" after use which takes a few seconds.\n\nThere is a toggle button which does give you a subtle waymarker on the compass to help you.\n\nStealth.\n\nStealth is one of the biggest aspects of this game, occassionally in the overworld the grass rustles, this lets you run through it for the duration without alerting anyone, and running will bring attention, as will firing any gun. You can crouch, which hides you, and get close to enemies to shank them, or hit them with a tomahawk. An important note to take is that wind does not affect arrows or bullets, so feel free not to worry if you are aiming and the wind suddenly blows.\n\nEnemies.\n\nOh boy this is fun!\n\nI'm only gonna reveal two, because I can and the enemies are really something to see.\n\nSpaniards: One thing you'll notice fast is that the Spaniards dotted around the map are not quite humanly, these are your standard enemy, and they stop at nothing to kill you, they come in numbers, and force. They will be armed with bows, muskets of both kinds, and they tend to run up and stab/punch you in your face. Remember! You can't take too many hits, so even four of them will require some kind of planning. Worry not though, as the game does not penalize you for choosing one combat type over the other, but running in guns blazing is still a risky move.\n\nSkeletons: The common everyday grunt of fantasy games returns and wants you dead! The skeletons are not push overs, every bit as strong as the Spaniards, but at least five different kinds of lethal. Unlike the Spaniards they are mostly melee oriented, but a good number of them will attack at range, and seeing as how they don't have guns or bows, they fire energy blasts at you at a rapid rate, did I mention they also have good aiming? Also unlike the Spaniards, they pop up at random around the Otherworld, some may pop up no more than a few feet from you. Spooked solid? You ♥♥♥♥in' bet.\n\nNon-enemies.\n\nWraiths, Shadows, The Red Hooded Maiden.\n\nWraiths and Shadows are there to tell a story, don't expect too much from them. They are the people to talk to do everything investigation related, don't expect them to be fully fleshed out, however their own histories are pretty interesting. Shadows however are there to tell a story like the Wraithes and give you sidequests and rewards. Both Wraithes and Shadows really really add to the horror factor, and the Wraithes especially make it seem like it's some kind of purgatory where they are. The Red Hooded Maiden is the person you'll be in constant contact with, she's the only person to talk to in the light world, not much more to say but to experience it for yourself, sorry for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting my way out!\n\nTid-bits.\n\nThe game is in an entirely black an white color scheme, punctuated with shades of red. This adds to the horror, and the red shows you something is not right with the world. You can change the color contrast, but why would you do that also? I do recommend playing through it the first time on black and white, it was the dev's artistic vision and it really makes the game. There's also no music, relying on ambient and various sounds, some superb audio if I ever heard any.\n\nThe game also throws punches in terms of difficulty, as you do progress your weapons do let you deal with the enemies more smoothly, but as you get better so do they, as new enemies appear and as they get more agressive in numbers and to ane extent, power. Did I mention arrows have a chance of deflecting off armor?\n\nThere is one problem, and that is a bug that makes you crash to the desktop. This is the only bug and it happens by accessing the menu and just rapidly moving through things. It's not the worst, but it does break the immersion when it happens; tread carefully around that. The game also saves often, so no worries if it does crash.\n\nOverall, Betrayer is an unsettling game, that gets better as you progress, it doesn't get over complicated or lost in telling the story, the combat remains challenging and grows as you go along. The total game time is at least 8-10 hours, not bad for an indie game.\n\nI give this game 4 out of 5 Axes!","March 26, 2014","true","10.1"," 152 of 180 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","152","180","0","2"

While it's definitely focused on first person combat using bows and 17th century firearms, there's a large focus on exploration and figuring out what happened. It's straight forward and linear, as horror stories tend to be, but good, nontheless. One of the major draws is the desaturated graphics, which are adjustable from fully desaturated aside from red, and full saturation. You can adjust these as you please, which is pretty cool, although I will admit it's easier to pick out items and enemies when it's played in its default state (and it actually brings a horror aspect to bright daylight areas).\n\nYou go from map to map piecing together what happened, along with collecting weapons, charms, ammo and cash. There's a sneak mechanic to the game which works well, and isn't finicky. There's a melee attack, but aside from charms there's no variation there. Bows and tomahawks are reusable but not as strong as firearms initially, so a lot of the first half of the game you'll be balancing what weapons to use, etc. The maps are of a medium size aside from the tutorial map, and there's even fast travel and "return to last location" so you can hop back to town to pick up some stuff and go right back to where you were, which is nice and leads to more engaging gameplay over endless walking.\n\nThe game is about 8 or so hours long if you do everything, probably 10-12 if you go for all the achievements. The story is interesting though it'll require a lot of reading. It's definitely a more subtle kind of horror, which I think works a little better in the long run for a game like this. I'd say at $20, this is a decent buy, but I got it for $4 which is a huge steal for this.","May 13, 2015","true","11.8"," 78 of 80 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","78","80","0","0"

You can tell this was made by a passionate group of developers who wanted to make a game different from the rest.\n\nMystery and suspense are the key areas of focus when it comes to the story. You're continuously driven to explore and uncover more about the events that unfolded in one of the first New World colonies. It's a very interesting time period/setting, and the feeling of isolation and terror are captured very well.\n\nGameplay evolves as you progress through the game. Stealth takes a bit of practice to master and becomes more necessary as the enemies become more difficult to fight. Each area has "crime scenes" that let you piece together what happened to figure out what to do next. It's deeply satisfying to find all the clues and work out where to go next. The game doesn't try to do too much too quickly, but rather presents itself gradually and expects you to keep up. Very nice stuff.\n\nI couldn't recommend Betrayer more.

Be prepared to be led on a magical journey through the wilderness surrounding early English settlement in Virginia.  You will learn to appreciate the things you take for granted and about the life altering passions of human nature.\n\n"Quit jerkin' me around, reviewer," I hear you saying.  "This is a horror game about exploring a black and white world filled with scary monsters.  There is no way Betrayer is at all like Pocahontas!"\n\nBetrayer  is  like Pocahontas; not because they share a setting but because they are both stories of outsiders coming to understand and appreciate the world around them by introduction to a foreign culture.  You, the player, are the outsider.  You are learning to appreciate the world of sound design.  The culture that will teach it to you is the setting Betrayer presents.\n\nOkay, I'm jerkin' ya around a bit.  I'm sure as a clever reader who enjoys my long-form reviews, you already appreciate what good sound design can mean for horror and stealth games.  But Betrayer has built its sound design into its every aspect to create the perfect study.\n\nThe stealth elements of Betrayer are entirely sound focused and are essential to your ability to remain hidden and to detect enemies.  Those enemies have a very small vision range.  However, if you run or use a firearm, they'll spot you in the dead of night, through a blizzard, in a concrete bunker, on another planet.  You'll need to move slowly or run in short bursts while gusts of wind cover the sound of your movement.\n\nYou won't hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon.  But you may learn which animal calls are made by an enemy that's just a silhouette hiding in pure, black shadow. Only by identifying the calls they make will you pinpoint their position and save yourself from a deadly ambush.\n\nIt's like Marco Polo for keeps.\n\nLikewise, sound contributes more to the game's tension and atmosphere than the visuals ever could.  Oh yes, the conquistador enemies you encounter early are unsettling for their hunched posture and the segmented movements of their armor.  But it's the bear roaring that makes them frightening.  The use of animal sounds for humanoid enemies lends them that elusive otherness that makes them horrifying.  It also characterizes the savagery of their nature brought to life by the cursed land.\n\nWhile stealth and combat are important parts of Betrayer, I would say the core gameplay is about exploration and investigation.  And like the others, sound is key.  Objects of interest give off directional sounds to help you locate them and you can press a button to hear a directional sound leading you to your next main objective.\n\nYour goal is to find physical evidence of the events that transpired and a bell to ring to visit a dark world haunted by ghosts.  You'll need to use your evidence and their testimonies to put together the story of the colony.  You won't paint with all the colors of the wind, no.  You will paint yourself a picture of racism, murder, ♥♥♥♥, betrayal, and all the other destructive passions of a people unleashed by a wild land they weren't prepared for.\n\nThere is a map and visual cues so that the hearing impaired might enjoy the game.  However, Betrayer has all kinds of new and exciting ways to diddle your ear-hole, so you should lean back, put on headphones, and enjoy the ride.\n\nCombat is fitting for the game's time period and tone.  You'll have access to a variety of bows, pistols, and muskets.  The latter hit - you and your enemies - for deadly amounts of damage, but make noise sure to give you away.  And you might as well go for a coffee while they reload.\n\nBows are silent, but the early bows you find only do deadly damage if you can fire them with precision while hidden.  And as everyone knows, an arrow bouncing harmlessly off your armor is the universal greeting for people who would like to be unceremoniously shot.\n\nThe game flow is similar to Bioshock:  you start poorly equipped and combat is hazardous and resource depleting.  By the end of the game, though, you'll have found powerful weapons that reload stupidly fast and have tons of health restoring items and ammo.  Fortunately, combat never stops being deadly where groups of enemies are concerned and the last segments of the game put your resources to use in large, difficult fights.\n\nLike that adventure under the sea, Betrayer's narrative is similar.  Take it from me.   (What is it with me and Disney films today?)\n\nYou play as an outsider washed ashore and left to discover the fate of a fallen society after the fact.  Unlike Bioshock (you didn't think I was talking about The Little Mermaid?), Betrayer takes place in the very real setting of Virginia in the early seventeenth century.\n\nCan you imagine being dropped into a proper wilderness with nothing to help you survive? Try to imagine it without all the cabin building karate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of recent survival games.  What I'm getting at here is that Blackpowder Games chose a naturally scary setting.  Life as an early American colonist couldn't have been anything other than ♥♥♥♥-terrifying.\n\nThey nailed that fear of being isolated in a very alive land you don't know anything about and threw in some monsters for good measure.  You'll find this Virginia's abandoned forts swarming with wraiths, Indians made of ash, and growly shambling conquistadors.\n\nThe only living thing not trying to kill you seems to be a lady with a pragmatic attitude who nevertheless wears her best sexy Little Red Riding Hood Halloween costume.  Like the ghosts, her past is a mystery to be solved and tied into the omnipresent curse.\n\nWait, what?  I haven't talked visuals, yet?  Sing with all the voices of the mountain, indeed.  The sound design here is that good.  But Betrayer also looks good.  Everything is in a stylish black and white with touches of bright red that direct your focus.  The wind effects through the dense foliage of your surroundings look great and the enemy animations strike a nice balance between natural and surreal.\n\nThe game also gives you the option to play the game in full color in the light world.  And the game looks just as good that way.  The only notable weakness is that the contrast is turned up to eye-gouging degrees.  I think the purpose was to try and give the light world a sense of hyper-real vibrancy, which it kind of does. But its biggest success was giving me a headache and making some things really hard to see.  That might be by design, but it's too much in my opinion.  I turned the contrast down halfway through and felt no shame whatsoever.  Fortunately, the option is there.\n\nThere are some other minor criticisms to be made.\n\nThe in game map is at-odds with using sound to navigate.  If you only use the map, you'll get confused about  events that only trigger in a sequence that the sound navigation would unveil.  The sound navigation will disappoint your Nazi robot-like need to follow the most efficient course through all the treasures and objects of interest.  And you will have that need because the pattern for each area - explore light world, ring bell, find ghosts - becomes routine.  So neither method is ideal.\n\nAnd if you want a pure stealth game, this isn't it.  Stealth is a tool that you can and should use, but even early enemies are designed so that they  will  ambush you.  There are several big fights that are unavoidable.  In the dark world enemies pop out of the ground right in front of you.  And, worst of all for stealth-lovers, there's no way to run away and hide.  Once enemies have found you, they will follow you to the ends of the map (barring the perfect storm of big cover objects, wind gusts, and timing).  It's not terrible that Betrayer isn't a stealth game, but I'd sure love to see a proper stealth game use some of the ideas here.\n\nWorth ten bucks?  Well, I know good sound design and horror has a life, has a spirit, has a name.  It's Betrayer.","July 23, 2015","true","25.4"," 131 of 159 people (82%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","82","131","159","41","8"

A linear path leads you inland, acting as a tutorial along the way, but it's once you reach the abandoned Fort Henry that you really begin to grasp what awaits you.Or rather, you don't. Betrayer is the sort of game that delights in keeping you on the edge, never entirely sure what's happened to rid the land of human life or what you're supposed to do about it. It's a game with no missions, no quest markers, no breadcrumb trails. Blackpowder Games, largely made up of former Monolith developers, has dipped into some obvious influences for this stark and striking horror adventure. The Elder Scrolls is one, with an open map through which you navigate by icons on the compass. You'll also sense strong echoes of Far Cry 3. Corrupted, animalistic Conquistadors patrol the wilderness, and since your only defences are crude bows, old-fashioned muskets and a throwing tomahawk, you'll spend a lot of time skulking through long grass, masking your movements in time with gusts of wind and thinning their numbers as stealthily as possible.Should you fall in battle - and you will, since these Conquistadors hit hard and are relentless once they have your scent - you'll respawn back at the fort, leaving all the valuables you found at the site of your death. If you die again before reclaiming them, whatever you found or earned is gone forever.But Betrayer is also an adventure game, of sorts, and one that is driven by mystery and puzzles. Not the crude block-sliding, lever-pulling puzzles that games so often fall back on, but deeper, more abstract problems. In terms of tone and mood it reminds me, more than anything, of the hallucinatory and terrifying climax of 2009 metaphysical viking movie, Valhalla Rising. It's a game that presents exploration as cloying terror and colonisation as a creeping cancer. It's scary, not in the cheap sense, but at a more primal level. You're compelled to explore this land - area by area - but it never feels comfortable or empowering.While Betrayer succeeds in atmosphere, it fares less well in pure gameplay terms. The lack of direction is thrilling, but becomes problematic when the game only marks specific locations on the map.Combat is, sadly, where the game is weakest. The enemies are fairly crude creations, wandering back and forth in fixed, meaningless patterns, and their AI doesn't stretch much further than simply charging at you once roused.Once you've got their attention, they'll follow you across the whole map, displaying only the most rudimentary of tactics - at a distance, they'll use ranged attacks, and up close they'll batter you senseless. Betrayer is rougher around the edges than its stylish exterior may suggest, but it's never less than fascinating.The whole game is a question, intriguingly posed and offering no easy answers.","November 5, 2014","true","47.6"," 98 of 115 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","98","115","0","0"

Crouched down in the tall grass, I listened for the cry of the water bird to come again for what seemed like whole minutes. I heard it suddenly, only a few yards behind me. I turned around slowly, but couldn’t see it against the pitch black shadow of the trees above. Holding my breath, my heart slamming against my ribcage, I took a step forward. Too late I realized I should have waited for the cover of the wind to muffle my footsteps. Four angered loon calls startled me from all directions as arrows flew towards me…\n\nThe above passage is an account of what could have happened in Betrayer. The initial starting scene of waking up on a beach next to a shipwreck seems a little bland at first, but the game soon after departs from stereotype.\n\n- Visuals -\nBetrayer starts in greyscale, making the woods and trees around you dark and mysterious. The color red is still visible, though. Enemies dressed in red are immediately visible even from a hundred yards away. Red markers over health, shops, and ammo drops help discern them from the grey background. Some enemies do not have red, making them near impossible to see against shadow and therefore much deadlier.\n\n- Sound -\nFirst and foremost this game forces you to listen. Some enemies cannot be seen easily and can only be detected through  their special call. The most unique feature of this game by far is the fact that the human enemies use animal calls: bears, loons, etc. This serves to makes the player feel isolated – the only sounds one ever hears are the noises of the wild. Audial clues to the next objective in each area force players to use their ears over their eyes. Headphones are a must.\n\n- Story - (no spoilers)\nThe player wakes up on a beach in 1604, Colonial America. As you travel, you discover deserted settlements, find weapons, and defend yourself from hostiles. You meet one person from the abandoned colony, a mysterious maiden in red who cannot remember her name. As you set out to discover her identity, you notice a bell has been removed from its post. You replace it and ring it out of curiosity. Strangely, you are transported into a shadow world with its own set of enemies and the spirits of deceased colonists. By collecting clues from the area around you and interviewing the spirits, you are able to piece together what happened to the settlements and discover who the maiden really is.\n\n- My Thoughts -\nI was immediately hooked when I started this game. I love atmospheric games that throw you into the world with set objectives but no set order to complete them in.\nIf you are an impatient sort, this might not be the best game for you. Especially at first when you have low quality weapons and low health, stealth and patience are essential to survival. There is nothing more satisfying, though, than stalking one enemy for ten minutes or so and successfully getting a stealth kill on them (not a typical case).\nThere are a few difficulty settings that you can change. I personally enjoyed the easiest difficulty level, but if you like punishment go ahead and try hard. There’s also a map system that shows you where just about everything is. If you enjoy a challenge, try turning the map waypoints off and using the audial clues to find stuff.\n\n- Cons -\n- Enemies’ pathfinding led to some interesting fights with lots of sudden 90° turns\n- Some enemies are actually impossible to see against a shaded background. Try flanking them to get a better vantage point.\n- Very little explanation of bullet/arrow drop leads to a high learning curve for trying to snipe far-off enemies\n- UI graphics aren’t too impressive\n- Last area is loaded with bugs – the devs really should release a patch or something\n- Each area feels quite repetitive in terms of tasks – devs should have provided a little more variety of quests\n\n- Wrap-up -\nFor all you TL;DR readers out there, I think this game was probably one of my all-time indie favorites. There are a lot of genre tags for this game because it takes influences from all of them. Bugs and annoyances are there but don’t really impact game satisfaction. I’d highly recommend this game to anyone who can wait five minutes for anything; you’ll be glad you did!\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\nRecommended\n- Highly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential","January 7","true","17.8"," 55 of 56 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","55","56","4","0"

Its atmosphere is amazing, with it's beautifully crafted black and white world. But it's an empty world, one that needed way, way more content than this, because the gameplay becomes quite repetitive after a few hours, even if the story is mysterious and intriguing.\n\nYou end up washed ashore and you have no idea how you got there or where you even are. Moving forward will act as a small tutorial and once you enter the next area the real game begins. Soon you'll find a deserted village, a village where you find a Maiden In Red (which the story is all about) and a bell. A bell that belongs to the village. Restore the bell and you can ring it, and it will instantly transfer you to an even darker world (please note that that's not quite true; the area remains the same, but the enemies and NPCs become different) where ghosts can be found. These ghosts tell a story and it's up to you to find more clues and solve the many mysteries this world has. You can switch between the light and dark world on the fly with the ring of the village bell and both of these worlds contain clues, found as letters or other objects. With the press of a button you will hear voices and sounds that will guide you in the right direction. Follow the sounds to find your next clue(s). An original concept that works very well, especially because it's an open world. I really liked it.\n\nOf course, there are also enemies to be found and these are actually quite tough at times. But defeat them and they'll drop loot. Loot that you might desperately need later on, because the enemies become harder to defeat. Other ways to gather loot is by buying it from a digital salesman in the village or by find treasure chests scattered across the lands. However, if you get slain by an enemy you'll drop all of your loot and you have one try to get it all back. Die before getting it and you'll lose everything, with no chance of ever recovering it (Dark Souls anyone ?).\n\nEnemies can be killed with stealth. Just use your bow to silently take care of them. Or you can kill them with help of the wind. It will mask your sound. Another original concept that works very well. Unfortunately, the AI disappoints from time to time so it's not always the way to kill off enemies. Enemies might never hear you even if you're only a few metres away from them, and other times they come running to you from miles away. It's all over the place and I was disappointed to see a polished game like this have such crappy AI.\n\nThere are several areas in the game and exploration is key for solving the stories. But like I said, it becomes repetitive after a few hours because all you do is look for clues, ghosts and treasure chests and kill enemies. There's not much else to do in this game. Now, I do have to say that it kept my interest all the way through (which lasts about 10 hours), mainly because there's no handholding. The lore and stories are yours to interpret. And this is exactly what also made Dark Souls so fun to play. You get small hints of what's happening or happened and it's up to you to think of what might have actually happened. Good stuff !\n\nBetrayer is an excellent game and I'd love to see a sequel. But please, fix the AI and make the world itself a bit more interesting to explore. Recommended !\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","March 29, 2014","true","13.3"," 91 of 110 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","91","110","0","3"

Everything you encounter is shrouded in mystery, be it your marooned situation, the person that shoots an arrow in your path to pass along a message, or the "darkness" you enter upon ringing the settlements' bells. At first I found it to be a rather unforgiving game. There's not a whole lot of handholding that happens with this: Here is your bow. Be careful with your ammo. Try not to die to ravening conquistadors on your way in. Pick up some clues and try to piece together what the hell happened if you make it that far.\n\nVisually, I really enjoyed the black and white color scheme with the splashes of red to indicate things of importance (like piles of dirt, pools of blood, and things that want to kill you). But if black and white isn't your thing, and you don't enjoy that creepy Blair Witch vibe, you can adjust the color to the saturation you're comfortable with.\n\nThere is no voice acting, which I find only contributes to the atmosphere of the game, lending itself to a rather solitary and unnerving experience. There is no musical score to speak of, but rather the things you would normally hear in my neck of the woods (the birds, the breeze, and your own footsteps). A lot of this game works on audio cues. You can hear the enemies if you care to listen for them. Stealth is the name of the game (not literally... but achievements! And... health!). So I highly reccommend it.\n\nOverall I enjoyed learning the story of these colonists. Some things, like the explosives you pick up, I have never found a use for, other than getting myself mercilessly slaughtered by every conquistador in the surrounding area. The ending, if not completely satisfying, is nevertheless what I would expect from this sort of eerie game.

You will solve mysteries about murdered colonies by finding clues and talking to lost souls in some other dimension, while fighting conquistadors and otherworldly creatures with 17th century weaponry as you do so.\n\nVisually it's also a very pleasing game and it gives you the option to customize how bright and saturated the colours are. So you could play in a completely gray scale world, or make it overly saturated so it looks unrealistic but beautiful, or just go for something realistic in between those.\n\nBut how beautiful the scenery in this world might be, its stunning aesthetics are literally all it has. There is only some minor exploration involved in this world, which makes the gameplay feel really bland. It felt like the world of Skyrim, but after having taken out all of the dungeons, sidequests and other interesting things and just replaced them with a few empty colony bases and some things for you to find, which you pretty much are obligated to do to progress in the game. You basically end up doing fetch quests and constantly running around to talk to this lost soul or go find this clue, which becomes a massive drag and will make most people lose interest in the game around halfway in.\n\nI understand the plot reasons for the bases to be empty, and you would imagine everyone being dead to make you feel lonely, but it didn't because there were still plenty of enemies to break that solitary feeling. And if you would actually do different things in all of these bases it would be a lot easier to tolerate, but unfortunately it's just doing the same thing time and time again.\n\nThis is all such a shame because everything about it looked so unique and promising, but it really ended up lacking variety in the gameplay and quests to an extreme extent.","August 23, 2014","false","8.9"," 111 of 141 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","111","141","6","6"

Likely the vessel that brought you here. A land devoid of color stay for an unpretentious amount of red.\n\nThis game is not just visually strking, its stunning. You are given the option to play in shades of grey or blast the color saturation up to see lush forests and gated strongholds.\n\nThe actual gameplay mechanics more or less revolve around two things. Exploration and killing things. Through your exploration you are likely to discover chests with goodies, pages with exposition that give insight into the goings on, gravestones among other things. Bascially, it's a completionists absolute dream or worst nightmare. The main draw though is to gain insight into the investigations. About the ghosts.. I didn't mention the ghosts?!\n\nThere are two worlds/dimensions to explore, though the same clues and collectables can be found in either. The dark world, the world in perpetual night where hostile undead things will spring forth from underground to ward you off the investigation. Where items must be "cleasned of corruption" before preceeding. And the light or daytime world. Hostile baddies still are here but their purpose seems less warding and more left over neural pathways of repeated and ingrained behavior from their time in life. Very real since of LIMBO here.\n\nCharacter progression is not necessarily "gated" but there is a very real MetroidVania -esk feel to upgrading your characters weapons from damage, speed of reloading, noise levels, amount of ammo held, amount of water (health packs) and charms that aid in movement speed, reload speed, and enemy detection.\n\nThe sound design is absolutely phenominal. Listening to the wind to find your direction. The wind insisting its innocent. Audio cues to detect the natives who are virtually undetectable otherwise. I should mention the wind I speak about is more a button to listen to the wind as the actual wind is used as a stealth mechanic to hinder your noise and detection level. The beasties make crazy scary noises, very distinct ones. To the point of knowing what enemy is behind the bush. The screams are unnerving, you don't really get used to to ambiance, comfortable perhaps, its always slightly disqueiting. Even at the end when I was fully confident in my ability to survive I was still nervous to face enemies to some degree. My only caveat remains that enemies don't react to your shots until their health is completely depleted and become victims to the physics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bandoid/recommended/243120/","bandoid","Bandoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bandoid/","383 products in account","I'm very pleased with this game.  I bought it on sale for $4 and was a little skeptical about it specifically because it looked like the kind of game I would probably enjoy a lot (I was afraid I would be pumping it up just to be let down).  I'm very glad I was wrong and I can easily say that this game is worth full price.\n\nA few bits of personal preference to start off with; I personally prefer to have the color saturation turned up in the game.  There's two modes that you play in, one is in the light and the other is in the dark.  The dark provides plenty of the gray color palette to satisfy any inclination for having it feel gloomy.  The game itself does a good job of setting that mood even without having the colors being washed out.  I also made the darks less dark and the lights less light, just so I could feel comfortable being able to see everything there was to see.  The second personal preference is to NOT turn up the difficulty in the game.  The default difficulty is satisfying enough for me.  For players who might get frustrated enough to put the game down, I would suggest setting the difficulty to 'less deadly' right from the start.  The weapons are 17th century weapons and as such are slow and feel a bit cumbersome (although not at all as inaccurate as I was expecting).  You're going up against supernatural beings who are every bit as deadly as you are and if you die, they all respawn (in new spots -except inside strongholds) and you'll just have to find them and kill them again.  Avoiding them is very difficult and once they spot you, they'll chase you all the way back to camp if you're not able to take them down.\n\nThe visual style of the game is excellent.  The sense of walking around in the woods is truly convincing and immersive. When the wind picks up to make all the vegetation move, it's nothing less than breathtaking.  I go hiking on a regular basis and this game comes as close as any game has ever come to replicating that experience.\n\nNavigating through the game and the story can seem a little confusing at first but it's actually very simple.  You basically use two things to tell you what to do.  Early in the game, you'll get a map and you'll get special senses.  Basically, all you have to do is turn on all of your map markers and go to the site of each one.  In addition to that, just keep using your special hearing skill (x-key by default) and follow the sounds to lead you where to go.  That's it.\n\nThe game is pretty scary to me in a fun ghost story kind of way and it would make a great game to buy and play around Halloween, although there's certainly no need to wait for the next Halloween to come around.  If you have a system that lets you set all the eye candy to maximum, it's worthwhile to do so but the game is well designed, with a sense of peril and accomplishment that really satisfies.  I haven't finished the story yet so I'll update the review once I make my way through the whole game.\n\nEdit:\n\nOk [I think] I've finished the game although it seems a little strange that it doesn't have any credits available, but I guess that's because it was a small team.  Anyway, here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Great overall story which is worth sticking around to see where it leads.\n-Great presentation.  Sort a combination of light versions of Skyrim, Far Cry 3, and Blair Witch Project.\n-Just about the right length considering how repetitive it starts to feel at the end.\n\nCons:\n-Lots of structures but not a single one is open to you to take a look inside.  It's all bunch of external shells and doors that won't open -basically just scenery.  Considering it's a period piece, it would have been nice to get a closer glimpse into what the daily lives of these people might have been like.  Maybe the sequel (?) will include this.\n-No voice acting.  I know this is unfair considering that it's an independent game with a low budget and also that it's available in multiple languages.  Nevertheless, maybe this game will be so successful that they'll be able to have a few more bells and whistles next time around.  Having said that, I'd very much prefer to have it be all text than to have any bad acting so there's that.\n-Repetitive quests.  Why is it that on every map I have to find someone's head, tell ghosts to find their way by listening to the bell, and find apparently meaningless gifts for the chick in red?  These things feel like and basically are meaningless distractions from the story that don't take up much time but nevertheless do so unnecessarily.\n\nOverall, I'd say it gets an 8/10 score.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoL0sS/recommended/243120/","CoL0sS","Baby Spice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoL0sS/","460 products in account","Betrayer is a bag of mixed emotions. Appealingly presented in beautful monochrome and undeniably atmospheric, it's a falling star that will mesmerize you for a moment before its light disippates into night sky.\nWhat do i mean by this ? Well, give me a moment to explain.\n\nYear is 1604 and you just woke up on the beach of the New World among the debris of a marooned ship carrying nothing but your knife. World around you is presented in stylish monochrome with pleasant sounds of splashing waves and schreeching seagulls. It could almost be idyllic if it weren't for the fact that you barely escaped watery grave. With only the vaguest idea of where you are and what to do next, you scrounge up what you can from boxes that are strewn around the shore and head up inland. It doesn' take too long until you stumble on a first sign of life in a form of a warning arrow, shot by a person clad in red. A friendly advice on a piece of paper will introduce you with a opportunistic merchant who provides you with your first weapon and hope of future, mutually beneficial relationship. Wepon in hand, but caution in mind, you'll proceed to face whatever dangers stalk the tall grass of this newly colonized country.\nIncidentaly, stalking is the best approach to combat. Your crude longbow won't do you much good in a straight on fight and breasplate worn by your enemies will deflect most arrows. Stealthy approach is very much encouraged - hiding in tall grass and utilizing shadows and gusts of wind to mask your footsteps before you can close in for one deadly strike. However, if you cross their direct line of sight they will spot you and charge to your location which creates a lot of intense encounters, at least in the beginning until you size them up and get better equipment. Like in Dark Souls, you lose all your loot when you die; (an option which can be turned off in gameplay menu), so you want to choose your fights carefully. There is a modest variety of weapons, appropriate for that era. Powerful, but slow-loading muskets and flintlock pistols for your short range, fire-and-forget needs with weaker short/longbows and crossbows doing a nice job at long range sniping. There are also quick-throw explosives and tomahawks when enemies get too close.\nExploration will reveal small bits and pieces of information - page scraps provide lore and insight into past events, puzzling clues an evidence into violent misdeeds, graves engraved with names and causes of death - these are constant reminders that something  has gone terribly wrong. Immersion is an overused buzzword, but it's really appropriate here. All this culminates when you reach your first settlement; a small fort mysteriously deserted, showing signs of struggle. Here you'll be introduced to another gameplay mechanic, where you need to collect a bell, hang it from a beam and ring it, whereupon you'll be transported to a darker version of normal world. Dark world is populated by skeletons and floating shades; your vision is limited, and you have to orientate yourself by "listening" and/or following small appearing pointers on the screen. These will lead you to lost souls, remaining echoes of colonists who will explain the significance of certain clues and slowly unravel their mysterious fate and events that led to their untimely, violent deaths.\n\nIn these first few hours it looks like Betrayer will settle into a nice rythm, providing a good balance between atmospheric, nearly horror experience, exploration and combat, but it never quite comes to that. New areas you discover feel and look pretty much the same - they're mostly empty and while collectibles offer a decent incentive to explore, it will inevitably become tedious. Enemies that seemed dangerous and sinister before will show all limitations of their AI when you realize there's nothing more to their tactics than relentlessly charging to your location. Most of the combat challenge will come from limited 17- century weapons, and finding more powerful ones is crucial to your survival. These are mostly found on dead enemies or in chests, but really powerful unique, weapons are buried beneath piles of rock that can only be accessed once you find a spade much later in the game. Unfortunately they use exactly the same models as regular ones so it lacks that feeling of finding something really special. Backtracking isn't a problem since there's a fast travel system, but your character is shown as area circle on the map, instead of the usual arrow, which creates  confusion when you're trying to find your way, so I'd recommend turning on compass. Ghostly investigations you have to do will reveal very interesting albeit mostly tragic stories, but ultimately amount to nothing more than running from one location to the next, picking up mementos and presenting them to appropriate shade. It's gets very formulaic and repetitive very soon - get to the new area, retake the settlment from enemies, find the bell, go to the dark world, play the courier for ghosts, rinse and repeat.  It approaches greatness but never reaches it and that's what's most frustrating of all.\n\n\nTenative recommendation. If you approach it from purely gameplay standpoint, you will ultimately be disappointed, but if you take in all the atmosphere and look past its objective flaws, you'll find an enthralling experience. Not really a scary one, but one with uncomfortable sense of unfamiliarty and uknown.","November 10, 2014","true","10.4"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","49","60","2","0"

Personally, I liked this game quite a bit. I'm fond of the design and setting and the gameplay wasn't bad, but there is plenty of room for improvement.\nThe first thing a player will notice is the color scheme, black and white with red filters to create a unique visual setting which perfectly complements the lonely and abandoned theme of the game. It creates an unsettling environment and is capable of leaving a memorable impact on a player. But I found that while it does look neat, the style lacks substance and eventually becomes a chore to look at for prolonged periods. Thankfully you have the option to adjust color and saturation on the main menu, so therefore only half of the game gets tiresome to look at.\n\nBetrayer's gameplay can be considered as a FPS with stealth and horror implements. The player has an open world dotted with enemies to be looking out for, and three weapon slots to fill with your choice of weapons. While the gameplay wasn't atrociously bad, there are some loose screws that break a chunk of the experience off. The game takes place in the 1700's in the new world (AKA modern day America if you don't know history) and takes advantage of the technology of the time period: Bows and powder loaded single shot firearms comprise your selectable armory. One of the problems I have with Betrayer is the weapons itself, being a first person shooter weapons are a very important part of the gameplay, and the weapons available are of short variety and are slow and meticulous to use. To fill your three weapon slots is a selection of 5 weapons, 3 kinds of bows and 2 firearms. The bows are unreliable in combat because a heavy chunk of enemy distribution are covered in a kind of armor that has a chance to harmlessly deflect your arrows, and the guns, realistically but kind of frustratingly, take a long time to reload. This makes the combat either frustrating or uninteresting depending on the player's approach.\n\nStealth mechanics are also implemented, enemies start off unaware of you but can detect you if they see or hear you coming. To counteract this, you can stay crouched and in shaded, obsure areas and move when the wind blows to block out the sounds of your footsteps. Stealth is even encouraged in the prologue level as it explains that enemies become enraged when in combat making them stronger, and that attacks while undetected deal more damage. A problem with this is that the stealth mechanics aren't as polished as they should be in order to suggest such an approach for the whole game. Enemies will always know exactly where you are if you mess up, and you cannot escape and try again, making a stealthy capture of a fort or outpost a "do it right the first time or not at all" deal. Also, I find that using arrows is more difficult with the black and white color scheme since its harder to determine where your arrows are flying, so it takes longer to determine the arc and most often giving yourself away.\n\nFor the horror aspect of Betrayer's design: I think it's subjective. I didn't find anything scary but that doesn't mean others will too. I liked some of the enemy designs, the maddened beasts wearing spanish inquisitor armor and the burned men (who are IMPOSSIBLE to see with black and white settings) are some of the most unique and creative designs I've ever seen. But at the same time the enemies are also so uncreative and boring. Other types of enemies include giant spiders and skeletons, might as well go all the way and throw in Frankenstein's monster and dracula to get the real Disney's Haunted Mansion effect. I was really disappointed at this turn, since the other types of enemies are creative and fit perfectly with the game's setting only to erase them out entirely halfway through the game and rely on cliche monsters you'd find in a kids halloween drawing. On a side note here, one of the most memorable and fun parts of the game is where you come across a large fort that you'd expect to be infested with enemies, only to find it empty. You feel slight relief at the unexpected respite when you hear battle horns in the distance and then find yourself under seige from the spanish inquisitors. This part was so unexpected and fun, I really wished that more of Betrayer had moments like this. Nobody suspects the Spanish Inquisition!\n\nNow to the final point: Betrayer is a semi-open world game with a sort of mystery setting for the story, setting out a bunch of clues in the map and letting the player explore to find them, no handholding. This leaves the entire experience of Betrayer to the player's whim, do you scour the map finding each and every bit or do you rush through to the end? While this is a good idea, the game's design is flawed and incapable of supporting it. Resulting in a lot of backtracking, boredom and searching. Being "alone and abandoned with no handholding" requires that the game fully captivates its player, getting them excited and invested in the experience making them want to discover everything and providing positive reinforcement with a sense of accomplishment. Betrayer has none of these, you find a clue, make a note of it and maybe a ghost will say something about it.  This results in the exploration of Betrayer being uneventful and disappointing. Not to mention that in order to uncover a large majority of items hidden you need a shovel, which can be found roughly half way through the game, resulting in a LOT of backtracking.\n\nWhile Betrayer missed the mark, the ideas are there. It could have been so much better, creating a unique open world mystery game in the 1700's with supernatural twists and heart pounding stealth combat. Instead Betrayer is flat, repetitive and lacking in a lot of substance. Despite my enjoyment with the basic idea of the game and all of it's potential, I can't help but feel disappointed with the direction the game took instead. The appeal is there but doesn't build up to anything worthwhile.","February 18, 2015","false","9.1"," 104 of 151 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","104","151","4","7"

I heard good praises about it without querying for details. After completing the game, those praises are definitely warranted. The initial setting of being washed ashore with no knowledge of who or where you are shrouds the player in a mist of mystery. The black & white graphics provide a unique atmosphere. I actually didn't realize you could play the game in color until I was almost finished with the game, but after trying both settings the black & white graphics really adds a sense of creepiness that you don't get with color.\n\nStumbling upon the first fort location, armored figures can be seen pacing back and forth, standing guard. At first it's really unclear how to approach the situation. Are they friendly? While trying to be sneaky, I was quickly spotted by one who alerted the whole platoon and 12 enemies quickly descended upon me. Goose bumps filled my skin from head to toe as I just turned and ran, my heart pounding as I occasionally looked back only to catch a glimpse of the blood red eyes of my pursuers.\n\nIt soon became clear that I could not escape and one-by-one I drew my makeshift bow, adrenaline swelling, and aimed squarely for their heads. One down...then another. Soon, after what felt like an eternity of running and shooting, they all fell before my feet, their red outlines lingering. My heart was able to catch a much needed rest.\n\nAnd this was only daybreak. More sinister lurkings are waiting in the night...\n\nBetrayer is really a spectacular game, for the first 3 or 4 areas. Then it starts to feel repetitious because all the adrenaline expended killing your first squad starts to become routine after about the 4th instance. So while there is plenty of gameplay, its appeal is lost somewhat quickly. And while there is a grander story coupled with all the action, it gets lost in all the noise (until the end of course).\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic game, although it could have been a lot better had there been more to explore.","October 1, 2014","true","14.5"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

The gameplay feels very similar to Elder Scrolls, with the ability to fast travel from one location to another via the game map. Unlike other First Person games out there, Betrayer uses a monochrome art style, which is a little disorienting at first. It looks cool, and definitely stands out from other games of the same genre, but I think this particular game could have looked amazing with colored graphics, just my opinion. The tutorial area consists of a beach where you are trying to find out what is going on. You learn how to sprint, melee etc. In this game you also collect clues, loot treasure chests, bust open crates for loot, and of course fight conquistadors. One ofthe first weapons you can get is the bow, so using stealth you learn to take out enemies from a distance. When you die you can try to retrieve your belongings but if you don't get to them in time, you will lose them.\n\nI am curious to see where the story takes me as it seems interesting, a deserted colony, Conquistadores and Natives who seem to have gone insane and a mysterous stranger who has amnesia and can't see the enemies you see. Worth a playthrough, for the story, as well as to check out a game that actually uses monochrome in 2015.","October 18, 2015","true","21.2"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","44","59","6","3"

You try to reason with him but then you hear a horrible unearthly sound and the Spaniard rushes you.  It is no longer human...\n\nThis game is fps mixed with horror.

I think it was of the more interesting and fun games I've played in a while. It's also one of the few early access titles I've bought where you can see a clear line of game improvement progression as far as the development goes. From the early alpha to now, the improvements were consistent and did take into consideration the playing experiences of the early adopters..\nThe ending had a definite WTF moment, and somebody else I was reading said they nearly crapped their pants, lol. That moment was abrupt and shocking enough for that to be apt, lol.\nAnyway, I thought it was a stellar game well worthy of anybody's attention.\n\n(Previous Updates with some SPOILERS)\n\nBeen playing more of the Betrayer today. I finally got the hang of combat enough to be able to make some real progress. I also noted that the developers listened to the complaints about the enemies unceasing search for you (and by search, I mean making a beeline for you no matter how well hidden you are or how far you have run) once they aggro. Now, if you can get out of their line of sight and stay far enough away, the enemies will start heading back to wherever they were patrolling the first time. That makes the pistols and muskets viable choices, since before, given the amount of noise they make, enemies from anywhere within earshot would head right to you no matter how far away you had moved once firing. Now, they don't, which is awesome.\nAnyway, now I'm at a very challenging (for me anyway) point where I've found and unlocked everything in the normal world on the first map, but have to cleanse some totems in the spirit world in order to move on to the next map, and the spirits guarding them are super tough, fire energy balls at you, and generally are as fast as you are.\n\n(next)\n\nAlright, progress update:\nDefinitely moving at a faster pace now. I'm on the Fort Hope map and\n\nSPOILERS\n\nfinally found the shovel. Turns out those rock piles hold some of the best equipment, which is unsurprising considering how long it takes to get the shovel.\nRunning away is also a viable tactic, especially once you figure out the maps a bit. There is almost always a spot where you will have the advantage over multiple enemies. Leading them there is key to taking a lot of the defended areas like forts and such....at least from my own play experience.\n\nSPOILER END\n\n(next)\n\nI use a gamepad, which I like, but the game clearly is made for k/m, and I think your odds of success increase if you play k/m. Definitely your weapon accuracy increases.\nI also re-keyed the gamepad, which helped my experience a lot. Setting up heal, jump, and such to keys that made more sense for me elevated my experience.\n\nAnyway, I may actually finish this game over the next couple days. I really don't see how people are getting through their first playthrough in 8-10 hours. I'm legitimately approaching 16 hours of post full release gameplay, and I can see putting another 8-10 in, and that's without trying to find every chest, note, etc..\n\n(Original Review)\n\nI purchased Early Access to this game via Steam. It has since seen its full release (a lot of you bought this while it was on sale yesterday, so I guess you all are aware of its full release, lol).\n\nAnyway, I have put about 4 hours (maybe a bit less) into the game so far and my impressions are as follow:\n\nIt is a disturbingly beautiful game. The sharp contrast between the black and whites in the black and white world are compelling. The way they did this was pretty amazing IMO. The world truly looks living and breathing, and yet at the same time, there is a forlorn sense of desolation that comes with it. Really an amazing setting. The use of red to highlight things of importance such as items, enemies, and even allies just adds to the stark contrast between beauty and horror. You can also enter a spirit world version of the same world (basically, your perception of the world around you is changed) wherein enemies are highlighted in blue instead, and everything seems quite surreal. The developers use of sound really brings all this to the forefront. Every sound and sight has a reason and noting seems out of place.\n\nThe interface has notably improved from the early versions of the game. The item/quest menu is pretty simplistic and easy to navigate. The map has also improved from its early state. Key areas show on the map as you find them and become fast travel spots. You can also see pretty much exactly where you are on the map. Other than that though, you really have to rely on the in game compass to navigate. In fact, this game doesn't really hold your hand at all. I think in many ways, they got their inspiration from Morrowind, especially in the way quests are presented. For example, you may meet the a guy who is looking for signs of his wife. Last he remembers, they would sit together on a hill overlooking the fort. That is all the info you are going to get. Now, it's on you to try and figure out where that location is. However, there aren't a lot of hills overlooking the fort, so it isn't a needle in the haystack type scenario, and when you get closer to the spot, it is highlighted in that eerie red and certain sound become more evident in the surrounding area.\n\nThe use of stealth is very important in this game. In fact, I knock a little off my overall view of this game due to an issue tied with this, because....once you attack something, it aggros and knows exactly where you are regardless of how fast you run, how long you run, or how well you hide. In addition, if it (or you) use a weapon that makes a lot of noise, and other creatures within earshot also aggro. That is a real flaw in the game in my estimation. So, stealth becomes ever more important to try and either get the best position to take down an enemy quickly, or to just completely bypass them altogether, undetected. The use of movement during wind gusts to mask your sound is particularly brilliant in its application and wind gusts happen often, so being stealthy is completely do-able.\n\nThe combat itself is fairly forthright. You have missile and melee options. Your missile options include one launched/fired weapon (bow and arrow, musket, so on) and a thrown weapon as well. Your bows/guns can be scrolled through on the gamepad and you can have up to three assigned to slots for this. The enemies can take some punishment,so again, the element of surprise is crucial as is upgrading to better weapons whenever you have the option. Healing is accomplished by drinking water and you carry a waterskin with you.\n\nThe story itself is pretty intriguing so far, and is both surreal and haunting. It and the environment suit each other quite well.\nThe gamepad interface, which was a complete wreck in early stages has also become a pleasant alternative to k/m. Some real thought went into how to key the various actions to a gamepad, and I personally prefer it to k/m for this game at this point.\n\nSo....those are my impressions so far. I think it is easily worth people trying out due to its unique qualities and amazing backdrop. Just know that the combat can be quite unforgiving for the reasons I outlined above.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/243120/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Betrayer is an action-adventure game set in 17th century America. Once ashore you reach your very first settlement but find it completely abandoned apart from some human-sized ash figures. The only friend you have is a girl wearing a red cloak. She is looking for her sister and asks for your aid.\n\nWhile wandering in the forest you encounter conquistadors who attack you immediately. Stealth is very important - especially at the beginning of the game - as you can quietly dispose of your enemies without having to fire your weapon. Initially, you have a bow but soon you'll be able to obtain a crossbow and also a pistol and a musket. These - as the game takes place centuries ago - require quite some time to be reloaded.\n\nI like the atmosphere of the game. I am not sure why the creators went with the monochrome (black and white) art style but it certainly suits the game's atmosphere. In fact, only some key elements show up in red colour such as the things you can interact with and the enemies. Wind blows heavily from time to time which completely conceals the sound of your footsteps. Both the art style and the sound effects deserve a high five!\n\nWhile the map shows small settlements and roads you can go elsewhere in the forest to find many secrets as it does not reveal everything. There are hidden chests, graves, clues and even unique weapons scattered throughout the land. Later in the game you obtain a shovel with which you can dig at certain places.\n\nOh, the clues! Every map has a central settlement where you can install a bell. Once rung the game changes your surroundings completely. Everything becomes dark and creepy and instead of conquistadors you fight skeletons and evil spirits. You find good spirits who will always tell you a story. A story of a murder, betrayal, vengeance or something sinister that resulted in the death of the townsfolk. You can then find other ghosts and clues (items) to reveal the background of these killings.\n\nWhile not necessarily a long game and repetitive at times, Betrayer offers a refreshing experience in the FPS genre with its unique art style and excellent sound effects.\n\nThe game never tells you where to go but you are able to "listen". By pressing X you hear a sound effect that is stronger if you are close to your objective and also if you face the right direction. This is a creative way to make you navigate and the creepy sound effect greatly accompanies the haunting atmosphere of the Otherworld.\n\nHighly recommended and do keep the monochrome colouring style as intended!","November 2, 2014","true","17.6"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomaera/recommended/243120/","tomaera","Big Red","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomaera/","130 products in account","It's fairly easy to knock about Betrayer if you approach the game like F.E.A.R or another 'ctrl+C, ctrl+V' shooter, but that is totally on you - not the developers. Rather, this should be played like a point and click game in many respects, with an appreciation for the art style Blackpowder has adopted.\n\nLet's start with that. The aesthetic of the game is obviously fairly distinct and this can be a great detractor for some people. Though there is a colour saturation option (that's right, you can play in colour), it is really not recommended as you lose a great deal of the art style that ultimately shapes the atmosphere of the game. However, I found that bumping up colour to 0.1 was beneficial in many cases as it allows for small amounts of extra detail to be resolved, adding a bit more depth otherwise lacking from homogenous blacks that at times were hard to wrap your head around. Overall it's quite gorgeous, and Blackpowder have clearly optimised the look to suit black and white with a little wiggle room for very minimal colouring.\n\nWeapons are by in large period faithful. Crossbows, short bows, long bows, muskets, tomahawks (no, not the exploding kind), flintlocks and rudimentry grenades make up your arsenal. I read elsewhere someone complaining about a lack of automatic weapons - which reflects more upon their own retardation than a fault of the devs. Each weapon feels distinct, and you'll be conciously cycling between certain ones based on the context of the battle at hand, with things like muskets woeful for close combat with multiple enemies but an absolute cannon for longer ranges. Though the mechanics are overall quite simplistic, the hierachy of weapons and their upgrades mean that you'll rarely be dependent on just a single one until quite late in the game.\n\nOther things to note are the actual quests and storyline. All follow a theme (if you can't guess it, log off and finish off your homework of reciting the alphabet) that can at times be a bit "geee I really didn't see that coming," but remain distinct enough so that if you're genuinely interested in playing the game, you'll recall who-is-who and what-is-what. It may not be the strongest storyline, but it is entertaining enough to see the game through to completion with a twist or two.\n\nFinally, the game follows an open world structure most similar to that seen in S.T.A.L.K.E.R games - with open regions to explore that may be left by only a single route in either direction. Though you can teleport anywhere on the discovered map, I find that it actually is inhibitory to your progress as you miss things like chests, buried charms, quest items and unique weapons that you probably overlooked in the early games. These can actually play a pretty big part in how you finish the game, so keep that in mind.\n\n\nThere are plenty of other things I could mention - like the charms, enemies, stealth mechanics, great soundwork or the otherwordly realm; but those are probably best left a bit hush-hush so you can enjoy them yourself. This is a great game that has been well produced but may at times suffer from acute cases of cliche or confusion. If you approach it not like a shooter, but like a point-and-click adventure, you'll enjoy yourself.","November 1, 2014","true","13.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

Sounds great, right? Well it isn't because it grows boring very quickly.\n\nYou fight the same enemies over and over. Your arsenal is limited to a bow, a crossbow, a pistol, a musket, a throwing hatchet, some bombs, and your melee knife. They are period-appropriate weapons, true, but there's just not a lot of variety and the hatchet and bombs are hard to use properly. I played using the bow almost exclusively, because it felt like the other weapons were just slight variations on range, fire rate, and reload speed. You can apparently try to sneak up on enemies from behind, but let me tell you: This is NOT a stealth game. It's all outdoors. You're out in the open. The only reason to bother with stealth here is if you want the game to last four times as long (aka, 300% more time spent doing nothing).\n\nYou encounter a woman in red, who has forgotten her name. For some reason, you can give the woman trinkets that you find. She immediately questions your motives for giving her a gift. She will then either begrudgingly accept the gift or refuse it and send a passive-aggressive insult at you. Look, I don't know why I'm giving you anything! It was a dialogue option that the game presented! Maybe if you had a personality, I would know what you like!\n\nYou're supposed to be collecting clues in order to learn the identity of lost spirits or something. Seems like everyone here has amnesia. This game has a light world / dark world thing going (Hey that's never been done before!) except in this game the only difference between them is that in the light world you fight the revenants of dead soldiers and in the dark world you fight spooky, scary skeletons. So you collect these clues by looking at your map and going to each of the pointers. You then talk to the lost spirits and select each of the dialogue options that is presented to you. Mystery solved! I'm Sherlock-effing-Holmes!\n\nI did not actually finish Betrayer as of writing this review. I did the same boring stuff through four or five areas and decided that even if it did a complete 180 and turned into a competent game at the end, it was too little too late.

I wasn't willing to risk much money on it, though, since it didn't look like there was much to the gameplay.  I'm glad I waited until I could pick it up cheap from Indiegala.  The graphics and overall feel of the game are certainly good, but playing the game itself just isn't very fun.  In fact, for an FPS, it's one of the more boring games I've played in a while.  You're given very little instruction or direction, just that you're supposed to "do" stuff and "find" stuff that's scattered around the map in an effort to "solve" investigations.  I don't really know what the point was to collecting this stuff and solving these investigations, as everything seemed pretty random and didn't do much to advance a plot, at least as far as I could tell.  Mostly what I ended up doing was wandering around aimlessly, looking for something with a bit of color or following audio clues until I stumbled across something to interact with, at which point I would press F to collect or read something.  Occasionally there would be some enemies to fight, and those encounters ranged from either being easy one-shot kills, to practically impossible battles with sizable groups that come from all directions.  Mostly there was just a lot of walking around, though, wondering if the game was actually going to go anywhere.  It's not that I mind this kind of gameplay - I spent dozens of hours wandering around the wastelands of Fallout 3, for example.  But in games like Fallout, there's a sense of accomplishment and progress when you discover things that I simply never felt with Betrayer, making everything seem more a chore than an adventure.\n\nThere was a kind of stealth system, but it was pretty laughable.  Bascially you could either crouch, which rendered you practically invisible but meant it took an excruciatingly long time to get anywhere, or you could walk, which gave the enemies supernatural awareness of you at all times, or you could stand around until the wind kicked up, then use the noise to scurry forward for a couple seconds until the wind died down again.  Maybe it sounded good in theory, but it was pretty pointless in practice.\n\nIt's not nearly the worst game I've ever played, I can't even say it's particularly bad, but overall the game was just too boring to put up with the frustrations, the ambiguities, and seeming lack of any progression.  I have plenty of other games in my library that are just more deserving of my time.","February 4, 2015","false","4.8"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","36","56","3","3"

Unlike most derivative FPSs, the setting is not burst-fire-full-metal-jacket but rather a period where you'll be armed with bows, crossbows, powder pistols, and powder muskets. And they will take time to load, including pouring powder and ramrodding. Again unlike most FPSs, there's a story you engaged in; not just riding along a cut-scene-driven story, but one where you need to collect clues and things and fill in your knowledge of what's been going on in the various areas.\n\nThe use of sound to help you locate PoI in the game is highly novel and clever, and the sounds are eerie & suitable for the setting. Pays to be listening carefully as you explore. Surround sound headphones were highly valuable. There are visual indicators to augment the sound if you need a little assist. The gameplay & environmental sounds are excellent as well.\n\nFor collectors, there lots of stuff to find--much of it quite helpful, especially if you're not the greatest twitch player--and it will pay to revisit old areas of the map.\n\nThe length is appropriate, but do note that you're looking at perhaps 12-18 hours; I'm not OCD on the achievements, but I sneak around somewhat (not to assassinate, just not to get injured in battles) so I took 17 hours. This length is very suitable for the investigations and degree of variety in the game.\n\nThere is just one save, which you can trigger yourself or let the game auto-save at key times and on a schedule. Normally I hate the single-save option, especially in games with ~RPG/story choices; I feel I get less value with no insta-replayability (no, I never want to slog through a game in order to make a different choice 11 hours in). However, in Betrayer it works out just fine and I didn't get that annoyed great-this-checkpoint-again feeling at any time.\n\nAll-in-all a quality game that was quite a bit of fun, had a unique settings, had novel use of sound elements, was interesting to complete, was suitably challenging, was engaging, and which didn't overstay its welcome.

So i went to the side of the game and it got an interesting plot.\n\nThe Year is 1604 and you were send to the new world to found out what happened to a british Colony. Soon you will be attacked by Conquistadors. The Spanish were not the only Danger in this Region. Finding the Fort of the Colony empty without any soul, except 2 Ash Corpses you have to ask yourself one Question: What happened to the Colonists?\n\nBetrayer is a very interesting First Person Shooter Game. Your Weapons are Bows, Pistols, musketry and knives. No Rocket Launcher, no BFG, no Lasersword and no Kitty Bombs. This game got a special Graphicstyle that creats a unique atmosphere. And i mean in a haunting way. Do you remember a walk in a forrest? Remember the the Birds Singing, the Sun between the trees, the wind playing with leafs. How they rustle? Yes? Congratulations, now you are in BETRAYER. I think my Forrest Walks will never be the same. *sigh*\nAnyway, on your search for the Colonists you have to fight. You can do it the direct way "HEY GUYS I`M HEEEEEERE!" or the Snake way. Sneaking. So if you`re sneaking you can do it with the help of the wind. No, really! This is a special point of this game. The wind covers your steps and the enemy can`t hear you coming, if you come from behind, hey who would sneak in front, eh? No, you don`t have Jedi Power forget it. This is 1604, not "far far away in a distant galaxy". Well you can decide on your own, how you survive and believe me ... the Conquistadors are not the badest Guys in this game.\n\nSo, follow the hints on a map, solve the mysterys and stay alive in a unique looking game. And don`t forget our real life. Take a walk in the forrest. Listen to the Birds and the rustling leafs in the sunlight.

Watching its updates, reading further reviews about its content and gameplay, I saw quite a fair amount of both appraisals and negative criticism. I was sceptical for a while, but the months reinvigorated my interest as I witnessed some clever updates addressing a few issues that were hindering its potential. Then I recently bought it and, about only one week and a half afterwards, I've finished it.\n\nBetrayer is a fantastic indie enterprise, like few I've seen. It combines visual astonishment (directly affecting the atmosphere of ethereal mysteries) with no-nonsense combat, enhanced by the evolution of enemy hordes and also of the player's arsenal and fighting techniques. Running about with musket and bow has never been so much about timing each one's shot and adapting them for the precise circumstances. Missing *your* shot might very easily mean taking the enemy's back at you, since their aiming is relentless, and your health bar, friable.\n\nThe theme is reasonably innovative, and the game's approach is downright unique. The year is 1606, and you land on Virginian soil, only to find a very primitive colonial process that has crumbled under inner conflicts and treason. On the other side, Native Americans are hunted, violated and burnt, as the names of their ancestors slowly fade away throughout the narrative process. The several notes found in the game tell (in fairly neat writing) of leaders from both sides being conspired against, sons and daughters being slain or assimilated. The player is then left with a visual that matches the storyline: ghosts float about the dense woods without remembrance of their actual lives, and beg for closure for their sins and/or misfortunes. The player may or may not remind them of who they were and what they did, bringing them either peace or torment. Amidst all this otherworldly saga, the true game's nemeses are embodied by steel-armoured bears (the colonisers) or burnt owls (the natives), which can be interpreted by their roaring or hooting beyond their human silhouettes.\n\nPlay this game bearing in mind that it is a heavy experience. Being able to adjust colour saturation and contrast is also a nice feature for atmosphere adaption. If I were to point out a mistake, it may have been the walking and searching necessary to locate clues, letters, chests, and weapons. These are vast forested lands that are excellent for territorial combat, but a bit tedious for repetitive treasure hunt. Apart from that issue, a game that is well worth the cash and is beautiful to explore.","November 13, 2014","true","18.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

As beautiful as betrayer is. Every map area is identical to the last, and the few enemy types quickly become EXTREMELY repetitive.\n\nInstead of just an empty forest every map. Where are the large spooky abandoned houses or mansions? Where are the rivers? Where are the lighthouses? Where are the rope-bridges, where the large quarries?\n\nAnd for the enemies they could have added so much more, like wolves, bear, possesed birds, witches.\n\nEvery map is the same as the last, enter, find four "Corrupted" totem poles, kill the 3-4 enemies next to them. And that unlocks the next area which you just start the process over again.\n\nThe story/objectives with helping the ghost people is insultingly repetitive. It seems like they tacked on the objectives just for the sake of giving you something to do. And the occasional "The thief has escaped" minigame is a pathetic last ditch effort to throw something else in. You have to find a ghost person, ask them what they need. Find them a certain item in the dirt, and repeat a hundred times. I have never seen a more borring/shallow objective setup in my life. I have seen MMORPG quests more immersive than betrayers quests.\n\nDuring alpha the game was headed in the right direction. The bows had arrow drop, and you really had to lead your targets to hit them like a real bow. If you died you had ONE chance to reclaim your dropped loot before it was lost forever. That gave the game a real sense of fear and adrenale.\n\nNow you\n1. No longer need to account for arrow drop with your bow (the arrow lands wherever the crosshair is placed)\n2. You respawn and don't need a single penny or any items\n3. You get healthpacks that you can use whenever your hp is low\n4. The enemies just run straight at you like brainless idiots.\n\nBetrayer could have been so much more.\n\nIf you get this game on sale for like 1-3 dollars and just want to have it as a relaxing immersion experience. Than go for it. But if you are looking for a playable video game. Get as far away from this game as possible.","August 21, 2014","false","13.6"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","34","58","0","3"

The game also gives you the option of adjusting dark/light/color saturation levels to find the desired graphical effect to your liking.\n\n+Interesting setting taking place mid century. The entire game takes place mainly in forested areas\n\n+Interesting story that slowly unravels as you progress\n\n+Easy achievements\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe combat leaves a lot to be desired. You have a handful of weapons: bows, crossbows, pistols and none of them felt truly satisfying to use.\n\nThe game doesn't do much in terms of changing up the gameplay or scenery. The game is split between a number of areas and all of them look, feel and play the same. Enter an area collect all treasures, clues, clear corruption, rinse and repeat.\n\nA lack of enemy variety\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The game gives you the option of using stealth rather than charging head first into battle. The problem however is that stealth is awful. Sometimes enemies will spot you a mile away and other times they won't. It lacks consistency, although there are items that make stealth slightly easier however most of these items are obtained late in the game.  This doesn't really matter though because most of the time enemies will just surprise attack you  as you make your way through the forest.\n\n-The only AI the enemies have is to charge you. Thus, combat revolves around enemies spotting you and then charging you relentlessly.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the low score I do feel there is enough in this game to justify a purchase, albeit at a low price. The developers seem to truly care about the game providing constant updates and responding regularly on the forums.\n\nYou are playing this game more for the setting and story and less for the gameplay.","February 22, 2015","true","14.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Rinse and repeat.\nIt is beset with the frustration of Demon Souls without the rewarding learning curve. Death means a loss of loot and a respawning of enemy you have painstakingly cleared; also, at the time of this review the game also tends to crash now and then when toggling inventory menu which again means  restarting the long chore of clearing respawned enemy,( although I understand the Devs have this issue tagged for a fix )\nSo that all said, what is it that keeps me coming back again and again for more? Is it the superb graphics and artwork? Is it the setting of a Shipwreck survivor in the 17th Century, or is it the intriguing and mysterious  sub plots clues and locations that build towards a larger picture of Supernatural proportions? It is all this that creates a sense of playing within a Ben Wheatley cult British film.\nSo flawed and frustrating, yes, but this is far outweighed by its moody and enigmatic magnificence.\nNow I need to take my leave, for I must return to the trees and rocks and that damned wind.

It's a horror game, with a semi-open world to explore. It's a shooter, but it encourages stealth. It even shuffles some RPG elements in there for good measure. The end result is an experience that's quite unlike anything I've ever played.\n\nThe game starts off with you washing up on a beach in 16th-century Virginia. As you make your way inland, you discover the nearest colony has been overtaken by a mysterious force: one that turned the local populace into ashes and changed a Spanish invasion force into feral beasts. You meet the enigmatic Maiden in Red, whose past is tied to this place in ways she cannot yet remember. As you venture through the forests you uncover more abandoned settlements, each with their own history and ghosts left behind to tell it. You'll face a multitude of strange creatures, brought forth by the plague ravishing the Frontier. The combat can get a bit clunky, but the novelty of shooting monsters with muskets and crossbows makes up for that. Exploration can get a bit dull, since the world mostly looks the same. I had to resort to using an online map for each of the game's segments in order to get the full experience.\n\nEach map of the game world is strewn with collectables. These range from journal pages left by the people to graves and clues you find in the wilderness. Speaking with wraiths can give you valuable insight into the tragedies that occured here, even before the world went to hell. There's some interesting stories to be found, and they all receive a form of closure. The way you handle them can also have an impact on the ending of the game, but don't expect the effect to be too great. The ending itself is also strange, and leaves a lot open to interpretation (and the inevitable sequel), but the game's climax is satisfying enough to overlook that.\n\nBetrayer is definitely not easy. The enemies pack quite a punch, even on the lowest difficulty setting. There's not a lot of guides on there online, either, so you'll have to find your own way through the intricate maze of Colonial history the developers have crafted. Figuring it out is immensely satisfying, though, and I'd definitely recommend everyone to play this game.","August 5, 2014","true","14.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

This is a game that’s big on atmosphere, even if it is a tad light on content. Visually the game is quite unique, and the small indie studio have managed to create a world that’s far more eery and mysterious than can be found in most AAA horror titles. And this creepy atmosphere is further enhanced by excellent audio design. The combat is fun and reasonably challenging, and it does stealth pretty well too. It would, perhaps, gain something from a wider variety of environments and maybe from some voice acting, but on the whole this is an excellent little game. And it’s also great value for money.

Whilst the story behind the events was actually quite interesting and complex it quickly became a chore that got in the way of killing enemies, finding clues and treasure, upgrading weapons and removing the evil on each map. There is not a lot of reading involved but, it does frustratingly slow down the game if you are playing it as an FPS.\nTo get the full benefit from the game it needs to be played first and foremost as an adventure and not an FPS.\nThe graphics are good, if your eyes are comfortable with the black and white default it heightens the atmosphere also, the night brought on by ringing the bells is particularly atmospheric, I preferred 50% colour during the day which for me, made the day night transition more dramatic.\nSound also plays an important part in the game as locating an item, enemy or event can be done just by following a sound to its source, headphones are probably an advantage.\nAlthough there is a compass it is not possible mark any locations on the in game maps this can be a problem as some items can only be accessed with a shovel and relocating them once you have found a shovel can be very time consuming. The ability to be able to print out maps for the player to mark locations currently inaccessible of items for later return would have been useful.\nThe game has little if any replay value except for playing on more difficult settings however, I shall play it again when I get time as an adventure and concentrate on following the story, although I completed it only a few hours ago apart from the main character I recall very little of the interrelationships of the other dozen or so characters in the story.\nI bought this in a sale and believe that I got value for what I paid however, I also believe there was a lot of potential missed because the two main game play genres failed to complement each other effectively, despite that, it was still an enjoyable game.\nI shall definitely consider any future offerings from Black Powder Games.\n","December 11, 2014","true","52.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The developers trust the players enough not to lead them by the hand. The gamer is given quite a huge map to explore, filled to the brim with hidden fragments of a spooky story (or, rather, stories) to piece together. This leads to an amount of freedom not usually found in similar titles.

Either way it's pretty amazing.\n\nThe graphic with color is above average for an indie game. The sound is generally creepy at night and sound is very helpful during daylight to help you track things.\n\nEverything is pretty easy to find because there is a Circle of interest that you can find on the map. During night use "X" to hear ghost sound and look though your compass to find where everything is.\n\nYou don't quite get the name Betrayer until the very ending and you have to actually think back though the story and note to understand where Betray is.\n\nYou have 1 NPC girl to interact with entire game and she is fun to toy with using different gift and dialoge options. The rest NPC ghost are very tragic and twisted sometime. IF it's not for the release all the ghost in Peace achievement.

As so many other people have already mentioned, base gameplay is roaming around trying to find clues and/or pick things up.  That's fine, not like other games require any less of its players.\n\nMy cons:\n\nI guess my biggest gripe with the game (and bear in mind my play time - maybe this gets better) is that I found the combat difficult (I may be in the minority there).  While some enemies can be done in with a single shot to the head, I found this to not really be an easy thing to do.  Where I am having serious  problems is in the "void/dark wold" (or whatever it's called) where the skeletons are roaming around.  You are using period appropriate weapons, so your guns require a significant reload time between shots (since you are using black powder weapons).  Even if I sprinted, I could not outrun the skeletons and the melee attack was near worthless since once they get that close to you, you're more or less dead.\n\nThis leads to my next gripe - you die way too easily in my opinion.  Where there is one skeleon, there are usually three or four and they swarm you.  Since you can't outrun them (unless I'm doing something wrong), I can't get away and keep getting killed.  You can go back to your last spot to recover any lost gear, but the game regenerates any baddies you killed before and places them in different parts of the map.  Usually I would be fine with something like that, but it just makes this difficult.\n\nWhen you are killed, you respawn back at the fort (at least at the part I am currently at which is pretty much the beginning) meaning you have to back track to wherever you were last.  The areas aren't that big, but since the bad guys are also respawned and placed in different locations after you die, it means you are stuck having to deal with the same bad guys over again.  Only this time you don't have the benefit of any ammunition or other items you may have had prior to your death (including money).  So even though you can buy weapons and supplies at the fort, you aren't going to have any money after respawning to actually buy anything with.  If you are out of ammo, you're kind of hosed since all you will have is your melee knife which is useless in my opinion.\n\nWith regards to weapons - you can purchase upgraded weapons, but they seem to be priced way too high in my opinion.  As much loot as I've picked up, I still don't have enough money to buy upgraded weapons and from what I've read on other reviews, they probably aren't much of a benefit anyway.\n\nThere is supposedly a stealth aspect to this game, but I have yet to be able to sneak up on anyone with success (even when the wind is blowing).  You're better off trying to take enemies out from a distance if you can.\n\nPros:\n\nGame runs smooth and I think it does offer a bit of a different premise when compared to the average FPS game. I'm usually a fan of this type of game in that it does blend some horror and investigation type elements into the game.  They are limited, but at least they are there.\n\nI got it on sale for a few bucks and that would be my suggestion to everyone else - get it while it's on sale and that should help offset the negatives.\n\nI did not (and will not) get a refund on the game and I'll still keep tinkering with it, but nothing in the game really screams at me to come back and play it like others that I've played.","October 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","16","27","3","4"

Play the demo first, it's a good representation. If that doesn't give you a thrill and a chill down your spine, then you'll miss half the game, because it's really quite a thriller.\n\nThe Betrayer name and Adventure genre caught my eye and a had quick glance at a short description and without further ado I was plunged into the game. All I really needed to know to play the game was the mention of the Unreal engine and a quick peek at the controls ASWD and the rest was quite intuitive.\n\nThe game is quite a mystery too and there were times when I wished I had a better idea about my role in the game, but it was somehow like playing Zork Nemesis or Myst with Guns. Sometimes there were dialogue options that left me wondering if it's also a role-playing game and with a bit of romance, but.. It didn't quite play out the way I thought.\n\nThere were a few times that I was getting a bit angry with the game, because of controls and a bit of clunkiness in design, like if you got your finger on fast-forward and open the map window for a quick peek and exit you stop moving even though you still got your finger on fast forward. There are lots of keys for different windows and there were times when I had too much adrenaline going that the keys felt a bit too crowded and since each of them would cancel movement, things were getting a bit to hectic at times.\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of moving around in the game and even though there are some nice fast-travel options there is still a bit too much walking, but there are also some really cool, chilly and atmospheric hair-raising sound effects and a lot of sudden encounters. It would have been nice to have an Always Sprint option.\n\nThe game use some really old guns, muskets, flintlock pistols, bows and crossbows all with pretty slow loading. Unfortunately you can't dodge bullets or arrows by quick-stepping or jumping, but you can sprint and take cover and it works quite well.\n\nEven though there is a lot of sound, there is no voice acting in the game and I didn't really miss it either. The writing is pretty decent.\n\nI only had to look online for a solution once, because there was a bell I couldn't find in the Deep Woods.\n\nYou can play the game in black and white (and red) or increase the Colour saturation from pale to full. I did a bit of both.\n\nIt took me 15 hours to finish the game and I was sprinting a lot, but I was also really exploring a lot.

Once I realized I didn't need to SEE a trowel or a hatchet to HAVE said item, I was good to go there.\n\nI think the only slight issue I could say is that the listening skill was not explained and therefore it took a couple minutes to realize how that worked.\n\nSound was handled nicely as well. I liked that certain audio clues would indicate what enemies were around. The indian sound effect was especially good. Every time I heard it, I would whip around scanning for them.

You sailed from England expecting to join a struggling colony on the coast of Virginia. Instead, you find only ghosts and mysteries. What catastrophe blighted the land and drained it of color and life? Where are the settlers and tribes who lived here?\nClue by\nclue, you must piece together the story of what befell this doomed settlement and find a way to set things right. You will be hunted by corrupted Conquistadors and ravening shadows as you explore an expansive wilderness in order to trace the brief, tragic history of the colony and search for survivors."\n\n***STORY - 7/10\nYou have to find documents and complete quests/investigations if you want to uncover the truth behind what you "think" happened. This is a good thing and a bad thing at the same time: it is good because it gives your search a purpose, but the drawback is that you might miss something important and will be left with some unanswered questions.\n\n***GRAPHICS - 8/10\nThe polygons are not the best, but since it is an indie game I'd say they are good enough. The textures on some bushes are really detailed, those on the pine trees not so much, but overall they are better than vanilla Skyrim. What I really liked about the graphics is how the vegetation reacts to the wind, you will see everyting moving, almost every leaves of a bush and every blade of grass.\nYou can choose to play on two different color patterns, the "supposed" one is black an white... and red. This is what the developers want you to use, it's spooky and it adds something the the game, but I didn't like it very much so I choose the coloured version, which is very good nonetheless. However I still had to play some part black and white for in-game reasons, but in my opinion it was better this way.\n\n***SOUND - 8/10\nThere is no music in the game, that's because some of the gameplay mechanics are based on environmental sound. For example if you want to sneak upon an enemy undetected and there is no cover, just stay behind them and run when the wind blows, your footsteps noise will be covered and you can stab the enemy in the back.\nAnother feature of the game that concerns sound is that you have to follow some distant eerie noises that will lead you to your next objective... or enemy.\n\n***GAMEPLAY - 6/10\nThe gamplay is quite straightforward, you will get no tutorial, but the game is a first person shooter. The only problem is that every quest is a fetch and retrieve. You basically do the same thing over and over again and it gets boring after the 3rd map. However, the game is 7 hours long (more or less) so you will not suffer much for that.\nThe good thing is that you have a quite nice choice of 17th century weapons and shooting lead balls from your musket is quite rewarding.\n\nReplayable? No, once you have finished it you're probably not going to start it again.\n\nOverall score : 7/10 - Buy it when it's under 10€","November 4, 2014","true","9.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Weapons. Ghosts. Empty forest, and a strange switch into darkness (same forest except creepy as hell) whenever you chose. Betrayer has more or less this atmosphere.\n\nThe game reminded me of STALKER in a way. You are put on a hostile environment with lots of nature, beautiful natural sounds mixed with some dark ambient and horror audio. No quest markers and pointers, you have to figure out what to do yourself.\n\nFor max atomsphere and immersion I advise to turn off the crosshair. It's pretty easy to learn how to shoot without the aiming help. Betrayer has a mix of exploration and first person shooting (which works fine). It has a classical horror story, which you will read in the game (no spoken stuff).\n\nGame is normal in difficulty if you just follow the story. If you set out to find all secrets and hidden stash, it's difficult. Map navigation is realistic, although it would be awesome if the game allowed to set notes on it. To illustrate the difficulty of finding treasures: it is still hard even if you have a copy of a map in a Steam guide that shows where the specific hidden objects are.\n\nIt's definetly a different game, and the switch between light and dark world is very interesting (don't misunderstand, both environments are pretty hostile). One thing to note: Betrayer can get repetative after some time, I wish there were more unique environments and places put here, since 60-70% of the time you will be exploring. Still, I gladly suggest it to anyone looking for dark thriller kind of game, with appropriate atmosphere.","May 8, 2014","true","18.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The environments are amazing. The game is supposedly meant to be played in black and white, with some color, mostly red, shining through to mark things of importance. Thankfully there are some sliders to mess with the colors and you can get the game looking amazing. I know some people like the black and white effect, but it didn't do it for me. I can't say enough good things about the atmosphere of this game. It manages to be bright, colorful and vibrant while being creepy at the same time. All the story is told though clues, documents and other collectibles that you record in your notebook. Every piece of text you uncover is recorder and honestly makes for a great story that involves the disapearance of all the people in the area, leaving behind zombified Spanish soldiers among other things. The combatinvolves longbows, crossbows and single shot pistols and muskets. There are charms you can find that increase things like reload speed. run speed and health. Health is important because it is rather easy to die in this game because the enemies are pretty strong. All you get out of this game is what you put in it. You can discover as much of or as little of the story as you want.\n\nThe only bad things are that there isn't more of this game and the story ends rather abruptly and without much fanfare.

It's a first-person stealth adventure with a healthy dose of whodunit storyline set in the New England wilderness of the 1600s.  This will be on my Best of 2014 List without question.\n\nThese notes reflect day 2 on Steam, so they may get patched over time.\n\n[PROS]\n- The black-and-white esthetic is beautiful, but replaceable if you're not into that.\n- The storyline is amazing and the characters you meet are written to make you like or hate them -- a lot.\n- The stealth combat is great -- creep into shadows and expect to get owned if you go running at two bad guys like an idiot.\n- Shadows count toward stealth\n- Wind counts toward stealth\n- When you're nearby important items, there are audio cues to draw your attention\n- Four hits and you're dead\n- You are rewarded for exploration\n- You can't lose aggro -- enemies will follow you until either you are dead or they are dead\n- Very simple inventory system; tons of lore and each clue you find is recorded just in case you want to review it later.\n- While sprinting, you never get winded\n- In my opinion, good game length\n- If the combat is too difficult or time consuming, there's a button for that\n- Full rekeybinding with warnings when you unbind a key\n- Audio cues are important, but if that's an issue, there's an option to turn them into visual cues\n\n\n[CONS]\n- Limited graphics options (no 1080; MAX = 1280x720)\n- There is no warning when you are exploring and walk into an "exit zone" to the next area.  So while exploring, you might accidentally leave the area and then have to come back -- which is a pain.\n- FOV slider goes to 110, but it looks very weird visually and really hinders you given how important it is to zoom in to hit targets at range with your bow and arrow.\n- Light refraction off of water is junky\n- Enemies always walk in a triangle, so you can anticipate where they'll be.\n- Enemies occasionally walk on top of a tree\n- Enemies make a huge ruccous when they spawn\n- There's no letter or other device to tell you why you're here at the start of the game.  You can piece together the story as you go along, but the first fifteen minutes of the game could be a lot more informative\n- Game is very linear all things considered\n- Each area takes about an hour to fully explore and technically you have to explore them twice (I won't spoil why)","March 25, 2014","true","4.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Your adventure will take you to a variety of deserted settlements, where you will talk with the dead, encounter a mysterious woman in red, and fight the dead enemies of the English settlers.\n\nThough I do recommend this game, I think the pace of it might scare people off. The game has a slow pace, and there is a lot of exploring to find objects. Patience required.\n\nThe black and white filter that you see in the screenshots can be altered in game, and you can bring colour and saturation into the game world (this too can be reset to the default B/W).\n\nI also recommend that you use a headset to play the game. Sound is used to alert you of clues to be discovered as well as enemies near by. In fact you will probably hear enemies before you see them!\n\nProgressing through the game you will need to seek out tribal statues during the night cycle and clearing them of any dead, by clearing all in one area it will open up the gate/path to the next. You will also need to solve the mysteries of the wraiths you talk to, you will find clues that will jog their memory of their last days alive. The backstory of each one you meet and the reason behind their death is compelling. The need to discover what happened to the settlement and it’s people was one of the reasons I enjoyed playing through the game.\n\nCombat can be incredibly tense, as first you will probably hear your enemy before you see them, and the hooting and howling of the native tribe folk are especially creepy. Seeing as the game is set in the 1604 your arsenal consists of bow and arrow, tomahawk, powder bombs, muskets, and pistols (either scavenged or bought) -- these weapons each have their pros and cons, but their main drawback is their speed. Reloading a weapon will give you enough time to throw a few curse words at the screen, as the enemies in the game pick up speed once they are aware of you. A stealthy approach is recommended to pick off individuals and groups, but sometimes you won’t have that option. Using tomahawks or bombs between shots can really help you out.\n\nThe environment is dead quiet, except for the sound of the wind and your enemies. You can use the sound of the wind rustling through the grass and trees to run up for a surprise blow.\n\nIf you’re looking for a further challenge you can increase the difficulty of the enemies and also enable drop loot. Drop loot will drop your loot and you will lose it permanently if you do not recover it before dying again.\n","December 13, 2014","true","11.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I was in on the early access, and while I liked the idea it just wasn't shaping up to wha I wanted to me. Color me shocked, but I have to say my expectations were simply surpassed. I still have my misgivings, but this is overall a good game. THIS is how a game should be developed. Start with a rough edge, sharpen, an evolution of characters and ideas, until finally you have a finished product. And on that note alone I would recommend this.\n\nFirst: The good.\n\nAtmosphere. The game drips with a thick atmosphere set in a pre-colonization american wild. There is no wildlife or humans save for you and one other. You are the only sane man in a cursed world, and this game does an excellent job at establishing that hard-to-nail lonely feeling.\n\nThis game is also quite frightening in the fun way that everything is scarier that it should be. Mortal enemies consist of soldiers and natives. The Spanish soldiers are literally some kind of inhuman beast-men, and the indians are more like zombies than humans. Then you have spiritual foes; consisting primarily of spell-casting skeletons and wraiths. Its just that everything you encounter is so strange and unnatural in ways you don't execpt. Armed with only simple weapons and your stealth skills, this game does a good job at making you feel helpless and alone in a diffuclt situation; proving that, once again, taking away the weapons doesn't make a game scary on its own so much as the feeling of helplessness and weakness does. A wide variety of intimidating monsters and plentiful surprises makes the game consistantly intense and frightening; no spoilers included.\n\nExcept one: NIne foot tall Infantryman in the first area.\n\nWeapons work well on that note. You have a small arsenal of five or six weapons that can be upgraded in quality to improve performance. Each weapon has strengths and drawbacks. Bows are weaker, but being able to recover ammo is practical. While a pistol or musket packs a punch they are also noisy and very limited. You also have a dagger sidearm for fending off swarming enemies, and a tomahawk that serves as a sort of grenade attack that can get rid of anyone except some of the nastier foes with one good throw.\n\nIt is also worth noting this game is very hard at times. You can take about two to three shots before dying if you don't use a health flask, enemies often attack in groups, and many foes possess a rage ability that makes them more resistant to damage when they go into attack. This is primarily a stealth fps where sneak attacks and avoidance are preferred, and open conflicts are dangerous and cost you a lot of valuable ammo. A well placed arrow to the back can kill a soldier in one shot, but if he spots you? Not even a high-quality musket shot to the chest will kill him then. You have to be quick and accurate in this game, and it is very rewarding.\n\nIn summary, the gameplay is intense and legitimately scary a lot of times. Its a good challenge, and working with old-world weaponry is good fun and rewarding to get the hang of. The gameplay is definitely there.\n\nThe bad:\n\nI'm going to skip over some of the nitpicks like the night being too easy at times or enemy path-finding being a little clumsy, and loading being a bit too long for my tastes and get on with the one big problem I have with this game.\n\nStory and objectives.\n\nThe setup is good to be fair. You are some kind of traveler going to America when your ship is gunned down by a Spanish warship and you are stranded in a strangely cursed colony where everyone is mysteriously dead, and ghosts roam freely. You have one companion in all this mess, a woman in red robe, but she doesn't even know her own name. Its up to you to figure out what is going on.\n\nAnd here is where it falls apart. You never figure out what is going on.\n\nYou spend most of the game finding white ghosts, people who committed horrible acts of betrayal (hah) and sin, and are now cursed to undeath, and helping them remember their sins in order to give them peace. But each character is its own little side story that ultimatley shapes up to have nothing to do with the whole curse problem. After completing the fourth investigation and helping the ghosts remember their sins, I still don't know what is going on. You also find pages that seem to log thoughts of the colony, but they are all worthless it seems; with many of them talking about mundane things like the quality of an indian arrow vs an englishman's arrow.\n\nThere's also a mechanic where you find certain treasures that you can give to the girl in red that I 'think' is some sort of investigation mechanic where you see how she reacts to certain things in order to find out more about her and help guess who she is later, but even on that I don't know.\n\nThe game is just cryptic. I feel like the main 'plot' doesn't go anywhere, and I'm just doing a bunch of fetch quests to collect clues to help people remember things that I don't care about. There is just no point to it, and if there is than its waited too long to make it, as I am sure I am already halfway through the game.\n\nThat's another thing though: clue collecting. Its interesting to use a sort of sixth sense to find little treasures and points of interest to collect clues to help the ghosts remember things, but its all linear and prescripted. All your responses are single-lines that force the stories along in an unpleasant way. It lacks intelligence.\n\nTo summaraize that: The story just isn't good. Its got a nice setup, but it holds the player by the hand, drags them along at a snail's pace, and presents itself in a broken incoherent mess of sidestories that just make absolutely no sense in the grand scheme of things. And finally, for a game that oozes with 'mysterious', there is just no mystery, since everything you say is pre-determined. You should be able to collect clues, put the stories together yourself, and figure out whether the evidence saves or condemns the soul in question, but instead its all a straight line and often painfully predictable.\n\nOverall:\nI remember the developers saying they wanted to make a simple well-polished game rather than one bloated with ugly features, and I can agree with that bit of wisdom to an extent. But I have to say, Betrayer's biggest flaw, and a big flaw at that, is the lack of complexity. Weapon variety feels a little limited, the stories of the ghosts are easy to figure out and don't really involve the player, and overall its just a big fetch-quest that serves as an excuse for the player to go out into the darkened wilds to explore and face monsters.\n\nBut that doesn't stop the gameplay one bit, which I would say is top notch when it all comes together in tense stealth action and brutal conflicts. Its a well-made, if overly simple, game that is fun to play and a decent challenge. For an atmospheric game, the lack of a good engaging story is a massive flaw in my eyes, but the one-of-a-kind setting and pre-american FPS gameplay is just enough to redeem its shortcomings.\n\nI recommend this game, if barely. I wish it could have been better, but its fun enough as is and definitely worth the twenty dollars.","March 25, 2014","true","19.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Anyway, when the game tries to be scary, at least tries to create spooky atmosphere, the result is not that good.

If you have a 32-bit OS, this game crashes like crazy. Wait until you are on a 64-bit OS.\n\nThe plot is simple- you wash up on shore in the New World (early colonization of America- like Jamestown). The land is drained of most color. A young woman in a red hood soon appears, telling you she doesn't remember much other than her twin sister is missing. You will have to explore during the day and the night to figure out what happened, and each has its own set of dangers.\n\nThe atmosphere schtick with everything black, white, and red works for me. It's hard to explain why I like it; best I can do is to say that it is easier to take in the setting when you know things in red are important and the rest (for the most part) is scenery. The graphics are solid- nothing amazing, but nothing bad beyond some of the typesetting, which is a bit sloppy and hurts immersion a bit. If you really hate the lack of color, you can opt to change it to a more "normal" color setting, but you'll lose some of the game's charm in the process.\n\nSound is well done. There is a type of enemy in the third area that, if you listen carefully, communicates via animal calls. One kind means they are near, another one is heard when I step into the open, and a third is the signal to attack. I have learned to fear bird calls, because they mean I might get jumped by multiple fast enemies shooting arrows aplenty at me. You can sneak up on foes more easily if the wind is blowing through the branches, too (though I have not been able to pull it off). There are a few enemies that are basically a skull and skeletal hands with dark vapors for a body- I mention this because killing them is punctuated by a rather funny "PING!" sound. On one hand, it doesn't fit the creepiness of night exploration, but on the other, when you nail that elusive Thief, it's very satisfying to "ring its bell", so to speak.\n\nGameplay is a sort of cross between an exploration/find and click adventure game and a first-person shooter. Combat is short and deadly; at first you can only take a couple of hits at one time (you do have a means of healing, but it is limited to undoing one hit per use, give or take). The bow, musket, and pistol feel like you'd expect such primitive firearms to feel (though if you're used to Skyrim's bow like I am, there will be a small adjustment period). Enemies often travel in packs, so proper attack plans and dodging are a must. Gung-ho rushing in will get you killed. The enemy will press the attack if you seem vulnerable, but you have a tomahawk to throw if they get too close. The melee attack seems best used for stealth attacks or as a last-ditch desperation move. Since my initial review, a new enemy, giant spiders, were added- while they are a nice addition from a pure gameplay standpoint (hard to hit and fairly fast), they are a bit incongruous to the setting.\n\nDuring the game, you have to search for clues as to what happened, which will lead in turn to finding restless spirits to interrogate and/or lay to rest. You will find items early in the game that will make it easier to spot clues via visual or audial cues. Lots of people who suffered horrible deaths, and a fair number that probably deserved worse.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone. If you want another traditional FPS, Betrayal won't do it for you. However, if a blend of light clue-hunting and investigation, short but brutal bouts of FPS combat, and a setting/theme that keeps the player on edge much of the time sounds like it's worthwhile, give it a shot (and don't forget to dodge while you reload that musket).","June 6, 2014","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat might be a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but BETRAYER’s main appeals are definitely the detective aspect and its atmosphere.\n\nThe most immediately striking things about BETRAYER are obviously its monotone color palette (which is actually optional) and that its unusual (for video games) setting. Both work together, along with the paper map by which you navigate, to create a great sense of being in another time and place.\n\nIt’s not just the lack of color that creates the style either, but the high contrast Blackpowder games employs (along with the reds that stick out to facilitate gameplay), particularly the very deep blacks which accentuate shadows. Blackpowder lets you adjust the contrast and bring color back into BETRAYER. Setting everything to “1.0” makes the game look much more “normal” and realistic, but also less interesting if you ask me. At some points you have to travel into an “otherworld” where the monochrome scheme inverts and thick, SILENT HILL-like fog is prevalent. Oppressive would be a strong word to describe it, but it manages to feel sufficiently moody.\n\nThe meat of the game is exploring the world to track down clues and eventually interrogate ghosts to put the story together. The ghosts all make for diverse and interesting mini stories that eventually connect to the main mystery of the game, though Blackpowder didn’t have the budget for any voice acting.\n\nEven though the main mystery is fairly directly told once you gather the necessary clues, BETRAYER manages to vaguely allude to other mysteries behind the scenes. These culminate in a highly ambiguous ending that’s already ignited various interpretations from players.\n\nThe combat is probably BETRAYER’s most polarizing aspect. Of course it can’t be a normal first person shooter when you’re dealing with 17th century weaponry. What Blackpowder ended up with is something I find rather challenging and skill-based but others might just find to be a crapshoot.\n\nAs you fight monstrous Spaniards, skeletons, and other creatures, you mainly use a bow which feels nice and takes a bit of practice for figuring out when to loose arrows. Stealth definitely helps for starting or avoiding encounters but isn’t always an option. The knife, crossbows, muskets, and pistols are suited to different kinds of enemies and situations which all have patterns to learn. Dodging enemy projectiles is particularly tricky but learnable. If you want you can turn on a feature where you drop your equipment when you die and have one chance to retrieve it a la DARK SOULS, but the game as of this writing has it turned off by default.\n\nBETRAYER probably takes between five and 12 hours to finish due to much of its content being optional, but also desirable because of its affect on the ending. For fans of survival horror and adventure games who miss investigating dark, mysterious places, this isn’t only a nice first person game to chew on, but also a unique application of open world game design. From there it’s just a matter of whether or not the combat holds you back.","June 30, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The UI is minimalist and the gameplay is interesting but eventually starts to become repetitive towards the end. It pulls off a decent combination of RPG and FPS, but I feel certain aspects could have been made better and others weren't really relevant (upgrading your weapons for example feels tacked on and doesn't actually contribute to gameplay, you just get more powerful weapons that do exactly the same thing as the game progresses)\n\nThe story is interesting and makes you think, the setting is unique and one I've seen in virtually no other video games and the mood and tone is excellent, I had cold shivers for a lot of the game and it brought me back to the creepy feelings I experienced in F.E.A.R.\n\nThe sound is beautiful in the game and the graphics are amazing for an indie title, but I highly recommend tweaking the contrast and color settings to bring a little bit of color back into the world, because the monotone black and white detracts from the lovely visuals. The only caveat is there is no voice acting whatsoever, and the game is heavy with dialogue. I myself didn't mind this but it is a shame to see a complete lack of voice acting.\n\nThe dialogue and storyline are solidly written and some of the conversations were heartbreaking while others were downright hilarious, so the writers have done an excellent job, I won't spoil the ending or the plot but I do feel the main plot was a little underdeveloped and not explained as well as it could have been, however the overall storyline and setting are leagues better than most story based games I've played, so if you want a story with as much depth as a decent novel or film, give this a shot.\n\n\n\nBetrayer isn't amazing, but it shows lots of potential and is probably one of the better indie games to be released recently.\n7/10, this game is underrated, but it isn't perfect.

This game was made by 6 (and 1/2?) people, and yes it has rough edges but the devs continue to patch it and even with the bugs, it is quite an experience.\n\nCombat is tough, almost Dark Souls tough in-fact.

(Like to see you load a early colonial pistol/musket in two seconds)\n\nGraphical presentation is great. Yes you can give the game color, but you should at least give the default a go, really works well.\n\nGameplay is fun as you explore the area, helping investigate wraiths deaths and try to find out that the hell is going on.\n\nOnly few complaints is there isn't much variation, go to a town, get objectives, fight and don't die, complete investigation, repeat.

It has the same slow, tense atmosphere and requires you to think about each enemy encounter, instead of rushing in weapons blazing. Enemies do a lot of damage and your healing item is minimal for most of the game, so you have to attack from a distance or sneak in an backstab a couple enemies first. The variety of weapons is really useful for multiple playstyles: muskets. pistols, and explosives do more damage, and help you survive when you accidentally attract the attention of a mob, and your knife, bows, and tomahawk are *mostly* silent and help you get stealth kills.\n\nThe black, white, and red aesthetic was actually really engaging and improved immersion for me, but don't worry, there is a really simple option to play it in full color if that's not your thing. What's even more interesting about the atmosphere in this game is that it incorporates a Silent Hill-esque mechanic of dark and light "worlds" that have different enemies and quests.\n\nThe storyline is fairly good, but I wouldn't say it is amazing. The theme of "betrayal" (I see what you did there Blackpowder Games) is consistent throughout the game and there are many smaller stories interwoven into the primary narrative, however, after the first two maps, whenever I spoke to a character that had a quest for me, I could already predict what evil "twist" would occur in his/her paricular story. Furthermore, I feel that the player-character really doesn't have much motivation at all and ffter playing it all the way through, I don't even know why he's there! All that being said, the story is genuingely creepy and "messed up."\n\nI only have a few criticisms for this game. The first is how repetitive it gets right before the end: the enemies don't really change much, so while combat is still fun, it's the same kind of fun, over and over. Even if the frequency of enemies increased, or if the types of enemies were mixed together in close proximity this would present new challenges. Ideally, I would have like to see three more enemy types: 2 for the "dark world" and 1 for the "light world," but I realize that this is an indie title, and there's onyl so much you can do. Also, there is a certain item that let's you dig up these rock piles you find throughout the game, and these piles have some of the best weapons in the game. Unfortunately, by the time you get these awesome weapons, you are near the end, so your need for them is really minimal. It would be nice to get this item halfway through the game. Finally, finding treasure chests and items is really tedious. You simply march out into the forest, wandering aimlessly, until you hear treasure (treasure chests emit a whistling sound). The problem is, you can literally wander around for an hour on one map to find all of the items! Something as simple as a mark on the map when you find a treasure would have made it go quicker, so I don't backtrack to places I've already searched.\n\nAll that being said, this game is still chock full of crazy, tense, scary, challenging, shooting, stabbing, sniping, sneaking fun!

"Investigations" are essentially that.  A means of unvieling a series of (pretty damn good) short stories to the player mixed in with some combat and exploration.\n\nThe art design and sound are well done, and generate an appropriately spooky and haunting atmosphere.  Being able to tune the amount of stylization was a good choice by the developer.  I'll admit I was initially interested in the game because of the stark black, white, and red color scheme, but as I played I turned it to the more realistic color scheme.  This only affects the daylight sections of the game.  The night time is trichrome no matter the settings, balancing out the day sections.\n\nThe combat is surprisingly ok, but a little more feedback on your health would have been nice, as I died often without really realizing how injured I was.\n\nI would have appreciated if the stories were tied to the enviroment a little more.  Enviromental story telling is what videogames can really excell at, and while I can tell the developer made an effort to do that, I can only wish they had more time and a bigger budget to really flush out the world and details.\n\nMr. Skeltal Approves.  8/10","May 11","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I won't lie, neither the story or the gameplay are spectacular, but the atmosphere and general aesthetic of the game are what keeps you playing. I haven't felt so immersed in a long time, a lot of other games just lose my attention quickly, but Betrayer kept it long enough to finish it all in two sittings.\n\nStory? It did have me curious, but there was a lot of filler keeping you from what you want to really know, but it isn't thrown in your face so I can't complain, most of it is optional. The ending did feel kinda cheap, but had shock factor at the same time.\n\nGameplay? About 80% of the game is following your ears to move from one objective to the other, essentially one huge fetch quest, but the journey is riddled with enemies and the combat is actually really damn satisfying. You'll be using bows, firearms and my personal favourite: tomahawks, to dispatch opponents that get increasingly difficult. It felt like playing Far Cry 3 with the bow and having to be stealthy.\n\nDesign? The graphical style is amazing, I'm in love with it. The unique style may take some getting used to, but it really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Don't like it? Then you can disable it and go full colour in the settings.

Mainly you go around the map to find clues, after finding them, conversation options "get unlocked" and you can talk to spirits to solve their problems which torture them and keeps them from departing. Sound is very important since there is no "questmarker"; the game offers you a "Listen"-button, when pressed, you will hear a sound leading you to the direction of points of interests.\n\nEnemies: Since this is kinda a stealthy game, enemies are very strong and should be killed without being detected. But in late game you (if you were busy searching), you might find powerful weapons which usually 1-hit them.\n\nStory/Atmosphere: Unique black & white, only the Red Maiden and Enemies are drawn in a bright red dye making them easy recognizable.

This didn’t stop me enjoying it, mind.\n\nThe game is set on an unnamed island in the year 1604, which has been taken over by “corrupted Conquistadors”, as well as various other nasties.  You quickly meet a girl, whose name is unknown to both of you, who claims she has been trapped on the island for quite some time.  She warns you about the dangers within, but obviously, if I were to turn back towards the sea, that wouldn’t be very interesting.  So, ♥♥♥♥ you red-hooded lady, I’m staying.\n\nThe game reminds me of what little I’ve heard about Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, insofar as that everyone on the island has ♥♥♥♥ed off somewhere, leaving only ghostly remains who serve little more than to tell you what went on.  The game injects very little personality into these beings, resulting in me quickly switching off to what was being said (or, read, because there is no voice acting) and just skipping dialogue.\n\nHowever, the game’s combat features quite an interesting mechanic.  There is a pseudo stealth system in place, meaning you are able to silently take out enemies from a distance when a gust of wind blows.  Being set in grassy fields and forests, this makes perfect sense given that for the most part you will be killing enemies with a bow, although you can also get your hands on a crossbow, musket and pistol.  The last two are, needless to say, quite loud, and will not mask your approach.  The wind sound effect is also very nice, might I add.\n\nThe enemies themselves aren’t too bright.  They will run at you until they are within their preset range to be able to attack you, meaning that you can easily kite them until you’ve twatted enough arrows into them to have them fall down.  The game also features a “dark world” mechanic, wherein you ring a bell and ♥♥♥♥ goes all dark.  In this dark world, among other changes, the standard enemies are replaced by spooky, scary skeletons, which send shivers down your spine.  Mechanically, they are not much different to the Conquistadors, and less visually striking.\n\nSpeaking of visuals, the game has a stunning art style.  In fact, it has multiple art styles.  By default, the game is high contrast duotone, apart from reds (yes, like Sin City).  Is there a name for that art style?  Maybe.  Anyway, if you don’t like that style, then you are very similar to me.  However, you are in fact able to change it in the settings, with separate sliders for contrast, saturation and brightness.  The only other game I can think of that lets you do that is Serious Sam 3 and Skyrim with mods.  More games need this feature, it’s a great customisation option.  I highly recommend you enable full colour in this game, it looks fantastic with it.\n\nThe game mainly consists of collecting bits of paper with words on them, finding tombstones with words on them and treasure chests with all sorts in them.  Also some story happens which ends abruptly (I think?) when you’ve done enough stuff that the red hooded girl remembers her name.  Then that’s sort of it.  You wander off and carry on collecting.  No real climax, no credits, no cutscene.  Nada.  This didn’t bother me much, but did leave me a tad perplexed.  Perhaps there’s an Arkahm-esque special super ending for collecting all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the game.  I might find that out, one day.\n\nSo, yeah, the game is about a man on an island with a girl, and you find stuff and there’s exposition in there somewhere.  It’s all a bit aimless, but the nice looking environments and collectathon nature of things was actually enough to keep me interested.","November 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","7"

And the dark world's atmosphere takes the creepy into overdrive.\n\nOverall this is a highly recommended game. The exploration is fun, the atmosphere is perfect and the sound based gameplay is refreshing and does a lot for the immersion. Some might complain the weapons are clunky as hell and they'd be right, but that's sort of the point, you are using 17th century muskets and pistols.

I highly recommend it.  It's a masterpiece.  The story, the graphics, the sound and atmosphere.  It’s amazing.  This is art.\n\nThings to Know\nI played on easy, so as to not loose my loot.  The game is not a cakewalk.\nDon’t mess with the color options, play in B&W.  It's worth it and will immerse you in the atmosphere and sound.\n144Hz is available through some file editing.  Steam has a guide on this. Link\nThe game does have a demo.\nPros\nThis is a really cool setting: you are in the Americas during the spanish colonial period.  Think natives, muskets, forts, etc.\nI was very interested in the developing relationship between my character and the girl in the red hood.\nThe game’s concept, that you are releasing troubled souls, is very interesting.\nA great story.  I was actually interested in these people’s lives.  That’s a hard thing to do in video games where the player is encouraged to go straight away to the next task.\nThe graphics are amazing!  I was fortunate to run the game on high/ultra with 60-100 fps on an i5 and GTX 980; it looked incredible.  Don’t mess around with the color, leave it black and white, trust me.\nThe sound is equally amazing.  Hearing the crickets chirp, the wind blow, the native’s chants in the distance . . . .  The subtle and perfectly placed music.  Whoever did the sound on this game deserves an award.  I would genuinely like to meet them.\nThis game is scary, definitely puts me on edge.  Requires an extra dose of anxiety medicine.\nThe fighting is unique too.  A first person shooter game, but your weapons are muzzleloading black powder pistols and muskets, or the optional bow and arrow.  Very fun and different\nThe enemies are varied, different, and thrilling.\nExcellent save system; pretty much save when you want.\nGood stealth system.  Stealth makes the game easier if you have patience but it is not required.\nPacing is just right, the game starts out fun and just gets better.\nPretty stable game.\nCons\nThe game will run at 144hz, if you edit some files on your PC.  Why wasn’t that just built into the options?\nAll of the firearms have an odd pointing to them, it looks like they are aiming at the sky.\nSome of the sound effects, like when a bullet hits an enemy's armor, sound like they are from a 1960's western.  I think this is a stylized choice.\nThe ending felt somewhat anti-climatic.\nI would like to see a little more weapon variety.  A crude pistol looks identical to an excellent pistol.","December 5, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/recommended/243120/","Allahweh","Allahweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/","299 products in account","Betrayer is a unique game that walks the line between a first-person adventure game (with some light FPS elements) and a horror game. There are a few moments of pseudo jump-scares, but most of the "creepy factor" for this game comes from the loneliness of the environment and the idea of being lost and alone in a strange land. The graphics are incredibly realistic (for some reason, I just love the wind-animations against the trees!), and I think the game shines graphically in the normal colored mode, though I think the black-and-white format does provide a nice aesthetic that does have gameplay advantages (enemies, chests, and other important things are a shiny red that stands out against the bleak look).\n\nI really like the fact that the game has such an interesting setting. The idea of finding yourself alone and in a dangerous environment is cool enough, but I like the fact that the game is set in 1604 in colonial Virginia. It just feels different from most other survival horror or adventure games I've played. The developers also did a good job capturing the looks for buildings and objects of the period, and the weaponry is pretty accurate for early-17th century technology.\n\nSometimes, the goals of an "area" are less clear than you might hope. The maps are very large, so a lot of exploration is necessary. This could be a turn off for some, but I always enjoyed lurking through the brush and finding something lore-related I had missed while trying to flee for my life earlier from enemies.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you are looking for a first-person shooter type of experience, although this game has elements of one, it likely won't fully scratch that itch for you. Thus, I'd recommend it for someone who digs the idea of a survival horror/adventure game set in a different environment with a compelling mystery to solve and some wonderful graphics.\n\nHonestly, I'd say it's worth the asking price, though the game also frequently appears in bundles as well, for what that's worth. =)\n\nOn a scale from 0 to 10, with 5 being a "true average," I'd give this game an:\n\n-----------------------------------\nVERY GOOD...... 8 / 10\n-----------------------------------","June 30, 2015","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The player is set to a part of Colonial America where the horrific truths remain undiscovered. The game world is open area in each section which allow player to collect clues and search for better gear to survive from relentless world.\n\nThe gameplay is about collecting clues and conducting investigations to learn the past of lost souls. Thus, it will reveal the truth behind the colony. Thanks to Blackpowder Games, who had worked on games F.E.A.R. for creating of two different worlds that allow player to switch and play major role to solve the puzzles. The silent New World is full of hostile conquistadores and Native American warriors while The Otherworld presents you an uncomfortable and depressed world as it stripped with black-white and red to indicate the important stuffs. It looks stylish and serves well on game theme, but you can adjust color saturation if it’s not your taste.\n\nThe combat is simple FPS game, even on normal difficult. The enemies are deadly and straightforward in AI pattern. You need to take them out quickly which force player to use bow most of the time or rely on inconsistent stealth mechanic.\nThere’s no voice narrative, all you need is to read from scarp papers to gain information and seeking for right NPC. The map marker and smart fast travel are useful enough to avoid player lost in track.\n\nOverall, Betrayer offers a short but impressive experience with unsetting and strong atmosphere.

The first hour or so, it was pretty entertaining. The graphics are stark, morose and creepy (very befitting the story). The story and setting start out very compelling. The soundtrack is subtle. The gameplay relies on stealth-based combat.\n\nUnfortunately, most of this begins to wear thin the more you play. The graphics eventually become a strain on the eyes, as you try to squint and find a flash of red in the repetative black and white landscape (which can be confusing, as the enemies are usually red, but so are certain small plants/flowers). The soundtrack becomes dull, as all you hear is the sound of the wind and the odd growl from the monsters roaming the map. The combat is repetative and boring, widly going from one-shot easy kills to mobs that kill you in a few hits. The weapons are limited to bow, crossbow, pistol, musket, rifle and melee (with sub-weapons like tomahawk and bomb), but are very clunky to use (rotating between them should be smooth, but turns out awkward and sometimes doesn't work at all) and the variety within said weapons is small. The gameplay gets boring, very fast.\n\nThe setting gets dull as you notice there is very little difference between the zones. Trees, long grass, and the odd small fort/camp. The stealth mechanic is pretty bad, as you are caught between walking (the enemies see you easily), running (the enemies see you very easily) and sneaking (the enemies shouldn't see you, but mostly do unless you're at a far distance).\n\nOverall, it felt like this could have been a great game, but just missed its mark.","June 4, 2015","false","4.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Buy it on sale if you like chores and nonsensical conclusions to unengaging stories.\n\nA tad harsh, perhaps. The game isn't entirely devoid of fun, after all. The combat and weapons are entirely serviceable, and the environments can be quite pretty.\nThe game starts off pretty well, too, with a setting somewhat uncommon to games (Early seventeenth-century America,) a sense of dread, and a large area to explore.\n\nYour character (Unnamed) starts the game washed  ashore with no memory of who he is or what he was doing, aside from sailing on a doomed ship. Finding these things out is your earliest motivation as a player. You will not find these things out.\n\nUpon meeting the only other living character in the game, you will find a map detailing the precise location of every item in the game, as well as an item which will allow you to hear spooky sounds which lead you to anything important not on the map. Suddenly, you are no longer exploring a vast and haunted forest, but running errands from point A to point B.\n\nThe first enemies you encounter in the game are red-eyed monsters in conquistador armor. They're fast enough to outpace you, should you be spotted, and strong enough to kill you in a few hits. And you will be spotted, more often than not, as their senses are keen. Their armor can occasionally deflect the arrows from your bow, the only weapon you have at the beginning of the game. Obviously, engaging them in combat is a bad idea. You are encouraged to sneak around them, and give them a wide berth. This is the best part of the whole game. The animalistic sound these things make when they spot you is probably one of the more memorable "Oh, ♥♥♥♥!" moments in recent memory. Fantastic.\nIt doesn't last. You will very quickly find a small arsenal for yourself in these woods. Within the first hour of the game I had two primitive firearms and a tomahawk, with which I tore through these poor saps like wet tissue paper.\nStronger enemies did eventually appear, yes, but not before I had the equipment to eviscerate them. The remainder of the game is spent with more of a hope for danger than a sense of it.\n\nEnemy design is nice enough. A zombie conquistador here, a skeleton with red eyes there. Nothing to write home about overall... with one exception. I will admit to a great appreciation for one late-game enemy design. A ghost, made up of a thick black swarm of insects with two long, skeletal hands and a silver skull floating over them. I love that thing.\nI mean, you can kill it in one hit, but it certainly looks cool!\n\nSo, now that we've established that the enemies won't be much to fear, where else can we get our horror fix here? Well... nowhere, really. Not in the "I'm afraid of this thing" or the "Please get me out of here" ways, anyway. Your character's goal in the game, the chore list I mentioned earlier, is to find the remains of settlers around the forest, find clues as to how they died, and bring their spirits closure. Now that I've typed that out, I realize that it sounds pretty flipping sweet. Sadly, it's not. It's excrutiatingly boring.\nEvery mystery is solved by following your map to every item and ghost listed on it, and every spirit put to rest in a  brief dialogue tree. It's somewhat interesting at first, but by the end every ghost's story blends together, and their characterization so thin that I could not relate or sympathize with them.\n"Yes, yes, you were a terrible murderer/♥♥♥♥♥♥ and/or tragic murder victim/♥♥♥♥ victim, I'm sure your passing was very sad. Now, hurry your ♥♥♥ up to the great beyond, I've things to do."\nAnd, yes, that's where the game's horror lays, with much ♥♥♥♥, murder, and betrayal. It wears quickly.\nEach ghost's story ties to others in their section of the forest, and each section's story ties into the greater plot. Which is great, on paper. Sadly, writing the plot on to paper would result in a page primarily composed of fluff, with maybe a paragraph of interest and a quick nonsensical sentence to wrap it up. So many ghosts end up playing such small roles in the story that you're left only to wonder why so much of the game was dedicated to them. Entire sections of the game could have been cut, and I'd only have been thankful it took less of my time.\n\nThe ending has quite the twist, too! The twist is that there is no ending.\n\nAnd no, not in a Twilight Zone-style "Eternal personal Hell" way, either. The game has no ending.","October 27, 2015","false","13.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","8","13","5","0"

The main characters task is to go around as mundane exorcist Sherlock Homes who help wraiths come to terms with the horrible murder/♥♥♥♥/suicide they or a loved one committed. excluding the wraiths the only other interactable npc is little red riding hood who appartently has amnesia and a twin sister. The interactions with her are very bare bones and seem absolutely pointless as the game seems more focused on her than you. There is no music or dialogue/speech sounds in the entire game making things feel unfinished, it does add to the creepy factor though. I will admit the game did catch me off gaurd with a few creepy/scary moments. One thing i did enjoy was the introduction of new enemies for the first three stages which helped spice things up, but then things became stale again. There is major repitition in each level involving finding ghosts and objects then using said objects to trigger the memories of the ghosts so that they can forgive themsevles for murdering their friends/loved ones. You do this for every area over and over again, rinse and repeat. By the time you get to the last stage it was my wits end over the difficulty and frustration in the last fight. To top it all off the ending leaves you feeling betrayed and almost robbed of your time playing through this game. I wasnt able to see how great of a game this is but if you are still dead set on buying it I would recommend buying it during a steam sale or humble bundle as I do not think it is worth the full price.","April 8","false","9.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

Nobody buys a game just to collect items.\n\nThe game has 7 areas, and in each area you just collect, collect & collect, to progress through the game you need to get rid of corruption by fighting "A" wave of monsters and there's usually only about 5-6 minimum,(you do this about 3-4 per areas) not that difficult.

It has been a very long time that a first person game has filled me with such dread and I am fully decked out with bows and arrows, crossbows, flintlocks, and tomahawks! It is amazing what a small team was able to accomplish especially with regards to the audio. The hisses of restless spirits, creaking of the walking dead, the groans of marauding Conquistadors, and the whistling of "naturals" create a soundscape where every encounter is filled with great risk and peril. Exploration can be very rewarding resulting in the discovery of loot of all types.\n\nThe art style is excellent. While the graphics aren't gorgeous, what's there is impressive be it English log cabins, native straw huts, varied geometry in the terrain, and well animated adversaries. I felt like I was taking a hike in the twilight zone, even using rocks and foilage to hide from my foes to ambush them with throwing axes and a hail of arrows. Heck I'd channel Natty Bumpo and fire off one of my many muskets to draw attention to myself. The AI is decent even if simplistic. Enemies will try to turn you into a human porcupine, hack you to bits, rend flesh with claws, lodge razer sharp bones into your flesh, or blast you with unholy bolts. Trust me, they're not trying to hug you!\n\nWhat I didn't like was how annoying it was to go about discovering chests. Sure there's a chiming sound when you get close to an object of interest and they glow or blink red form afar, but in all seriousness I often overlooked things. An enterprising player collaborated with other explorers to take a screen shot of the map of each region with a legend of points of interest like loot. I love treasure! Even though I love the audio, the game is best played with headphones or a good surround set up. Even then I suggest on turning on visualization of audio cues. Running around spamming the "listen" button wasn't too much fun.\n\nCombat is simplistic and felt suprisingly authentic. Except for the ultra accurate smoothbore flintlocks. Yeah their range was relatively far, but the dude you're playing as fires accurately and loads like a man possesed (or on drugs). Not that I'm complaining too much, in RL (real-life) it takes roughly thirty seconds to get your muzzle loaded musket ready for firing and that's if nobody's shooting at you, there's no yelling, or people trying to stab you with bayonets (which weren't invented yet). A lack of spear toting and halberd wielding enemies was a bit suprising, but a dagger is still plenty deadly. Things get easier with the discovery of new weapons my favorite being the crossbow. If you get decent at leading enemies and catch them before they enter melee the game isn't quite a breeze, but it's rewarding to keep cool under pressure.\n\nAll in all I'd give the game an 8/10. A bigger budget and more staff would have made this diamond in the rough into a gem.","April 7, 2014","true","54.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphics is like Skyrim with the added fog/lightning effect that intensify the "mystery/thrill/horror" effect.\n\n2. The black/white is a funny way to add into that, and it works.\n\n3. I said this is horror/thriller-ambient instead of horror is because there is no jumpscare unlike Amnesia.\n\n4. There is no holding hand on what to do/how to fight but it's pretty simple. You are exploring around to find out what to do. To fight, you can either go melee (I advice against), with gun (loud), with bow (stealth). Stealth is important in this game unless you want to die more than you should\n\n5. The game is open world, means you can explore whatever you want. There is fast travel too.\n\n6. Overall it's a great game worth $20. The game creates the feeling that you're in this unknown place full of unknowns and that's why you want to explore. Once you solved something you still don't really know what just happened therefore you want to explore more to find what is going on.\n\nMore (WARNING SPOILER)\n\n- Your guy has a level 100 Sneak. You can sneak around anything easily as long as you stay in darkness. You can also stay in the light within a certain (5-10m) distance from enemy and they won't notice you.\n- Your guy also have level 100 Backstab. You can backstab anything except stuff that are twice your size, making combat a joke as long as you've played any stealthy game before (Thief series, Dishonored, Skyrim as Thief)\n- Dying has no real punishment because all you drop is gold, and the dropped gold can be retrieved back as long as you don't die before you pick it up.\n- The enemies respawn too if you die but this can be avoided by playing smart. E.g. if you have spent all your gold then you have nothing to fear, just run around to gather intel e.g. approximate number of enemies, their location, etc then you come back to backstab them.\n- Don't open any chest until you clear out most of the area. Reason: You only need gold to upgrade weapon/trinkets (give passive ability) which is expensive. Majority of weapon/trinket are 200-500 gold, enemies drop 4 gold, and chest give you 25-40 gold. In an area there are only 20 enemies while there are 10 chests. Therefore majority of gold come from chest. You risk dying when clearing out an area. Therefore if you don't open any chest until you clear out an area you minimze the risk of losing gold.","March 28, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most of what I'm experiencing is a tense atmosphere with the occasional pants crapping moments. The limitations on weapons adds a very real feeling element to it.\n\nAs far as length goes, I have been at it for just over 3 hours at the time of this writing, and I'm still in the first area, and from the size of the map, I'm guessing 12+ hours easy.\n\nControls are solid, response is rather good for all movement. I'm using a controller and it can be a bit weird at times on menus and such, obviously put in as an afterthought, but it is not truly bad and is in no way a game breaker. The controller has always been great otherwise.\n\nI highly recommend this game and I also recommend you play using headphones (sound is a huge deal in this game) and on the default color settings. The tension seems to lessen a bit when it's all bright and happy, though that might be a good thing for some players...","March 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Later on we will have the opportunity to travel to a the dead world which is incredible, the lights and shadows creating an atmospheric feeling that sadly being ruined by the clumsy enemy animations, which brings back memories from the games of 2000's. In fact they are terrible. Perhaps the biggest problem is  the lack of music, not to mention the lame enemy, and the non-existing conversation voices. Thats not why i like it. Rather because of the engaging story, witnessing the life and deciding the fate of the dead people at the land of endless horrors makes the whole event so personal.\n\nThe game is good overall, achievements are working, and the Dev crew is so nice and helpful, despite of that, it is not yet recommended to buy before sale.","August 21, 2014","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you set forth to reach the nearest colony you realise that something is amiss: deserted colonies, deranged conquistadors and scattered corpses are a gruesome welcome for our protagonist. He soon finds himself a companion of sorts, a woman all clad in red, that will not fight his foes, but will be what little solace he may find in such bereft land, offering a chance for interaction and some sort of guide that helps you remember, to some extent, the humanity of your character.\n\nThat is not to say that she will be the only opportunity for interaction you shall find, for there is the "Other World", a parallel, twisted alternate reality of our world is there for you to access; when you are in there you can find lost souls, astray and forlorn. It is your job to help them remember their identity, and make them relive their last, darkest of hours, to piece their past and get to understand what destiny befell the colonists.\n\nAnd that is where Betrayer truly shines: in order to piece together the various clues and information you must make various forays into the other world, as well as in ours. It is so seamlessly integrated that you go back and forth without ever feeling like it is being imposed in any way, rather, it feels as a logical path. The non-linear and open world nature of the game does help in this regard. Moreover, you find totems scattered all over the place, some of them corrupted; approaching these in the Other World triggers a fight with some guardians, and upon completion will leave the area less populated with foes, making your exploration easier.\n\nAs for combat, the Other World has its own share of creatures, creepier than their real world counterparts, and deadlier. In there you may fight spectres, skeletons, and some other creatures. That is not to say that the real world is easy by any means. You have to employ stealth, cunning and skill to survive in the environment, hiding in the bushes, waiting to strike at unwary conquistadors and indians, using the sound of wind to cover your footsteps.\n\nWeapons are SERVICEABLE; they are the game's weakest portion by far. They  feel half-finished, lacking the "oomph" of a proper weapon. No crossbow thud, no arrow whoosh, no musket/pistol detonation feels powerful enough. They do decent damage, though, they just lack the right feel.\n\nGraphics are alright. The game uses the unreal engine, and it does show in the grass and some textures. Yet the character's hands seem taken out of some 2007 game. They are alright, just not what you would expect of a 2014 game. It is worth mentioning that the game is in black and white by default, and it plays beautifully that way, far more immersive. That being said, you can tune the game and give it as much colour as Oblivion's palette, but it will lose its grim charm.\n\nTo sum up, a compelling story, an excellent and captivating gameplay and a charming (and eerie!) atmosphere are sure to make Betrayer a game you shall not soon forget.\n\nAll in all, I would highly reccomend this: 8.5.","March 31, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is an unsettling adventure with lots of tragic stories to uncover and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it.\n\nBy just looking at the gameplay videos, you can tell that the game is very heavy on atmosphere. The world has an eerie feeling to it and from the very beginning you know that something went very wrong here. The first time you are transported to the shadow realm, I guarantee some nerve-racking moments. Betrayer's setting is great because while you might not find many enemies, the tension is always kept very high. It is horror done right, not with cheap jumpscares but an atmosphere that is undoubtely chilling.\n\nIt also doesn't help that your weapons are true to the game's 17th century setting. If you thought that evading screaming skeletons and floating skulls wasn't enough, then imagine frantically reloading your muskets and pistols that use gunpowder.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand along the way and this is a very positive aspect in the age of dumbed-down game design. There is no objective marker, just a "listen" button that vagely gives you an audio cue about where to go next. This greatly helps immersion and you truly feel like a helpless chap among mysteries and monsters.\n\nOverall, I can easily recommend Betrayer to people who enjoy a refreshing, immersive experience in a unique setting. I really hope that the developers will continue this story with an expansion at least and this is a very rare thing for me to say!\n","March 27, 2015","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Muskets and pistols from 17th century acts like they should and your hero is not the commandos with magical autohealing.\nIt's not an average modern stealth action. If you can hear the enemy or see him from hundred meters away - so does he; they're not deaf and blind as it trended in stealth games nowadays. Enemies are smart but reckless, they'll track you down almost always, even if you'll run from them to the other end of the map.\n\nI was sceptical when got heard about this "open-world horror action". But the atmosphere of the game is really great - mysterious and grim, even in the bright daylight. I highly recommend to play this game in original black-white-red palette - your eyes will bleed, but it's worth it.\nSound is also a big part of ambience and it's awesome: wind, birds, trees and grass, weapons, ****ed-up Spaniards, skeletons and wraiths. It'll sounds crazy, but lack of voice acting is not a flaw in this case - it makes the game even more surrealistic.\n\nTotally worth the full price (but I grabbed it with -80% at Summer Sale).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/243120/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","A very boring, uninteresting game that left me highly disappointed as well as angered by its terrible mechanics and design.\n\n\nBetrayer was a game that I good expectations for back when it was in early access and I bought into the beta for 13.49 usd (the game was originally 14.99 on steam when I bought it.)\n\nThe game, at the time, seemed promising. It was taking on an interesting art directive. This following description of the beginning of the game is still accurate in the final product.\n\nYou enter into a blighted land that's void of color with the exception of the color red. While you proceed inland, a woman fires an arrow at a post with a note attached. Telling you to leave this land for it is cursed and lest you desire to be trapped here too, you should make haste away from the land. Building up atmosphere, you look around you and the winds howl, the trees and leaves rustle violently creating a very ominous feeling of living in a corrupt land driven mad. You continue down the winding path only to be stopped by another arrow hitting a post near you. It tells you to take the bow near you and arrows. The creatures who dwell in the lands are spirits of people who once lived there, now insane, they skulk the lands, only to be thrown into a murderous frenzy should they see any living soul who wanders this place.\n\nYou will need to kill them. She tells you to aim for their heads and use the wind to mask the noise of your arrow, and your kill. Now. For starters. This is one of the first problems i've encountered in this game. The mechanic of using the wind to mask your... ANYTHING. Doesn't work, ever. It doesn't mask footsteps, even if you're crouched and hardly moving. It doesn't mask arrows, grenades, crossbow arrows, musketshots, thrown handaxes, pistol shots. It's a faulty mechanic that doesn't exist at all. The wind is just wind, it has absolutely no gameplay value except contributing to atmopshere.\n\nAnd then we get into the next part. A lot of the weapons in this game accordingly have a low reflect chance. Meaning if you shoot an enemy or throw a projectile at them, it has a "small" chance of reflecting. At least that's what it says on paper. But in reality, the reflection rates in this game are stupidly high. It's pretty common for enemies to reflect your attacks. Your arrows, your bullets, and sometimes even handaxes.\n\nAnd that's where we get into the next part of the bad enemy design/weapon design as well as player mechanics. In this game, you'll take a lot of damage from enemies from one blow. Though alternatively, assuming you're aiming for the head, all enemies die very quickly, usually in 1 or 2 blows to the head, and about 4 or 5 if you're fighting a captain demon (except grenades one-shot everything including boss-like monsters).\n\nSo anyways. You'll quickly assume in this game you're supposed to play it very stealthily. Avoiding conflict, sneaking around foes. Attack only when you absolutely have to-except that's not how it works at all. For some reason, all of the enemies in this game seem to have pin-point knowledge of where you are. I've had many times where enemies are charging at me from far down the field and I have no clue how they saw me, heard me. And this is inconsistent too, sometimes you'll just have enemies who know exactly where you are from a little over half a football fields distance, and then enemies who'll not know you're extremely close to them, at nearly pick-pocketing distance.\n\nI think the worse part is that all the enemies in this game will simply just charge you. They'll run up to you and get in your face and quickly kill you. Which is stupid, you have sometimes freaking squadrons of men just charging at you. And for how slow the reload times are for guns, and the deflect chance on arrows. You'll be standing there like an idiot constantly firing arrow's they'll just deflect or reloading a gun while they hack your bloody limbs off.\n\nthough it doesn't stop there, it gets better. It's an entirely liable strategy to lead a mob of enemies to a barrel of water and then iterally stand next to a barrel full of water (because barrels of water replenish all of your health and give you 3-4 potions that replenish your health by 40 points out of 100 total health) and just strafe around and reload your guns/fire them and shoot arrows and then pick them up and fire them again at the enemies until they all die while you keep drinking from a barrel of water. This is literally the only strategy I could find that was functional to actually take over a few stronghold positions in the game. The difficulty is otherwise impossible for the mechanics of the weapons you're using.\n\n\nSo i'm going to halt there and go back to the atmosphere.\n\nSo in this game after you leave the tutorial area. You enter the world and proceed up a path to a abandoned village full of people turned to ashen figures. You won't find much in the village save for a bell. You'll place a bell on its bellpost and you'll ring it. Once you do this, a loud sound resounds from the bell and you enter the dark world, the place where demons wander. And the game sets the tone for what they want of the dark world. A shadowy place where unspoken horrors echo deep within the blackened foggy haze, you will hear screams in the fog, but you and a courageous foot will have to proceed forward into the haze. But i'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nYou'll pick up a dismembered eye, ear, and tongue in the village. To allow you to see, hear, and talk to spirits in the dark world. This is assumingly, where your investigation begins. To figure out what happened to the people here who lived here before these lands became cursed.\n\nBut i'm going to ruin everything for you right now, because there's absoultely ♥♥♥♥ing nothing. I streamed this game for several hours on twitch.tv and I can tell you that there seems to be absolutely no story here. Nothing is explained, everything you meet and talk to is just people who died painfully normal deaths in the real world in the time period it takes place. And for that I mean being killed in a battle with natives, a person was killed so the killer wouldn't be found out as a traitor, natural death from disease, suicide from depression over a loss, there's even a person who commited suicide by accident because they didn't know how guns work and accidentally shot themselves in the head.\n\nNothing contributes to whatever story there is in this game, it's just fetch quests, and you have these incredibly boring conversations. That basically sound like this.\n\n"I don't know who I am."\n"Were you killed by this gun?"\n"Yes."\n"You are Alvar Thompson."\n"Oh yeah, I am."\n"What happened?"\n"Oh, my son died and I got really depressed so I killed myself."\n"Okay."\n"Yup."\n\nAnd that's it. Sometimes there's "more" to the story, and it's just more fetch quests and finding out why they're dead. The best part is that after you find out everything there is to learn about someone. You report to the girl who was firing arrows at the post back at the village (She's only there in this land cause she's looking for her twin sister.) and then you just give the like, murder weapon or a memento of the person who died, as a gift to her. And you get 4 options and none of which contribute to the story. And you learn nothing about her.\n\nI've hit my character limit, so i've deleted a lot of text to type this and the below. I will post a video review of this game in the future wrapping up my points about this game.\n\nAnyways, this game is riff raff and you should stay away from it. Even at 4.99 usd, this game is a waste of money. The atmosphere and gameplay as well as story are all bullocks and a waste of time.\n\nSorry for my incomplete review, but I hope to some degree that the text provided will help you in your decision in buying this product.

The mood in this game is perhaps the best I've seen from any game in recent memory. For a game about 17th century Virginia, it's also the closest game I can relate to Silent Hill 2, which is the highest of compliments.

A nice blend, i'd say. And completely corresponding to what was promised - an FPS action, an adventure and a horror game in one piece.\nThe set of monsters is poor, and the story-telling is a bit too schematic, besides you could think in the beginning that the game's world is too empty for a nice one. Skip the latter, as you will get enough mobs and skirmishing soon. As for the first too faults - it's an indi game, besides, all the little it does have has been made perfectly. Nice picture, fine controls, exhilarating fast-pased fighting, scary undead guys(ones in the beyond-the grave plane at least).  I don't remember myself paying so much emotional reaction to the undead from games or movies since distant times when i first visited the Crypt of Inubis and other places, inhabited by walking skeletons and zombies in Gothic 2 (for those who remember that feeling). So images, sounds and a bad habit to show up suddenly of the undead are quite all right here, scary enough to feel good :).\nMaybe the way the undead look and sound here are the main dignities of the game, disguising all it's lacks, they're definitely more than worth seeing and hearing for those who seek that kind of show.\nNot sure about the game's high replayability though, yet i've had a lot of what i wanted from a horror game during my first play through, and gonna try it another time later.\n-----------------------------------\nНезатейливая но, тем не менее, в своем роде и в своей весовой категории отличная игра.\nВнутриигровой набор занятий состоит из блуждания по лесам в реальном и потустороннем плане, поиска предметов и улик, необходимых для расследования предшествовавших появлению в этом мире игрока событий, разговоров с привидениями и стрельбы по нежити и злым духам. Короче, неплохая смесь.\nВ целом наблюдается полное соответствие списку: экшен от первого лица, адвенчер и хоррор.\nБестиарий несколько скудноват, и подача истории немного схематична, к тому же в начале игровой мир может показаться несколько излишне для хорошей игры пустоватым. Но последнее больше кажется, основное время игры будет достаточно плотно забито стычками с противником, а в рамках заявленных составляющих, с учетом того, что это инди проект, все сделано на отлично. Картинка красивая, управление удобное, стрелять весело, нежить жуткая(та которая в потустороннем плане). Насчет эмоционального восприятия последней - не помню, чтобы что-то из игровой или кинематографической нежити производило на меня такое же сильное впечатление со времен первого посещения мной склепа Инубиса и прочих пещер и углов с серьезной нежитью Готике2, если кто в курсе о чем речь. С качеством образов, озвучкой и внезапными появлениями у нежити тут все в полном порядке, положенную жуть наводит :).\nПожалуй изображение и озвучка нежити в потустороннем плане и есть главное достоинство игры, перекрывающее все ее недостатки, там реально есть на что посмотреть и что послушать по этой части.\nНе уверен насчет реиграбельности, но на первый раз точно не жалуюсь, и наверно потяну второй.","December 22, 2014","true","41.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I got sucked into the game for hours. The atmosphere is bone-chilling, the color deprivation is equivalent to removing of one's senses to enhance the reception of the other availalable ones, mainly the audio. However, there is a color saturation option if you want it, but I recommend keeping it off or very very low for the experience intended. The game's atmosphere is relied heavily upon the sound that I had become scared and jumpy on several occasions. There is an item in the game you need to help you find your path via sound. The path-finding sound is like a bunch of whispers that are heard from afar and are louder as you near it. It is audible when the item is used, but i shudder before I even press the button.\n\nThe games graphics are beautiful, thought some may say dated. I love the way the trees and grass move and the ambient lighting bounces off the environment. Sprite/Enemy models look a bit shoddy, but does not stray from the fear factor it gives me with animalistic sounds of beastly vehemency.

I don't know what I was expecting, really, but it certainly wasn't something so engrossing and well-written as this. It's a bit of a shame that the game overstays its welcome by a few hours, since the most fun I had was early on when I was figuring out the mechanics of this strange world and unraveling its mysteries. Later on, I often found myself just checking all the spots on the map in order to move on. However, I will say that the final map and its related investigation managed to bring back much of the game's initial charme and atmosphere. I just wish they had cut out some of the filler in the middle.\nEither way, though, as far as spooky indie games go, this is a big "Recommend", with the hopes for a tighter Betrayer II that focuses much more on the investigations.\n\nAlso, I noticed that many commenters have criticized the game's ending for being a letdown. I don't really agree. The ending (both in terms of plot resolution and gameplay) is pretty much in line with the rest of the game, in my opinion. .:very mild, nonspecific spoiler:.

I like the atmosphere (spooky!) but having a map that pretty much tells you where everything is and being forced to travel to locations twice (once in the normal mode and the second time in the alternate reality that the game allows you to switch to) seems like it is meant to drag the game on. The story seems interesting but the rather dull MMOFPS-like combat isn't doing it for me.\n\nThe weapons are rather interesting and require good aim. Fortunately and unfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks as it seems to get stuck behind objects a lot and gives up the chase when you run away.\n\nI immediately went into the colour correction menu after starting up the game as the black and white didn't do it for me at all. Kudos to the developer for allowing you to configure the game to your needs.\n\nI only played this for 20 minutes and already I realised that it was going to be one long haul of going here, doing that and bringing it back to base then going out again because something else needs a hauling. I couldn't recommend it as I generally do not enjoy these games, especially not when the combat is rather bland and the graphics rather outdated.\n\nOn top of that, the game expects you to apply some sort of stealth. Unfortunately, this Raptor doesn't do stealth. It also seems to needlessly drag the game on even longer as you are forced to move at a snail's pace.\n\nI am thinking this game would have been better off being a Doom 3 clone than making you walk around all over the place.

The spooky and somber atmosphere with its natural desaturated visuals (which can be changed in the options, but you really should at least play SOME of the game like this) ends up being very engaging. The game lacks any kind of voice acting, favoring solely text, and even music is absent from the game. Instead your soundtrack is the noises of the wildlife around you (birds and insects), the rustling of wind through grass and trees, and your own footsteps. The crisp clearness of sound makes even the sound effects stand out, the sound of an arrow shaft being drawn across the bow limb or filling the musket chamber with gunpowder... every sound is painstakingly focused as sound is the primary focus of this game. You'll have to use sound to locate your enemies, as well as extra items like treasure chests and journal pages.\n\nHunting down final collectibles in the end can get a bit tedious (namely the chests when they become far less useful to you) and most areas look very similar, if not identical, but can be easily overlooked. Even the terms of story take a more subdued approach, filled in with the journal pages you find (amongst other things that I won't spoil for you).\n\nBetrayer is not a run-and-gun sort of action game and typically requires more stealth approaches and a more reserved style of play, so if you like to take things slowly, the game will suit you perfectly.\n\nOverall, I rate Betrayer an 8.5/10. The beautiful sound effects and impressive visuas far outweigh any negatives.","November 9, 2014","true","77.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Others you have to warm up to. Honestly, Betrayer was a cold fish the first time I played it. It was slow, it was repetitive, and it just wasn't something I felt like spending time on. But I put in the time, and it didn't take long before I started getting to the meat beneath the tough exterior.\n\nYou awaken on a beach near a fort in the New World to find the place deserted and bestial conquistadors roaming the countryside. Your only friends are a mysterious lady in red, an equally mysterious merchant, and the sundry spirits haunting the fort and the wilderness. The game is assembled as an open-world mystery, where you are free to explore the VERY expansive map in search of answers, clues, trinkets, and gear scattered about. There's a great deal of walking to be done across the gorgeous environments, but there's a very handy and well-implemented fast travel system that cuts out some of the tedium.\n\nThere are a few kinds of foes to face as you explore, and care must be taken in handling them. It's an FPS with a major, MAJOR emphasis on stealth and intelligent approaches to fights. Enemies have basically the same field of vision as you do and will spot you from across fields and valleys. They're just as fast and just as wily about getting hit, and your weapons are limited in their utility. However, shadows and underbrush can hide your approach, gusts of wind can muffle your footsteps, and headshots kill far more effectively. Your bow will be your best friend for much of the game, but the flintlock pistols and muskets have their uses in dispatching single enemies efficiently. You also get a one-hit kill tomahawk with limited range and explosives for when you're feeling overwhelmed. Combat is an involved experience and can get a little repetitive when you really want to get somewhere, but mastering it is a rewarding experience.\n\nThe story is intriguing and should keep you moving forward to uncover more and more secrets about the mysterious world you find yourself in. Characters are well-written and there's a very useful journal which holds all your clues and profiles and investigations. There are plenty of items to find, including plot items, interesting trinkets, and equippable gear that improves your abilities. You'll also be helped along by some clever systems like listening for ghostly echoes to point you to places of interest. The sound design is excellent and important, so make sure you have good directional speakers or headphones for this one.\n\nAbove all, the atmosphere is top-notch. It's desolate and confounding despite the simple setting, and the graphics push it even further (and can be completely reconfigured, including playing in color, if you don't like them). Betrayer is not a hard game to play but it can be hard to get into, the way it marries open-world exploration and low-tech combat. It risks becoming repetitive at times, but it is most definitely worth experiencing.","September 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Over that time I was able to think what it was like, who it would appeal to.  The closest thing I could think was it was like playing an MMORPG, but with bad graphics, no leveling, less well designed weapons.  What it shares with an MMO is that you will do the same action over and over, you will cross the same terrain over and over, and you will travel from one area to the next just to shoot the same 3 enemies the entire time.  Also the enemies are stupid.  Like - run at you and hit kind of stupid. Yep! Just like an MMO.\n\nSo after you've completed your mandatory takss (90% of the time you will be running across the map activating a checkpoint or required script) you are paid back with a pathetic end, not a single cool cutscene nor explanation... the game just ends.\nUmmm positives...\nThe one music score was ok\nThe fast travel system was ok\nThe exposition was completely dull, so there's almost nothing to say with regards to it's delivery.

It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead described as "undeniably striking". The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map." - Wikipedia page for Betrayer\n\nBetrayer has a lot of great things going for it. Its art direction, sound design and world creation are phenomenal. (In my personal opinion) One of my favorite things about this game is the enemy design. While most horror-esque games have the generic zombie, ghost or some mutated person this game has strange but intriguing designs. (aside from the skeletons although they have their own flair to make them their own thing.)\nThe lighting and coloring to this game is great, although I did bump the color up to 0.5 or 1 just to have a dramatic contrast from the normal world to the dark world.\nOne of my only issues with this game is about 30 minutes from the end I became completely lost. This was primarily due to the fact that I was intoxicated and skipping dialogue on accident, but that is beside the point. In all honesty I would give this game a 7.5 or 8/10. Solid indie game.\n\nTL;DR: Game is kinda spooky at times but still really good. Sound, music and art are great. Only bad thing I didn’t like was getting lost near the end. 8/10 would buy from Black Powder Games again.\n","August 2, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just saw the video on the Steam store page and figured it was worth a try. I'm really happy that I decided to get it. All in all it is a rather solid game. What got me interested were two things. I thought it looked amazing and I liked the idea of using the wind.\n\nI wasn't disappointed with how the game looked (especially when I maxed out the settings). It was so immersive to just wander around the different settings and marvel at how pretty it all was. The windwas more enjoyable on the asthetics side of things. As far as using it for stealth it was really only handy when I was going for the backstabber trophy. Beyond that I just did everything I could to keep my arrows on the mark. The plot was interesting too. I like that I needed to piece everything together. This game doesn't do any hand holding, and that was very appreciated on my end. It helped me feel more like I was exploring a new world, rather than feeling like I was being shown a new world. I will say though, that if you aren't the type to dig into every single nook and cranny and pick up everything in this game, EVERYTHING, then the plot could end up feeling more shallow.\n\nThere is a draw back to the game though. The combat is pretty bad. The enemies are dumb as bricks, and that might be offensive to the bricks. Once you figure out where they usually are on each map, and what the different sounds mean, the game becomes much easier. For most of the game this aspect didn't really detract from my experience too much (well except when I looked a conquistador in the face, they just look weird). It really didn't become a chore until I started going for the combat achievements. Then this game became a slog. All because the enemies aren't interesting at all. If they could figure out a way to fix that this game would be amazing.\n\nIf you're like me and you love games that let you explore this is a very good one. If you want a game that you can crank up to max settings and just be in awe of how pretty it all is (I recommend playing in color to get the full enjoyment) then this is the game for you. If you're looking for something that hands the plot to you in a direct manner, or if you're looking for solid combat, this is definitely not the game for you.","June 3, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall the game is a decent offering which will entice those that heavily favor the mood a game sets, but may leave those that look for strong game play elements feeling worn out and frustrated.\n\nI bought Betrayer during its Early Access debut on Steam after having its unique, alluring high contrast and mostly black and white color scheme catch my eye. Simply put, the graphics of Betrayer are gorgeous. Set in early 17th century colonial Virginia, most of the game takes place in heavily wooded areas, and Unreal Engine 3 does a fantastic job rending a large amount of individual trees, grasses, and shrubs to portray a relatively realistic wilderness. Every few minutes a gust of wind will come along and shake the vegetation, causing a truly dazzling display as each tree branch and grass leaf bends and moves, which is amplified by the lack of coloration.\n\nThe sound design of Betrayer handily backs up its striking graphics. There is no music in Betrayer outside of the games main menu and credits, so it's up to the ambient noise of the forest to do the heavy lifting. Sound in Betrayer is sparse, but (aside from one combat noise that is outlandishly cartoonish) the sound of wind rustling the leaves, birds in the branches, and your characters footfalls are well mixed and convincing.\n\nUnfortunately, for as well designed as Betrayer's world is, there is not much to fill it. Betrayer is divided into seven open area levels, six of which have both a light and dark side that the player must switch between to fulfill different objectives. Enemy types are introduced between the first two levels, and then disappointingly stop, leaving only a sparse eight enemy types to lock horns with, two of which are simply stronger variations of previous enemies and another two of which are almost never used at all. The weapons also follow suit with this, with only seven weapon types being available, most of which you will have by the end of the second area.\n\nThe combat in Betrayer is decent but simple, with most enemies also having projectile weapons or rushing toward you with knives. The AI of your adversaries is not very good, but it does fit with the overall theme of the story. The combat near the start of Betrayer is easily where it shines brightest, with each engagement being tense and difficult. Combat after the first few areas takes a disappointing turn, however, as the better weapons and items the player has amassed at this point are far too powerful to make the same enemies pose a challenge any longer.  Aside from having stronger weapons, having more water flasks that allow the player to heal all but eliminates the need for stealth.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent exploring each area, uncovering clues, and speaking with confused wraiths to piece together stories of betrayal from each area. Although Betrayer gives you a “Listen” skill that will help you find these clues and wraiths to help push the game forward, there is also a lot to find in the world that can only be found by simply exploring. These include not only treasure chests that contain gold to help you upgrade your items, but also paper fragments with more bits of story if you care to further elaborate on the world. Although personally I did not have a lot of difficulty making sure that I covered all the possible ground of each area, the map Betrayer gives you is about what you would expect from the era, and at times the landscape can look vague, which will sometimes lead to frustration trying to find everything contained in a level. Thankfully, Betrayer does alert you when you have found all of a certain item in an area, in addition to when you have found everything possible about a subject or area, which gives a sense of accomplishment and closure before moving on to the next stage of the game. This is where the meat and potatoes of the game lies, as without this exploration, simply using the “Listen” skill to push the story along quickly turns the game into nothing more then a very short, twenty dollar fetch quest.\n\nOverall Betrayer seems to be a solid first offering, especially for a discount price, although it is certainly geared more toward fans of games like Dear Esther or those that enjoy exploration, and even then many may find themselves a bit worn out from the repetitive game play as they approach the middle and end of the game.","March 24, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully, those who would find the blatant visuals unappealing (or sore on the eyes) can always disable its monochromatic look (at least in the 'normal world') and enjoy the lush and vibrant visuals in full colour - for a time.\n\nBlending stealth-shooter with paranormal detective work, the game flits between secret-searching exploration and dismal (often very eerie) otherworldly exorcisms - the victims of which all have well written and intriguing (albeit grisly) tales of woes to tell.\n\nWhile the exploration and occasional combat are a treat, the game does eventually become somewhat tedious as it rarely deviates from what it has offered to you from the early stages - though on the flip-side, given the game itself is quite short, this will only effect those unwilling (or unable) to reach the conclusion quickly.\n\nA nice addition is the high reliance on sound, where listening through the ambience may give a forwarning of the dangers ahead that you may not be able to currently see. In the otherworld, your travels will be paved by listening to the wails of the dead, leading you to those you need to speak with - that is, if you're not fleeing for your life from vicious skeleton armies and floating skull-headed thieves who don't appreciate your living presence.\n\nOverall, the game is quite enjoyable and well worth playing despite being a short, slightly repetitive affair, with an ending leaving things up in the air. I'd certainly welcome a sequel, provided it expands on the foundations to make a more varied experience.\n\nThumbs up!","April 5, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game looks and sounds beautiful, using red highlights and audio that helps draw your eye to important things, such as enemies or treasure. And the use of the whispers in the wind to find key objects I feel is an amazing touch.\nI play with no HUD, on the hardest difficulty, so my experience may differ from someone who plays it in a more standard way, but the reliance on sound and a keen eye adds much to my enjoyment.\nThe combat relies a lot on stealth, as once you enter open combat, a single weak enemy can kill you easily, so you always have to be careful, and cannot just yolo your way around.\n\nIn the end, my final verdict is: I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm dying repeatedly, I hear the bell ringing in my ears while I sleep, and I love this game!

I'm not sure how I made it through this one. Maybe the art and play style were fun enough to overcome the scary? I doubt it, because I remember quite a few times I got spooked, jolted in shock, or had my heart racing from anticipation.\n\nMost likely I was able to make it, because the idea of sneaking-out-in-the-open seemed a bit more fun than your normal sneaking-in-rooms type of game. The idea that you should walk while the wind was gusting to mask your foot steps was also a most likely reason. The game does a good job of holding your hand halfway through the first level, but then drops you in a pit surrounded by ravenous beasts. And I do not mean that in a fun way. Perhaps I was not smart enough or maybe I didn't care enough to read every clue, but I couldn't figure out a lot of what I was supposed to do to free all of the souls. Most of them I got, but some of them I had to look online at YouTube videos or guides on where things were. You have to explore each level with a fine tooth comb in both the day time and night time. Then after you find a lost soul, talk to them back to the base, then go back to any previous clues you may of found and you might see a wraith near where they died and where you found a clue to their death. Then after that go back to the lost soul at base, then find another clue. Wash and repeat. I wouldn't of minded the running around chores since the game's atmosphere and environment are fun to run around, but not knowing where to go or not being able to mark anything on your map as a reminder made completing this game impossible for me without the aid of a good guide or two already posted on the steam community and a few YouTube videos.\n\nThat being said, if you don't mind having to look up things while you play, I recommend playing this game. It was a lot of fun. I still have to go back for the kill 1000 enemies and stealth-kill 200 enemies achievements.","June 28, 2014","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The trailer was convincing too but it was still in Early Access on Steam and I wasn't in a pay-to-test mood so I put it on my Steam wishlist and promptly forgot about it.\n\nThe Steam Summer Sale, 2014 re-acquainted me with this title and I was thrilled to pick it up for a mere $5.00 via the digital distributor. I dove into it immediately and became obsessed...\n\n'I awoke, washed up on shore as the waves lapped the stone-strewn beach around me. I immediately realized I must have sustained a head injury during the storm that tossed my ship against the rocks for I was color-blind! Dizzy, my head aching, I pulled myself from the sandy, salty froth that ebbed and flowed around me. I lurched to my feet and stumbled over to a nearby crate, still wobbly from my ordeal and headsore, shielding my eyes from spray of brine and piercing rays of sunlight alike.\n\nArmed with a sturdy tomahawk and an old longbow I stumbled through the surreal landscape my damaged eyes showed me, making my way towards Fort Henry, the coastal stronghold for the colonies I was sent to investigate for the Crown...'\n\nIndie developer Blackpowder Games has crafted an exquisite experience for anyone willing to brave the chiaroscuro the game initially presents to the player. The familiar control scheme and minimalistic interface become immersive strengths as the artistic design seemlessly meshes with the twitchy, responsiveness of the Unreal Engine, drawing you in with austere beauty and heart-pounding action alike. To top it off the story is very well done and relayed to the player through various elements ranging from visual clues to conversations with ghosts.\n\nAfter a while I got sick of the black and white motif and was pleasantly surprised to find the in-game visual options which allowed me to colorize the graphics and adjust contrast elements. Game developers often cut costs on graphics by skimping on texture quality and dressing their graphics in post-processing effects that cover up glaring flaws. This is NOT the case with Blackpowder Games and the colorized textures are very detailed, even up close.\n\nThe sound design is also very well done and positional audio is relied upon often for clues and direction in the large, woodland areas that lend themselves to becoming lost in. Furthermore, I encountered no game-breaking bugs and the most annoying glitch I encountered was the graphical artifacting and tearing I found, which was mostly mollified via tweaking video settings.\n\nHowever immersive and compelling the game elements are, Betrayal has some negative aspects depending upon individual preferences. Weapons and the enemies you fight with them are very limited and there is not a huge variety of anything in the game world. The player is locked into the FPS perspective and there is no ability to zoom out with the camera, which can be tough on people who get motion sickness from such experiences. The combat is very twitchy and dodging enemy fire is important to survival thus hand-eye coordination is paramount to success in Betrayal. The in-game map is unmarkable and there is no mini-map overlay so keeping track of places of interest and your relative position in an area can be tedious.\n\nIn summary, Betrayer is an excellent first effort from Blackpowder Games. It's a great example of what talented game developers can do with a limited budget and a time-tested game engine. Minimalism has been played to great strength in this title, resulting in an immersive experience populated by tragic tales, beautiful environments, thrilling combat, and expertly designed mechanics. A satisfying romp for any fan of FPS action/adventure games.","June 26, 2014","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So few games realize that wind is a critical component to building a believable world.  After all, it is a very common and natural thing that our minds expect to be in an environment.\n\nThis game also makes it into a mechanic.  Unfortunately, unless there is a gust of wind, there is no wind.. so that is not as good as it good be, but it's still nice to see High detail wind in a game.  (I'd like to see this used for a nuke at medium range in a forest.)\n\nAnyway, putting all that aside, it's a solid game that seems to be heavily inspired by Dark Souls in it's mechanics. I'm impressed that I like it considering that it is a genre I normally don't play.","March 26, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is great, the stealth gameplay is rewarding, the use of 17th century weaponry is novel, the two-tone graphics are a breath of fresh air, and the stories about the dark personal betrayals which caused the deaths of the colonists were engaging.  I personally prefer to play full color in the daylight and greyscale when ringing the bell, because it adds to the contrast between the two worlds.   At $19.99, it's well worth the purchase.   However, even though it has moved past early access the game contains  bugs and crashes fairly often.  If it were not for this I would have very little bad to say about it.   It doesn't crash often enough to ruin the game though, and with a few patches it could be great.","March 28, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you see it on sale and you want a very aestheticly pleasing game to look at while you wander it's game world, this might be a good pickup for you. Otherwise ...\n\nI'll give you the bad, then the good.\n\nStory. I've played games without a narrative, and that's fine. I've played games with a narrative so tight you can see the stitching between characters. That's fine as well. And then there's Betrayer. If you've ever wanted to ask "Just how many people in a small community would wake up and straight up murder each other over super petty things, when their survival really depends on them working together as a community to build a better life..." Oi. Just ... don't expect the stories or Story in Betrayer to stick with you in a good way. There's ONE. ONE, that I felt a little feels for during the reading, and that's only because it was an actual Tradgedy involving parents losing a child. Every single other story, including the main one which is meant to explain the weird shazz going on, is just a damned soap opera set in the 17th Century.\n\n****Spoliers****\n\n\nDo you want to hear about how a young woman was hunted, tied to a stake, stripped naked and had her throat slashed by her father? Because you will. Do you want to learn about how it was necessary to lure someone you considered a friend and companion out to the woods and cave their skull in with a rock? You will. Do you want to come to understand that pretty much everyone's husband or wife cheated on them with everyone else's husband and wife? Sure thing!\n\nNow, do you want all this presented in bland, voiceless text which emphasizes not the emotional gravity of each ghost's story, but only serves to distance you from the terrible, soulful tale of how they killed a man... over an insult... but they're not sorry... except they are.... when it turns out the worman they burned at the stake wasn't a witch but the man who burned her at the stake did so to keep his adultery a secret from his wife whom I believe was killed by the woman who was accused of being a witch or something honestly the whole thing blurs together.\n\nThat's the kind of thing the individual Ghost Stories you find during the game are based on. It's like the ships of settlers were just chock full of rapists, adulterers, and psychopaths. Seriously, one of the stories is just flatly stated to be "We saw a native girl one day. Thought she was pretty. So we ♥♥♥♥♥ her then killed her. Now I'm all confused, and a ghost, because her brother found out, came and found us, then shanked us until we stopped moving."\n\nWhat the sweet grassy knoll?\n\nThe ending is no better. I actually made it a point not to check any guides or sites which would spoil the ending. I did everything properly. Found all the notes. Uncovered all the stories, found all the graves, gave every Ghost their name back, freed EVERY spirit. Gave the Maiden in Red a decent, hopeful response every time I needed to make a dialogue choice.\n\nThe game ends the same way. No matter what you do. Free the sister. Talk to the Maiden. Oops. it was her all along. Bam, back to the ♥♥♥♥ing shadow world with you.\n\nBuuuuullllllllShit.\n\nThere is no reason what so ever to give interactive dialogue choices if they don't affect the story in any way. Doing so is a giant finger to anyone who's ever played a story based RPG or non-linear branching path game. Betrayer bills itself as neither, that's true, but to insert a mechanic which adds both the illusion of choice and increases the players stress due to having to think about it and make the "right" choice? .\n\n♥♥♥♥ off. It's your story. Don't ask me how I want it to turn out and then at the end tell me there's no way to get a happy ending. If you do, expect the players to expect a change.\n\nOk. Story aside for a moment. Aesthetically Betrayer is BEAUTIFUL. Flat out, hands down. The lighting, the monochrome high contrast black and white, every little tuft of long grass and tree branch swaying in the breeze. Fantastic. I could literally make a game called Walking Simulator and just have it be this game with everything removed except for the environment. And it would sell. Turning on the color is even more impressive. Every color is super vivid, bright and distinct.\n\nWalking or running around these environments with the color turned on and the effects all the way up made my machine chug a little, but overall the game is well optimized for the number of moving objects on screen at any given time. When the wind picks up, you can see each leaf and bush ripple. It's very, very pleasing.\n\nThe combat is pretty straight forwards. Hope to see the enemies before they see you. You can sneak around if you like, but the environments are so large that sneaking from one end of an area to the other is just insane. You can restore your health simply by drinking out of water barrels, and can carry up to three weapons, plus your melee attack, Walk down the road, see enemies. Equip Musket. Blam. One down, switch to pistol. Blam, second down. Switch to bow, quickly loose  an arrow at the one still coming, then slash him once when he gets too close and bam. Reload rifle and pistol, keep walking. Getting caught in the middle of a group of shadow world skeletons, or suddenly hearing the alert noise from a moss of conquistadors, as you're sneaking through and having to line up rifle shots while trying serpentine to avoid ranged and melee attacks is just not worth the risk.\n\nI would still recommend this game, but not for the story. Don't invest in any of the characters. It doesn't matter. Play the game as a game. Take what enjoyment you can from it that way, and let the rest go.\n\n\nCheers.","December 21, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First off, there's only one thing I can say regarding the environment: absolutely beautiful. From the details of a single leaf (straight down to the dew), to the rocks on the ground (actually ROUND when you look straight down, not like flattened choco-chips of even the latest generation of games), to the flowing water, bustling trees, and dimming landscape, there's little to say but phenomenal. Caught myself more than once trying just standing admiring the landscape..... inspite of the oncoming errors finding their way to my knee in hopes of ending my journey as an adventurer (shut it, Skyrim fanboys). Best part is, regardless where you are and the color saturation, the landscape still remainds creepy as hell in areas.\n\nSpeaking of the color-sat settings, Betrayer works a great-but-simple slider system in order to turn your landscape from shiny-green trees with monsters waiting to kill you, to some "Sin City" black-and-white-with-red-highlights setting to solidify the creep factor. But, wait, there's more for you traditional suspense-horror folk. Want to go back to that creepy, B-rated 80's horror film feel? No problem. Adjusting light, dark, and color saturation gives you that all-star black-and-white feel for when you're about to be eviscerated.\n\nAaaand speaking of eviscerated (and moving on), there are a number of enemies to preoccupy your time between smelling the roses. Unfortunately, every time a new one pops up (literally, I mean exploding out of the ground to eat your entrails), it's a whole new world of "oh S%!^!! as you've now got to learn the attack pattern on the fly, which still won't help you much, while all the other enemies are swarming after you..... And that's if your lucking to land 'em all in the same spot. Even as much as the newer, harder enemies introduce themselves, the older get stronger, faster, smarter, and, in the zombie-Spaniards cases, better equipped. One prime drawback to the enemies, though, is one shared on the aestetic side. Whereas the flora and overall landscape of the game looks down-right gorgeous, the fog, wraith's miasma, totems' and world's corruption (don't worry, you'll find out), look blocky and pixelated. Don't be discouraged though, as you'll inevitably see from the up-close and personal view of their heads and whatever solid extremities they may have, they're still creepy as hell and will still kill ya.\n\nCombat is simple, but having to manually work the pistols, muskets, bows and crossbows feels natural. By natural, I mean loading a pistol will take a lot longer then a shortbow, but it'll also do a hell of a lot more damage with less chance of deflecting off surfaces. Headshots, as expected, will deal more damage, and as with the old adage, "Nobody wins in a knife fight," if you're going in for a close kill, don't expect to come out unscathed as you're human. They're not. They're faster. You'll find out who "they" are.\n\nStory-wise, Betrayer definitely takes its cues from older horror and suspense movies, only there's no chance of a happy ending with any of 'em, and they're generally more depressing and brutal then you were expected. It's more of a mystery novel with a horrorific veins than an adventure/FPS. The closer you think to completing a puzzle, the more you find out how many pieces are missing. Those pieces are generally worse then you were thinking, as well. Betrayer does not earn its name for no reason, folks. Oh, and once again, there's no way any of the "arks" end well, which holds especially true for the first few missions.\n\nIn summary, even with  a few quirks you'd expect in an "indy" game, Betrayer holds up in all grounds, combat, scenery, and storytelling. Without further ado, you'll F^!(ING HATE THE ENDING.","March 11, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The exploration and survival combination is nice. It doesn't suffer from the "I shouldn't explore anywhere I don't have to because I'll run out of matches/batteries/bullets" annoyance of most survival horror games. The visuals are interesting, the high contrast black and white makes it difficult to pick out enemies at a distance. The story is intriguing as you uncover it through clues. The only downside is that it can get fairly repetitive. I'd recommend grabbing Betrayer, although not at $20, wait for a sale.","July 28, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Immersion at its best! Even if the whole game was absolutely empty of NPCs, it could be one of best explorational "walking simulator".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/surlybitch/recommended/243120/","surlybitch","ChuckleBags","http://steamcommunity.com/id/surlybitch/","390 products in account","Betrayer is full of betrayals (as one might expect), most of which are discovered in the course of playing through this intriguingly visual mystery first person adventure stealth shooter all the way to the end.\n\nYou awaken, shipwrecked on the shore of pre-colonial North America, the world around you rendered in vivid black and white with bare highlights of red. This art design decision works well to frame the story, but also describes the almost exclusively binary decisions you'll have to make in the game. You can change the visual settings if you wish, but I recommend playing at least once with the original settings.\n\nWalking to the British colony to which you were traveling, you'll encounter hostile Spanish troops, and maybe catch a fleeting glimpse of the local natives who reportedly still populate this quiet land. There are also, other... things. Guttural sounds, glimpses through the underbrush. Something here is displeased at your presence. Best to keep moving.\n\nOverall, the story is fairly muted within the gameplay. You can have frequent conversations with game characters, who offer cryptic clues to the story. Combat with the limited period weaponry is the same throughout the game, although you can find/buy better versions. A few useful items you discover allow you to sense things others cannot, almost mystically.\n\nA HUD compass at the top middle of the screen shows your heading and any discovered locations in the current region. You can use a map to fast travel among them as well. This is very helpful as the game regions are all open and explorable. Many additional details can be found if you explore outside the beaten paths.\n\nThe sound design is excellent, as it must be since a crucial game mechanic relies on listening. To find clues, stop and use the “listen” key (once you've acquired the item that let's you hear things that others cannot).\n\nWhen you “listen”, if there is anything to be heard, you'll hear a low sound from the direction of undiscovered items. On the compass' right and left edges will appear guides indicating if the sound is stronger from your right or from your left. It will make sense when you use it.\n\nIt can be easy to lose track of your purpose, but these are three things you should remember:\n\n1 - Your journal is pretty thorough. Check it frequently.\n\n2 - You can “listen” for locations of characters and hidden objects. This is crucial to resolving the story.\n\n3 - You can ring the village bell to move from the daylight world to a world of twilight, each world having its own clues and mysteries, most of which all tie well together in the end.\n\nThe game's pace is deliberately slow and combat is infrequent unless you're careless. When you hear the howl of an enemy who has just discovered you, there are a few frantic moments as you look around trying to see from which direction the threat is approaching.\n\nBut that's about the height of “excitement” in this wonderfully atmospheric game. I took a chance on this game because it offered a fresh look, and it makes for an enjoyable few hours to pull the story bits together until the final betrayal. I'm glad I did as it's well worth trying.","December 31, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's another game that holds its narrative higher than its gameplay, but it still tries to fit more combat into its story and atmosphere than other games like Gone Home, Master Reboot, etc.\nIt also features a very striking artstyle at first, although I'm not quite sure the developers knew exactly where they wanted to go with it.\n\nYou arrive in 17th century America, and go from camp to camp, trying to figure out the world around you. To do this, there are some pages spread around the maps, and also ghosts. You can see and speak to them, and little by little, by finding clues around the maps, you'll be able to understand who they are, how they died, and thus investigate the strange happening of each camp.\nI really like the concept, and it's certainly different, but I don't think the execution is perfect, for the game's length. It feels like it would be a great element in a game, but not the sole focus, as is.\nThere are various enemies spread around, with different tells. You'll have to be methodical in dealing with them, and use sound to your advantage, moving stealthily to avoid certain death.\n\n\nLet's go more in-depth with its presentation. You've probably seen from the screenshots that it's a very important aspect of this game.\nThe game is essentially in greyscale, with heavy contrast and lighting, and then features some live red for you to spot enemies and other important clues. There is the option to set normal colors though, and it looks pretty good as well, as long as you adjust the contrast and the lighting as well.\nThere are two worlds, a living world, and the ghost world, which you switch from and to, depending on your objective. The ghost world is far grimmer and darker. However, since both are black and white, I think it loses its punch, in general. I played the whole game as it was by default (always greyscale). After that, I went back to find missing collectibles, and used normal colors. Even in the living world, the game is far more tense with colors off, but the shock in switching worlds is significantly lessened.\n\nPlaying without colors can also be quite confusing at first, and I honestly don't know how I feel about it. It's just weird. And in the context of this game, it works! The whole time, I was just trying to understand what exactly the game was trying to do.\n\n\nAnother crucial aspect on this game is its sound design. There's no music, it's only ambient sounds.\nNow, the greyscale serves a purpose in the game. It makes you realize that you see the world differently than others in that world. You can clearly see enemies and interactable objects, while they can not. This also plays a role in sound design, as enemies have a much harder time seeing how. They can however, hear you if you're not careful. So you'll constantly be trying to walk crouched if you hear enemies around (or see them) not to get spotted. There are also occasional gusts of wind that mask your sprinting sound.\nSome enemies are very clear with their red tells. Others, however, are also hidden, until they spot you. The only way for you to tell they're around, is through the sounds they make. There's a lot of nuance to it regarding its sound and visual design and the combat, actually, it's pretty cool.\n\nThere are also audio tells for when you are near an objective, or a collectible. You can also press X to be guided towards a close ghost/main objective, with a distant sound effect. There is a visual aid to it in the options menu, but I recommend playing only based on the audio cues.\n\n\nIt's hard to review this game, as it has so many details that shape the experience. I'll have to say the it's very heavy on atmosphere. It's not an horror game, but it can make you uncomfortable at times, and unexpected enemies can make you jump every once in a while. But I loved how tense it made me. The visual and audio design was spot on to make you feel that something was wrong at all times. Great job on that.\n\n\nWell, there goes half of the review and I haven't began talking about gameplay.\nEach map if self contained, and you can only progress to one after you've done every important objective for the previous. If you guide yourself with the sound cues, you'll have no problem with it. Most of the maps are very empty and barren woods, with 2-3 camps or important landmarks in each one. There are Pages, Chests, Clues, Ghosts, Graves, and Totems spread around. You have a notebook that checks most of what you find, regarding clues, locations visitted, graves found, etc. You also have a map to guide you (and fast travel between landmarks), but you can not make annotation in the map. This is a huge problem. If you're after the chests, pages and clues, it's a nightmare to go look for them again without map markers. There are also some clues that you can't uncover until you get a Shovel late into the game. Without marking these when you find them, going back after you get it is a pain... You'll forget most of them, and overall, it's very inconvenient to simply walk around hoping you'll stumble into something. This is only a problem with the optional stuff, but it's annoying nonetheless.\n\nRegardless, let's go back to the game. There's also a vendor, from whom you can buy weapons, ammo, and the like. Enemies also drop weapons, although much weaker than the ones you get from the vendor. There are also 16 unique weapons that you can find from Chests, or with the Shovel. These are even better from the ones in the vendor, and it's worth scavenging for them.\n\nIn the normal world, you'll have to clear the camps of Spaniards (to set your checkpoint there) and find a Bell, to mount in it. By ringing the bell you change worlds. This is where it gets more interesting.\nIn the ghost world, you'll go around trying to find lost souls and wraiths. There can be both colonizers and natives. If they're lost, you'll point them to the camp, you can speak to them there. As you find more ghost and clues for each map, you'll be able to ask them questions about each other, and the items you find. This reveals how they died, little by little. It's usually episodes of people betraying one another (hence the name). While they're not groundbreaking, I thought they were cool, and also set the tone for the game's world. It's not historical or anything. It's mostly a way of integrating the narrative with the gameplay, and that's very good.\n\nThere's also a main plot (that's related with these side-stories as well), about the normal human being you find. She can't quite remember what happened, and so you go around trying to find her family.\nThe problem with this, is that I can't understand the point of this story. There doesn't seem to be a message in it, for the most part. It's just... there. And while the world itself, and the side-stories make the game interesting, it doesn't seem as directed as I would have liked. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed playing the game, but there's something missing, and the potential is there!\n\nI hope you get a good enough idea from this to know if this is for you. I just find it really hard to fit this game into a review.\n\nAnother aspect that I want to touch, is the moral of your actions. With the enemies, they completely dehumanized the enemies, weirdly enough. The Spaniards are just armored humanoids that sound like bears. Seriously, if you hear a freakin' bear, it's a Spaniard. They also have a full helmet, so you never see their face. The natives are fire-y ashen being and whistle to communicate with each other. None of them feel actually human, so you have no problem with killing them, as they're just hostile beasts.\n\nOverall, it's a very interesting game. Execution is half stellar, half lacking. It feels a bit incomplete, pacing-wise. But I'd say give it a go! You'll probably have an odd feeling of enjoyment while playing it!","December 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are haunting. I sincerely recommend not turning the saturation up because the black and white effect seems clearly designed for the game.  The gameplay is often tough and somewhat unforgiving. Betrayer doesn’t hold your hand like so many other games these days, you have to actually do a bit of reading and investigating to figure out what's going on.\n\nFrom the moment I started, the score and the visuals had me tense. I'm someone who loves older horror games and the simplicity of this game really appealed to me. The ambiant sound is fantastic and keeps the player on edge. I sincerely got goosebumps more than once from playing this.\n\nI have to say though, like all things, it's not perfect. The entire game revolves around you going to different places on the map and finding things. These locations are all marked on your map when you enter a new area. I would say that the game's lack of hand-holding probably would prevent a lot of people from even getting far enough to criticize the collect-em-all nature of it, but that's neither here nor there. Beyond the story itself, it's really just a collection game and that can get tedious.\n\nOverall, I loved it. It's a solid game with pretty tight gameplay and honest nightmare material with an interesting plot to boot. It has its flaws and can get repetitive and boring, but all games have flaws.

Later saw the game was on sale for $0.99 so I thought what the hell, and so it sat in my steam library for about 2 months. Untill the other night, where I was craving a new adventure very badly. There she was shinning brightly through my eyes into my very soul. Booted her on up and never the less I fell in love really quick. Game has an open world feel to it even though there really isn't like a GIANT overworld just mainly open=ended level's where you have to explore and collect while solving the mystery of a young girl, and what happend to this new community that you were set to live in. Don't skimp up the exploring though you will regret it! for the story and survials sake! Shooting things and sneaking around is alot more satisfing than it is at first. Wait until you get the crossbow thats when the stealthy aspect of the game really heats up and makes you feel pretty good about sticking a spaniard in the eye with a bolt or 2. The game really can scare the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you as well and I just don't mean your cheesy jump scares that seem to destroy the naritve that is "Horror". But this game is all about atmosphere as it should be and that's what makes a good horror game for me. Your not waiting for the next jump scare to come out and scream in terror becasue you new it was coming but not when. In Betrayer very rarely will you come across a jump scare and it really scare's you because you don't expect it at all. Which is the beauty of this one. The only couple of problems I would have with the game is that it does feel like a collect fest at times some items do not have any real value and you find them to give to the "Girl in Red". Don't get me wrong here either though, a lot of the items you find do has value to a lot of the Wraiths you find and try help figure out who they are and what happend to this "New World". For a buck though?really you just cannot beat a game of this quality for a dollar.\n\nVerdict: 9/10\n","February 23","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Language, texts and the overall story is very well done, and the language used is beautiful and fits very well with the game.\n- Very well polished.\n\nCons:\n- Combat seems to get a bit repetitive, but it's still challenging, interesting (with inventory management), and also isn't the main focus of the game.\n\nThis is just a great game and I really wish there was a sequel to it or more games in its vein.","March 27","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a great atmosphere, especially with its nice touches, such as realistic wind effects, and the ability to change the colour saturation when playing.\n\nAt first it appears as though the game has no story. You arrive in a wooded area with scattered forts and military outposts. Everyone aside from one NPC are dead and it's your job to find out what happened to this place. As you travel from one open area to another, you find clues and remains of the conflict. In each area you are able to traverse between the normal world and the dark world. In the dark world you are able to communicate with the spirits of the dead, hearing out their side of the story, and eventually putting together the clues that tell you how they died and why.\n\nIn each area, there is a variety of enemies you encounter, each of which poses a threat, especially when they come in groups. This means you often have to approach them with strategy and stealth, because most weapons are either not that powerful or take a while to reload. It kind of felt like Dark Souls but in 1st person - dangerous enemies, dying takes you back to a safe place with all enemies in the area revived, and most of the story told through clues in the environment.\n\nI generally enjoyed the game and found myself very immersed, but there were a few minor drawbacks. For example, it started to feel like it was dragging on a bit in the latter stages since the gameplay did not change much between each area. I also found exploring the dark world to be a bit tedious because the environments were being bland. I think it could've been made a bit prettier with some more detail in the environments. Just because it's meant to be grey and dark does not mean it has to feel empty. There were also very minor gripes, like some wearable charms having useless bonuses, like having a 4% chance of being harder to spot (why equip that when I can equip charms that increase my melee damage by 50 or even 100%).\n\nIn general, this is a solid game. If you're into games with an open-world feel and lots of things to collect, and story being subtle, you should enjoy it. If you're not into those things, you might, just like me, enjoy it still.","May 16, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/243120/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Betrayer is a game best played without prior research or information, but it's also a very polarizing game that you will probably either love or hate, and I'll try to talk about the things that would hold you back from purchasing this title and the things that you might come to love about it while trying not to leave you feeling like you've already played the game.\n\nIn simple terms Betrayer is a fantastic FPS with a huge focus on immersion with discovery, exploration and detective elements. Set in the first decade of the 17th Century as a colonist arriving on the shores of Virginia, there are a number of interesting and fairly unique mechanics that all help to compliment the world and the players exploration and while it requires a level of attention and self learning, it delivers more the more you put into it. For me, this is a game that exemplifies underrated or hidden gems.\n\nHighlights\nThe last game I can remember grabbing a hold of me and making me feel so immersed and part of its environment was Metro 2033, and with a much smaller budget and development team, it's commendable how incredibly well designed this is. There's a depth of elegant graphical and audio options for players who want to get rid of the HUD, turn up the difficulty and increase the realism even more, but even out of the box it's very reactive and real. Everything from the get go is designed with this in mind, the HUD elements can be mostly forgotten about and blend into the background, the weapons are all accurate to the period, and reload animations look and feel natural and even small things like reloading while running support the level of realism.\n\nThe audio and animation and art style all stands out as exceptionally well made. Using the games listening mechanic feels like stopping to ♥♥♥♥ your ear and is a genuinely useful part of play. The rustling of leaves in the wind can give you a scare if you mistake them for something else and paranoia takes hold often. Similarly, visual elements like light shaded ferns and foliage or bent tree branches blowing in the wind can easily be mistaken for assailants or hazards and catch you off guard.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nA common complaint about Betrayer is the lack of depth in terms of gameplay, and that it quickly gets boring. While it's true that the combat and actual progressive gameplay are straight forward and arguably limited, they're not the whole focus of the game, and shouldn't be viewed as the reason for playing. Instead, the game is about discovering clues, finding out who and where you are, what's going on and what happened in and to the environment and characters around you. Still, players expecting a different take on an FPS are justified in feeling out of place here, I just feel it's a complaint that doesn't take into account the rest of the game.\n\nFinally, the ending receives a lot of criticism for being abrupt, not making sense, and explaining very little. Like the rest of Betrayer, it requires a level of thought and comitment from the player, and a developer explanation helps confirm what most people will take away from the ending, but it still feels poorly conveyed and ends like a movie that left you feel wanting for an explanation after viewing.\n\nAll in all the biggest issue I had with Betrayer is that it's one of those games that leaves you feeling like it could've been much more. I can't criticize a game that's taken interesting new approaches to common gameplay mechanics, and I feel they've simply been used as the best solution to the game design in mind and they serve it well, but players should know that it will probably make them want for more, or for one of the mechanics to be explored more in depth. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is more down to individual taste.\n\n* Due to the ambiguous nature of gameplay and the focus on realism, almost everything is left unexplained, be it the mechanics, the enemies and even the controls. It compliments the playstyle very well, but also creates for some frustrations. I remained ignorant of the fact that I could use melee weapons far into the game purely because an enemy spawned too close during the brief explanation of the controls, and made me feel like a fool later on.\n* Spoilers For a game with such incredible sound design and natural assets why on Earth are the enemies using generic animal sound clips that I've heard in games and moves? A conquistador should not make dog noises and skeletons should not be roaring like a bear.\n\nRecommendations\nWith an average playtime of around 8 hours, and a price tag at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99, Betrayer feels fairly priced and fair value for money. The caveat is that, being a love it or hate it kind of game, it may be worth waiting for a sale of -50% or more for anyone who's unsure. Though a demo is available on the Store page and will help anyone on the fence.\n\nThe already visually impressive graphics can be heightened further via use of SweetFX settings, and FPS can be unlocked to allow greater than 60fps. Further explanation is listed in these guides.","August 6, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

The frustration of dealing with muzzle-loaders, flint-lock pistols, and crossbows also zero in the frustration of these low-tech solutions. I don't mean that this is not a welcome change of pace from games that seem to want an automatic in your hands as soon as possible. Combat in this game rewards both the bold and the stealthy, although once you get to a certain point, you'll hear your enemies, but spotting them before they spot you is REALLLLLLLY hard.\n\nSo to break it down:\n\nCombat: Stealth or run-n-gun. Explosives are okay, but I never use them. Use cover to your advantage, and the wind-swells to mask footsteps.\n\nAtmosphere: From the lonely shore you wash up on, to the sad bastions of fortresses where the ghosts of some truly deplorable people dwell all give this game a kind of hopelessness that is engaging and eerie. Moving between day and night worlds is a kind of Silent Hill-esque treat.\n\nIssues: I wish the markers for ghosts that aren't available would disappear until they were available again. After every piece of evidence, I'm back to wandering in the woods to see if a ghost popped up.\n\nThis game doesn't give you a ton of info up front, so let me help:\n\n1. The corrupted totems can only be dealt with at night, and you can "listen" to them (starting a battle) with "X"\n\n2. You can switch back to the world map and you don't have to go back through each area, you can warp to any point you've created, across any map.\n\n3. Make sure you check the map that you want everything to show up! I made it to the fourth area before I realized it wasn't showing me ghosts.\n\n4. You won't get the shovel to dig up the rock-piles until quite a ways into the game, so don't keep looking for the damn thing until you get like four or five maps in.\n\n\nAnyway, great game for the price, and I bought it and forgot I had it in my library for a few months. I then went back and actually played it, and I've been playing it every night for the last couple weeks!","October 8, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It seems people tend to commonly go on about storyline and the colour scheme, and how spooky the game is. I'm going to give you a couple of brief sentences about what I find enjoyable about the game, rather than what the game is about.\n\n1st of all a couple of notes on colour. Yes, it's a stark monochrome black and white world, but in a later patch, they've enabled the ability to turn the contrast and brightness all the way up or down, and also to turn the colour saturation all the way up or down. the screenshots that you see in black and white, are the default colours for the game, and the ones in colour are with the colour scale at about a quarter. There are not sections in colour, and sections in greyscale, as I got the impression when I saw the screenshots.\nI personally played with everything turned all the way down, and the gain off at night. It can be nice to have a bit of colour during the day though, to turn the situation up a little actually makes it and more enjoyable world to stomp  around in, and turning the saturation all the way up gives you a "Far Cry 3" feeling to the game.\n\non the subject of Far Cry 3, this game has many elements in common with it. You can go in stealthy and killed as many as you can, before you get detected and it all turns into the shooting fest. Saving and reloading is only the checkpoints. Billy game you feel like a stiff breeze would knock you over, and late game you feel like a complete wrecking ball able to charge in if you want to. the only thing really missing from Betrayer, is a really cool kill animation if you manage to sneak up behind enemy. That would have made the sneak attack approach much more worth it - in fact, that is the whole reason why I love our client. I played the entire game with a knife. Literally the only time I used weapons was on animals, or in sections that forced me to.\n\nSome of the default key bindings are not particularly intuitive, especially the one about throwing a Tomahawk. I did change a couple of key bindings in regards to some of those things, but what you do with that is up to you.\n\nI am not a fan of having background music killing in game, and sound as a very important mechanic in this game, precludes the use of music in the background. I enjoyed this particular aspect quite a lot.\n\nI liked the size of the maps, they were just big enough, but not too big. There were enough of them, and not too many. The only thing is they were all very much the same, they were too similar format to map the scenery did not change very much at all, if at all.\n\nThere are a lot of "secondary missions" in the form of running around investigating lost souls and murders, and the like. It's not really mentioned by most people in the reviews, but this is the best method I've ever seen of doing investigations in any game, ever. It does use the sound of clues to lead you towards the next person, or the next item that you need to find, and that does help quite a bit at times. But what it did differently, as the investigations although a key part of the story never really felt frustrating like most games, where the puzzle orientated. This one had a flow and it never really stopped. It was more of a matter of being part of the journey, rather than bashing your head against someone else's idea of a brick wall. If you've ever played ♥♥♥♥ games we've got to do investigations, such as the Sherlock Holmes series, or  murdered: Soul suspect you'll find this a welcome relief to their horrible investigation mechanisms.\n\nI've seen a couple of complaints about the lack of the number of types of enemies, but I find that there was enough variety in the enemies, and your approach to taking down, to keep it interesting. Mostly, because once I figured out how to find those little flaming guys before they left at, a kind of became like hunting the Hunter, except that the hunters were more like rabbits with big sharp teeth - oh, and flames. And short bows.\n\nI really got dropped a little bit in and have to try and figure out what's going on, especially early in the game. I really recommend that at least for the 1st couple of levels, maybe the 1st 3 maps really try and stay away from looking for a walk-through of what's going on. That's really where the discovery of the game happens, and that's really part of what makes the game enjoyable.\n\nOne thing I didn't like a lot was there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing from the 1st met at the last minute to the 1st met the last map again by the end of the game. Maybe that could and have bothered me quite so much, if it didn't have quite long load times between maps. I didn't mind too much, because every time you load it, all the enemies respawn, and I get to kill the more all over again. That's probably why have every achievement in the game.\n\nConsidering the direction of the game took, and how you got there, I personally found the ending a little bit incomplete? At least, I found an underwhelming. It felt rushed or unfinished or to sudden, or not thought out well enough, but the journey there was enjoyable enough to make it worth, so don't let the knowledge of the fact that it has an ending victory from from wanting to play the game. There's lots of intrigue and betrayal that happens right throughout the storyline. Every investigation that you undertake involves some kind of betrayal between friends, family, lovers. Sense, therefore I think, the name.\n\nThanks for listening!","March 29, 2015","true","21.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My first arrow ricochets off his helmet. My second finds purchase in a chink in the trunk (torso). Grab his pistol and move on to a Fort.\n\nExplore the area with the color saturation at 0.1.\nCome across another conquistador; he takes a third of my health 'fore I dispatch him.\n\nContinue, crouching all the while, only sprinting when the wind blows, so as to muffle my steps to any other adversaries.\nNeglect the Fort for the countryside; I find a note presumably from one of the men stationed in the fort: He expresses concern at his superior's wanting to confiscate and hide treasure amongst the hills and fields.\n\nAnother foe put down with one arrow to the neck.\nJump atop a rock, to witness a panorama; flashing indicates loot to either side, red indicates enemy before me off in the distance.

I try out the different weapons (bow, pistol and a rifle I had picked up). Connect with the pistol (on the second shot); rifle seems to have a spread. I peek over, with an arrow notched. I get a face-full of pellets.\n\n\nThis game... is awesome.\nThe visuals, the environment(al features), the ambience.\nThe combat: No medium; painstaking stealth, oddly hectic firefights with flintlock and powder based firearms.\nThe story: From what little I know, you can shift between two realms.

You take on demonic Conquistadors and spectral horrors as you pass back and forth between diffferent veils of reality, clearing the various areas of enemies and helping lost spirits remember their stories and gain absolution.\n\nIt is an exercise in restraint - everything from the soundtrack, to the visuals, to the story is constructed carefully and sparingly with great intention. There is no music but for the wind through the trees and the grass, and the contextual sounds that alert you to the presence of nearby points of interest, and this sound design is excellent. However, the minimalism also extends to the gameplay - you'll do a bit of shooting, a bit of stealth, and a lot of walking from one place to another and back again. The locations exhibit little variation, and you won't see much beyond trees and grass and rocks along the way.\n\nThe layers of atmosphere, the oppressive feel of the dark other world, and the genuine tension when you hear the bark of an enemy all expertly manipulate the player's emotions, and the stories themselves are well-written and feel like they reflect believable and uniformly tragic struggles of a once-living colonial population, however the overreliance on mystery can leave you feeling without purpose, and the sheer amount of trudging back and forth is tedious. The last couple of hours of the game are striking in that you begin to get a little variety in locations, the story finally gets momentum, and the difficulty unbalances heavily in your favour, and I found this the most motivated section of gameplay, but to trudge through 4 repetitious hours beforehand was not an altogether enjoyable experience.\n\nThis is one of those games that you can really appreciate for its parts, especially from the perspective of artistic risk-taking, but it is not greater than the sum of those parts, and you may have trouble feeling compelled to finish it. I recommend it because it's well-made and unique, but I recommend it tentatively because its design makes getting through it a bit of a slog.","November 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has a great atmosphere, especially with its nice touches, such as realistic wind effects, and the ability to change the colour saturation when playing.\n\nAt first it appears as though the game has no story. You arrive in a wooded area with scattered forts and military outposts. Everyone aside from one NPC are dead and it's your job to find out what happened to this place. As you travel from one open area to another, you find clues and remains of the conflict. In each area you are able to traverse between the normal world and the dark world. In the dark world you are able to communicate with the spirits of the dead, hearing out their side of the story, and eventually putting together the clues that tell you how they died and why.\n\nIn each area, there is a variety of enemies you encounter, each of which poses a threat, especially when they come in groups. This means you often have to approach them with strategy and stealth, because most weapons are either not that powerful or take a while to reload. It kind of felt like Dark Souls but in 1st person - dangerous enemies, dying takes you back to a safe place with all enemies in the area revived, and most of the story told through clues in the environment.\n\nI generally enjoyed the game and found myself very immersed, but there were a few minor drawbacks. For example, it started to feel like it was dragging on a bit in the latter stages since the gameplay did not change much between each area. I also found exploring the dark world to be a bit tedious because the environments were being bland. I think it could've been made a bit prettier with some more detail in the environments. Just because it's meant to be grey and dark does not mean it has to feel empty. There were also very minor gripes, like some wearable charms having useless bonuses, like having a 4% chance of being harder to spot (why equip that when I can equip charms that increase my melee damage by 50 or even 100%).\n\nIn general, this is a solid game. If you're into games with an open-world feel and lots of things to collect, and story being subtle, you should enjoy it. If you're not into those things, you might, just like me, enjoy it still.","May 16, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Set in the first decade of the 17th Century as a colonist arriving on the shores of Virginia, there are a number of interesting and fairly unique mechanics that all help to compliment the world and the players exploration and while it requires a level of attention and self learning, it delivers more the more you put into it. For me, this is a game that exemplifies underrated or hidden gems.\n\nHighlights\nThe last game I can remember grabbing a hold of me and making me feel so immersed and part of its environment was Metro 2033, and with a much smaller budget and development team, it's commendable how incredibly well designed this is. There's a depth of elegant graphical and audio options for players who want to get rid of the HUD, turn up the difficulty and increase the realism even more, but even out of the box it's very reactive and real. Everything from the get go is designed with this in mind, the HUD elements can be mostly forgotten about and blend into the background, the weapons are all accurate to the period, and reload animations look and feel natural and even small things like reloading while running support the level of realism.\n\nThe audio and animation and art style all stands out as exceptionally well made. Using the games listening mechanic feels like stopping to ♥♥♥♥ your ear and is a genuinely useful part of play. The rustling of leaves in the wind can give you a scare if you mistake them for something else and paranoia takes hold often. Similarly, visual elements like light shaded ferns and foliage or bent tree branches blowing in the wind can easily be mistaken for assailants or hazards and catch you off guard.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nA common complaint about Betrayer is the lack of depth in terms of gameplay, and that it quickly gets boring. While it's true that the combat and actual progressive gameplay are straight forward and arguably limited, they're not the whole focus of the game, and shouldn't be viewed as the reason for playing. Instead, the game is about discovering clues, finding out who and where you are, what's going on and what happened in and to the environment and characters around you. Still, players expecting a different take on an FPS are justified in feeling out of place here, I just feel it's a complaint that doesn't take into account the rest of the game.\n\nFinally, the ending receives a lot of criticism for being abrupt, not making sense, and explaining very little. Like the rest of Betrayer, it requires a level of thought and comitment from the player, and a developer explanation helps confirm what most people will take away from the ending, but it still feels poorly conveyed and ends like a movie that left you feel wanting for an explanation after viewing.\n\nAll in all the biggest issue I had with Betrayer is that it's one of those games that leaves you feeling like it could've been much more. I can't criticize a game that's taken interesting new approaches to common gameplay mechanics, and I feel they've simply been used as the best solution to the game design in mind and they serve it well, but players should know that it will probably make them want for more, or for one of the mechanics to be explored more in depth. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is more down to individual taste.\n\n* Due to the ambiguous nature of gameplay and the focus on realism, almost everything is left unexplained, be it the mechanics, the enemies and even the controls. It compliments the playstyle very well, but also creates for some frustrations. I remained ignorant of the fact that I could use melee weapons far into the game purely because an enemy spawned too close during the brief explanation of the controls, and made me feel like a fool later on.\n* Spoilers For a game with such incredible sound design and natural assets why on Earth are the enemies using generic animal sound clips that I've heard in games and moves? A conquistador should not make dog noises and skeletons should not be roaring like a bear.\n\nRecommendations\nWith an average playtime of around 8 hours, and a price tag at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99, Betrayer feels fairly priced and fair value for money. The caveat is that, being a love it or hate it kind of game, it may be worth waiting for a sale of -50% or more for anyone who's unsure. Though a demo is available on the Store page and will help anyone on the fence.\n\nThe already visually impressive graphics can be heightened further via use of SweetFX settings, and FPS can be unlocked to allow greater than 60fps. Further explanation is listed in these guides.","August 6, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","6"

The world is painted in stark black and white with splashes of blood red - just like hope, all color fades.\n\nBeneath the grim horror of Betrayer is a nicely challenging FPS with basic stealth elements. Defend yourself with muskets, pistols, bows, crossbows, throwing hatchets, black powder bombs and a basic knife melee attack. The survivor should use a stealthy bow to kill from a distance, aim for the head, use trees as cover, blast armored foes with black powder, and throw hatchets into the ribs for an instant kill on charging enemies.\n\nI heartily recommend this game to lovers of atmospheric horror, historical settings and weapons, and FPS-stealth hybrids.\n\nPROS:\n+ Dark atmosphere\n+ Great sound design on gun shots, monster sounds, the chilling Night realm, terrifying breathing, and screaming totems\n+ Unique art style\n+ Color can be turned on if wanted\n+ Hefty Muskets and powder Pistols with nice reload animations (powder, ball, ramrod)\n+ Ammo is plentiful if you have the money\n+ First Person Shooting feels great mid game and late\n+ Stealth is powerful and aided by sound hiding wind gusts and damage increases for stealth hits\n+ Tragic backstory told through Lost Souls, torn Notes, Clue items, and conversation\n+ Colonial setting is creepy AND historical\n+ Enemies are threatening and scary, the first time I heard a Loon call I was surprised by what was making it\n+ Bells allow the player to transform the world into Night and re-explore the same area with different enemies and loot\n+ Different enemy types: Conquistadors (Bow/Rifle/Sword Conquistadors, Armored Giants), Burning Indian Bowmen, Ash People (not in the game much), Spiders (not in the game much), Spectres (Human Skull Mask/Deer Skull Mask), Skeletons.\n+ The final act of the game was horrifying, getting closer and closer to the evil heart of the woods and finding out what happened there\n\n\nCONS:\n- You fight basic Conquistadors, Skeletons and Indian Bowmen for 90% of the game.\n- On the hardest difficulty the beginning areas can be VERY difficult with the weak starter weapons and weak stealth\n- Enemies can rarely detect the player through solid objects such as bushes and fort walls\n- Stealth is impossible in some parts of the game (the enemies auto-detect you in certain events)\n- Stealth has no detection meter, only a simple sound and you are easily spotted without stealth buffing charms\n- Lots of backtracking if you are a completionist\n- Hidden best charm in the game is given by the Maiden in Red only if you answer mulitple choice questions a certain way (go for practical uses for gifts you give her) and it is never indicated you could unlock anything\n- No voice acting\n- No music at all, even slight atmospheric music with colonial instruments would have been neat, or Indian chants\n- The story is basic with no huge revelations\n- The main game does not have enough enemies to complete the 1000 Kills and 200 Stealth Kills achievements, you must grind respawning enemies\n- With no music you'd want more atmospheric sounds, or weather or something\n- Never felt much emotional connection, just a sense of curiosity\n- Weapons sold at the merchant chest are almost never worth buying, too expensive for the upgrade until the "Common" vaiants\n- Variety of areas is a bit basic\n- Short-ish game\n\n\nI played on the Hardest difficulty and did 100% of the achievements for this review.","February 4","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It really saddens me that this game really didn’t get a lot of publicity or praise. So many lesser games are receiving more appreciation than they deserve.\n\nBetrayer is a bit of a mixed bag as far as genres go. The story and atmosphere is very much rooted in horror and paranormal. Mechanically the game is a first person shooter/melee adventure. There are mild RPG mechanics granting some basic equipment upgrades and a few nice skills here and there. Gameplay consists almost entirely of stealth survival with a very strong focus on limited resources and few but deadly enemies. To wrap all that up, the world is staged in a re-imagined colonial America fighting against skeletal Spaniards.\n\nWith just an eclectic mix of attributes it would be unsurprising to find that the game plays like an incohesive mess, but instead it brings this incredible breath of fresh air. Captivating and enthralling just begin to scratch the surface of what it’s like to boot up Betrayer for the first time. The button mappings are a bit strange but easy enough to rebind, and while you’re in the menu, make sure to fiddle with the mouse sensitivity. Once the controls are sorted out, you’ll find yourself constantly pulled forward into this dark, death filled world. It was incredibly hard to pull myself away; I wanted to just find that next scrap of information, or find out what happened to this one more lost soul. Riddled along the way I got a few good jump scares but none of the horror was contrived or staged, it was all very natural and unsettling. The weapons have serious weight to them, but at the same time leave you very vulnerable. I found myself tiptoeing through the underbrush, only covering distance quickly when the breeze picked up, rather than confronting any enemy outright.\n\nIf you've read my other reviews you know I don’t do the whole numerical rating because they are meaningless; however, out of my entire game collection Betrayer sits very comfortably amongst the top ten and won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.","February 18, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a world that manages to feel, at the same time, both desolate and packed with intrigue. There are places to explore, mysteries to solve and threats looming around every bend. This is a game that isn't afraid to take some risks in terms of game design. The results are sometimes wonderfully successful and other times ineffective.\n\nWhat first drew me to Betrayer was its artistic design. While it does look as good as the screenshots, the novelty of it does wear off over time. I eventually experimented with turning on full color and was pleased with how things looked that way as well. Just know that simply turning up the color saturation slider doesn't make for something pleasing to the eye. You'll have to change the light and dark intensity sliders as well. I had both of them moved most of the way to the left.\n\nAs eye catching as the graphics style is, the sound design is equally as good and is an integral part of the experience. Even though the only music is during the main menu and credits, I never felt like the game was missing a soundtrack. All the sounds of the forest and the way you "listen" for clues and collectables makes your ears as valuable as your eyes as you explore.\n\nHunting for certain collectables can be a chore due to your long range "listen" ability being restricted to leading you only to story related locations. That can make for a lot of aimless wandering for completionists like me, which gets frustrating when you're still missing something after going through an area quite thoroughly. This could have easily been remedied by a late game unlock to be able to "listen" for everything. It also doesn't help that there isn't a lot of variety in environments. In fact, around the halfway point in the game zones start to blend together and no new enemies are introduced either. The final zone is very cool and unique, however. From around 50% to 85% of the way through the game is easily its weakest portion. Contributing to that is that it is around this point that you begin to identify gameplay patterns, making things feel predictable and repetitive.\n\nIf you're into murder mysteries then I suspect you'll enjoy Betrayer. Each area you visit has its own stories to tell. Some of these stories offer clues as to what's happened in the larger region in which the game is set. Others simply flesh out the local histories. It is up to you to decipher what fits into the grander scheme of things.","July 27, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer‍‍ '​‍s Dan Whitehead described as "undeniably striking". The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. Sound plays a central role in exploring the game world, as it is used to lead the player to clues and other points of interest. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map. In the game, players stealthily kill enemy conquistadors by creeping through tall grass and hiding their movements by timing them with strong gusts of wind. Enemies are killed using a variety of antiquated weaponry including bows, crossbows, pistols, muskets, and thrown tomahawks. Taking inspiration from Dark Souls, when the player dies in the game all of their items are left on their corpse at the location of death. The player then respawns at the base fort and must journey back to where they died to retrieve their items from their corpse. If the player dies again before retrieving their items, then the items on that first corpse will disappear and can not be recovered.

There is no voice acting mind you, but either way the story is well pieced together. Also for those who don't like the monochrome look, they offer the option to turn color on, how ever I highly suggest you stick to that black and white look. The game it self is not necessarily scary, though it might just be me, but the atmosphere is definitely eerie and unsettling. Stories of what become of certain victims are also quite disturbing once pieced together. The Ai is straight forward, they can hear and see you, but you can hide and mask your approaches with the wind as advertised. I wouldn't call the game open world exactly, but rather several large connected areas. It does the job of giving you the impression you're in a forest, and you're alone with the exception of some skulking phantasms.\n\nI think the game was great, but I would imagine it's not for everyone. Some might find the story and setting a bit too "artsy" or too simple to really get into. It's odd simply put.","March 25, 2014","true","10.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You can use gusts of wind to sneak up to enemies, using this and the environment for stealth works nicely. Also, the idea of using muzzleloaders with only one shot and long reload times is awesome, and makes drawn-out fights tense.\n\nMy Problem is with the Narrative of the story. There are 7 maps in the game, and only on the 5.th map, the "real" story starts. Over the course of the game, you will get hints about awesome and mysterious stories, but not a single one of them is picked up again. The "real" story of the game turns out to be the weakest, most clichéd and uninteresting story you find, with all the other mysteries just being red herrings. As for the ending, I would have been content with a sad or tragic ending. But the ending you are given is just ridiculous. It clashes with every detail of the story that you have been told earlier, and explains nothing. The "endgame", which consists of lots of backtracking, completely put me off with its clashing emotional tones.\nDon't let me fool you, the mystery of the things you find will make you invested in the game in no time. My problem is that all the mysterious happening lead up to a bland and uninteresting final game.\nFor example, the mystery of the game lead you to question the origin of the enemies you encounter (and the enemy designs are fantastic, so it first seems likely to suspect a deeper story about where they came from and what turned them into this.) However, only one type of enemy can be connected to the story in any way, while the others are just nice ideas without any backstory.\n\nWhat I want to say, is: The gameplay first seems to promise you a deep and mysterious story, and if you take the bait, you will be heavily disappointed.\nHowever, if you can play the game just for the gameplay itself, without any interest in the story or narrative, you will have a great time.","October 26, 2015","false","18.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It's got some good ideas going for it, but there's a lot of blandness and repetition that bogs it down in the end.\n\nThe stealth gameplay is pretty decent, feeling genuinely rewarding as you successfully maneuver around in the shadows and take down unsuspecting enemies. At least at first. Sometimes when you're in a hurry to do something, all this stealth can get kind of annoying. So instead you run as fast as you can, alerting the entire forest and hucking tomahawks at everything that moves. Which is kind of satisfying... but these are pretty much the only game mechanics, so it sometimes gets a little old. There are guns and such, too, but it takes so long to reload a musket that it doesn't get much use... more of a one-shot-per-enemy-encounter type of use.\n\nThere's lots of stuff to run around and find, but there's so much of it that you would never happen upon unless you search the entire forest. But who's gonna do that? Nobody. So you have to look up a guide and compare your game map to the guide map to slowly collect everything. And there comes to be a strange satisfaction in all the tedium, but you collect everything in one area, then move onto the next one and repeat, counting how many more areas of the game there are until you're finished. And when you start to look ahead at how much more of the game there is until you're finished rather than letting it unfold on its own, that's never the mark of a good game.\n\nThe story's pretty bland and uninteresting. It's made up entirely of meeting ghosts, asking them what happened to them, then finding clues around the area and confronting the ghosts about them to unlock their memories of how they died or whom they killed, etc. The individual stories that each ghost tells are somewhat interesting but don't amount to much. It's sort of the one trick of this one-trick pony. There's an over-arching storyline that tries to connect the whole thing, but it again ends up being just another story that's sort of amusing but nothing more. However, there is also the occasional note that gives a bit of story that seems to be completely unrelated to any other parts of the story. There are some genuinely neat little stories in some of these.\n\nThe game does have a decent atmosphere, though. Its default black-and-white look with the occasional stark red highlight on points of interest and enemies is pretty captivating. Though by the end of the game, it starts to feel a little lifeless. And wouldn't you know it... it wasn't until I finished the game that I found out there are color options to play the game in full color, which looks so much better... lol. The sound design is great, giving distinct audio cues for different enemies, allowing you to pinpoint not only when an enemy is close, but what kind of enemy it is and where it is, so you can get the drop on it.\n\nI can't tell if Betrayer is trying to be a horror game or not. It's not scary. However, it does do some cool things. The presentation of ringing a town's bell to change the scenery from day to spooky night is startling and very well done. The ending's not very good, nor did I care enough about the story even if it was, but the very final moment of the game, although confusing, was actually pretty freaky. I have no idea what it meant, but I like freaky, so props for that.\n\nAnyway...\n\n4/10","July 25, 2014","false","15.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

They rapidly desending into who has the most health, and do you have enough "water skins" to heal you if you fail in the first category. once the enemy spots you it's like they throw some unseeable flare that alerts everybody in the near 5 mile raduis that they found some nice noms.

No the flare onl goes away after you killed every enemy chasing you, and all the enemies you atrracted while trying desperatley to run away , and to reload your weapon with the speed of sombody who dosn't know how to work there fingers. So the battles are poor, and the lack of meaning gives the large maps no purpose. But it looks pretty, you know if you like black and white.

Is this refreshing recipe bound to succeed?\n\nNo intro, cutscene or voiceover explains what happened. I wake up on a beach. Everything is black or white (not even gray). On the horizon I see a wrecked ship, there is only one direction I can take: A small path leading into the island.\nSoon I notice something red stand out in the monochromatic but serene looking dense forest of the island. Before I know it a Spanish conquistador with glowing red demonic eyes is out for my blood - his growl lets me know that he’s not really human anymore. Thankfully I have a bow and a knife to defend yourself.\n\nAfter these first intense moments as well as an mysterious encounter with a woman in red, Betrayer got me hooked. Venturing out into the wilderness where I discover graves, handwritten notes or other clues and hints that tell me more about what happened on the island give me the feeling that I love the most when playing a new game. Exploring and getting to know a new and strange world.\n\nYet soon after I discover that Betrayer greatest strength lies somewhere else: After some events that I don’t want to spoil you encounter ghosts of deceased that speak in riddles.\n\nThese lost souls and their story unfold like little detective cases. You need to find evidence, murder weapons or remains of the ghosts to solve what lead to their demise. Their mostly terrible fates are not only well written and interesting, they also create an atmosphere of desperation and really makes you feel that the island is not a place you wanna stay for a longer time.\n\nAs interesting as these ghost mysteries are, as problematic is their integration in the gameplay. After figuring out how the game and the environment is set up, you are basically just running from clue to clue and fight every enemy that pops up in between. The game keeps the battle interesting by offering a good weapon roster like Tomahawks, Rifles and Crossbows - all with different attributes in the RPG side of the game. The combat encourages you to plan ahead a bit as stealth gives you an advantage and realistically long reload  times force you to rather switch weapons, but after a while it gets repetitive and there aren’t really a lot of different enemy types. The AI is not really challenging as most foes just chase you straight down once they see you.\n\nAll in all, Betrayer is a very interesting game that definitely tries new things in a refreshing scenario. The visual style, the writing as well as the gameplay mechanics are good and interesting, but combat and exploration gets repetitive after the first two areas and the horror subsides after you become familiar with the few enemy types. I still enjoyed my stay on the island and would like to revisit the place in a possible sequel with more refined mechanics.","January 2, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirnameless/recommended/243120/","sirnameless","TheBraveSirRobin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirnameless/","266 products in account","One of the most well-paced, compelling and atmospheric first person "action" games I have played in a long time. I will summarize my thoughts categorically in the following bullet points.\n\n* The combat is slow-paced and challenging but ultimately rewarding. Multiple weapons are unlocked and can be upgraded throughout the game, and the variety is adequate. Enemy variety is not exceptional either, but the deliberate methodology required to dispatch hostiles reliably makes the combat more tactics focused yet somehow nothing about the it feels forced or obtrusive. In other words, you might be surprised with how enjoyable it is to exploit simple mechanics like line of sight and the terrain in order to deal with encounters creatively and effectively.\n\n* The game world is one that adequately balances the threat of the unknown with the reward of exploration. Enemies often lie in ambush when you are off the beaten paths, but collectibles and monies are scattered across the maps serve as adequate encouragement to explore. Nonetheless, it still combines well with the other aspects of the game to accomplish it's ultimate goal; you will feel as if this is truly a land of the forsaken.\n\n* The story is purposely vague at first but is willing to offer answers to those willing to go deep inside the dark and twisted rabbit hole that it is. It consists of an unexpectedly dark collection of tales about betrayal, suicide and human savagery. I thought it would simply be a matter of "we are all dead because of the spooky skeletons", but I was (un)pleasantly surprised by it, and it is this aspect of the game that is perhaps the one I find to be most memorable.\n\n* The visual aesthetics of the game are, oddly enough, the thing that I was least impressed by (and by "impressed" I mean it quite literally as "that which left the least impression on me") despite the obvious hard work that had gone into it. The enemies appeared intimidating, the items looked realistic, and the use of red to highlight objects is more than just a gimmick once you've been engrossed by the atmosphere of the game. The look of the terrain and objects in the game is all tied together very well, stylistically speaking. Besides that though, graphics are not something that I pay that much attention in a game to unless something about it is very unique. And to be frank about the black-and-white filter(s), it just felt off to me and after no more than an hour or two I had lowered the contrast and increased the saturation to slightly more natural levels. I like that the option is there for those that find it just a bit too harsh on the eyes, and I feel as if the changes I made kept the original feeling well enough to not impact my overall experience negatively.\n\n* The audio design is minimalistic, but entirely functional. Perhaps there could be more work done to add music and improve the sound effects and maybe-just-maybe add some voice acting, but I think works well enough without those things. In fact, the lack of music actually helps further impress the game's lonely and bleak atmosphere, at least for me.","January 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And in a good way.\n\nHorror surivival game where you are trying to survive and solve clues to open up the world. You start with a bow and later and you are limited with ammo so dont shoot like crazy. Good thing is that you can pick up your arrows if you dont goto far away. You will be collecting old gold coins of the scary souls you kill and with that you wiil be able to buy upgrades ex more ammo upgrades, quiver upgrades, more helath, sneaking etc. Some enemies you kill you can get weapons like a flint pistol and flint rifle, same goes here you are limited with ammo wich you can buy at store or pick up from dead enemies if you are lucky to find some.\n\nOut in the world you will be finding hidden cheasts, clues and if lucky some boxes with ammo. You can allways buy ammo from store in the unlocked camps. In the camps you can also heal yourself, phew. ;)\n\nAnyway i enjoy this game alot. Its designed to be in black and white but you can if you want put colours on but then you will loose the atmosphere the developer has put in the game. The enemies are colored red in normal world but as soon you get the soul dimension you will meet skeletons wich are white in a deeper black and scarier world dimension. You will probarly be tipping on your toes the first time. ;)\n\nI have been sneaking alot in this game because the enjoyment of putting 1 arrow kill in the head is awesome. And later  in the other dimension you will walk slow tipping because you can barely see anything but you will hear skeletons razzle but not seeing them before they are running againts you.\n\nAnother cool way If you want? You can change options so you drop your loot if killed.  If dropped you have 1 chance when you resurrect to get it back where you died. Myself is to coward and saving that option untill i have finished the game. :))\n\nGFx 8-10 (Gfx and effect is really nicely executed and the atmosphere did get me chilling cold)\nSFx 7-10 (Sounds is great in this game and i understand why they have the forrest atmosphere. cool)\nDesign 9-10 (GFx art style is really clever, you will have no problems enjoying it)\n\nPlease note! I have not finished the game because iam looking everywhere to find all hidden stuff. And iam enjoying to sneak kill those soldiers hidden. And if lucky getting some coins or weapons to use in store. ;)\n\nI will still gladly recommend this game. YES!...\n\n(I have found several spelling errors but i will sort that later becase time her is ZZZzzz )","January 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Oh my god, best dollar I ever spent. The aesthetics and the atmosphere of this game are AWESOME. Not only is it beautiful, the sound effects are just insanely immersive, from when you encounter an enemy and hear the animalistic sounds they make as they rush toward you, to when you ring a bell and find yourself in a spirit world inhabited by shades, skeletons and just plain chilling noises that unsettle the hell out of you.\n\nTrue, there's a little bit of roaming, and some people might like a world more populated with enemies, but this is personal preference, and you never go too long without encountering an enemy unless you happen to be wandering around in the same area after killing them. People have also complained about the combat saying it's slow and clunky. I may have crapped myself on occasion when trying to reload a musket or a pistol and I'm having to ♥♥♥♥ around just in order to take one shot, but, as far as I understand the weapons, this is just being true to them, and, to tell the truth, it makes combat a lot more intense than if you shooting your pistol/musket/bow as if it were an uzi.\n\nIn short, I think this game is class - my first impression was that it was an awesome game for a dollar, but, truth be told, I'd pay a hell of a lot more for it.","February 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll try and cover some of those points.\n\nFirst of all, the game is very visually striking...  Sometimes too much so.  The eerie, black and white contrast certainly gives a rather cinematic sense at some points, and since most important things have some red to them it can be easy to pick out the things you should be paying attention to.  However, I eventually found it tiring and went on to spend some time tooling around with the graphics settings...\n\nAs it turns out, the game's graphics actually have quite a bit of color to them, and are very pretty even when not going for the marketed look.  I would recommend any player to try mixing and matching a bit, finding a mix that you find most pleasing.  I wound up going through most of the game with a "normal, slightly washed-out" look that I felt showed off the color palette while still contributing to the game's haunted atmosphere.  All in all, the environments are very pleasing, respectably varied (considering you can't exactly go hog wild with biomes in New England) and something I got comfortable with rather than got bored of.\n\nNow, at this point we have to actually look at the gameplay part of the game, and there are a few things that break down here...  There's no voice acting, but personally I think it's better not to have any than to have too much of the bargain variety.  Combat is probably going to throw a lot of people off, because it's not what you might expect from the previews (I certainly didn't expect it).\n\nIf you're looking for a realistic combat simulation of discovery-age fighting, you're barking up the wrong tree.  This is a back-to-basics shooter where enemies can see you from a mile away unless you're prescribing to the somewhat arbitrary "stealth" mechanics, and who will then beeline directly towards your position while firing or slashing mercilessly and without form.\n\nIt's not Mount and Blade, it's Quake.  It's a bit of a jarring system, what with how advanced and complex a number of fighting systems have become over the past era in the gaming industry, but once you get used to it and wrap your head around it it's not that bad.  You'll have to kind of compartmentalize it away from the rest of the game, because between the very game-y combat "feel" and the at times hilarious ragdolling, it doesn't *exactly* fit in with the rest of the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe game has got some absolutely fantastic sound direction, and I just realized I meant that half-literally...  Instead of an "objective compass" or other big arrow on the screen telling you where to go, there's a command to "listen", which will cause the nearest quest item or person to send out what effectively amounts to a ping.  By listening for the ghostly whoosh of wind, you can tell what direction it's in and roughly how far away it is.  It's also worth noting that it will point you in the direction of quests you haven't even started yet, so it makes "clearing out" each zone reasonably simple.\n\nThe game's enemies, despite being almost entirely humanoid, use animal noises to communicate.  This starts off being more just of a curious footnote when you're fighting off the growly-snarly spaniards early on and their wolf/bear noises, but later in the game you come across natives who communicate to each other using whooping, warbling bird calls.\n\nI make special note of this because it is amazingly creepy and suspenseful.  The little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are damn hard to pick out from the foliage at times, and in groups they can be quite dangerous...  Hearing that bird call when you're out searching the woods will make you instantly drop into a crouch and double-check your weapons and health to make sure you can survive a potential conflict...  Which there almost certainly will be, because even trying to escape may result in you blundering into them by accident, as evidenced by the predatory screech they'll let out once they've spotted you.\n\n\nI've mentioned the quests a couple times here, and...  Well, there's really not that much more to say.  They're quests.  You talk to someone, they say something vague, and then you have to kill someone or find something and talk to some other people before talking to them again.  The quests are all very "fetch this" or "kill that", but the writing behind them is actually very much worth a read, and some of the stories lead down twistier roads than others.  After a while, I was honestly just puttering through the required steps so that I could read the next scrap of story and find out more about all the myriad little stories kicking about, because I was geniunely interested.\n\nThe big wallop ending of the main storyline is...  Really a phone-in.  It is.  The Big Ending is not that great, and it really just smacks of early development that never got out of being "early".  There are also some minor bits and pieces of interaction with the main countercharacter in the game, the mysterious Lady in Red, which are a bit arcane...  Through completing quests you will wind up with certain trinkets or mementos that you can then offer to give to her, at which point you need to explain *WHY* you're giving it to her...  If she likes your answer, she'll like you more, and if she doesn't, she'll be pissy...  This has no real effect other than getting or not getting some items at the end of the game, but it's a bit irritating that you have no idea how she'll respond to any one tone or statement and basically just have to guess what the "right" answer would be.  Oh, yeah, and it might also screw with your being able to complete the final quest the "good" way, minor detail that...\n\n\nAll in all, Betrayer is definitely worth a play.  The fighting is jarring at first but becomes greatly satisfying once you develop your deep-seated hatred for the various enemies in the game.  The sound direction is a bit empty at times, but otherwise is deeply refreshing and immersive.  The graphics are at best stunningly gorgeous, and at worst rather janky and headache-inducing...  Player meddling is encouraged.  Despite its numerous flaws, I went from being at first disappointed to being pleasantly surprised by the experience of playing it, and I do not regret buying it in the slightest.\n\nI wish the developers all the best in their future endeavours, and hope to see a more fleshed-out example of what they were going for here...  Because I think that if they'd had the time and money they needed to see Betrayer become what they set out to make, then it would have been spectacular, rather than just good.","January 29, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's strange - both visually and in terms of plotline. It's also nearly as vague in its explanation of the world as Dark Souls is vague in its everything, as you receive all your information from various clues and paper scraps scattered throughout the different zones. However, after you grow accustomed to the grayscale world and its darker counterpart, you'll come to appreciate this colour scheme as well as the superb employment of sound and tension as you uncover the island's mysteries.

In my mind, it ups the bar. No more excuses for garbage pixel art assets with the "retro" cop out because the devs wanted an art budget of $1.50. Step your game up, indies. Blackpowder just served you.\n- The default desaturated filter is interesting, and I can appreciate it for what it is. That being said, you can absolutely play the game in color, and I set mine to be in color within the first hour. This doesn't apply to Otherworld (which will make sense once you play the game).\n- The setting and story are cool, and I thoroughly enjoyed the investigation aspect of it.\n\nThe bad:\n- Lack of polish, particularly with audio. There are almost no sounds in this game. No music at all.\n- The investigation aspect falls into the same trap as a lot of games with investigation: too much walking. Walking is not gameplay, but you're going to be doing a lot of it, even with quick travel.\n- The ending is utter crapola. I won't spoil it here, but it's pretty contrived and pointless.\n- Speaking of pointless, you can run around the handful of maps after beating the game, for some reason.\n- It's very short. I beat it with 100% completion in less than 10 hours.\n\nThough I could come up with more bad than good bullet points, I think the good points are worth more.

In the case of Betrayer, the convention break to get used to is painfully long reload time with muzzle loaded muskets and ball and powder pistols. It's one of the few games I've played where the reload time really does force you into cycling through your weapons because you just won't have time to reload them when being chased by multiple enemies. I think it could have gone further in this area, since there's 5 primary weapon types but you can only equip 3. I would have loved to cycle through them and fire them off, then swap to another, fire its one shot, etc.\n\nThe story is interesting. It's something that only works in text, which is always interesting to observe. This is because the words being said by characters are true, but the picture they paint quite often is not, which was a really unique experience in a world full of unreliable narrators.\n\nThe core mechanics for the story progression start off intriguing and fresh, but by the first couple of areas, you'll have pretty much seen what you'll be doing the rest of the game. That doesn't mean it isn't intriguing, however.\n\nIf you like slower paced, atmospheric first person games, you should check out Betrayer.","October 5, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I caught it on a sale and it was a great purchase.  I'm very impressed with my brief playtime so far.\n\nThere are two things that stand out when you first start.  The peaceful, but eerie quiet and the washed out sort of black and white visuals.\n\nSound:\n\nThe simplicity in the sounds almost builds suspense, kinda like when there are no animals making sound in the woods.  This put me on edge and it especially highlighted the sound effects that were emphasized.\n\nVisuals:\n\nIf the black and white appearance isn't your thing, I'm told that it can be altered in the settings.  Personally I think it's a brialliant design choice.  With the low color, the reds focus your attention on important NPCs and objects.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe combat is feels fluid and projectiles really feel like they connect with enemies.  There's an element of stealth that is suggested early in the game.  You're advised to move with the sound of the wind to avoid attracting enemy attention.  It feels like you can get their attention from a good distance and they do not waste any time engaging.\n\nI've uncovered some mysterious story elements that has me very curious.

Is this refreshing recipe bound to succeed?\n\nNo intro, cutscene or voiceover explains what happened. I wake up on a beach. Everything is black or white (not even gray). On the horizon I see a wrecked ship, there is only one direction I can take: A small path leading into the island.\nSoon I notice something red stand out in the monochromatic but serene looking dense forest of the island. Before I know it a Spanish conquistador with glowing red demonic eyes is out for my blood - his growl lets me know that he’s not really human anymore. Thankfully I have a bow and a knife to defend yourself.\n\nAfter these first intense moments as well as an mysterious encounter with a woman in red, Betrayer got me hooked. Venturing out into the wilderness where I discover graves, handwritten notes or other clues and hints that tell me more about what happened on the island give me the feeling that I love the most when playing a new game. Exploring and getting to know a new and strange world.\n\nYet soon after I discover that Betrayer greatest strength lies somewhere else: After some events that I don’t want to spoil you encounter ghosts of deceased that speak in riddles.\n\nThese lost souls and their story unfold like little detective cases. You need to find evidence, murder weapons or remains of the ghosts to solve what lead to their demise. Their mostly terrible fates are not only well written and interesting, they also create an atmosphere of desperation and really makes you feel that the island is not a place you wanna stay for a longer time.\n\nAs interesting as these ghost mysteries are, as problematic is their integration in the gameplay. After figuring out how the game and the environment is set up, you are basically just running from clue to clue and fight every enemy that pops up in between. The game keeps the battle interesting by offering a good weapon roster like Tomahawks, Rifles and Crossbows - all with different attributes in the RPG side of the game. The combat encourages you to plan ahead a bit as stealth gives you an advantage and realistically long reload  times force you to rather switch weapons, but after a while it gets repetitive and there aren’t really a lot of different enemy types. The AI is not really challenging as most foes just chase you straight down once they see you.\n\nAll in all, Betrayer is a very interesting game that definitely tries new things in a refreshing scenario. The visual style, the writing as well as the gameplay mechanics are good and interesting, but combat and exploration gets repetitive after the first two areas and the horror subsides after you become familiar with the few enemy types. I still enjoyed my stay on the island and would like to revisit the place in a possible sequel with more refined mechanics.","January 2, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In the case of Betrayer, the convention break to get used to is painfully long reload time with muzzle loaded muskets and ball and powder pistols. It's one of the few games I've played where the reload time really does force you into cycling through your weapons because you just won't have time to reload them when being chased by multiple enemies. I think it could have gone further in this area, since there's 5 primary weapon types but you can only equip 3. I would have loved to cycle through them and fire them off, then swap to another, fire its one shot, etc.\n\nThe story is interesting. It's something that only works in text, which is always interesting to observe. This is because the words being said by characters are true, but the picture they paint quite often is not, which was a really unique experience in a world full of unreliable narrators.\n\nThe core mechanics for the story progression start off intriguing and fresh, but by the first couple of areas, you'll have pretty much seen what you'll be doing the rest of the game. That doesn't mean it isn't intriguing, however.\n\nIf you like slower paced, atmospheric first person games, you should check out Betrayer.","October 5, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I caught it on a sale and it was a great purchase.  I'm very impressed with my brief playtime so far.\n\nThere are two things that stand out when you first start.  The peaceful, but eerie quiet and the washed out sort of black and white visuals.\n\nSound:\n\nThe simplicity in the sounds almost builds suspense, kinda like when there are no animals making sound in the woods.  This put me on edge and it especially highlighted the sound effects that were emphasized.\n\nVisuals:\n\nIf the black and white appearance isn't your thing, I'm told that it can be altered in the settings.  Personally I think it's a brialliant design choice.  With the low color, the reds focus your attention on important NPCs and objects.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe combat is feels fluid and projectiles really feel like they connect with enemies.  There's an element of stealth that is suggested early in the game.  You're advised to move with the sound of the wind to avoid attracting enemy attention.  It feels like you can get their attention from a good distance and they do not waste any time engaging.\n\nI've uncovered some mysterious story elements that has me very curious.  I can't wait to find out where the game leads.","October 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's probably easiest if you keep everything enabled on the map screen so you can see where everything is and just walk there without looking for it, if you turn all that off you might spend a whole lot longer in the game looking for everything so that's probably ideal for a lot of people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/243120/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Betrayer is a game made by Blackpowder Games, a new development studio made up of members split off from Monolith Games, the creator of many of my favorite games. I don't know who went where in the split between what now remains of Monolith and what is now Blackpowder Games, but considering one group went on to make a creative and unique game called Betrayer and the other went on to mash together Ubisoft's franchise catalogue into one big homogenized Lord of the Rings game, I think it's somewhat clear to me which group to look forward to in the future.\n\nBetrayer is largely a game about exploration, and the game's design works fairly well towards it. The game's art style is mostly monochrome (though you can change the color settings in the options if you're a big loser baby), which both gives it a really great look and also serves a gameplay purpose by using color to define things like enemies and items. Sound is also used pretty extensively, serving as your compass as well as providing positional audio cues to help you find enemies before they find you, so headphones are recommended. The combat and story are also well-executed, and finding the stories of each of the members of the settlement is a lot of fun.\n\nHowever, one thing I will note is that the game has changed since I played it in Early Access. In the original releases, you were left to navigate on your own, using the map like you would a real one and navigating using landmarks and sounds. This worked really well in my opinion, and added a lot immersion to the exploration that made it feel like you were navigating a world on your own and not just following a dot on the map. But at some point along the line they updated the game, adding markers to the map that display both your position and the position of almost everything there is to find in the game. This isn't a deal-breaker, as these can all be disabled in the options, but I want to mention them because I would very highly recommend doing so as soon as you get the opportunity to. Leaving the map markers on is practically the equivalent of playing the game with a walkthrough, and I really wish they had defaulted them to being off so that they didn't encourage new players to play the game with them on and just follow the dots.","September 20, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

As the game progresses you will learn what to look and listen for and figure out the different mechanics and types of enemies. So far so very good. But for me the last part of the game just absolutely ruined it. It feels completely unpolished and simply frustrating. So far the game was a solid 78/100 for me, but the last part drops it somewhere where I didn't finish the game myself but watched the rest in a youtube-video. In the spoiler I will explain, why:\nAfter you discovered all the wraiths, pretty much cleared all the areas and your equipment is so good that killing enemies is easy you have to release all the wraiths in order for the story to progress. If you try to take on the final boss before that it will just spawn endless waves of monsters. Now here is the thing: For some wraiths I apparently missed some stuff, so I couldn't release them all even though I collected all the clues and had no more talking-options available. So the game apparently needs me to search all the maps all over again because I missed something small somewhere. Without an indicator where you found something or where you had been already (like a fog of war on the map f.e.) this becomes an absolutely frustrating experience. Also the ending is bad, because unnecessarily unexplainable and it feels very rushed. Would not recommend like this.","May 4, 2014","false","12.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanaev/recommended/243120/","Kanaev","Kanaev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanaev/","444 products in account","You wake up on a shore. You know nothing. Nothing is explained. You start to trot around. Break some boxes. Find a path and move yonder.\nAt some point an arrow strikes the wood near you. It is a note that tells you to get out.\nYou wander around the island. Meet friendly inhabitants. Die from them. Kill them. Find clues about the past of the island.\nYou're still rather unsure about your objective. You find some piles of dirt that you can not dig. Rather demon~ish looking soldiers are all over the place and are trying to kill you. Some strange merchant leaves his wares with notes for you to purchase, which is strange. All his wares are here - lying in the chest. No one guards them. And yet our protagonist can't take them for free, looks like his conscience would kill him in his sleep if he takes anything without leaving a payment. So we always pay. And merchant leaves new wares and more notes about how grateful he is that we actually pay.\n\nUntil you come across the first Fort and ring a bell - it's all hard to understand. It's even more confusing afterwards, but not for long.\nYou come to the Fort. Find and ear, eye, tongue, bell. Why would you take those things? Why not?! Free stuff! Anyway. You hang the bell on it's place. Ring it and... kaboom. Deafening noise surrounds you. All light fades and it is not a day anymore. It's all creepy and unsettling.\nAfter wandering for a bit - you see ghosts. You start talking with them and trying to help them to remember what they forgot. At this point in the game - you're almost done, but you don't know it yet. All what's left is mechanical work. To cleanse some corruption and proceed forward / kill stuff on your way (not necessary) and get to the last location. 70% of the game is entirely optional. Except for the curiosity (I find those little stories and connections to the whole picture rather enjoyable) - there's only one reason to help the ghosts the fight at the end of the game becomes easier, but it doesn't really matter, because you can handle it either way\nAnd another spoiler about the ghosts -\nthe thing here is - the stories are good. I liked each one of them. But there's a certain pattern - everyone is a bad person. You can start talking with a dead soldier and he would say how he misses his friend playing on a flute. You wander around. Find his friend and turns out that the first soldier killed his friend because he discovered that the soldier was a traitor. And the thought when the soldier killed his friend was about how he's going to miss his playing. Here. And same thing with every story. There's no good characters.\nWhere am I going - in the end we have to do a great backtracking and to visit every ghost we've freed (or are yet to free). But it's not troublesome. Because now wee need them to go and we have an option with each of them - comfort or crush. We can say "It's all right. No need to wish for different outcome. Be free" or we can say "You're a sick monster who tied your wife to the tree and let wolves eat her alive. You cut throat of your daughter because she was pregnant with a child of savage and sent your men to kill another one, for she discovered what you've done. You shall forever burn in hell." and it was great.\n\nNow your objective is clear. Here's a ghost. Ghost doesn't remember ♥♥♥♥. You ask the last he remembers. He tells us some clue / location / deed / name. We proceed from that, most likely meet some foes on the way, and uncover his past. He remembers what he forgot - we're done. Like a detective. There're several ghosts around the island and all of them are optional. - That's 90% of the game. Sad, but true. After a certain point you start to understand it and the game feels repetitive. The only thing that drives you on are the stories of the ghosts and finale.\n\nWhen you're not being detective (or rather in between of it) - you kill stuff. Kinds of different stuff.\nThe combat system in this game is enjoyable. You have a long bow, short bow, crossbow, pistol and musket. You plunder weapons of different quality from defeated foes or you can buy them from the store.\nThere is a stealth system. The enemies have the same sight distance as you do. So it's not wise to simply run around - leads to a higher chance of being spotted from afar. You can mask your movements with bushes and grass and move while the wind roars to hide your sounds.\nYou can enhance your abilities by finding / buying charms. They increase your movement speed, reload, hp, your melee speed and attack, reduce the chance of being spotted - that kind of stuff. You can have equipped only three at a time and trough the game you will change your setup of charms more than once or twice.\nIn the end all this gives us a very enjoyable stealth-shooter, where you're not limited to either and can play as you wish. I liked it a lot. The encounters are memorable and breathtaking.\n\nKilling aside - atmosphere. Rather strong part of the game. It leaves you horrified and in anxiety. "Horror" might fit it, but it's more of a thriller. The b/w is incredible for atmosphere, it sets the right mood for the game and themes the game touches, for the plot itself. I never played this game with color (I know they added an option), but still - I do not recommend you to play with one. Part of the incredible atmosphere would be lost.\n\nSound. The sounds of environment, enemies - there's not a lot of them, but they're all in the right places and sound RIGHT. They create atmosphere. You can even navigate by sound. There's a "listen" ability (not your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with seeing enemies through the walls like in Last of Us or smth) - you press a button and protagonist starts to listen. And by hearing and moving your mouse you can pinpoint the location of where a place of interest might be.\nThe only thing that I don't like - is that how quiet muskets and pistols are. Like come on! They should sound like thunder. I own a charleville myself and that thing can set off alarms of the whole neighborhood when fired! And maybe the sound of arrows strucking the armor is a little silly. Sounds a little comical. But still. The sound is incredible.\n\nThe ending left me horrified and with a lot of questions without answers. Is it good or bad thing - I don't know. But I hope for sequel. I enjoyed the game a lot.","November 2, 2014","true","11.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

With only a fistful of enemy types, no bosses and only one model for each weapon with new versions simply increasing stats there's really nothing here but the lore and environment, which you will spend A LOT of time walking through.\n\nI still recommend the game because that lore is surprisingly good. It's split up into short bits (ghosts remember things as you remind them, short blurbs written about things you find, scraps of pages strewn about) so you won't feel like you're just reading a book. The game is composed of about a dozen short stories about the life of people in this lost colony, coming together to explain the source of all the madness around you.\n\nRated -1/10, with all eleven points deducted for not having an autorun key.\n\nRecommended for anyone who's into lore and mysteries, and has a stack of quarters on hand to hold down the W key for them, though $20 was definitely way too much for such a short game.","May 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The storyline is as follows, you wake up in a strange place with amnesia as you do in all horror games and then decide to make your way into the woods. You soon come across basic weapons as well as easy to kill enemies, You also find out that you are being followed my a mysterious maiden in a red cloak who most likely became lost on her way to granny's and stumbled into betrayer. After you exit the starting path you find yourself in a more open area with an abandoned English settlement where you can perform a large variety of interactions including having the ability to access a completely unmaned store that you still have to pay for for some reason, you can talk to the maiden in red who will ask you to find her lost sister, you can find clues as to what happened to the town, you can use one of the games almighty waterbarrels which restore all your health, and lastly, you can ring the bell that takes you into dark world. Dark world is a (predictably) much darker version of the regular world except you can talk to the shades in the settlements, the regular conquistador enemies will be replaced with skeletons that shoot magic missiles at you, and lastly you can cleanse the totems which involves fighting off a few waves of skeletons. If you cleanse all three totems in an area, you'll be allowed to travel to the next area.\nStealth combat consists of either sneaking up to the conquistadors and putting an arrow through their skull, however if you're spotted then the game really urges you to have pinpoint acuracy because only a headshot will take down an enemy in one hit and when ammo is rare and your firearms have fifteen second reload times you really don't want to miss. However I cannot stress how satisfying it is to kill enemies in this game. The sound of a helmet being forced in followed by the crack of a skull breaking of an enemy that kills you in three hits feels amazing. My only complaints with this game are that a lot of the time you have no idea what you're doing and there aren't many guides online to help, the NPC's all have the personality of a baked potato, and that there isn't really much of a penalty for dying.\n\nSo just to clarify\nPROS;\n-capturing story\n-beautiful, fresh art style\n-simple barter system\n-Dark/light world theme works very well\n-simple, yet immensely satisfying combat\n\nCONS\n-combat can be a little too easy if you have easy access to a water barrel\n-Charecters can be dull at times\n-you get lost, A LOT\n\nOverall I would give this game an 8 out of 10 and would recomend it to anyone even remotely interested in this game.","November 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was very interested in this game with its exceptional graphics for an indie game, deep mystery, and subtle horror genre inspirations. However, the one thing that holds this game back is combat. You use a bow, a gun, a tomahawk, and there isnt a whole lot of difference between them. Stealth is basically nonexistant, so youll be duking it out with what appears to be the same enemies consistently and based on other reviews, it seems there is no boss type fights in this game. If you can get past the combat, the story and atmosphere are a 10/10, so itd be worth a shot for you.","December 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Something went awry with my schedule however. I was all set to review some game that some right old knob has been asking me to review for a while when I saw that there was a Steam sale. 'Blimey', I thought,' I wonder if any recomended games would be worth buying'. You see, I take punts on games like these. More obscure games that have some sort of gimmick bolted onto the end of it. So I bought the Betrayer.\nNow I love atmospheric games and having recently weaned myself off Alien Isolation with a bit of Outlast and Betrayer, I have to say I've been craving more. The Betrayer IS an atmospheric game for damn sure. Made by Blackpowder games, this black and white tale takes place in New England and if you're from New England then allow me to tell you that New England actually means America. You arrive stranded on a beach, waking in a anamnesia state with your vision blurred and no other backstory about how you actually got there, so basically just my average Sunday. You can see a few ships off the coast, however you never seem to try to make contact with them. Odd enough when you consider that you are supposed to be trapped there. From there you take a linear path up to your first location serving as the only form of communication between player and game, which is pretty much how the game starts to go on. You are not lead through the game thats for sure. Once you find the first location, Fort Henry, you're pretty much on a free reign to discover at your own pace all the while being blue-balled by a literal red riding hood.\n\nThe game's gothic influence is a strong aspect I have to say. There's no disputing the fact that the eerie sound design, black and white (with a hint of red) visuals and the spooky monsters you fight all fit the bill of old gothic literature. Having said that though, it reminded me more of those old horror films set in time periods similar to this one (17th century) like Witchfinder General and other masterpieces that have been cut from the same cloth. It's definitely not Five Night's at Freddies where things jump out at you for a few minutes before passing out face-first into the dirt, but Betrayer is asking for more than three pound fifty, so it knows it needs to grip the viewer preferably by the gonads as you're lead through dark forests and solve elaborate and chilling mysteries of the land's previous inhabitants. The lack of direction may be a middle finger to some players who are used to the half arsed games like Skyrim where you can click a location to immediately and inexplicably warp there. In Betrayer you can only use this trick if you're in the specific location and only to travel to the predetermined 'safe points'. I gotta admit, I quite like this system. There will no doubt be a literal horde of angry GTA fans, still wounded from last week, that will claim that the game doesn't direct you enough, but that's just it. The beautiful thing about this system is that you are lost, destined to wander the world in search of the next enlightening piece of the story pie. It feels atmospheric and gothic with only a slight whiff of the pretentious artsy-ness about it which only becomes obvious when the black and white mode is on (which you have the option to switch off).\n\nIf I were a gambling man, I'd be ready to say that you may be worried for my health at this point viewer. After all, I am the kind of guy who's idea of a wild night is to sit in his room with an oil burner silently getting drunk and slinking into the arms of the weeping abyss of self loathing. But even I like things, and the Betrayer is one of the things I like. It oozes atmosphere all over the place which is pretty difficult to explain when people come to visit. Guest scaring aside however, I like the Betrayer because it's something a bit new. I could play through the thousands of modern warfare games in a week and walk away like I've just been given a frontal wedgie by Hulk Hogan, or I could sit down to play some original games. Sure, modern warfare games are good for spectacle if nothing else but that's not what a game is there for. If someone said you were going to watch a good film and hands you a book that's just a lie and it's the same principle when a game developer gives you what amounts to a film with a few button prompts. Luckily the Betrayer doesn't betray the gaming audience and instead gives us an atmospheric and mysterious little gem that's got a few cracks in it, but ultimately would make Indiana Jones a very happy man.\n\nHaving said that, there is a point in this game where the atmosphere receives a little hairline fracture. If you've played the game you'll know what I'm talking about because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I want you to let me know if you had the same experience. It's a moment in the game where straight-up combat takes sway and you're forced to fight wave after wave of evil dudes, kind of like World War 2 without the fast pace of a heavy machine gun. For the combat here is effective yet slow. As to be expected with a company that names itself after a slow-firing weapon, the combat has some pacing issues in that fighting large numbers of lads can result rather quickly in your brutal demise, which is fine... For a while. However when you're only way to stop the armoured target running towards you is to shoot him with a horribly inaccurate blackpowder weapon that has a 10% chance of deflecting off of the target and there's five of the buggers now so hurry you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I can't help but wonder if there's a bit of a design flaw. I would say that it's intended though. As I mentioned, when you're fighting a reasonable amount of guys with rusty, inaccurate and slow-firing weapons, the encounters with the fast brutal enemies can become all that more intense. After all, man hath no fear of hell, if handed a high-grade assault rifle.\n\n8/10- Yes! I've done it! A good review! Well, as good as I can get before downing the rest of the bottle and passing out in a road side ditch.\n\nPlease be sure to stop by my site to egg me on in my content and help support me and what I do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yearight/recommended/243120/","yearight","tripmind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yearight/","150 products in account","Good: The visual style is a smart way for players to seek small details in a seemingly endless forest. There are plenty of notable audio cues to guide the player to important quest objects as well as to detect enemies hidden in the forests. The combat mechanics are mostly well built and well polished, the encouters are mostly well balanced with just the right amount of complexity to make them challenging. The writing is creative even to the very end of the game and will still draw enough interest to carry on the story. The visual tones and audio cues allow this game to have a daunting feeling, even when you're 6 hours into the game, you'll steel feel some chill when you go into darkness.\n\nBad: The stealth mechanic is gimmicky, once you shoot an enemy your position is immediately known by all enemies within range of that enemy. 100% stealth kills is not possible in this game. The listening mechanic is also a gimmick that forces that game into a completely linear experience. While it may be possible to complete investigations in different orders, relying on listening will ensure that you complete the game in the same sequence every single time. They should have just used quest markers like in skyrim, it serves the exact same purpose while saving the player some extra time that is spent honing in on ghosts/objectives. Exploring and finding chests simply is not that rewarding, aside from the slight chance that you'll find a very good weapon, most of the time you'll just get some gold or a charm that you might not even want to use. Perhaps if they didn't have anything interesting to put in such a big forest, then maybe they shouldn't have spent the time on making it so big in the first place.\n\nUgly: This game simply turns into a linear chore after a while. You gather all the evidence while in light, then go into darkness and follow a string of dialogue and other bits to finish that zone. In essence this game is comparable to "Dear Esther" with some combat thrown into the mix. The primary content of the game revolves around going from place to place and reading dialogue. The combat itself might have some polished mechanics, its simply ruined by the unnecessary gear level system. There are like 4-5 different qualities of each weapon, and each one does slightly more damage than the last. the improvements are absolutely marginal, and in the final sequences of the game it seems frustrating that the items you just spent several thousand gold on don't seem to be making a real difference in how well you can kill things. Combine this with an annoying AI pathing system that ensures that the enemy you're about to hit with an arrow will zig zag around some terrain right as you shoot towards it, leaves the player longing for something slightly more polished and more fun.\n\nI would give this game a 7/10. It's not perfect, but its unique in its own way and offers some decent fun factor, its worth playing, but get it on sale.\n","November 29, 2014","true","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It just doesn't satisfy in any of it's claims. Perhaps as a mystery it has some interest, but I couldn't get past the overall dullness to enjoy it.\n\nAs a horror game it doesn't do much for me, sure getting my ♥♥♥ kicked by a skeletal conquistador would be terrifying in real life, but gets boring quick in this game.\n\nAs a exploration game it is beautiful. However after about 5 minutes you've seen it all, there's nothing new to see, just a large map to shlep around. To be fair this may be the best way to play the game. turn the difficulty all the way down and the color saturation all the way up and just wander around.\n\nAs a combat adventure game it just falls flat. Unless you're completely new to gaming there's nothing new here. And what is here is limited and boring. The weapons all feel the same and the enemy AI is simplistic.\n\nAs a stealth game.... Well it just isn't a stealth game, and they should never have claimed it was. They have their one unique stealth element (wind covering the sound of footsteps) but i is useless in actual gameplay. The enemy detection is absurdly high and unless you know just where they are you are going to be the one snuck up on.\n\nAgain the story is interesting, and if you can put up with the rest of this dull slog of a game to pick it out you may enjoy it.\n\n4/10","March 25","false","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

BARELY.\n\nDon't let the few hours of game-time on record fool you.\nThat is a lot of time to spend in this game, given it's mostly a jogging simulator.\nIt gets boring FAST. Can only play in "bursts". Just like running. HAHAHAH!\n\nI will only focus on the BAD.\nIf you can get past these, then buy this game!\n\n1st off, this game uses the Unreal engine...poorly. The game looks like something about 5-7 years old, but runs very poorly. Just not optimized I suppose. Skyrim came out in 2011, has vast terrain, mountains, hills, forests, you can see faraway, runs great. This game, is like taking some outdoor map in Unreal Tournament 3, and making it bland and unable to rival Skyrim graphics. Not to mention, it runs like POOP! OMG, it's a "confined area" level design, just small bumps for hills, trees, and rocks. This is inexcusable.\n\n2nd. The game plays out in Black and White. I really tried to play as intended. I had no problem with the "somethings are red, somethings are not" gimmick, but here is what killed it for me, forcing me to turn on the color: you can see better in color, it looks better, and the red became annoying. Like seriously, arrows and other weapon related items are in red. Clues, chests, things you need to find or will help you progress are red. I think the B/W was to hide the "Captain Obvious" that people couldn't find crap, so they make those things glow red, then people feel they are being hand-held, so they say "Let's make everything else black and white, this way, the things we painted red...MEAN SOMETHING. Like it HAS MEANING NOW. WHAT MEANING? I DON'T KNOW! ITS A.....MYSTERY! YES! THAT'S IT! OOOH!"\nNaaah, no thanks. It would have been cooler to play in B/W if there was tons of blood, you know, like in other FPS games using the Unreal engine (or any). Seriously. A horror-FPS-type game and there are no blood splats on the ground or everywhere? I mean, when your whole game makes "A THING" out of the color red being the only color, and it's a horror game, why make it so bloody BLOODLESS (except for a few red puffs from hits?)\n\nMakes no sense, and people will find it annoying. They'll think "OOOh Red is only color? It's a horror game? It's also FPS? I'm ready for some horror splatterfest!" Instead it's like "The Red, you see, it means something. It represents a reflection on humanity's fascination with violence and looking for truth, and answers in those truths. Take for example the history of colonialism and the native americans, which the story of the game....." BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH - that's basically the impression the game gives you throughout as far as Red relating to the story goes. Or rather, in color, as probably game was intended, Red was simply to show the clues which leads me to 3rd.\n(Quite note, I went to a pile of glowing rocks, "a clue", that gave a pop-up describing there is blood on the ground around the clue" instead of just showing it. HAHAHAH.)\n\n3rd. The game holds your hand ridiculously. You are dropped on the the coast of what I will call "Level 1". As you go through, you immediately have the "4th Wall" (those who don't know what this means should look it up) to hold your hand from the start. Wow, really? I thought. So basically, you have to figure out "what happened to the colony" or colonies since there are "Levels 1, 2, 3, etc." which each have a settlement/fort of some type. There are literally FRICKEN NOTES or clues laying in a fricken field in the middle of nowhere, or in piles of rocks. When you go to use it, you get a pop-up telling you what you find (RATHER THAN JUST SHOWING YOU lol). How to find these? Look for glowing red spots, but some are very deep so you must explore. THAT CAN TAKE FOREVER.\nSo why do that when you can simply pull-up your IN-GAME MAP of the ENTIRE "Level" that comes with a legend already marking where everything is? You can even filter it out to only show chests, only show clues, or spirits that are not actually there, in fact, some things are not even there. Instead, you have to somehow progress and unlock stages of progression to where that thing marked on your map will not spawn. This means you have to run all the way the hell back there to then continue progression so you can what? Get the hell out of that level.\nRather than have some kind of plot device or something like that in the game to give you a clue where to go, you get a map showing you. The kicker is not all things are there. So THIS, THAT, THIS clue will progress the "quest?" so THAT, THAT, and THIS clue, will be there, basically. So you will still spend the whole fracking game running around from one side of the map, to completely the other side. It feels they designed it this way to extend the play time, to make what would really be a short game, much, much, slower.\n\n4th. You die alot. The game's combat mechanics are brutally frustrating. If they are going for realism, I GET IT, musket weapons take forever to load. But if going for realism....why are weapon racks "Stores" where you can buy/sell stuff? Why can't I buy health potions? Instead, you have to drink from a glowing red barrel of water, that doesn't heal you right away. Instead, you store up "invisible" health potions and usually third time you heal fully. That's great.\nSo, you leave a place that is at, and then get attacked. You get shot, arrowed, fisted, and almost dead, using up your "healing water invisible things" only to have to go back and get another drink of water from the barrel. SO, can you imagine? You leave the center of the "hub", immediately get attacked by 3 dudes who move very fast (and some spawn from nowhere), if you survive, you have to run back to refill. Then, you go out again, maybe that spawn-point has refreshed, or maybe you run into another mob, and then get beat up. Then you have to run all the way back again. In one level, they put a barrel on the road. HOW NICE OF THE DEVELOPERS TO DO THAT!\nSo, the whole "realism" thing is a completely mental argument. If it was done for the sake of horror, that makes more sense but still sucks compared to the combat mechanics, and people complain. You can take the stealth approach, which works best, but as some others have mentioned, as soon as you tag an enemy, the "magically" know where you are no matter what. Eventually, the game turns into a death-fest and "avoid the spawn point" fest.\nOH, AND GET THIS, THIS IS THE BEST: If you die: you simply respawn! Of course, you respawn back to wherever the game decides was your last "checkpoint" (it was never clear on this). But so do all of the enemies, and all the respawn points reset too. That means, you get to run the FRAGGIN gauntlet ALL over again.\nIt becomes like playing an old-school game where you have to "beat a level" and it's a tough level, and you always die, but you have unlimited lives to keep trying and trying. "Like someone unraveling a cable-net sweater you keep on knitting, and knitting, and knitting, and knitting, and knitting....hegh-hegh!"\n\n5th. It feels like what we are playing is not the original intended design of the game. Almost as if people complained about so many things, that they did all those things I mentioned above.\n\nLast. Why recommend? The game succeeds with the, albiet illusionary, non-linear design. Here is the next "map". Figure it out. Collect the pages. Whatever. The sound design is excellent as is some of the art style, the dark-world mode is incredibly creepy and works well. They hit the right marks in all other areas than what I mentioned (REMEMBER, I spoke of the bad only).  If you want a game with great atmosphere, a bit of freedom to explore (try it without using the map!), some interesting surprises, then buy it. Prepare to spend 90% of your game time, running around. This game requires A LOT of patience. GO INTO THE GAME WITH THAT IN MIND, and you'll be fine. Maybe, play at a party where everyone is wild.

Luckily, I got it on recent sale at a price of a cheap chocolate bar, so the experience was well worth the money.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, Betrayer does indeed have certain things nicely done:\n+ visuals (pretty vegetation, neatly placed buildings, realistic gusts of wind, etc)\n+ nice ambience sounds\n+ actual XVI century weapons with more-or-less authentic sounding and reloading sequences\n+ no bugs (seriously, none spotted)\n+ you can fast-travel between areas and some locations\n\nHowever, everything else leaves much to be desired:\n- there is no voicing (literally none, prepare to read everything)\n- there is practically no background music (wasn't really a problem for me - playing some dark/tribal ambient in background did the job well)\n- a very repetitive gameplay in each area (unlock key locations by clearing them of enemies, find all clues and other crap, go into spirit world, run around talking to spirits, proceed to the next area, repeat)\n- low variety of enemies (99% of them in the real world are 'undead'/illusory spaniards and indians, while on the spirit plane there are only spoopy running skeletons and flying skulls)\n- you should've already realized that it's not exactly a 'horror' title, but rather a freeroam FPS with creepy-ish but hardly terrifying enemies\n- last but not the least: storyline gets increasingly boring and predictable; the only "twist" is at the very end and looks pathetically forced.\n\nOverall, the game seems to have never truly graduated from early access, never got properly finished. Thank goodness, the gameplay itself is neither buggy, nor especially clunky - that's one of the few redeeming aspects that make Betrayer playable.\n\n(TL;DR)\nSo, can I recommend this game to everyone?\nNope, not really. If you'd like to try an atmospheric but cheap and somewhat boring crossbreed between 'The Path' and 'Far Cry', then go ahead. However, if you're looking for a typical 'survival horror' kind of experience, you should better pass.","April 26","false","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main selling point of Betrayer is the atmosphere, but it's just stripped away from the lack of suspense. Betrayer offers a midieval stealth based combat system; the stealth based is a lie. The story is as lifeless as the aparitions telling it. The graphics, which may seem pretty at first, just start seeming bland and uninspired. It just dosent feel like this game is actaully finished. This is most evident with the combat system. Here's a list of each weapons/items I've encountered that ruin any appeal the game could have had.\n\nBow- Its not even a bow. The arrows have no arc, nor does the bow or any other weapon have recoil/spread. Your cursor is a white dot that never changes from weapon to weapon.\n\nTomahawk- This thing just breaks any fear you would have had from the enimies. Every enemy I've hit with this thing died instantly no matter were I hit them; every other weapon requares a headsot for an istant kill.\n\nThe knife- Why even use this if you have the tomahawk?\n\nThe flask- Not a weapon, but this is another major factor that ruins the horror and diffiulty. Its basically a health potion which heals about half your health instantly. This just lets the player run up to an enemy, heal any damge just dealt, and throw a tomahawk right into the enemy's face. There's also barrals to refell your flask scattered everywere.\n\nI also would like mention that the only difficulty setting this game has is an option to make the enemys weaker. Thing is that the Ai is so stupid that I can just run around in circles, and for the most part come out unharmed.\n\nI've been reading other reviews saying that this game has been in early access. Is this what Steam calls finished?\n\np.s.- You can buy Amnesia: A machine for Pigs for about the same price as this game","March 26, 2014","false","1.3"," 22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","22","46","0","0"

I bought it, though I am not into FPS but I believed that with its atmosphere It could amaze me.\n\nI was so freaking wrong.\n\nI do not have any problem with the atmosphere, the beginning was so promising until the appearance of the wraith and a red hooded girl. I said well, I want to know what happened to these people. I was exciting to reveal what's behind all of it.\nThen I went out to the black and white world which was definitely empty and boring. Geez, literally nothing out there just those zombie-like Spaniards, who attack you in sight. Sometimes we bump into treasures and we need to dig now and then.\n\nAnd then the gameplay... I like hard games, I remember how hard Stalker was, two shots and you are dead. But there was something to balance its hardness: tactics, you could hide and get closer to them, find another way to hunt the enemies down etc. Not to speak of the Gothic series. If you took the wrong path, you were dead.\n\nBut here: they say you can get close to the enemy by using the wind. I had no chance to make use of it. They see me from a long distance even if I was sneaking. Most of the time, I could not even get close enough to kill them with my bow. And when they see you, they just rush like hell towards you. The only option is to run away, turn around and shoot, then run, turn around and shoot until you die, because you will die, a lot. The problem is not this but the fact that there is no reward. I don't feel, after killing the big, rock-throwing guy for example, that yeaaah I made it, (I died 5-6 times before). In games after dying, you should feel that probably you made a mistake, that if you had used a different way to get through, you would be alive now, then you try it again. Frustration comes when you start feeling that you are not the responsible of your death. In this game, I feel I am not to blame, I think in this case the devs are the cause of this.\nWell, I just lost my interest after all, I got so frustrated because of the numerous deaths. When playing you need to feel that it was worth suffering so much, but after I kill a Spaniard just look around and I feel loneliness, I see a forest without life around me and don't feel like playing this game anymore. It is so sad because it could have been something, there is something in this game but ... It seems to be unfinished, it needs to be filled up with more life and content.","August 8, 2014","false","3.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/er_red/recommended/243120/","er_red","ZaZu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/er_red/","239 products in account","Betrayer is a nice game, but you shouldn't get any false expectations.\n\nFor starters, it's not a horror game. It's not scary. Well, sometimes you'll be startled, but mostly it's just creepy and unsettling. Something like an Edgar Poe story.\n\nAnother thing - there's not much going on. You'll be running around, occasionally fighting skeletons and such, reading notes and trying to find all clues before proceeding to the next area. Yes, it's repetitive. There's almost no gameplay progression throughout the entire game, except for some tougher enemies introduced and some new equipment gathered. Once you learn the mechanincs the game becomes quite easy, too. Especially since you have infinite respawns, as well as infinite sources of loot.\n\nIf these characteristics don't look like critical flaws to you, well, then you'll most certainly enjoy what Betrayer has to offer:\n\n- Story. Remember what i said about Edgar Poe? Add some Fenimore Cooper to the mix and wrap it up with Silent Hill, and you'll get a hint of what Betrayer is about. I'm not gonna say it's something AMAZING, but the setting is original, the characters are believable and the main storyline is intriguing enough to hold you tight till the end. Lots of good ol' reading, too.\n\n-Visuals. Doesn't matter if you play in monochrome, as intended originally, or if you use the full palette, Betrayer's visual style is captivating. The haunted forest you're scrambling through looks stunning in its every form, and it really helps to immerse yourself into the game's world. It's actually amazing how indie developers nowadays could achieve this without the need for high budget.\n\n-Sound. The game doesn't have much to offer in terms of different sound effects, but the ones present actually make up an imortant part of the gameplay, as you've got to listen carefully in order to find clues. This feature is implemented perfectly. Atmospheric noises are decent, too.\n\n-Gameplay. As repetitive as it gets, it's still not so bad. You get some RPG elements, like weapons ranging in quality and magic charms that boost your attributes. Exploring for clues and loot is fun, and there's also fast travel in case you'll get tired of running around. Combat gets a lot less challenging over time, rendering stealth elements almost useless, but it still feels rewarding shattering those spectres' skulls or putting down a zombie with a tomahawk.\n\nOverall, Betrayer is an enjoyable experience, with some original gameplay ideas, rather nice story and great visuals. If you like slow-paced games, centered around exploring and collecting stuff, try it out. But if you expect an action-packed heart-pounding thriller - better move along, or else you'll be disappointed.\n","November 4, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The mystery, what wiped out the whole colony is to be solved by you, an unknown adventurer in a grim world coloured by white, dark and red. Game promised to be a stealth detective horror experience, what was not always fulfilled. But let's see in detail.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Wide locations\n+ Various enemies\n+ Day/Night possibility\n+ Possibility to turn off hints and still find your goals\n- Grinding and collecting things\n- Tendency to be repetetive and boring\n- Stealth not always possible\n\nGameplay is definitely the weakest part of whole game. Though there are various locations you can explore and feel free to do so, enemies designed as Spanish soldiers, or ghosts and skeletons at night, most of the time you will be running from one end of map to another and collect things needed for the solution.\n\nProgress is linear, clear the map, release all the spirits and move to next region. I got bored several times here, even the horror atmosphere was weaker, because I could expect the same change after moving to the night and back. It seemed later to me, that day is even more scary than the night!\n\nIt states here, that it should be a stealth game, but a lot of enemies appear right next to you, when you are passing them by, so there are not a lot of chances to get them undetected. That pays also for groups, longbow or crossbow, stealthy or not, you are hunted by the whole group, does not matter what your tactics are.\n\nBut there is one point, that you cen turn off your hints and try your detective skills at their best. Good luck!\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Perfect atmosphere in a comics' book style\n+ Details of armours and colonial stuff\n- Possibility to play in regular colours\n\nAt this part of the title, I am amazed. The white-dark-red combination set a grim and uneasy atmosphere, it really has somethign from horror, I do not recommend to set natural colours, because after that, it becomes just a colonial-style FPS. What Betrayer is not at all.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Variety of characters\n+ Releasable or banishable\n- Most of them are not important for the story\n\nThere are plenty ghosts, their stories need to be revealed. You can search and find out, what was their crime, or that they were victims. But most of them are just for keeping players in the game and their only purpose is to unlock next destination. But in the end, you can decide, whether their acts are forgivable or not. Interesting point.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n+ Eerie sounds\n- Not existing\n\nEerie sounds are good for this type of game, but in the end, it is not sufficient to create all the impression from playing. It is just a part of the composition and there needs to be something more, that drives player further into the story. And there was nothing else, sadly. What a waste of potential.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBetrayer had a great potential to be one interesting and captivating game. But it seems to me, that the developers did not see, or were not able to use it all and their work acts half-finished and tacky. I was very puzzled after finishing, open end did not change anything and it was predictive as hell.\n\nTherefore, I can not recommend this game. Either buy it during a huge sale (-75% at least), or, better, watch a gameplay from YouTubers.","July 2, 2015","false","15.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Unless you play the game the exact "right" way that the devs expect you to, you can't progress.  I googled, read the forums (including dev responses) and still couldn't progress because I wasn't properly following the vague esoteric "audio clues".\n\nI had very high hopes and enjoyed the first few hours but it soon turned into a constant series frustrations. Primary among these was the fact that enemies respawn and player location resets anytime you save the game. If you clear the map of enemies and are sitting at the exit but have to save the game for any reason (yes, I have children, a job and a life outside of gaming) when you load your supposed save, you are back at the beginning and all enemies are repopulated.  Why push a boulder up the hill only to have it roll back down once you reach the top?\n\nNoble ambitions but poor execution.","May 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Betrayer is absolutely stunning visually and the use of audio is done really well, though some of the weapons could be a bit louder.  The stark contrast of the monochrome world really makes the setting, and played in a dark room it has a great immersive and eerie quality.  Headphones will enrich the experience as the developers implemented an audio waypoint system in addition to a visual one.  As I write this I am currently half way through the game and will update with more information as I dig further into the games mysteries.\n\nI have just finished the game and I must say I stand by everything stated before and then some.  The only drawback to Betrayer is the lack of voice acting, everything else about this game is fantastic.  The story is worthwhile if you don't mind reading your way through it, and the combat never lets down.

If you die again before picking them up, you lose them. I have lost a lot of items learning this the hard way.

It does provide you with a decent mystery that keeps you giong through the motions.\n\nThe gameplay is very generic, especially at first.  However it is still fun, it definitely could have been improved upon, such as the bow feels rather anti-climactic.   The way you discover clues is okay, you basically uncover parts of a story an then have to go find the rest of the story by uncovering secrets such as a body on the ground, or talking to people.\n\nThe eviornments themselves are very atmospheric and very enjoyable.\n\nA.I. is basic, there are times when they can be very challenging especially when you start to encounter different enemies.\n\nAll in all a game that could have done a lot more with what it had.

Just, not quite what I hoped.\n\nMy general feeling on this title is it just sort of throws you into a scenario with a vague sense of what to do from beginning til end. This would not be a bad thing, but the game is remarkably... well, empty. You cross large tracts of wilderness looking somewhat blindly for clues to an investigation as well as treasure. The former you can locate easily by using a special listening function whereas the latter is just a matter of being in the right place to hear the chime. There's a great deal of backtracking and exploration, which I usually like to some degree, but the landscape has very few landmarks, let alone features to it. Everything winds up looking pretty much alike and the setting (not the scenario) lacks character.\n\nAs for the plot, it mainly ties together in the end, although I didn't find the overall investigation to be particularly interesting. There's a lot of wandering from one empty town to another, reading small notes and talking to conveniently amnesiac wraiths in a poorly utilized 'otherworld', but you never really feel for anyone or care as the NPCS are a mix of boring and a--holish. It's mainly just a series of exercises that feels more like padding out the game than really telling a story, at least until the end.\n\nThere's a lot of potential in Betrayer, but it just doesn't go far enough with the premise or the writing to really sell it. I enjoy exploration titles a lot, but like many things in Betrayer, the experience is sort of empty. Mind you, I don't mean to sell this as a very negative review, but this is already a very niche title that doesn't really work for me in execution.\n\nBe advised, there is a suspicious amount of downvotes for any negative review of this title. Keep that in mind when you read the positive ones.","November 21, 2014","false","8.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

Tapi satu hal yang aneh adalah kenapa game ini hitam putih semua? okay mungkin ingin membuat game ini menjadi unik tapi buat gue malah aneh. Bukan nya bernuansa hitam putih tapi bernuansa film negatif. Tau kan film negatif? itu lho lembaran film yang belum jadi.. duh anak yang tahun 2000an pasti bingung.\n\nGameplay:Game ini berusaha menjadi RPG.. atau adventure... atau action. IDKWTFIWTG. Mungkin gue yang salah baca tag di steam atau game ini yang salah menawarkan fitur. Ketika mencapai titik ini gue udah malas melihat kembali ke dalam game. Banyak hal yang gue bisa tuliskan agar lo tidak membeli game ini. Salah satu hal yang paling krusial dari game ini adalah TIDAK ADA VOICE ACTING! Gue main 1 jam, ketemu banyak hantu dan lady in red, tapi semua dialognya ya dibaca gitu. Cmon... visual novel hentai aja ada suaranya, masa game ini gak ada? terus gue mau diharuskan baca gitu dari awal sampai akhir? males.. mendingan gue baca skripsi gue lagi.\n\nStory:Gue cuman mainin sejam dan yang gue tangkap adalah lo terdampar disuatu pulau pada tahun 1500an. Lo lari menuju benteng tapi orang orang disana udah menjadi batu. Setelah itu lo mencari misteri dibalik itu. Game ini bernuansa agak horror tapi horror yang gagal.\n\nJANGAN BELI GAME INI. Kalau lo mengharapkan petualangan yang seru, sistem RPG yang menarik, atau menikmati pemandangan virtual, beli lah game lain. Serius deh, gue berusaha untuk suka game ini tapi.. duh.. susah.","December 14, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","6"

I know that's a weird thing to say, but Betrayer turns into a literal: Go here, Touch That, Go there, Touch This, Kill that Bad Person, Kill That Other Bad Person, Touch that . . . Rince and repeat. At first, it might seem like a LA Noir find the evidence and claim things, but no... Whenever you find the evidence, you just get one option when talking to the spirits. It's always the SAME thing over and over.... Since the enviornment is always the same, a forest, it makes it even more tediously the same.\n\nThe sad thing is that the game's art direction is fairly nice and plot (although it needs more) was pretty okay. Sound effects are nice, too.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game.

The trailers and pictures make it look much different of a game than what it is. The game starts out nice enough with you crash landed, and there are good parts. The white contrast is striking and very different from anything normally used in games. The atmosphere is good with the sounds of nature, rustling of the wind, and original feeling of lonliness. Those are the only positive things to say. The game is plain boring. You wander around these giant open similar looking forests and go into empty towns for the entire game. There is no story or direction, just basically open chests, and read random scaps of paper that don't add to the game or story at all and just include things like "papa got lost in the woods tonight, guess I'll have to go find him.". The scraps don't come together in any real way and are basically incoherent and worthless. The problem is you don't know what you're doing or why you're doing it. Oh ok I found a few clues, what do those do and what am I supposed to do with them. The game never changes are there is only 1 person you see. I get the game does the "no hand-holding", but just walking around hoping to find random collectables that are impossible to see half the time because they are on the ground and not visible enough, just isn't fun. The combat is not good as guys just rush at you in giant packs and then can hit from you super far away as your guns take 20 in to reload. The money system makes no sense as you pick up 3 gold and 30 gold from chests but you need like 700 to buy 1 thing, and its an upgrade for 5 damage on a weapon so you blow all your money on nothing. The charms you wear give worthless stats like 4% better reload speed (why even waste your time making use of charms if they are a waste?). The stealth doesn't work 2/3 the time as a guy sees you while turned sideways and who is 300 feet away. You use the same 3 guns the whole game. I got stuck towards the end because even though clearing totems get's you to the next area, for this area it didn't work for some reason, and I still don't know why or what I was supposed to do instead. There are things like crosses and clues and scraps but you have no idea if you need to collect them, or they are just superfluous, or if they actually accomplish something. Back to the drawing board guys, this is literally a game wandering around collecting objects that you don't know what to do with and are hidden while you get shot at by guys that run up and stand there. No better way to describe the game. 4.5/10","January 13, 2015","false","36.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The problem is that this game is fun for about an hour at the start, and about an hour at the end, but the 5 or 6 hours in between are incredibly tedious, repetitive, and pointless.  You will run in circles for hours covering identical areas to find clues that tell you nothing and fighting the same enemies over and over, until any sense of fear or curiosity is burned out of you by sheer over exposure.  Even accidentally skipping over some minor and insignificant clue will force you to go back and search for it, only to learn that it "reveals" some uninteresting fact you had already guessed hours ago.\n\nThe sidequests are what ruin this game.  Even the sidequests that have a plot and point to them, you'll either figure out what happened or stop caring long before you finish the breadcrumb trail.  And the game forces you to do every single time sink of a sidequest to progress to the main story, requiring a huge amount of backtracking and busywork in a game that was already painfully repetetive.\n\nI would mark it as neutral, just for the visuals and sound, which are excellent, but that isn't an option.

We reported bug after bug, we got into some really good discussions with the developers where we felt they really listened to us, (and maybe a few where they didn't).  We waited for each new update andicipating some good changes.  Updates 2, 3 and 4 came within just a few weeks of each other.  Then nothing.  Then months later, bang, finished product.  But.....where is it?  Sure they completed the missing areas, and changed a bit of the storyline which made it a bit more interesting.   But the text interface still looks like it was created using notepad.  And don't give me that "we wanted to make it look old timey"  or "we wanted to make it simple like the black and white world".  That's total BS, you didn't want to spend the money on developing an interface that looks like you put some thought into it.  The map interface still sucks, where is the "you are here" marker?  It's still WAY to hard to tell game elements from background scenery, even worse from a distance.  You still can't tell which way a spaniard is facing from a distance if he's not moving.\n\nYou have to sneak everywhere, or pretty soon you'll get suddenly noticed, for no reason at all, by 7 enemies at once that converge on you from all directions.  You'll die, when you respawn, all your stuff will be in the middle of all those enemies, that ALSO respawned!\n\nThere are no storyline cues, you just have to wander around and hopefully remember, and be able to make some sense of , everything you read.  There are no quests.  My understanding is that somewhere in the course of the game you find a way to  "heal" the world and make everything in color again but the game has no quest path to this goal, you just have to guess and hope you get it right.\n\nAs far as I can tell there is no "you are here" marker on the map, so you don't know where it is you are standing once you leave the fort.  And there are at least 3 different "paths" marked in the map that you wouldn't know you are standing on by looking at the world itself, so it's nearly impossible to make sure you've walked the whole map.  The developers promised to fix this by making fast travel points on the map but how can you fast travel somewhere you can't find because you can't navigate to it in the first place?\n\nDon't buy this game.\n\nThis is yet another example of the "let's get this to production as soon as possible, I don't care if it's not ready" philosophy.  If I hadn't have bought the early access to what sounded like a cool concept, and I had played a demo of the game as it is now.  I would never buy it.","March 29, 2014","false","10.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"

The story is mostly told through the stories of ghosts, what the maiden in red tells you, and notes that you find. The game is open world, and while the world is split into maps, they're large maps with varied terrain, and there are treasure chests and buried treasure that gives a reason to explore, if the great scenery isn't enough. There's also fast travel.\n\nThere are armored soldiers and stealthy natives patrolling the area, and stealth is a viable option if you don't want to run in guns blazing. The weapons are well designed and animated, with 2 flintlock guns, 2 bows, a crossbow, a tomahawk, and grenades, a nice break from the usual "pistol, SMG, rifle, etc.". The guns, bows, and crossbows can be bought in different qualities, and there are unique weapons with even better stats hidden around the maps too.\n\nOn each map there is a bell that moves you to a very atmospheric alternate dimension where you can talk to ghosts and try to solve some of the area's mysteries while fighting skeletons. There is a unique "listen" feature that helps you find clues, ghosts, and statues by making a sound near their location, which prevents the frustration of not being able to find the next clue.\n\nOverall, definately worth buying.","January 1, 2015","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall mood portrayed by the lighting and environment is perfectly suited for the style of gameplay.\n\nWith that being said, do not expect this game to simply guide you through the campaign by automatically setting up new missions after arriving at checkpoints. It doesn't work that way. You're expected to figure everything out with little to no guidance whatsoever. To me, this very aspect is the genius of the game. Taking place during a time period devoid of any type of helping-hand technology, I feel that the developers were able to accurately capture that sense of vulnerability and uneasiness that should be expected from a game of this nature.\n\nOverall, for an indie game I'd rate it 4.5/5.

Each wraith you meet can't remember what has happened or what is keeping them from resting in peace, and will at first only remember one thing that happened. For example one will only remember staring into the barrel of a gun, which will make you assume the wraith was murdered, until you uncover more clues and belongings which will help the wraith remember what happened and you will eventually realise that your assumptions of the events that took place are completely different from what actually happened. Your first impressions will never be correct. In fact, they will be far off. And this is what, to me, makes the game really shine.\n\nThere is no true horror in the game. The game will feel creepy for the first hour or so but after that you will realise this is not a horror game.\n\nThere is virtually no hand-holding or tutorial. There is a mysterious woman, also with amnesia, who has her own past she is trying to discover who will a few times direct your next move, which include assisting her in figuring out her own. The majority of the side stories also tie together to the main story line involving the said mysterious woman.\n\nThe combat is challenging at times but revolves around switching between weapon types for either faster firing or more damage for different enemies, while dodging their attacks.\n\nVirtually no replay value however (unless you want to witness the ending again) as all investigations are recorded in a book so you can always read back at what the stories are, and there are no cinematics.\n\nFor $20, you may be wishing there to be more content, otherwise when the game goes on sale it is definitely worth a buy.

That also helped to build the tension as the game progressed. The story line was good as well, although I would have liked it to be fleshed out just a little bit more.

An eerie environment and momentarily gusty winds make you want to creep around every corner. Finding all the pieces to every puzzle starts off straight away, getting you into the groove of looking everywhere, but a "nearby item" tone makes things less grueling.\n\nCombat is, actually, fairly realistic. The bows are absolute trash until upgraded versions become available, and the one-shot nature of the guns I've used so far makes combat absolutely difficult. Tactics are needed more than brawn, so be wise.\n\nFOV can be adjusted for those that FPS games make a little nauseous.

It's one of those time periods (in my opinion) that don't cater much to certain people primarily, but this game stands out.\n\nThe atmosphere is what makes this game, with an open world similar to Skyrim in a smaller scale.  The options of changing color is nice and the whole concept is there.  It gives you a lonely feeling where you only interact with the girl in red and the spirits while enemies are out to hunt you.\n\nThe only 2 minor problems I have is the fact that you can only have 3 weapons at a time when there are only 5 in total.  I use the Musket, Pistol, and Longbow primary and not the shortbow and crossbow at all.  I would consider setting the 4 and 5 key as a 4th and 5th weapon slot so that we wouldn't have to set the weapons from the inventory slot.\n\nThe other problem is the lack of enemies in the game.  Sure, the nature and huge world are nice, but I feel that some more action would be nice. I find that the Spanish Conquistadors and the Statues are the most fun to take out but there's not enough of them.\n\nOther than that, Great game and will recommend to people looking for a new themed first person shooter/adventure! 9.5/10","December 31, 2014","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After watching vids, reading a few short reviews and "first impressions", I was sure that I had a full understanding of what this game was like, what it was trying to achieve, and, most importantly, what type of titles it leaned on to give it its general feel. Very soon into the game I realized that everything I thought I knew about the game was wrong. There is really nothing like it. It doesnt appear to have "leaned" on or borrowed any ideas from other games. Game play is simple and solid. Nothing weird. Nothing that takes a special touch or extra time to master. So many games try to go crazy with making unique gameplay that they screw-up the basics. This doesnt do that at all. They dont need to. The originality is in the way the world unfolds in front of you and not in the form and function of core gameplay. So everything works just fine and anyone can start this game and start playing immediately.\n\nThis is one of those small publisher games that everyone should play. Its also a small publisher game that large publishers will likely borrow ideas from.\n\nThe color scheme is really pretty genius. I thought I would bring it up to full, regular color early on. But I didnt. I put just a touch of color saturation into the world and it seems that that graphics engine really looks cool that way. But again, its all preference and I cant believe that no other games had this option before.\n\nBetrayer also fills a market gap on time period of the game setting. We have futuristic, modern(early 20th-21st century), medieval, and even ancient FPS games. But the 17th century is a relatively underutlized time period. I think the reason is that the time period itself is just not as popular as the latter I listed. But it does make for an interesting environment. Many games have a bow. But few games take place in the time period where the bow is a relatively strong option when compared to other weapons available to you.\n\nIt just seems that the devs and the publisher ticks all the right boxes when it comers to making a truly unique game. I have been watching this title for some time and I am glad that I finally pulled the trigger today and purchased it. But there is nothing to compare it to. So I cant say "If you like [insert game title here] then you will love this!", but I do highly recommend this game.\n\nThe only downside so far is that the enemies dont seem very challenging. With that being said, the stealth mechanics work just fine but because the enemies are easy, there is no real reason to be stealthy. That may change as I am only an hour or so in the game and I have now seen a new type of enemy.

I know I should have.  The game looks nice. The trailers pretty realistic about what you can expect visually, but not gameplay wise.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are really lacking, or almost non existing. Enemies see you through grass, so if you're coming up over a hill then they will have seen you before you knew they were there. The wind-blowing mechanic is cool, but you wont use it nearly as much as the game will have you think. Encounters with enemies are mostly just "what order do i have to kill things to save on HP. They don't see you if you go behind them, but wether you are able to chance upon them from behind is seemingly random, as the blurry camera makes enemies even capable of seeing you before you see them in a straight line.\n\nThe AI is dumb as bread. Enemies either A) run straight at you. B) shoot at you. C) in the case of the natives, just move around a bit to "seem" like they're doing dodging things. The only time i was impressed by the AI was when a monster walked up to another monster he had seen get killed. Other than that, you'd almost wonder if there was any thought into the AI at all.\n\nThe quests are OK if you like storie telling. Everything is text. Everything consists of fetch/delivery quests and dialog with NPCs. you press the "listen" button to get a noise indication of where you have to go next. You would think that with all the stories and footnotes the game stores in your journal, it would expect you to take on the challenge of thinking about where to go next, but no. You can beat the game by just spamming through dialog all meanwhile doing dull-as-water fetch-quests where you have to battle the ♥♥♥♥ poor AI that pops up every now and then along the way.. though once you've unlocked all the quick-travel locations in an "area" then you're just going to try to do as little walking as possible.\n\n\nI got to the third and last area, and realized they want me to backtrack through the game for the rest of the story.

If you're expecting a deep and complex story then this game probably isn't for you.  If you play through this game following only the main story then you might be left disappointed, but if you're the type who enjoys walking around a semi-open world and collecting memorabilia then you'll discover more about the events that have occurred and come to appreciate the atmosphere the developers have crafted.\n\nThe gunplay is fairly enjoyable and can be quite challenging at times especially when facing multiple enemies with anitquated weapons.  The pistol and musket feel immensely satisfying to fire.  Even the basic bow feels nice to shoot with.   The only complaint I would have about combat is the lack of variety of enemies when in the dark side.  One other complaint would be the bug where stepping into certain rock formations can leave you perpetually stuck in them as you can never jump out, forcing you to save and quit and reload the game.  Thankfully progress is saved.\n\nThe game can feel repetitive after a while, but for those looking to do a bit of exploring while shooting enemies with a one shot pistol or crossbow, this game is fun to play.  I hope the developers make another game in the same vein as this one as it shows good potential to become something even greater and more complex.","November 29, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A flintlock pistol is neat since you have that "panic" moment after every shot where the enemy didn't die. However, the game seems to heavily want you to use stealth, and enemies can spot you where enemies in other games really wouldn't, and from so far away. Once an enemy has seen you and it gets close, it's almost impossible for that enemy to miss or for you to get any distance again.

It really is quite brilliant. However once you've wandered through the tutorial and first area and you reach the second area you'll pick up the pattern - i.e. how the levels work - and there really is no variety from there on in. You do the same things you did in the first area in a slightly differently landscaped environment. It's not until (I think) the 6th environment that you get the shovel necessary to dig up rocky blobs that have been scattered across all the previous levels (and these are not helpfully marked on your map, nor do you have any way to make any marks on your map yourself) meaning you are left to painstakingly search your way through areas you've already been encouraged to ...painstakingly search your way through... again.\n\nIt starts out with a huge amount of promise - a really awesome environment, some great mechanics and the prospect of a pieced together story. However the gameplay really isn't expanded on past the first area and the story, rather sadly, ends very weakly. Your character's presence is never explained - you don't fit into any of the narratives really and the seemingly organic discovery of other characters stories is quickly rendered into a "go here, click this, go back, click that" as they are actually surpisingly linear and you simply can't discover the details out of order.\n\nOh and one of the achievements completed for me in game but not on steam.\n\nIt's totally worth a look at, especially if you can pick it up in a sale or a bundle because the first couple of hours you spend exploring will be truly spooky and quite awesome. Definitely will be keeping my eye on further offerings from this company and I may well return to this just to amble around in such a nicely crafted world.","November 24, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe the only criticism I could have is that I found the bow speeds way too fast, as an archer myself, there is no way you could shoot a longbow with a 1 inch draw like that.  I would love to see a sequel, that left me itching for more!!! I would rate this game overall 8/10.

Due to computer problems I had to uninstall, recently reinstalled and still love it. It's unique, in story and atmosphere. Give it a go if you like trying new things.\n\nMore detail: Changing the colour scheme from monochrome to full colour is an aspect I really love. It's great to play it the first time round in the default black and white (and red), and then the next time in colour, because seeing the trees and the sky in colour feels like an experience you shouldn't miss. Although I've found I personally like using the half way mark, washed out hues with just a hint of colour gives the game an "old" aesthetic, imo.\nI normally steer clear of horror games, but Betrayer seems to only toe the edge of the horror genre. The atmosphere is creepy, and the deranged spaniards are what frightened me the most, but earning a victory makes you feel accomplished, unlike most other horror games where you just feel sick.\nI do wish there were more details given when you find out what happened to lost souls, I want more of a reason to go to the trouble of finding out their stories. In fact, more details in general would be nice, but maybe that's because I'm usually more invested in a game's story than the gameplay itself.\n\nAll in all, Betrayer is a brilliant idea and I love how it's executed. A sequel, perhaps? ;)","October 28, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually ended up loving it, the lack of any musical presence and the mystery surrounding the whole island was something I enjoyed, if you can, leave the color settings as they are, as it adds to the immersion quite a bit, I would also recommend using a headset, as finding your way is almost entirely reliant on sound.\n\nThe game starts out with you waking up on a beach with a crashed ship out in the sea and broken cargo washed up around you, you have no memory of anything, and you start to explore the island, and you see a hooded figure out on a cliff whom sends you a note by shooting it at a totem near you. After this intro, which you have control of the entire time, I was hooked and a little obsessed with finding out who the hooded figure was, and why was there a destroyed ship out ate sea.\n\nThe game play is open world, in the first person perspective with a focus on basic shooting mechanics and very light stealth thrown in there. Your weapons consist of bows, crossbows, and muskets as a primary weapons with thrown explosives that explode on contact and hatchets which are thrown directly in front. Your weaponry is obtained either from fallen enemies, hidden chests scattered around the island, dug up from the ground in predetermined digging spots, or purchased via a weapons rack. The health is more classic, with a predetermined amount of health that runs down with every hit taken, it can be replenished by drinking water from barrels, and you do carry around “waterskins” that can heal you when away from a water barrel, these “waterskins” are replenished when you drink from a barrel.\n\nThe dialog is entirely text, and often times blunt, still I enjoyed some of the snarky replies I got from one of the characters. The story is kind of scattered at first, with you finding bits and pieces of events everywhere and you trying to connect the dots between all the different characters, but towards the end everything begins to fall into place and you see the wickedness and cruelty of some of the characters, and stupidity and cowardice of others, with some people getting caught in between and becoming victims. Often times you will be confronted with a choice between replies, some of which can have an impact on the story and maybe difficulty of the game.\n\nIf you are someone looking for a game with a lot of backstabbing happening in the plot, and want to shoot human and ghost like beings, than this just might be what you are looking for. I strongly recommend it.","November 8, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is also one of the few to creep me out simply because of its color scheme, its black and white tones will give you the chills for sure. If the creepy colors aren't your style that's perfectly ok as well because if you're like myself then you may find that this game can cause a bit of a headache and the developer has place a nice option to change the colors to normal ones. This, in my opinion, does not take away from the experice and therefor should not be a reason for not purchasing the game.

The game puts you in the shoes of a happless explorer, waking up stranded on a beach. And right away, the game disquiets you with the fact that everything around you is in black and white. It is almost as if you're wandering about in somebody's dream, though you find soon enough that the one color you're not blind to is red - it permutates nearly everything you run into, in this story.  You see it in the eyes of strange monsters disguised as Spanish soldiers. You see it on the tattered flags of derelect settlements. You see it splattering the ground with fragments of violent events from a distant past. You are the only person left to piece together the clues of what happened, save for a maiden wearing a red cloak. As far as style goes, this game kept it simple but vibrant. It truly felt like I was wandering lost through the forest trails of ancient New England, trying to figure out what happened to the Roanoke Colony (this game isn't directly about that particular incident in history, but it's not hard to imagine how much the event inspired this creation).\n\nAs far as style and visuals go, this game is an easy 9. It was slightly flustering having to take so much time reloading your weapons after each shot, but hey, it's the hazard of being a 1-man platoon in the 17th century. Thankfully as the game progresses you manage to secure higher quality weapons and charms that increase your health or allow you to reload faster. Some enemy encounters can get overwelming, but as long as you can keep a good tempo in combat, things get pretty easy after a while.\n\nAs for any criticisms I have, I say them only out of love for this game. But Betrayer does feel like it was a bit rushed in some aspects, particularly with the ending. Not that the ending was terrible, but it was a bit of a hasty punch-out. The free-roam mode after you win provides some context as to what happened, but I would have preferred just closing the case once and for all. If your main character gets the girl and they say their final farewells to Tabitha over her grave hand-in-hand, great. If Allison ultimately regresses and decides to push you into an open grave and betrays you as the title suggests, that's fine too. If the programmers wanted a free roam mode so badly, they should have had a hot tub you can climb into with Allison, Tabitha and that native princess. In short, the ending just felt kind of phoned in, and the free roam mode just felt like padding.\n\nPlease don't take that to mean I hated the game, though. I recommend the hell out of it to anyone that wants a different kind of challenge to a 1st-person wilderness-survival-paranormal sim. The weapons test your abilities (and the threshold of your patience) as a marksman in frantic combat situations, and the mysteries of each neighboring fort settlement adds so much intrigue to exploring the countryside. I eagerly look forward to any news of a sequel or new content that might spring up for this game, and I hope more people try this out until then. This is a very unsettling, twisted look at the depths of human cruelty to his own people, and I hope this game becomes more widely known as time goes on.","February 25, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a good way. I started to play and was extremely pleasantly surprised at what I was faced with.\n\n(+) The atmosphere is beautiful, nevermind if you have color or black and white enabled. The playthrough is intriguing, with sidequests that just make you want to play more. The dark zones are invaluable to this game, they're beautiful, well made and enjoyable. The graphics are pretty good as well. The game has a toughness aspect to it that no matter if you're just playing easy or going all the way on hard mode, it's a challenge. The monsters are uniquely made, the "story" is great, considering it sucks you in and makes you want to keep playing. It has a slight terror aspect to it, but not overbearing in the least, which is good for those players who like the psychological thrill but not having to deal with jumpscares and such. Weapon mechanics are decently made as well.\n\n(-) I own a pretty good computer, but it still lags slightly on it, even with settings down.  Also, to really get into the story, you have to find notes. On the ground, on the trees, in the forts, etc. Sometimes, They're hard to find and you might miss some once in a while, which is a pity.\n\nAlso, to those of you who use the "hint" button (tells you where your objective is) but can't seem to understand it, on the sides of your compass will pop up white boxes, and when you're pure glowing white, that means you're facing you're objective. If the left or right one is glowing (intead of both), turn towards that direction.\n\n11/10 would kill Spaniards again.","March 21, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Violent stuff has happened and you must find out who did it (find artefacts and present them to related 'persons', no puzzle other than finding the stuff in the first place), and ultimately you must judge whether or not those people should be set free or left to torment on their deeds. Boils down to a binary choice, yes, but it made me think about stuff I probably wouldn't otherwise.\nGame-play is quite fun, actually, with you exploring several right sized locations for items and 'people' to talk about those items. The maps are populated with some enemies, that re spawn when die, and a nice mechanic is implemented to let you approach those enemies with some stealth. You also have perfect indication if you have been spotted or not, as well as noises that you learn to recognize that point to nearby enemies - which can be pretty hard to spot when not enraged and charging you. New enemies (with accompanying attack mechanics, mostly hit and run but with different flavours) are introduced at a right pace. At least one of them made me jump when they first showed up, which for me is quite hard to achieve in games where the character has some means to defend itself... You must also use a nice mechanic to switch to 'dark mode', which changes the enemies, the colour scheme turns dark, and severely limits your view range. The idea is to explore in light mode, mark up the spots (by hand or by cellphone photos, as the map has no marker functions) and then revisit some places when you have the equipment or on the right mode to progress in story. You also can ask for audio and visual cues to where you should go next, which will help you find the elements relevant to the story.\nOverall the game was a dark and tense experience but also a quite enjoyable exploration. You are not powerless or forced to do stealth, and although you are encouraged and should use it to at least dispatch the stronger enemies first in a surprise attack, charging up in the right zig-zag pattern might left you alive at the end. Still I recommend do not panic and remember an axe to the face is quite effective in discouraging those pesky charging foes.","February 17, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The weapons are for the most part bows and black powder weapons, both are single shot and have a significant reload time. This makes for tense combat but sometimes it gets boring to watch yourself reload over and over while fighting the same enemies. However, I feel that the end of the game makes up for the repetition of the mid-game. Visually, the game is stunning, with a very interesting setting (17th century, new world).

Like, for the same price at time of writing, you can get Skyrim which is infinitely better.\n\nThe good is the game looks great, especially if you keep it set to monotone + red, it sounds amazing (the enemy sounds are incredible), the combat works well for the most part, though you'll die fast if you go guns blazing which is a good thing in a surivial game. This all come together to create a great setting and atmosphere that you could really get into.\n\nThe bad is that nothing really happens in that atmosphere. For the most part, you're just running across the map trying to dredge up clues relating to a bunch of ghosts of people you've never seen or heard of. Too be honest, with no face, voice, personality, or attachment to the player, it's hard to care about the ghosts... they just feel like quest vending machines. On top of that, basically nothing gets answered about what happened (or why you should care about what's happened). There is an attempt of an explaination near the end but it's so weak and vague that it makes things worse. I just feel there was so much potential for "Oh wow!" moments that blow your mind (see Bioshock), but you just get a few forgettable "oh, ok"s which is a real waste.\n\nOverall though, if you see Betrayer in a bundle or on sale, I'd recommend you pick it up as it's different enough to be worth checking out, plus a lot of people seemed to have enjoyed it more than I. However if you get bored, my advice is don't feel pressured to finish as the game really doesn't have anything new to offer after the first hour or so.","December 14, 2014","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're explained little at the start, which allows the player to piece together the mechanics so by the time you're late game you should have most of it figured out.\n\nFor those who enjoy a slower paced game, focusing on sneaking up on enemies and taking time to aim, this could be for you.  It is not a *bad* game -- but it's not one with high replay value, repetitive levels, and three achievements based on grinding over being actual achievements.  The simplicity of the game would almost be a strength had the pacing been different and more thought put into not making things feel like a game (chests and the typical game-style merchant) would have helped it a lot.

I recommend it strongly if spotted on sale, and a warm recommendation at regular price especially if you are a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like myself.\n\nThe game isn't hard to figure out or learn to play, though the introduction scene is short and is not comprehensive. I would have liked to be able to practice more sneaking and using the bow before moving into the game world proper, as this is the majority of the gameplay.\n\nBetrayer relies on text in scraps of notes or with NPCs to transmit the details of the world. If reading a sentence of exposition or a super-short paragraph of dialogue isn't your thing, you've been warned.\n\nI appreciate being able to piece together ghost stories by finding clues with the 'listen' mechanic. Finding treasure chests and other goodies while stumbling through the wilderness adds to the experience.\n\nAs I said, sneaking and stealth kills are the majority of the game. How stealthy you are to the enemy is not communicated to the player besides simple simple video game common sense. Crouching and walking are near silent, walking is loud, running is right out. Being in shadows seems to help tremendously, though if you are within line of sight of an enemy looking in your direction you are likely to be found out regardless. Detection distance is irregular. Sometimes I'll be spotted across a flat field with little ground cover, sometimes I can get away with it. This isn't terrible, but it forces the player to be cautious, especially since it is easy to be overwhelmed.\n\nAll out combat isn't preferable because the player is fragile. A group of enemies is deadly, and it is best to pick them off with stealthy arrow kills. (You deal more damage when the enemy has not detected you yet according to the tutorial.) When hard combat becomes necessary, it is difficult enough to survive that you learn quickly not to charge into any group of foes.\n\nProgression is measured in areas you move into, as well as what items are available in the shop (which also become available as you move to new maps). The weapons handle distinctly and feel great. Charms add passive bonuses to actions (musket reload speed, run speed, stealth, etc) and most everything you need can be found or purchased. Broken or shoddy versions of weapons can be found on enemies and sold for currency right in the field from the inventory screen. Ammunition is picked up from enemies or purchased from the shop. The game also allows you to conservatively retrieve arrows and other thrown weapons' ammunition from dead enemies. If you miss, sometimes I've been lucky enough to find the arrow in a tree, bush, or in the ground far behind the intended target. Ammo bought at the shop is cheap, but money is better spent on fancier versions of weapons to start, and this encouraged me to pick shots carefully.\n\nThe intial black and white visuals are what I heard and saw first about Betrayer. While it was a nice introduction to the game and set the tone appropriately, I eventually turned up the color to saturate the natural environment. This also grew tiresome because the bright red of clues and enemies was easily lost in the woody greens and fields. I opted for a medium saturation, and the game ends up looking washed out enough to know that there was color, but still allowing the red signals to catch the eye and keep the bleak, lonely feeling of the game world. This setting becomes moot in the shadow version of the world, where everything becomes black and white anyway, so I don't feel like it changes too much of the experience.\n\nSound, particularly listening to the environment, is extremely important in Betrayer. The primary 'listening' mechanic allows you to locate plot clues in the area by briefly adding markers to your compass HUD. The marks change width and brightness when your heading to the item is true, then fade out until you 'listen' again. It's an old idea, but I like the system because it is not as precise as a simple waypoint on your map and allows accidental exploration. Simply listening to ambient noise is incredibly helpful because item caches and enemies will make sounds at a distance as well. This gives the player the opportunity to explore, avoid, or maneuver around these opportunities. I appreciate that different enemies will make different noises. For example, I did not figure out until the umpteenth ambush that Naturals have a birdcall idling sound; I previously thought it was an ambient bird sound from the forest. Again, this is an old idea, but it fits well with the gameplay and setting, and is executed very well.\n\nMystery, suspense, horror, paranormal activity, and good old-fashioned, New World mysticism are all wrapped into one tight package. Hours of fun were had combing the woods, listening tensely, and hunting Spaniards. I'd give it a solid 9.2/10, an A-, a 4.7 out of 5. Play it, especially if it goes on sale again.","July 10, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story isn't exactly detailed as your traverse the beautiful forests but it adds to the mysterious nature of the game. Combat is fun, using bows is always a pleasure for me and sneaking around was simple and effective. Sound was awesome, with eerie tones and listening for whispers was haunting and engaging. Graphics were amazing, lush forests and great color saturation (if you changed the color from black and white to color). Enemies were engaging but overall were not very difficult, although I don't believe they were supposed to be. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to play something mysterious with engaging first person combat. It's not very long, coming in around 6 and a half hours or so, more if you spend time looking for ever single chest, scrap of paper, etc. Don't expect a lot out of the ending with this one but it adds to the mystery.

A black and white, open world, horror FPS set in the colonial era from a virgin studio? Most indies would rather churn out another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle/platformer. But does the execution live up to it's premise? Nope! Does it matter? Maybe.\n\nThe stealth system is awful. Many of the later enemies have black and white color palettes, so you don't see them before they see you. Oh, and they can see you instantly from 50 yards away. There's a mechanic involving wind masking your sounds or something, but I never felt that it was worth the risk.\n\nAnd the game is plauged by a lack of variety. There are only five different weapon types, with varying qualities. There are only six or seven enemies. You can find equipment, but all it does is give you passive bonuses that are hardly even noticeable. Each zone in the game plays out the same way: find everything in the light world, find everything in the dark world, talk to ghosts and move on to the next zone. By the end of the game, you're sprinting from point A to point B just to finish the game. I haven't felt this kind of repetition since Assassin's Creed 1.\n\nBetrayer has a fairly solid engine. There's a myriad of graphics options and HUD options to choose from, which is always welcome from an indie dev. You can even skip the black and white aesthetic and play with color (recommended). That said, I did get stuck a couple times in the geometry, forcing me to kill my character and respawn.\n\nBut if you can get past these shortcomings, the game is really interesting. The sound design is stellar. I can't think of any game that has such a robust audio department, much less one that is so integral to the mechanics of the game. When the story comes together it can be superb, but the story elements are all non-linear. Sometimes the story doesn't have the impact it should have because of this, even when dealing with incredibly grim topics like filicide.\n\nIf you're a stickler for mechanics, I'd skip this title. 'Rough around the edges' doesn't even begin to describe my experience. However if you're more interested in atmosphere or story and you're not bothered by the broken stealth system, this game will entertain you for a few hours.","July 12, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unless blackpowder has just made a ton of improvements and optimizations since it was released (or the review sites couldn't figure out how to enable the color instead of playing in black and white the entire time) then I just don't understand the low score.\n\nBetrayer is awesome.  Huge, lush natural environments (some of the best graphics I've ever seen -- especially when the wind blows through all the bushes, grass and trees) with intelligent enemies (love the haunted Indians) that hide behind trees and crouch in bushes and hear your footsteps.  Solid story with depth in the gameplay.  Betrayer is a convincing, surreal world that I enjoyed losing myself in for the 12-14 hours I played it.\n\nIn fact, the only complaint I have about the game is that there's only one save slot.  My power was knocked out on my first play-through after I was already 9 hours into the game and my save corrupted on the outage.  Maybe it was for the best, though, as I honed my skills enough the second time through so I was able to progress even more smoothly to the end.\n\nOk, just one other complaint.  What were you thinking, blackpowder.. the game should default to color instead of black and white.  I don't know why anyone would want to play this beautiful game in black and white.  The color and lighting needs a little tweaking to get the right saturation, but once you do, wow, you have better looking natural environments than Skyrim does--and everything moves.  If you turn the draw distance up all the way then even the grass on that hill 1/4 mile ahead of you will lean when a gust of wind comes along.\n\nBought it on a 9.99$ sale here, but it's well worth $29.99 or more.

First you go get your first weapon then your introduced to some mystery girl then you're not sure like everything else you encounter if you should trust her or not. Personally this game has kept me on my toes. Stealth is somewhat good, but its very useful when sniping, Combat feels great and you can adjust the game to give you even more of a challenge than what you had before or make it easy so you don't overwhelm yourself too much. Second the game visually is a little abstract. If you play it you can keep the black, white, red look to it how its intended or you can make this game colorful and see how bright and beautiful the world is. It's possible the developers did this for people are color blind or don't like how it looks.\n\nAs for its way of making you feel like fight or flight every enemy I encountered I made crucial choice whether to go in charging guns blazing or keep it quiet and make yourself blend in the shadows as the enemies try to find where you are as you pick them off one by one in a nice safe corner. The AI for this game are questionable because they're either very intelligent or ignorant. For example, an enemy ran up to me with a knife then quickly pulled out a gun and shot me dead. As I was charging for him as well. As this happened I laughed because it happened so quick, but the next guy I fought he died just like I did. Ammo is not to be taken lightly every arrow, bolt, or bullet is a blessing when you get some.\nThis game has alot of unexpected jump scares and travelling feels great.\n\nMy only complaints or refutes for this game is although it's a great game things like mapping a quest and finding quest items are like finding a needle in a hay stack. It gives you where you are, but does not have a very good way of showing it if you're lost. While Ranged Combat is great, melee combat is a bit weak. There isn't any voice acting for characters so it's like much older rpg games I've played in the past so you'll just have to do what I do and be a voice actor for fun as the game takes you on adventure one quiet not like it. This game is not for the faint of heart and one that constantly needs direction for story progression because there is one you just have to bear the monsters you encounter and scary moments that await you.\n\nIf I had to rate this game it gets a 8/10, but I found myself not playing too often, because for me it was probably because I'm afraid to go back on after what I encountered my last playthrough with friends, but I'm not spoiling anything.","July 12, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Personally i love games that make you feel like you are actually in the world you are playing in and have to figure things out, so if you are like me and love emersion games than pick up this gold mine, but if you want a game that tells you and shows you exactly what to do then avoid this game cause you will have a very hard time with it.\n\nProps to developers hope I see more great work from you guys soon, wish i would of bought it for 20 bucks to support you guys more","June 26, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(for obvious reasons); for instance, it forces players to choose and use a small selection of weapons at any one time, and the game has a sense of immediacy in its control scheme lending itself to direct action (I half expected to nail enemies with flying kicks). The otherwordly effect of a child's voice conjured experiences of Alma Wade, as does the duality found within the persona and actions of the antagonists' structures. With these similarities in mind, is Betrayer a good game?\n\nYes.\n\nBetrayer is a good game, and stands on its own merits: a strong narrative, striking presentation, and effective use of audio. The dependence on audio cues is rewarding. Dialogue between the player character and non-player characters are accomplished through simple trees, whose options are unlocked when clues are discovered. Roaming the world of Betrayer harkened to Silent Hill, but was animated and alive in a way that allow a player to imagine themselves in the midst of a breathing, sighing forest, tinged and tainted with subtle blood-red cues. When action happens, the player's speakers tend to explode with a rushing, beating heart, and enemies are deadly.\n\nThe challenging enemies serve to emphasize the theme of the game, and its narrative. There is a lot of text in Betrayer, and it is well-written; the investigations often reveal cruelty or tragedy, and all tie into the eponymous conceit of the game. I'm not sure if spoken dialogue would have improved things, because voice acting on a budget can do more harm than good, and often precludes narratives from achieving the depth text otherwise provides.\n\nWhile well written and compelling, the text of the game can sometimes be confusing. Players have to backtrack and search areas again, which made the later game feel systematic rather than fluid.\n\nStick with it and its rewards will yield themselves.","June 26, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This unpolished feeling though adds as much as it takes away in a strange way with the bow for example feeling clumsy to fire, yet much more realistic, the muskets taking a bloody age to reload is annoying and unhelpful... But RIGHT.\n\nWhen it comes to how this game looks, I couldn't be happier with it, the black and white style just works well as well as a small amount of colour or very bright colours, It really depends on what you want the game to feel like and the level of detail if really rather good too. And the thing I like most it the games use of red just to make sure you know when you're looking at and for while still keeping the mystery of whet to do with it now that you have it.\n\nThough I feel the main selling point to this game for me is the fact I was able to just get lost in the game. The immersion levels of this game are really something special as it's so rarely done to this standard. Every sound leaves you franticly searching around for someone, even the breeze keeps me in the edge of my seat though that's nothing when it comes to the other world where it's everything I just said times a 100.\n\nThe main negatives to this game are just little annoyances that just remind you it's a video game, such as the shop owner just not being there, or the vast drops in pace when you're not sure what to do for 10 - 15 mins.\n\nWhen it comes to you buying this game I really do recommend giving it a go, though maybe when it's on sale like me as I feel £15 may be a tad on the steep side.\n\n(I realise at the time of writing this I may not have played too many hours and so you may want to think of this as maybe more of a first impressions (Sorry, a very long one at that) Though i plan to play more and look very foward to do so.)\n\nVisuals: 9/10\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nImmersion: 10/10\nStoryline: 6/10\nDetail: 8/10\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","July 3, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Naturally, since FEAR is one of my all-time favorite FPS games, I decided to give this game a try while it was in Early Access stages. Unfortunately, it did not stay in Early Access for a large amount of time, and because of apparent time constraints, Blackpowder did not manage to reach further potentials this game could have had.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Very nice effects. The game's biggest feature in terms of visual splendor is wind. Oftentimes when you are treaded the island, you'll notice that gusts of wind pass by and affect all the foliage around you. At once, this left me in awe. I could've sworn I've seen things like this in other games, but in this one it was done so well. I was surprised at my own bated breath.\n\n+ Fun combat. It's pretty simplistic and straightforward, but combat was a surprising amount of fun regardless. You'll acquire an assortment of olden time weaponry that function well enough, ranging from pistols to muskets to longbows. I found all of them to be quite useful and satisfying. Fighting the spainards was especially fun for some reason. I liked hearing my arrows sometimes bouncing off of them with a humorous metallic clunk.\n\n+ Deep and shaking mysteries! This island has been inhabited by a lot of pretty screwed up people! Throughout the game, you will be solving a plethora of mysteries around different settlements, encountering wraiths and lost souls and helping them figure out who they were and what role they played in the sick situations that had taken place in the past. This is the thing that really kept me going. I've seen a few misspellings here and there, but the writing for the most part is exquisite. It just really makes me wish the game had voiceovers.\n\nCons:\n\n- Betrayer is quite repetitive. Seriously, as neat as the mysteries are, the gameplay is quite repetitive. There is no real section that stands out, and everything you see from the third level is what you've already played before. I wish there was a little more variety in gameplay, but again I feel this squandered potential was because of time constraints, plain and simple.\n\n- Lack of real immersion and empathy with characters. This is mostly due to the lack of voiceovers. It may be because of tight budgets, but potential for immersion was really lost with the lack of a voice here and there. The dialogue and writing is for the most part excellent, and it makes me sad that Blackpowder didn't make more ambitious pursuits in this aspect.\n\n- Ending segment. I will not spoil the game here, but the ending segment contains an optional task that might as well be mandatory since it makes the final fight easier (and it was already pretty nerve-rackingly difficult). This requires you to scour across all the maps you've been through to the end point, which means lots of annoying loading screens. I have really mixed feelings about the ending segment; on one side, it was really interesting and well-executed, but on the other, the gameplay aspect somewhat fell flat.\n\nClosing: Even if Betrayer stumbles upon a couple pitfalls and doesn't feel as good as it could be, it is still very much a solid, spooky, first-person mystery/action that will find a way to engage you one way or another in its harrowing tales. I hope that Blackpowder will pursue greater projects in the future and continue to deliver us unique experiences not unlike what they've lovingly crafted into this mystery romp.","April 23, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the other hand, it has one of the bleakest worlds I've seen in a video game, sometimes involving wandering for hours just trying to figure out what clues you might have missed. I bought the game during Early Access and it's progressed quite a bit since it first came onto Steam, and as such I can't recommend it enough, at least to try, for the sake of the things it does well in its atmosphere, storytelling, and gameplay.","April 24, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, Betrayer is the first game in a long time that has me wanting to play until the end credits. I first became interested in playeing Betrayer when I learned that it was set in older times specifically during the colonization of "the new world"; this combined with the paranormal elements implemeted into the game make up for a very gripping and unique experience.\n\nExperience:\nThe game delivers a very unsettling and eerie atmosphere through sound, visuals and dark subject matter. It combines history and paranormal elements in a way that works greatly and is actually believable. The game deals with subject matter including murder, betrayal, witchcraft, adultory and other aspects of life during the colonization period. Sounding bells sends you into a ghost demension similar to "the Further" in the Insidious series where you meet the tormented souls of the previous inhabitants of the forts and villages that you explore; through them you learn more about the colony's dark past and the events that led to the dissapearance of its settlers. The plot gets darker and more sinister as the you progresses through the game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe compat is a littly clunky, but I feel that this greatly adds to the survival/horror elements in the game. Battles are intense and frantic as a result of the aiming difficulty and long reload times; this forces the player to develop fighting strategies and use stealth effectively in order to stay alive. To me however, exploration and progressing through the story were far more interesting aspects of the game than the combat.\n\nVerdict:\nBetrayer is definitely a strange game, but in a good way. Its atmosphere and dark historical subject matter are what make this game so unique and unsettling. I would like to point at that you are not forced to play the game in black and white. There is a slider in the settings and pause menu where you can adjust the brightness, darkness, and saturation to your liking. I recommend playing the game in color because you are forced to play in a desaturated screen setting when you enter the ghost demension; you get the best of both "worlds" this way! See what I did there? Anyway, I would definitely recommend trying the demo if you're not convinced yet; it really gives you a good idea of what the game is like. I also recommend getting this game when it goes on sale for $4.99; You will get more than your money's worth!","November 3, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Due to computer problems I had to uninstall, recently reinstalled and still love it. It's unique, in story and atmosphere. Give it a go if you like trying new things.\n\nMore detail: Changing the colour scheme from monochrome to full colour is an aspect I really love. It's great to play it the first time round in the default black and white (and red), and then the next time in colour, because seeing the trees and the sky in colour feels like an experience you shouldn't miss. Although I've found I personally like using the half way mark, washed out hues with just a hint of colour gives the game an "old" aesthetic, imo.\nI normally steer clear of horror games, but Betrayer seems to only toe the edge of the horror genre. The atmosphere is creepy, and the deranged spaniards are what frightened me the most, but earning a victory makes you feel accomplished, unlike most other horror games where you just feel sick.\nI do wish there were more details given when you find out what happened to lost souls, I want more of a reason to go to the trouble of finding out their stories. In fact, more details in general would be nice, but maybe that's because I'm usually more invested in a game's story than the gameplay itself.\n\nAll in all, Betrayer is a brilliant idea and I love how it's executed.

It's not like F.E.A.R. (Seeing the developers are ex-Monolith) where you'll find a lot of action. This game is not at all action based in my opinion, but it does succeed in capturing the unnerving feeling of horror like the early F.E.A.R. games did. And this is because of the interesting decision of keeping the whole setting in Black, White and Red, and revolving a plotline that fits well with the game's color scheme! The soundtrack is also one of the key aspects of the game here, since it enhances the atmosphere by a great deal, creating a feel of dread on every corner. The game does get a bit dull after you put a few hours in because it's open world and there are no quest markers. So you'll have to play detective, or just keep roaming here and there to finally come up with something interesting. But I somehow enjoyed this as well.

I died three times so far, and each time I was able to pick my loot back up with ease. It just adds to the games atmosphere.\n\nThe enemies are... weird. And deadly.\nThey usually carry bows, knives, pistols or muskets. (so far - I haven´t completed the whole game yet)\nIf you see an enemy carrying a musket or knife, kill those guys first. It´s quite easy to dodge arrows of enemy archers.\n\n(If the guy with the knife manages to get close enough and stab you, you´re likely going to die. Because they don´t just stab you, but right after they stabbed you and drained about 45% of your HP, they will very quickly draw their pistol and shoot. And that shot will drain the rest of your HP)\n\nThe game offers quite nice stealth/sneaking tactics. You can hide in bushes, as far as I understood, you also need to try to not stay in the wind as it carries the sound of your footsteps. So if you have an enemy in front of you and the wind is in your back, he is more likely to hear you.\nThat is accompanied by a ton of vegetation that indicates the direction of the wind. So that´s pretty cool as well.\n\nEnemies receive increased damage as long as they didn´t see you. So that is quite helpful for players who prefer stealth, as well.\n\nArrows can ricochet off of the enemies armor (luckily not all enemies have armor) so be sure to either hit the optics in their helmets (basically try to hit their eyes) or other unprotected body parts.\n\nThe arrows have close to no dropoff, so most of the times you can just aim directly at their head.\n\nLast but not least, before I say something story-related:\nThe developers left an email adress in the main menu where you can directly send feedback to them.\nThat is pretty cool, in my opinion.\n\n\n+++ SPOILERS BELOW +++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo at this point I want to point out some things in the story, that I have witnessed so far.\nOne - the story seems very interesting at first, but becomes dull after your first sidequest and talking to the first main NPC.\n\nSo there´s that mysterious woman in a red cape right after you leave the beach. And she disappears again after a few seconds. And then she later appears in an abandoned fort and when you talk to her, she says that she wasn´t that first woman in the red cape you saw, but that it was her sister.\n\nOkay.\n\nFurther she tells you that she has no idea which enemies you are talking about, because she can´t see anybody besides you on the whole island.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo why can´t I bring her with me and actually SHOW her the enemies I am talking about, because all she ever does is, stay in the stupid fort? It could have an actually logical story related reason, but that´s as far as I am right now.\n\nThe sidequest I had so far, was basically a ghost that was missing his wife and son. And you are supposed to find out what happened to them.\n\nAnd here comes a really cool thing.\nIn Fort Henry, you will find a bell. Upon activating the bell, you can switch into the other world. The black and white colours invert and the whole game suddenly becomes really scary. (Note I´m scared easily)\n\nThe game further adds to the scary atmosphere, because you have to "listen" to be able to find quest relevant places in the darkness. And the listening involves hearing ghostly whispers and screams.\n\n-----\n\nThere´s more to say about this game, but just go ahead and give it a shot. It´s not the best game, but it definitely isn´t bad. And for that pricetag, you don´t lose much, even if you dislike it.","June 29, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I didn't mind the whole black and white color scheme but you can choose to give it color if you like. This game doesn't have any side quests but you'll never get lost during the story thanks to the "Listen" button you get that shows you pretty much where to go (I should note that you don't get this until the first town in the game so maybe not "never" lost). Below are some pros and cons I found about the game.\n\nPros:\n\n-For once I enjoyed not having to farm enemies for better weapons that might just be 5 damage more or something like that. All weapons of the same name have the same stats so you can focus more on the story and if you want, hunting pages and chests.\n\n- Inventory space will never be a problem because you can "scrap" your items in your inventory at anytime and gain money. Now that's convenient\n\n-The gameplay for me was pretty smooth and incorporates drop when shooting arrows (not sure about guns because all I used was longbows.\n\n-Collectables such as pages, key items and also treasure chests that are near will actually make a high pitches noise so that was helpful. Now only if my keys did that.\n\n-There's also fast travel. Like, thank god. Seamless fast travel if you're moving around in the same map which is AWESOME.\n\nCons:\n\n-Sometimes it will feel like there aren't really much enemies at all on the map.\n\n-The shades sometimes hit you with a melee attack before they get in your melee range.\n\n-Although it is listed as a horror game and I said it was, there wasn't really anything scary to me but this is just my personal opinion.\n\n-After you beat the story, there's not really much replay value. Only to get achievements.\n\nAll in all, this was a great little indie game. However I don't think it's worth $20. I got in during the summer sale for like $5. If it was $5-$10 then go ahead and grab it!\n\nP.s. Tomahawks are OP.","August 18, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stories of the characters in the game really REALLY add a neat creepy factor, as does the random things you find out in the overworld. it's just really really well done, and if you like a scare that isn't simply a jumpscare, but comes from wandering around in perfect eere enviroments then this game is for you.\n\nmy only problem (and it's a minor one) is using sound to find the next waypoint. the only reason i have a problem with this is because for me as a person with a hearing disorder it's sometimes next to impossible to pinpoint where it's coming from. despite this however I would rather them keep this system. it's innovative and only adds to the feel of the game.","July 31, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall mood portrayed by the lighting and environment is perfectly suited for the style of gameplay.\n\nWith that being said, do not expect this game to simply guide you through the campaign by automatically setting up new missions after arriving at checkpoints. It doesn't work that way. You're expected to figure everything out with little to no guidance whatsoever. To me, this very aspect is the genius of the game. Taking place during a time period devoid of any type of helping-hand technology, I feel that the developers were able to accurately capture that sense of vulnerability and uneasiness that should be expected from a game of this nature.\n\nOverall, for an indie game I'd rate it 4.5/5.

I didn't mind the whole black and white color scheme but you can choose to give it color if you like. This game doesn't have any side quests but you'll never get lost during the story thanks to the "Listen" button you get that shows you pretty much where to go (I should note that you don't get this until the first town in the game so maybe not "never" lost). Below are some pros and cons I found about the game.\n\nPros:\n\n-For once I enjoyed not having to farm enemies for better weapons that might just be 5 damage more or something like that. All weapons of the same name have the same stats so you can focus more on the story and if you want, hunting pages and chests.\n\n- Inventory space will never be a problem because you can "scrap" your items in your inventory at anytime and gain money. Now that's convenient\n\n-The gameplay for me was pretty smooth and incorporates drop when shooting arrows (not sure about guns because all I used was longbows.\n\n-Collectables such as pages, key items and also treasure chests that are near will actually make a high pitches noise so that was helpful. Now only if my keys did that.\n\n-There's also fast travel. Like, thank god. Seamless fast travel if you're moving around in the same map which is AWESOME.\n\nCons:\n\n-Sometimes it will feel like there aren't really much enemies at all on the map.\n\n-The shades sometimes hit you with a melee attack before they get in your melee range.\n\n-Although it is listed as a horror game and I said it was, there wasn't really anything scary to me but this is just my personal opinion.\n\n-After you beat the story, there's not really much replay value. Only to get achievements.\n\nAll in all, this was a great little indie game. However I don't think it's worth $20. I got in during the summer sale for like $5. If it was $5-$10 then go ahead and grab it!\n\nP.s. Tomahawks are OP.","August 18, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Genuinely heartbreaking at times.\n\nOn the obligatory flipside, the game felt a wee too short, the map's TOO useful (every single item is marked on the map, so exploration quickly gave way to just hopping between markers), the areas felt a little too similar after a while and the "kill x enemies" achievements felt like overblown grinding, as I fought A LOT and still wasn't even halfway to the required kill count by the end of the game.

It definitely brings something new to the table in a world were every FPS game is the same, Betrayer takes one of my most common complaints of FPS games and smashes it (That being that we always see the same setting WW2, Vietnam, Modern, and most recently the future.)  This takes you to what seems to be the 17th century (more specifically after  the colonization of America.)  where the guns are single shot and the best weapon is a bow and arrow.   This game heavily relies on stealth, most interestingly the wind, you use it in order to hide your foot steps.  Now with all that none sense out of the way let's talk about the most interesting parts of the game.  The mystery and the atmosphere.   When you first get into this game you have no idea what the hell is gonig on, when you first arrive at Fort Henry and start reading scraps of paper that you start to slowly understand what happens.  it gets really interesting when you start talking to the "folks" there.   Trying to piece together what happened at the fort and what is happening in general.  The atmosphere.  When it is day time the landscape is beautiful it's bright, it's lush, it's vibrant.  It makes you feel some what relaxed, that is until you meet your first enemy.  The "ngiht time"  is the definition of forboding hearing things off in the distance like screams when you come near a corrupt totem poll.  To skeletons randomly popping out of the ground to destroy you. So far I have encountered 4 types of enemies.  The game definetly gets frustrating after a while but nothing too bad (as of now.)   How ever the game seems as though it is a little too hardcore at times, which is  never be a bad thing in my book.  However not having a map can be a bit aggrevating, because when you die you end up either at the start of the particular map you are on or at the last place you visited that shows up on the compass.  All that being said I love this game so far, I couldn't be happier.\n\n\n8/10 I think it is worth it, if it's on sale pick it up!","November 1, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a rule of thumb that when I buy a game, I EXPECT to play an hour of gameplay for each physical dollar that I spent. Is this a short game? Yes. Is it worth the asking price? Definitely. While I have read that a lot of people are on the down side for the fact that the only weapons in the game are: a bow (longbow and short bow), a crossbow, a pistol, and a musket; and the throwing weapons are a bomb and a throwing hatchet, all I can say to those people is, “This a game set in the time when the first settlers were coming to America, did you expect that you would have more weapons than were available?”\nThat being said, the game was quite immersive. I found myself yearning to figure out what each of the wraiths did to keep them in this world. This aspect of the game never got old or repetitive to me. Each of them had a distinct and different story to tell. Yet all of them were bound to the world by one defining factor that you learn through talking to them all.\nThe downside of the game for me was the map, honestly. While it was necessary for the game considering that the map for each level, having a map to look at that displayed both the light and dark worlds made the game rather simple to navigate once you figured out how they dispersed enemy movement. You become all too cautious around all of the way markers and can take out the enemies that surround an item. The “savages” (also known as burning men) are a nice change of pace with the fact that the red outline is less distinct for them.\nI have also done a full color play through and fully recommend it, especially if you play with the “Death Drop Loop” option enabled. The game takes a new turn in difficulty as the rogue-like aspect of the game comes alive with this option.","November 4, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is a perfect complement to the style, setting, and story! This genre can often be combat free and I personally enjoy those games. However I always find that challenging combat makes the game far more enjoyable! The combat is so fun in Betrayer, that I actively engaged every enemy I found, on the hardest setting.\n\nBetrayer has some really unique art too! That is mostly with the use of colour ... or lack there of. There is a really creative use of mechanics that change what is essentially day and night (that's the spoiler free version). When the player initiates (except in one instance) the art, monsters, and story all change on the same map.\n\nI want to go on, but am afraid of spoiling the ending.

There is no voice acting so all of the story is told through text, which is fine since the writing is good. The unforunate part is that things get very difficult to keep track of as each character tells you their story (and there are a LOT).\n\nThere are enemies and combat in this game, but both have very little depth/focus. The combat system works, but shows its flaws in battles with multiple enemies. The main thing you will be doing in this game is reading, so if that's not something you're into, then avoid it. Also speaking of the enemies, there isn't a whole lot of variety. There are skeletons, floating head things, spaniards, spiders, and little goblin guys that sound like wolves (also more floating head things that look slightly different). They all kind of do the same thing which is sometimes melee you but mostly just sit back and throw projectiles at you. They're also not that scary unless you find skeletons and spiders scary.\n\nThere's a bit of exploration involved but most of the world map ends up looking pretty much the same; Grass and trees and some small settlement. Outside of a few houses in the center of each zone, there isn't much to find or see.\n\nThe "game" boils down to three different quest types which you must repeat again and again to beat the game. Find someone's skull and bring it back to them, find a totem and kill enemies to cleanse it, and find clues to figure out a character's story. These get old very quickly of course. Also that being said, there is very little guidance when it comes to these quests and I often found it difficult to tell what to do next.\n\nFor a game that is so focused on story, the main plot isn't very good or original. It's hard to describe without going into specifics but the gist is that one girl falls in love with someone and her father doesn't approve.\n\nPersonally I enjoyed the stories of all the other characters, outside of the main plot, but ultimately, I would rather have read a novel than play this game.\n\nAlso to very briefly and vaguely discuss the ending. It's awful. It goes from "Okay I know what's going on." To "Wait. What?" in literally one second. It's a horrible shoehorned twist that doesn't fit at all.","November 4, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately the manner in how well it plays out is rather hamstrung due to lack of feedback, repetitive environments and said stylisation hampering orientation.\n\nBetrayer is a first person, semi-open world adventure game based in  the late 1600s in the new world of America. In this you progress through a colony to find out what the heck has gone on, plus trying to figure out who the mysterious maiden in red who follows you about is. The setting helps set the game out from the crowd, mixing small English outposts, strange ghostly Spanish conquistadors, odd natives and numerous ghosts thorough out. It should also be noted that the game is almost entirely supernatural with few people met who are still of the flesh, where most NPCs are ghosts the player goes to sort fetch quests for, unravelling the situations surrounding their deaths.\n\nTo further the ghostly, otherworldly nature of the setting the game has a unique aesthetic, where 90% of the environment is in high contrast black and white with items and enemies highlighted in bright reds. While a little uncanny at first, it does give the game a very interesting atmosphere, especially when it comes to the shifting between night and day mechanics. If players want however, the stylising can be switched off, though it does ruin the mood a slight.\n\nWith its HUD displaying a compass and locations of note on it, the game is possibly going to be associated with a Bethesda title such as an Elder Scrolls title or one of the modern Fallout games, however in execution the game is split into a number of small areas that reward exploration and small scale investigation more akin to the stalker games. Also, like Stalker, this is not an RPG so to speak. While your character does improve as the game goes on, it is done mostly through improved items as opposed to gaining levels or experience etc... You gain better guns and charms which kill your enemies faster, from longer ranges and you can sneak and move quicker with charms. Due to the era the game is set in you mostly deal with bows,  crossbows and very crude, slow loading guns. While this may sound cumbersome, and I admit it is, it gives shots a degree of weight. Fire a gun for maximum power with the risk of a slow reload and a mass of noise, or let loose with a number of silent arrows from a bow? The choice feels a little more pointiest than an endless supply of assault rifles.\n\nThe combat in the game is generally tilted toward the stealthy approach. Enemies can be taken down in single hits (provided the weapon is good enough) when ambushed, and due to the supernatural plot it even justifies that to a degree. While you can go all out and fight the enemies toe-to-toe, the slow loading of the weaponry usually favours killing things off as fast as possible. To help with this the stealth is reasonably fleshed out, using wind and sneaking to cover you, though I'm not sure if light effects this at all. Unfortunately the AI is a little dopey and you can quite easily hide behind a tree while reloading and strafe around so as to cover yourself while reloading. As such the combat can get a little cheesy at times and fights veer from occasionally overwhelming to simple AI exploiting to get around problems.\n\nWhile the game does very well for an indie title in its initial hour or so of play, it falls flat on its face once the player starts moving on to the later areas. While adventure and intrigue may drive some people, the utterly random nature of where to find things on the maps is frustrating. Mix the game's unique stylised graphics and a very repetitive landscape with few minor landmarks and its a bit of a crapshoot as to whether you find all the ghosts in an area or not. Sure, Stalker's environments were not too handholdy, but here there just are not enough unique landmarks per map to be able to find things. Also, in stalker items or NPCs would be in logical locations. Where you find the ghosts is just a case of combing each map to see if you missed anything. Mixed with the fact the map only updates the locations of fast travel locations and not the unique clues you need to help solve the mysteries means you need to memorise each location for each item. As someone with a poor short term memory, this is an absolute chore to do. Kudos to the designers for making items of note give off a audio que, plus they tend to stand out in red, but it is still messy trying to progress when its not clear where you are supposed to go or what to do.\n\nAll in all Betrayer is a laudable game and certainly worth a look if on offer (I got it in an indie bundle, so nice and cheap). However only don't be too worried if you drop the game if you don't have the patience to seek out all the little odd secrets the designers randomly scattered across the game. Just recommended, but not for people with limited time.","February 21, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a bold look to it, being only black and white with dashes of red seemed (to me) like a gimmick until I played the game. The developers give you the choice of playing it black and white, or with a variety of levels of colour, varying from off-white all the way to realistic. Despite the choice I still played in almost black and white, it was design move that works heavily in favour of the story. Throughout the game you will encounter peoples tormented souls, and you will figure out what happened to make them all ghostly. The stories are usually mundane and it feels almost pointless to do it except for curiosities sake. However, once you approach the end of the game all these peoples stories will come together to affect what will happen. You will have choices to make, and I found it surprising how invested I was in what I was doing.\n\nThe gameplay is very crisp, a solid stealth system that does not hold your hand. If you are not behind cover or in the shadows, and you see an enemy, chances are he will see you as well. You have bows and guns, bows have a higher chance of deflecting off armor but are silent, guns hit hard but are noisy and draw huge aggro. There is also melee and some other weapons but you get the idea.\n\nThere is no music, but you will want headphones. You're only indication for what you have to do next is to listen. If you press X you will hear some noises, and you will need to know where they are coming from to find them. Also the game sounds beautiful. Exactly like the outdoors. It's got crows and everything.\n\nGameplay:   7/10\nStory:   7/10","February 21, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A flintlock pistol is neat since you have that "panic" moment after every shot where the enemy didn't die. However, the game seems to heavily want you to use stealth, and enemies can spot you where enemies in other games really wouldn't, and from so far away. Once an enemy has seen you and it gets close, it's almost impossible for that enemy to miss or for you to get any distance again. The combat difficulty ramps up too quickly for me to really enjoy this title.

Just make sure to switch the color saturation to normal if your eyes start to hurt from the base color style.\n\nGame isn't very long but will occupy a good 6-8 hours if you take the time to read the dialogue and do the side investigations. The combat is very basic. Look at enemy and either shoot it with an arrow or musket ball or slash at it with your knife. There are stealth mechanics but it's only helpful some of the time. You find charms which act as modifiers for your weapons and melee but for the most part they seem to have been a feature that felt like it was quickly added versus being well though out as you can get some hefty bonuses from them later in the game.\n\nThe story is interesting but strewn about the game world so if you don't take the time to dig up every hole and open every chest and talk to every NPC then you will end up leaving this game lost and confused. There is some back tracking but it's not terrible and for the most part if you can get this game on sale or from a bundle then it is worth taking the day to play it.\n\nThe game itself has some "funny" sound effects and it won't win any awards there but the world itself is beautiful. The areas could have been created a little better by possibly adding some wildlife or more interactable objects but the base game is fine the way it is. You are supposed to feel alone in a hostile world where everything wants to kill you, afterall. It does seem a bit odd though to hear birds chirping and crows screeching but to not actually see any flying or wandering around on the forest floor scrapping for food and what not but it isn't exactly going to hurt the game any by not seeing them.\n\nOverall the game was a wonderful experience and maybe with time there will be some DLC or a sequel that will utilize the  base game's features and world to create a successful sequel.","August 23, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What was there wasn't enhanced, built up, or polished to a shining beacon, but instead buried and muddied and lost in overgrowth.\n\nIt really is a shame, because this game had amazing moments. I looked forward to every conversation I had with the Lady in Red. Though they ultimately weren't substantive, they were still emotionally interesting to me. The setting was extremely unique, and supported and enhanced by all the types of interactions in the game. The enemies were strange and exciting when they were newly introduced. There was a strong atmosphere of forbidding at key moments. Atmosphere was created naturally, not artificially. The weapons felt nice. The graphics were beautiful and it felt good just exploring the area and engaging in skirmishes with the enemies. The stories were realistic in the sense that they were tangled messes of human tragedy, without simple solutions.\n\nBut then Betrayer backpeddled hard over all it had going for it.\nThe progress is entirely composed of digging up items after circling and crisscrossing the map two or three times. The maps have a nice coat of paint, but underneath they are just empty expanses. There are ferns. There are trees. There are some forts. There are large boulders. There are some broken fences. I might not have noticed the lack of substance, I might not have even minded.... except first I had to clear the locations of enemies so I didn't die constantly or have to circle around them for an even longer traversal. Then I had to clear the map of items and clues scattered across the landscape. (this is just arriving at the location, clicking, reading a sentence description, then moving on to the next 40 items.) Then I had to run around the map for a third time, but now in the dark, to retrieve a few more things. Wash, rinse, and repeat for all 8 maps. Don't expect the gameplay to vary or become more interesting (which the game conveys openly reasonably clearly). There are a few new enemies introduced over time, but the interaction with them is largely the same. Worse, what was once strong and salient in the game, becomes tedium and annoyance.\n\nAlmost all of the above problems could have been solved if this game was 1/3rd the length. But of course then it would have only been 1/3rd the length. Not a problem in my book, but it would demonstrate more obviously the lack of new content in the game. It is hard to say the game "lacks content," because the maps have loads of treasure and things to find scattered across them. Clues are unique, notes are unique, stories are unique, but they don't really add more to the experience. If you have read Atlas Shrugged, you might know what I mean about it being good except that the second 2/3rds are just the first 1/3rd over again.\n\nIt is worth it in terms of unique experience and good storytelling plus excellently executed atmosphere early on, but not worth it in terms of time spent jogging across maps and slowly dissolving amounts of fun. 10-15 hours total, ~4-8 hours of worthy content.\n\nIt is enjoyable, and yet a slog at the same time.

It has a pretty unique art style, a fun combat system, realistic locations and dark stories to discover.\n\nBut the game tries to be something it isn't. It's not about shooting enemies, it's about investigating. You find ghosts who don't remember their names and their cause of death, so you have to find out what happened by finding other ghosts, clues and objects.\n\nSo, for example you find a flute and a shoe. Each one belongs to a different person. You talk to a ghost and you are able to ask him if he knows the flute - he'll say yes and voilà, you know his name. But you can't even ask him if he knows the show because the game only allows you to ask the right questions. Investigation at its best!\n\nObjects, clues and ghosts are scattered all around the map, so you have two options: You either investigate the whole map on your own (everything is marked on the map) or you just let the game show you where to go next. Which is basically unavoidable unless you want a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ because the ghosts and dialogues are triggered and you never really know whom to speak to next. Also, the ghosts are the only thing not marked on the map.\n\nThe stories itself are really dark and fit into the historic background, but once you clear one of the maps you just move forward to the next one and forget everything that's been told before.\n\nIt's always the same: You enter a map, explore it until you find the bell to enter the "dark world", let the game lead you through an extremely linear detective story and then enter the next map. It's a shame because the combat system is really good and challenging, but that just isn't enough to keep you excited for about 7 hours. Open world is pointless - the only freedom the game gives you is grinding. Lots of grinding.","September 5, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And on that note I thought the pictures made this game look pretty interesting. Visually it looks pretty spectacular the models and the surroundings are great and give really good atmosphere to the game, so no complaints there.\n\nMy problem is I'm not one who's very interested in horror games, occationally having a horror theme to an action game or something is nice but playing a game just because it's horror is rarely a thing for me. And this game just flat out bored me. There were a bunch of circles on the map indicating where things where, so it was like a pc version of connect the dots. Go to circle, maybe fight enemies, go to next circle. There were usually chests of coin, piles of dirt to dig random stuff out of, or just letters talking about some attack, death, disappearance, etc...\n\nThe enemies aren't even creepy were just annoying for me, the quests felt tedious and I had almost no motivation to finish finding some persons head, or that girls sister. The shop makes no senes to me since there's nobody manning it so I wonder what force convinces you to leave money there for the items instead of just taking them. Enemies sound like animals and fighting them isn't very thrilling. Water is used to heal you and is found in barrels around the place. My short gameplay consisted of, find corrupted totems in otherworld, kill skeletons around them to purify them, get them all and door opens, go to next map, repeat.\n\nMaybe if you're into this time period or if these kinds of activities interest you the game would be worth it, but I couldn't be bothered to go on after I died once and just uninstalled.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nReally nice atmosphere\n\nCons:\nBoring quests\nBoring fights\nIn general just boring gameplay\n\nAgain I'd like to say I'm clearly not the audience the game was looking for so take this review with a grain of salt. It only cost me like $1 so I figured it'd be worth it just to see what it played like, but it just wasn't for me.","June 26, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You explore doomed settlements in colonial-era Virginia, fighting demonic Conquistadors and angry indians, and try to find out what happened by talking to the ghosts of the previous inhabitants.\n\nStriking and vibrant art style, glorious sound design, weapons feel good to use, enemies aren't very varied but are quite smart and fun to fight.\nThe story's VERY interesting (and quite bleak), and told through nice and twisty writing. Genuinely heartbreaking at times.\n\nOn the obligatory flipside, the game felt a wee too short, the map's TOO useful (every single item is marked on the map, so exploration quickly gave way to just hopping between markers), the areas felt a little too similar after a while and the "kill x enemies" achievements felt like overblown grinding, as I fought A LOT and still wasn't even halfway to the required kill count by the end of the game.

It definitely brings something new to the table in a world were every FPS game is the same, Betrayer takes one of my most common complaints of FPS games and smashes it (That being that we always see the same setting WW2, Vietnam, Modern, and most recently the future.)  This takes you to what seems to be the 17th century (more specifically after  the colonization of America.)  where the guns are single shot and the best weapon is a bow and arrow.   This game heavily relies on stealth, most interestingly the wind, you use it in order to hide your foot steps.  Now with all that none sense out of the way let's talk about the most interesting parts of the game.  The mystery and the atmosphere.   When you first get into this game you have no idea what the hell is gonig on, when you first arrive at Fort Henry and start reading scraps of paper that you start to slowly understand what happens.  it gets really interesting when you start talking to the "folks" there.   Trying to piece together what happened at the fort and what is happening in general.  The atmosphere.  When it is day time the landscape is beautiful it's bright, it's lush, it's vibrant.  It makes you feel some what relaxed, that is until you meet your first enemy.  The "ngiht time"  is the definition of forboding hearing things off in the distance like screams when you come near a corrupt totem poll.  To skeletons randomly popping out of the ground to destroy you. So far I have encountered 4 types of enemies.  The game definetly gets frustrating after a while but nothing too bad (as of now.)   How ever the game seems as though it is a little too hardcore at times, which is  never be a bad thing in my book.  However not having a map can be a bit aggrevating, because when you die you end up either at the start of the particular map you are on or at the last place you visited that shows up on the compass.  All that being said I love this game so far, I couldn't be happier.\n\n\n8/10 I think it is worth it, if it's on sale pick it up!","November 1, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I very much enjoyed the black&white color scheme; to me it seemed to make things easier to see, not more difficult. The mapping was well done, if a little deus ex machina (everything has a marker, which reduced aimless exploration but seemed a bit unlikely) - for gameplay purposes it was definitely a help.\n\nThe dialogue is unpolished and lacks characterization (everybody pretty much talks in the same textual monotone), but for the most part that felt acceptable in the context of a ghost story. You don't expect ghosts to be scintillating conversationalists. Enemies were never incredibly difficult, but the archaic weapons added a layer of awkwardness that was fun to work with - running backwards while trying desperately to get your musket reloaded because you ran out of arrows, being pursued by creepy burning ash-men or snarling men in armor with glowing red eyes gave the game its own kind of character.\n\nPleasantly surprised. Definitely worth playing if you're a horror-stealth fan.","July 14, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And on that note I thought the pictures made this game look pretty interesting. Visually it looks pretty spectacular the models and the surroundings are great and give really good atmosphere to the game, so no complaints there.\n\nMy problem is I'm not one who's very interested in horror games, occationally having a horror theme to an action game or something is nice but playing a game just because it's horror is rarely a thing for me. And this game just flat out bored me. There were a bunch of circles on the map indicating where things where, so it was like a pc version of connect the dots. Go to circle, maybe fight enemies, go to next circle. There were usually chests of coin, piles of dirt to dig random stuff out of, or just letters talking about some attack, death, disappearance, etc...\n\nThe enemies aren't even creepy were just annoying for me, the quests felt tedious and I had almost no motivation to finish finding some persons head, or that girls sister. The shop makes no senes to me since there's nobody manning it so I wonder what force convinces you to leave money there for the items instead of just taking them. Enemies sound like animals and fighting them isn't very thrilling. Water is used to heal you and is found in barrels around the place. My short gameplay consisted of, find corrupted totems in otherworld, kill skeletons around them to purify them, get them all and door opens, go to next map, repeat.\n\nMaybe if you're into this time period or if these kinds of activities interest you the game would be worth it, but I couldn't be bothered to go on after I died once and just uninstalled.\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nReally nice atmosphere\n\nCons:\nBoring quests\nBoring fights\nIn general just boring gameplay\n\nAgain I'd like to say I'm clearly not the audience the game was looking for so take this review with a grain of salt. It only cost me like $1 so I figured it'd be worth it just to see what it played like, but it just wasn't for me.","June 26, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's easy to figure out, nothing is too taxing and the gameplay ebbs and flows between a parallel dimensional concept. However after a short time I found myself wanting more variables to play with. Where's my stamina bar? Why can't I climb trees? I want more items. More dynamic enemies. My health goes down too fast (I can only imagine they did this to lengthen the game duration as you are forced to regularly go back for health).\nOverall the gameplay felt a little mechanical and 2 dimensional, unfinished, yet relaxing, quite enjoyable and hopefully the start of something big.\n\n\nGame ambiance: 5/10\nThere isn't really much, but what does have I like.\nAmbience? What ambience? Well... The grass and the tress bend, sway and dance as the wind blows through on a sunny day. Shhhhh, I'm going to take a nap.   ...was that a bird?\n\n\nReliability/Stability: 10/10\nReliable. No crashes/problems/errors to report.\n\n\nStory/Plot: 6/10\nNot bad. The plot was never dull for me. I enjoyed it throughout. There were a few elements that were original and some that sounded religiously suspicious. That being said I felt I had to drop the score a few points because, again, the game felt unfinished, or more like a concept than a full release.\n\n\nConcept: 7/10\nBrilliant. It's good to see a bow and arrow and black powder arms game. I love the way you can play with the colour and how colour is part of the game. The quests are great too.\n\n\nConcept execution: 5/10\nGood clean simple fun. I really hope there is a Betrayed 2 and it's literally, in every way,  twice the game this is.\n\n\nTextures: 5/10\nAverage. Characters look somehow "plonked" in the there without much visual continuity with scenery textures. Although the shrubs on the ground have nice textures.\n\n\nModelling: 6/10\nAverage, but better than the textures. Weapons look great. Plant leaves are ok.\n\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nOverall they are ok. Despite it's shortcomings the game is by no means intolerable.\n\n\nSound: 5/10\nweapons are great!

It's really just a chain of fetch quests, exploration and somewhat mediocre combat, but somehow, some way, it works. The design aesthetic is really cool, what with the lack of color (which you can actually tailor the colors to what you want, but the black, white and red really adds to the game). THe sounds (and lackthereof) really add to the sense of isolation and desolation. And man, this game manages to be pretty creepy. Over all the game does a good job of trying something different, and for the most part it works.\n\nThus far I am enjoying this game.

Without ruining the plot, the theme is that you arrive on land after a ship wreck.  You meet a girl, and shortly thereafter you are unraveling the secrets of what happened to the inhabitants of the island.  The story is overall told very well, however one of the big downsides is the last reveal.  It's meant to be vague, but also was thrown together almost as if it were an afterthought.  Despite this, the rest of the game and plot is worth getting through.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, one of my biggest gripes was in this department.  Some things were done fantastically, such as using environment to plan attacks, planning type of weapons for different enemies, and the fluidity between melee and ranged weapon use.   There was so much lost potential for what could have increased the immersion.  For example, all of the items can be found by using the map that you already have at the beginning of the game.  Most of the "quests" as you progress through the game require no thought - just simply find an item, bring it to a person, choose the only option to make you progress.  It reminded me a lot of Far Cry 3, which also for me lost it's appeal due to this idea of "run here, kill this, make waypoint, hand in item".  My suggestion to make this better?  If a sequel to Betrayer is made, I'd like to see something implemented such as in Condemned: Criminal Origins.  When you have to solve a mystery, you need to really engage the environment, piece together the clues, and figure out what happened.  Give the player choices with consequences, and allow it to have an effect on the plot.  Adding this aspect not only will help the player feel more like part of the story, but we can use our brains to take a break from the repetition.  It may also change the fate of certain characters and the overall ending if done right.\n\nWith all that said, I really hope the developers plan a sequel.  This game has a lot of potential, and the next plot can really be fleshed out on the next go with good script writing.  Cheers to Blackpowder for a very successful game.","May 14, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's use of black and white, emphasizing the color red, gives it a unique look not seen too often in games and when paired with the frequent breezes, swaying vegetation and nature sounds truly make the experience surreal.\n\nThe selection of weapons in pretty impressive for a budget game and there are even charms you can find, that when equipped, will enhance your movement speed, HP and other attributes.  Both the charms and weapons (muskets, rifles, crossbows, short/longbows, etc.; it takes place in colonial times) have varying degrees of strength depending on the type, such as crude, quality and exceptional. There is a light and dark world you must trek through in order to solve the mystery of what's going on in the game and in particular, with the Maiden in Red.  There are collectibles such as chests and letter scraps  and gifts to find and also clues that will allow you to solve other, lesser mysteries involving ghosts you encounter along the way.  There are also a decent number of enemy types, such as skeletons, spider=like crustacean things (yeah, no idea what these things are but they're cool), undead Spaniards, phantoms (skull/deer=headed ghosts....don't ask about the deer heads, freaked me out first time i saw them, thinking it was the Wendigo or something coming after me...) and burning, undead Native American warriors. You can even unlock destinations and quick travel between them, as well as upgrade how many times you can heal. You even have tomahawks and explosives to throw, and like arrows, the tomahawks can be retrieved from fallen enemies which is very nice.\n\nKeep in mind this is a budget game, so the amount of content the developers put into Betrayer for only $20 is truly impressive.

I really wanted to like it, and even fooled myself to for a time, a somewhat refreshing look at a stealth-horror-investigation-shooter?  Here are the reasons that made this game was hard to downvote.\n-Amazing environment\n-Unique Story\n-Solid Gameplay\n-Very Fair Price\nNow with a list like that, how could I damn such a game?  Well the combat did prove enjoyable though the enemy variety proved to be fairly bland, not the types or number, just how they had the same behavior and mode of attack.  That along with the give and take story that really demanded finishing.  Once you spend an hour or two in the game, you realize it is rather shallow and becomes a grinding Easter egg hunt, wrought with cheap scares to keep you on your toes until you are upgraded enough that you no longer care to be tactical or stealthy.  Then it’s fast traveling back and forth, as well as revisiting areas you’ve scoured already.  The dialogue proved dreadful as well as many systems that appear mostly hollow, like gifting your red friend things you’ve dug up like an obedient puppy and not much to show for regardless of if she accepts it or not.  The game isn’t spotless either as I have also found myself on more than one occasion being lodged into rocks and walls maneuvering with a borderline useless jump key.  Speaking of environments, I hope you like forests, because that is all you are going to get in this game.  So if you are into a cheap romp through the woods with a passible story where you collect junk kill skeletons and talk to ghosts for 5 hours, feel free go on ahead.  I just can’t, although I can safely say I gave the game the benefit of finishing it at least.","March 29","false","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TobyH95/recommended/243120/","TobyH95","Tobyh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TobyH95/","261 products in account","A compelling tale of discovery, ghosts, regret and, naturally, betrayal.\n\nYou travel around a section of woodland near the coast of the New World with no real understanding of who you are or what you must do, meeting variuos trapped spirits along the way. Each wraith you encounter has its own unique baskstory, which normally ties into the stories of the other wraiths in the area. There is areally chilling overarching plotline which retains a couple of eerily ambiguous elements and it only picks up speed as you go through the game.\n\nThis is a superb short game (you could grind it out in a week easily, and I fully suggest you do so) but not without content. True, there could be a bit more variation in the maps/objectives, but that's really not what this game is about; rather it is something to play slowly and contemplatively, exploring every tree stump and rock face and traversing every inch of the woodland on the hunt for clues. It somehow avoids being boring despite being really much of the same for the duration.\n\nThe graphics are great and run wonderfully, the sound design is EXCELLENT and is one of the few games I can think of where sound was actually an aspect which jumped out at me, and the gameplay is simplistic and smooth. Loot and weapons are fairly standard, but you do find some interesting variations on the same weapons as you get later in the game. There are multiple incarnations of each weapon type, getting progressively stronger as the game progresses.\n\nAt the start of the game you feel so weak, only being able to take on a couple of enemies at once at a push, stealth really is the preference for early game. Towards the end, however, it is possible to find weapons capable of taking down a skeleton in one hit, even the floating skulls are no match for you near the end, but combat is not the focus of the game and you never feel overpowered.\n\nMy favourite aspect of Betrayer is the level of customisation the game gives you. you can choose to play the game in black and white or colour, with variable saturation, as well as having control over the enemy difficulty at any point in the game. The best part of customisation, however, is the map, which you can set to display the locations of various goals, or, as I prefer, not. It is useful to be able to turn these settings on after the plot draws to a close for completionists out there, just so you can polish off the few chests you might have missed.\n\nOne downside is that it also seems to highlight chests/objectives you have previously attained in the map, although this only happens once you return to an area you have previously visited. I also noticed that, at one point in the game, it decided to invert the stereo; so what should have been in my right ear was suddenly in my left visa vera, which was incredibly disorientating in game which utilises sound to direct you to the wraiths. However the fix was easy, as I just swapped my headphones round.\n\nApart from these two very minor greivances, Betrayer is a great game from such a small developer and at a great price. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for an atmospheric daytime-horror game. Theres something in this game which is certainly creepier and more harrowing than any xenomorph jumping through the air vents. Its more subtle than that. Buy this game.","July 12, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I very much enjoyed the black&white color scheme; to me it seemed to make things easier to see, not more difficult. The mapping was well done, if a little deus ex machina (everything has a marker, which reduced aimless exploration but seemed a bit unlikely) - for gameplay purposes it was definitely a help.\n\nThe dialogue is unpolished and lacks characterization (everybody pretty much talks in the same textual monotone), but for the most part that felt acceptable in the context of a ghost story. You don't expect ghosts to be scintillating conversationalists. Enemies were never incredibly difficult, but the archaic weapons added a layer of awkwardness that was fun to work with - running backwards while trying desperately to get your musket reloaded because you ran out of arrows, being pursued by creepy burning ash-men or snarling men in armor with glowing red eyes gave the game its own kind of character.\n\nPleasantly surprised. Definitely worth playing if you're a horror-stealth fan.","July 14, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is pretty decent: exploring the settlements and investigating the deaths of their former residents is decently entertaining, the combat isn't terribly deep, but still handled well, the visuals are all excellent and effective.  Unfortunately, though, the overall narrative (especially the ending) is flat to lackluster.  While the backstories of the ghosts are quite tragic and thought out well enough, having them told to us flatly by unemotive, similar looking ghosts via text simply isn't that exciting and worse yet, gets repetitive.  Only making matter worse, the end is unsatisfying, raises questions that almost no one is bound to care about, and ultimately leaves us with zero answers regarding our character's identity.  Seriously, who are we playing?  As far as I can tell it's a generic nice guy wandering through the forest armed to the teeth, talking to spirits, and suffering from schizophrenia so severe he thinks all spaniards are beastly monsters and all native americans are on fire.\n\nIt's ultimately not a bad game, and if you're really interested, give it a shot.

So, I re-wrote the list as "Things This Game Is and Is Not About."  "Bottom Line" at the top, for TL;DR purposes.\n\nBottom Line:\nThis is not a triple-A title, and it isn't trying to be.  It's trying to go in a different direction and do things that triple-A titles *don't* do, and specifically avoid doing the things they already do better.  If you like the "Things This Game Is About," and are not bothered by a total lack of "Things This Game Is Not About," then you will like this game, because it is VERY good at what it *is* about.  However, if you find the game "too slow," "boring," "lacking weapon diversity," or "not challenging enough," then this game is a poor match for you, because it is not about scratching those types of itches.\n\nThings This Game Is About:\n~ Spooky atmosphere.  Not frightening, shocking, or horrifying - just slightly spooky.  Something is... *off*.\n~ Exploration.  There are numerous ways to pick your way through the game, but turning on all the map markers and following the optimal path will be tremendously boring.  Instead, exercise a bit of self-control and wait to turn on those markers until you've found most of the stuff but aren't sure where those last two or three things are.\n~ Isolation.  This is a doomed colony, and you're there to sort out the wreckage, not interact with a cast of dozens of vibrant and interesting NPCs.\n~ Paying attention to what you hear (and how audible you are) more than what you see.  The devs wanted to create a game where aural cues are more important than visual ones, and while there are still visual cues for the hearing-impaired, the aural cues are far more important and reliable.\n~ Helping ghosts make peace with their deaths, which they can't remember, by figuring it out for them.  You may well piece together a story before the ghost does, but they might need some object or other trigger to be able to move on.  Just accept that this is how ghosts work - it's about their peace, not your understanding.\n~ Patiently planning your attacks.  More like Tenchu (the first one), where you can get in over your head if you fail to spot something, than like Shadow of Mordor, where you're *supposed* to overcome superior odds and adapt your plans on the fly.  Actually, it's even farther in the Tenchu direction than Tenchu is.\n\nThings This Game Is Not About:\n~ Broad weapon choices (would be period-inappropriate).\n~ Slaughtering your enemies in droves (would detract from the atmosphere).\n~ Fast-paced gameplay (would detract from the atmosphere).\n~ Being super-exciting, epic, or over-the-top in any way (would detract from... look, this is a very understated game).\n~ Magic spells, talent trees, mega bosses, epic weapons, phat lewtz, or pretty much anything that most triple-A titles go over-the-top on to try to stand out from their competitors.\n~ Puzzles.  The "investigations" you undertake, such as they are, are not intellectually demanding.  There are no puzzles in this game, no intuitive leaps to make; if you can just find the MacGuffins the ghosts are looking for, they'll fill in part of the colony's story for you and be able to move on themselves.  This is not a framework for a puzzle, it's a justification of the fetch-quest mechanic (the ghosts are stuck, therefore they can't go on their own errands).","February 29","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game could benefit greatly from voiced dialogue. The premise has a lot of potentional that could be realized by a bigger budget.  However, as it exists it is not very engaging. The monsters aren't particularly frightening; the astmosphere isn't particularly chilling. For example, you are an 17th century English explorer and discover that the King's colony is a ghost town. Then you encounter a spirit. Then you enter an Otherworld, which seems to be similar to Silent Hill's Otherworld. There's a Maiden in Red who has amnesia. After seeing all this, you plod along as if it's Sunday at Nottingham. Meh.\n\nEdit: Having just looked up the plot, it does seem like an interesting story. But the lesson is no matter how interesting it is you must get there first. I'm not going to spoil the plot, but basically it is FEAR with muskets and bows, and instead of a fictional government agency you are an English explorer.\n\nAs to what is scary, FEAR was scary when it came out. Most recently there is Layers of Fear. The latter doesn't involve any firearms and is basically a walking simulator, but when it comes to that crawling sensation, it's top-notch. Though there were definitely a few sequences in that game where I wished I had a knife or something. Sending a man unarmed into a haunted mansion is not cool.","April 6","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But normally, I can tell whether or not I like a game within the first hour or two. In this case, I think this game is beautiful and has a depth to it that I find hard to replicate.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Yeah, I find it fun so far. However, I can't tell you how highly I recommend it since I've only played roughly an hour.","September 28, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oops sorry back to the review! I am just going to keep this short.  This game is a rare gem and I am more than happy I stumbled upon it.  The story is a journey that leads to climax and falling resolution which in this case there is a rather interesting ending and I will give nothing away and leave on this note.  I still love the Maiden in Red. She was worth every hour of this game alone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nksor/recommended/243120/","nksor","Nksor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nksor/","195 products in account","The game's not very engaging from what I've played:\n\nThe black and white aesthetic with the occasional red object is neat at first, but it quickly gets monotone and tiring.\n\nThere's very little in the way of sound design, and what is there sets up the mood well, but it's a case that quality just doesn't supersede quantity.\n\nSome experimentation is needed to figure out what all the buttons do on the pad. Figuring out how to switch weapons was especially polarizing, seeing as how you don't get a radial menu or anything, but instead a single button (LB) cycles through all three weapons at once. Otherwise the controls are fine.\n\nThe interface feels very clunky in some spots. Cycling through fast-travel locations is a major pain, and so is navigating your equipment menu. The minimalistic interface design also has the unintended side-effect of making the whole thing seem very budget-y and not very well implemented.\n\nThe combat is a bit one-sided. At first it feels quite visceral, with enemies dashing towards you as you try to put one more arrow into them, and the game does have a neat mechanic in masking the noise you make when a gust of wind hits your surroundings. However, the combat just doesn't feel deep enough: you get a handful of ranged weapons which all perform very similarly to one another, a short-range tomahawk which you can throw for massive damage, and a few bombs which help to thin out crowds. Enemy patterns don't differ so much from one another that you need to adopt any different strategies: aggro enemies in front of you, wiggle left and right repeatedly to dogde projectiles, fire projectile of your choice back at them. The odd inclusion of an option to drop your equipment when you die is meant to make combat more tense, but it doesn't add anything meaningful to it in my opinion, it just makes it more annoying.\n\nI couldn't figure out how to attach myself to the story in any point. You're a shipwreck making his way inland where Englishmen and Spaniards have set up camp and constantly have skirmishes with indians and each other. Death permeates all of the camps however, and after digging around a bit, you gain the ability to talk to the wraiths of the people that lived in the region, and piece together how they died. Reading by this narrative ultimately isn't really interesting: while the backstory of these people is well-written and often pretty gruesome, the medium by which they are delivered falls short: there are no cutscenes and no voice acting, leaving you with a pretty paltry dialogue box and your imagination (nothing wrong with that, it's just not for me).\n\nThere's also a lady that follows you around in the camps, the only other apparent living human you can talk to. You can give her things and talk about the apparitions you're seeing, but she doesn't share in your ability to see the dead or the strange ashen figures scattered throughout the camp. Making you question the main character's sanity like that is a legitimately cool plot point, but the lady herself is hardly engaging: like the other characters, she lacks a voice actor, and any other kind of different idle animations or behavior. Her dialogue isn't even that engaging to make you care for her all that much, and giving her gifts, if it did anything at all after, passed right by my head.\n\nThere's just not that much great to say about the game. I gave it a few hours, and made it to the third map you can get to. Maybe that's not enough time, but the lack of sound assets, strange choice of visual style, clunky interface and simplistic (unnecessary even?) combat meant that I didn't want to give it any more of a chance for it to grab me. It asks for a fair price though, so maybe someone with a bit more patience can find enjoyment in it.","September 25, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
