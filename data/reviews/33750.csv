Then don't buy this nor the third one since nethier have a tutorial so good luck in trying to play the game (Get prison architect instead save your money for  that and a enjoy a more complex, better polished game which also has better graphics.)","May 28, 2014","false","0.8"," 112 of 135 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","112","135","11","7"

The game is bad for a lot of reasons, but the biggest is its confusing interface. There isn't a tutorial mode, there are very few 'challenge' scenarios, theres no way of seeing when the next milestones are, building position seems to be irrelevant... The entire game is from another era - and while it might have some nostalgic value for a couple minutes, it definitely doesn't meet todays standards of a pay to play game -- it doesn't even hold up to most free games.","July 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","17","23","3","0"
