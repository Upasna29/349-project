A blend of strategy and twitch-based genres, baptized as “Twitch-Strategy” by the developers, and as such it might not be that normal tower defense and strategy game that one would expect. Forget about defeating waves of enemies on a single map with fixed building spots and upgrades, instead, embrace your limited freedom and walk freely on the map, trying to survive by strategically spawning droids and placing structures within a limited time.\n\nPresentationThe game has a cartoonish 2D style with a unique feel to it. The focus lies on a futuristic look while keeping it as a tribute to those old game shows, maybe a bit too detailed which make it look messy, with too much going on, like the billboards filling the background of the battlefield with witty anecdotes; sadly there is not enough time to read them all, but the effect is still there.\n\nThe audio is very simplistic and yet very fitting, but sadly there isn't much variation in it, therefore it looses some attractiveness and might get irritating in a longer game run, considering that the soundtrack is pretty much the same as it fits the the theme perfectly.\n\nAs it a more casual game there is not very much voice acting going on. The lines are brought in an attempt to sound stupid and funny, but in the end the humorous might not get appreciated by all players and a bunch of references might go by unnoticed with the younger players.\n\nPlotThe story plays in the future where robots dominate the human race. The player plays the role of U.H. Wutt. A typical fat nerdy human who is too smart according the droids and is sentenced to death because of it. The 'truth' about it all, is slowly reveal with the messages on the boards, the cries heard in the battle and many other elements in the background. The story also packs some parodies, references and puns from cult classics, but most of them can easily be missed by younger players, while olders might find it overdone. At the end, the story seems to disappear along the gameplay rather fast.\n\nGameplayThe first level sort of acts like a tutorial but still leaves an aftertaste of confusion. A lacking of "how to" or a the function of replay the tutorial makes the game confusing at times and might force the player to replay certain levels before realizing what needs to be done.\n\nAs the game will progress, the gameplay will only be getting harder, and your buddy (a chained mobile factory or G.I.M.P., standing for Gameshow Intimidation Machine of Pwnage) also has an energy bar, which needs to recharge if you spawned too many droids in a short time. You also must place buildings around the map, which will help with defeating the enemy droids, but some will help by generating other friendly droids.\n\nThe has a simple premise which consist in each level Wutt getting transported to a planet, then he needs to accomplish some goals before getting on a rescue ship. The ultimate goal is always to survive until the timer runs out. Even though the field is small and is side scrolling, the space above is filled with flying enemies and sinking coins that Wutt will use to grab with his equipped hook.\n\nKilling enemies, grabbing coins and getting upgrades while text balloons with funny lines shows up; dying re-adjusting and repeating is all what will be left of the strategy as the levels get harder and faster. The game has particular power-ups available through spinning the wheel, but they are so far and in-between, you’ll never have enough. It would be great if the money could be used to buy more units. But that is unfortunately not possible.\n\nReplayabilityThe challenges or levels have a high replay value. In fact the more it gets replayed, the fun factor rises together with the understanding and goal of that level. None the less, for certain gamers it could get repetitive, while others might quit or get bored with the string of dying and restarting due to the difficulty spikes in some levels.\n\nAdding to the replayability value, the levels do not only have a difficulty setting, which is easily changed by a slider, but the also provides a in-game level editor, as well as different languages packs, custom sprites and levels in the Steam Workshop.\n\nConclusionDeath by Game Show is a fun casual game filled with tons of humor and a unique style based on a great idea. Definitely can be addictive if not for the uncertainty of what to do. It is perfect for getting a few minutes of strategy and overall fun but might not be for everyone. If the kinks get worked out, it just might become one of those games you just need to play if you are fan of the hard challenges.\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn ! curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn !","May 27","true","4.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","3"

Game is based in 26th century where apparently everyone else is stupid and our hero is way too smart and is therefor sentenced to rehabilitation. Rehabilitation turns out to be a TV-show where audience awaits your death and the main idea of the game is to avoid dying.\n\nRight from the beginning I found the graphics really appealing for an indie game, lacking only the differences between two of a kind of robots or buildings. Every explosion and critical hit is presented in a comic book- way which adds a nice little touch with matched sound effects. The one and only background tune that is constantly playing, however, quickly becomes annoying and you start wishing for any Justin Bieber song instead. Extra points for the Big Arnie's "Get to da choppa!" phrase, always could be more of these!\n\nThe death match happens on a circular planet- map between two electric fences where you will have to use strategic skills and planning in a strategic view in order to destroy enemy robots and buildings, as there is never enough time nor energy. You spawn the robots by pressing keys 1 - 0 on your keyboard and build the buildings as well as use the boosters with your mouse, which sometimes didn't respond correctly to my actions.\n\nGame is fun for the first 40 minutes where you finish the tutorial and do some of the easy levels of the game. I found it hard to follow the instructions since there were a lot of text content on the screen, but after 5 minutes of playing you get used to the excess signs between every inch of the screen.\nAfter 40 minutes of playing, game becomes grinding hell where you need to run previous levels multiple times to buy yourself a good amount of boosters and buildings to finally pass the next round. Level 14 alone took me 40 minutes to pass, even with 0% difficulty slider - which I think is way too long for an indie game that has 50 levels, with even harder achievements.\n\nJudgment\nAfter a few level optimizations should become greater than Fallout Shelter! Game is totally worth its price.\nPLUSSES AND MINUSES:\n\n- difficulty of levels\n- background tune becomes annoying after a while\n- becomes grinding in terms of replaying\n\n+ many levels\n+ achievements and trading cards on Steam\n+ random comments such as "Get to da choppa!"\n+ hours of fun\n\nGRAPHICS7MUSIC (TUNE)5CONTROLS8SOUND EFFECTS6STORY7\nOVERALL RATE:		7","February 15","true","7.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","1"

The graphics are well-designed for a two-dimensional game, pretty much basically cartoonish, but they are well detailed, fitting the game perfectly. The textures are pretty good as well, they are pretty detailed. The atmosphere takes place on Terra and in the Solar System, and basically on Terra you are on a stage where there is a show-designer, cameramen and random units around. In the Solar System, you will be sent on different planets with a rocket, and then released on the planet where you need to accomplish various objectives, differing from mission to mission. The audio is pretty nice, all of the sounds are well-optimized, as well as the soundtrack being great and funny. The gameplay is about a human who needs to fight the enemy droids with his friendly droids, which are being spawned by his buddy, which looks like a smiley locker. As the game will progress, the gameplay will only be getting harder and harder, and your buddy also has an energy bar, which needs to recharge if you spawned too many droids in a short time. You also must place buildings around the map, which will help with defeating the enemy droids, but some will help by generating other friendly droids. The story happens in the 26th century, and the show-designer keeps the story alive, until the end of the game. The controls are alright, there isn’t anything wrong with them. The engines are alright as well, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. This game works even with low-performant computers, as the store page says, making it accessible to any gamer. The mechanics are pretty nice, the enemies and buildings drop nicely when getting destroyed, and everything moves pretty good.\nPositive Points Pretty nice 2D graphics and nice textures\nPretty good SFX and soundtrack\nFun and challenging gameplay\nMany types of units and buildings\nMany levels to combat (around 50)\nThe ability to construct buildings\nThe ability to spawn your own units\nIntegrated in-game level editor\nSteam trading cards and achievements\nNeutral Points The difficulty gets a bit too hard too early\nThe area of fighting could be a little longer probably\nA multiplayer option would  be a great feature\nNegative Points It gets a little confusing from time to time\nToo much background text displayed around the maps\nIt could get repetitive for certain gamers sometimes\nGeneral Ratings\nFeature	Rating	Graphics	78/100	Atmosphere	72/100	Audio	80/100	Music	82/100	Gameplay	76/100	Story	78/100	Content Quality	75/100	Content Quantity	72/100	User Interface	70/100	Controls	85/100	Engines	85/100	Mechanics	80/100	Price Tag	88/100	Personal Rating	79/100","May 14","true","2.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

He's to intelligent that he has to go for rehabilitation. Which will on us to stop that?\n\nThe beginning wasn't complicated, level 1 was a sort of tutorial. From my viewpoint, level 5 is where the challenge begins.  Something I didn't find amusing was the quantity of information the developers provided on the screen and there wasn't any pause button to read everything another time, so you'd have to be quick in understanding this game properly. It's easier to understand to unlock the various powers and achievements, but difficult to get all the money!\n\nGraphics are really good. Sadly, there are a lot to read, like rules, and that's a big issue when you're playing. Rich colors and textures. I loved the 2D touch implemented.\n\nMusic was decent. I always appreciated good music but it's never always the main thing in a game. Ambience sounds were great, just as we expect in a TV reality show.\n\nI recommend it! Lovely game, you can pass hours try to improve a level and get the achievements.\n\nI really recommend this game, funny and with enough levels to get frustrated at.\n","February 24","true","22.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

This is my personal review, not for any company and with no benefits towards myself.\n\nMain Game Features:\n\nStrategy/Tower Defense\nGame show setting\nPlace buildings and send droids to win challenges\nAsset Creation, Level Editor, and Text Editor.\nQuick Comparison:\n\nThis is a very unique game. I honestly haven't found any other game like it (there may be one, but I have not come across it). However, if I had to compare it to something to help someone get a gist of if they'd like it. It would be a mix of Swords & Soldiers and Castlestorm.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nThe first few levels are tutorials. Short and sweet to tell you the controls and get familiar with objectives. However, not the best I've experienced. It does well in explaining the core concepts of the game, but falls short when giving you extra (debatably benificial) information; such as shortcut keys, which can still be found within the game's "controls" menu in settings. As well as, giving you time to familiarize yourself with the different buildings.\n\nOverall Gameplay:\n\nYou go through levels, with various objectives, placing buildings and sending out droids. It sounds like an easy concept, but this game very difficult. There is little to no hand holding, and that can be considered good or bad, depending on the type of player you are.\n\nAs you play through a level, destroying enemy droids and buildings, coins will fall on the ground and start sinking below the surface. You are equiped with a launch hook (grappling hook) which is used to pick up coins from a distance.\n\nThe main goal of every level is to board the rocket and fly back to safety. However, there are various objectives to complete before the rocket arrives. For example, some levels may have you survive a certain amount of time before the rocket lands and you can enter, others may have you collect a certain amount of coin.\n\nWhen you send out droids, your G.I.M.P.'s energy meter goes down, but does recharge over time. If the charge depletes, G.I.M.P. falls to the ground and your movement is slowed. However, you can still send out droids.\n\nThroughout levels you build up a spinner, which hold either power-ups or extra cash.\n\nUpon completing a level, you get rewards (power-ups or buildings) to use in other levels.\nPros and Cons:\n\nPros:\nUnique game\nExtremely fun to play\nWitty and commical writing\nChallenging gameplay\nAlmost everything is customizable\nCons:\nChallenging gameplay\nCould use some gameplay tweaks\nFor The Developers:\n\nI know you guys are planning to put out a patch at the end of this week, but I'm still going to go over the game in it's current state.\n\n1. Entering a level, the difficulty slider mostly just changes the rate that the enemies come out at, and how much coin is dropped. So if I turn it down to make the game "easier" I feel like I'm also hindering myself because I'm not getting the coin I need to in order to get that objective. My opinion on this is to have the slider also lower the coin needed to pass the objective.\n\n1a. For example, I was on a level that required $8,500,000 in order for the rocket to come. If I moved the slider down, I felt it was harder for me to hit that coin mark, because less coin was being dropped.\n\n2. I know the hotkeys are there for the droids, but some people may prefer being able to see the coresponding number.\n\n2a. For example, Hammie would show a small number one in the bottom left corner.\n\nFinal Words:\n\nLong story short, buy this game. If you're a fan of any strategy and/or tower defense game, you will not regret this purchase. I've mentioned before that the game gets challenging, but on the same note - I'm not a very good player. Having said that, I still really enjoy the game.","January 25","true","37.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","1"

I did not really know what to expect but it really won me over. The game is basically a funny game show where you are a human who is deemed 'too smart' by the robot overlords. You then have to go through a series of challenges all the while building up your money and buying new items to beat the next stages. The humor is more mature in nature so be advised. Not too crass but not for children. The graphics are well done a crisp cartoony look. The sound is great and the little robots that you defeat and the ones you use of your own to defeat them with are funny and charming. After playing this for about 10 minutes I was hooked. The difficulty ramps up around stage 8 or 9 but even in the lower levels the game is just fun to play. I would rate this title an 8 out of 10.

Well onto the First Level, Not one for signs telling me what to do I went left and died lol\nI like the stretcher carry away scene as you perish as well.\nThe concept is intresting. The Narators Voice is deep and cool when you die and beat the levels. I didn't see much gameshow connection in the first few levels of playing tho, besides the wheel that comes up to spin. The game is sort of like a tower defence game in the sense that you must survive waves of enemies to be able to beat the level.\nWow Come on "Get to the chopper!" super funny Arnold Reference,  sounded almost sampled, if so hope they asked rights and dont get sued lol\nPlayed through a few more levels (upto 9-3) seems like the same so far with more powers and little homies to help you.\nOverall this game is interesting, a whole lot less gameshow like and a lot more of just a survival game.

It stood out and seemed like it had good deal of quality for me to follow up on and check out when it was released. So scooped it up on release day.\n\nIt hasn't dissappointed. So far I really like the game even though level 9 has me completely baffled after many retries and resets. With that said the game has a charm and enjoyment to it's style and presentation that with even being stuck on a level I'm still enjoying trying to figure out how to beat it. If the rest of the game is like this I'll enjoy it but I can probably see it not being for people who are prone  to punching monitors or smashing keyboards in fits of rage because a game isn't easy insta-win enough.\n\nIf there was one thing I wish it had that's missing is a hotkey system for picking the various units rather than having to  mouse click them. I find myself to be wanting to just use the mouse for grabbing dropped coins to get my wheel spins or level requirements. Having to do that and also clicking the right unit to build in the small list on the bottom is a bit of a juggling act when things get a bit frantic.\n\nAll-in-all a very well made game that's fun to play and look at. The hard work and thought put in by these devs definately shows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/recommended/409730/","Gamingtrevor","Gamingtrevor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/","203 products in account","To read my full review, click here; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/death-by-game-show-review/\n\nWhen I first heard about Death By Game Show, it was touted as a game inspired by the great film Idiocracy.  I would call it a guilty pleasure film, but it deserves more than that.  Then I read up on the game, discovering that the developers were also declaring this game was blending the strategy and twitch-based genres in what they coined as ‘Twitch-Strategy.’  Intrigued, I requested a copy and gave it a whirl.  I’m not a huge fan of strategy games, but like speed chess, the merger of speed with critical decision making was something that greatly interested me.\n\nThe game starts in the 26th century, where your character U.H. Watt stands trial for being too smart for a human.  You’re sentenced to rehabilitation, otherwise known as Death By Game Show.  This is the full extent of the story.  Obviously, when they said ‘inspired by’ the designers thought it meant referencing lines from the cult classic.  All of the writing is borrowed dialogue from a full gamut of films, including The Dark Knight, Office Space and even Predator’s ‘get to the choppa’ line.  If you still enjoy hammed up ‘Awnald’ impersonations, then you’re going to love this game’s wacky sense of humor- sadly I found it kind of grating and childish.  The story is basically non-existent, so I’m going to move past it and looks towards the gameplay.\n\nYou’re transported to a planet at the beginning of every round, where you run around the planet’s surface with goals to accomplish before you can take back off on a rescue ship.  Despite it being a side-scrolling experience, the developers have utilized flying enemies to use the space above, buildings behind the front row that can only be taken out with particular robots, and coins that sink underground that you can pluck out with a claw right out of Bionic Commando.  You can also adjust the difficulty before a stage, with the lower the risk, the less coins your enemies will drop.\n\nYou’re strapped to The G.I.M.P. (Gameshow Intimidation Machine of Pwnage), an automatic and personified locker, which has a limited amount of energy as it shoots out your selected fighters.  If you push him past his limits (indicated at the lower left by a power meter), he’ll fall over exhausted until his meter fills back up.  You can still send out robots while he’s down, but it’ll be at a slower pace, and you’ll have to drag it if you decide to move.  As you take out enemies and blow up buildings, you’ll collect coins and upgraddes (the extra D is for a double dose of pimpin’).  Once you’ve taken out the buildings or raise enough money, you return to the studio audience, and your money continues to rack up (as long as you don’t die).\n\nI have to say- when I first started with the tutorial levels, I understood the innovative spark behind the design.  Being on a two-dimensional plane, you’re robots have a nice blend of offensive and defensive purposes, while you focus on grabbing coins that fall beneath the skirmishes.  You have a mobile wall that pushes back enemies and standard troopers you can send out to swarm the opposition.  There’s a fast-paced missile that blows up upon collision with an enemy building or robot, and flying robots that take out background infrastructures.  Your opponents come out of lockers as well, and you can see a timer counting down until their release.  It’s quite innovative.\n\nSadly, these ideas aren’t as developed as they need to be, and the strategy and choices evaporate as you get further along in the game.  This is clearly the opposite of how it’s supposed to be.  I should be getting more confident, and discovering new ways to utilize my abilities.  My paths should be growing instead of narrowing down to one.  Because everything starts moving at a breakneck speed with very limited resources, you’ll discover a level’s needed order of attack, and what you’ll need to defend against the pushback.  You don’t spend time strategizing; you’ll just die, figure out what went wrong, adjust and try again.  Eventually, you’ll ignore the coins that fall into the ground (they’re not worth the risk), and you’ll be focused on remembering the patterns.  It’s more like learning an overly complicated dance fad, knowing that when you do finally nail it, it’ll be meaningless, and you’ll have to move onto the next one.\n\nThe game does try to change things up; perhaps a stage will be based on points, or destroying every building on the planet.  However, considering most of the time you’ll need to kill everything to get the points you need, the goal of every stage is the same- leave nothing standing.  The game has particular power-ups you can only get through spinning the wheel, but they’re so far and in-between, you’ll never have a nice reserve.  What would’ve been nice is if I could’ve used my money to buy additional units, but sadly the game doesn’t offer that- making money useless outside of high scores.\n\nVisually, the game is very imaginative with character designs, but the frame is cluttered without any mercy.  The GUI just has too much going on for me to pay proper attention to any one area.  When you release robots, they speak with a giant text box saying some 90’s Back To The Future reference that fills the screen.  Huge black and white billboards have even more witty anecdotes, as planets rotate around the background as you move.  All this sensory overload doesn’t matter too much either, as most of the time your eyes will be planted on The G.I.M.P.’s power meter as you release enemies as quickly as you can.  The only time your eyes will be needed is when you look up to defend against hovering opponents or missiles.  Then, occasionally you’ll get to spin a giant wheel that gives you a random perk- that ends up filling the screen while enemies continue to push towards you.\n\nMike Judge should be blushing because this new take on the strategy genre has been infused with his magical extract of vulgarity and satire. Regarding style, the game has a distinct feel. The speedy gameplay has an innovative approach. Sadly, the execution is entirely off, and everything from the mechanics to the audio comes across as muddled and half-baked. There’s simply too many missing opportunities to be recommended. Soon, “twitch strategy” becomes as impressive as combining empathy and action into a “walking shooter.” I would only recommend this game to hardcore fans, who are willing to wade through poorly implemented ideas to experience this fast-paced strategy game.\n\nI recommend this game to only hardcore fans, or those interested in the idea of breakneck strategy.","January 24","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

The replayability of the game comes in the form of trying the same levels over and over to finish them or get a high score, while this may sound dull the game manages to be quirky enough with the right mixture of different game-play elements that it never gets stale. The devs were not lying when they said the game is hard, sometimes it will take several attempts just to finish a level as you try and build up the required buildings and power ups via the 'spins' mechanic to complete a level, but when you do it feels very satisfying.

The core strategy and the different combinations of buildings/robots leads to a lot of dynamic challenge that players will enjoy, it's just a bit rough to get accustomed to it while you fail over and over again. The dynamic difficulty setting and the real risk that comes with pushing forward with reckless abandon or not thinking about your next move will keep your mind thinking. So the core gameplay works well...it's just got a set of functionality around it that could use some improvement to make it easier to play. It's nice to see though that steam workshop support will be there, and I feel that it will make a huge difference for the life the game. The humor of the game is hit and miss, and that's really what I feel about the game in the end. It's going to be very hit and miss with the different audiences out there, and while it hit with me, be weary if you like more general strategy experiences, because this game will probably frustrate you.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kOR7CyJ1Fo\n\nLists:\n+:\nGood strategy gameplay that forces change up in tactics, and does it with good enemy combinations in combination with the environments in question.\nThose looking for a challenge will get it here. The dynamic difficulty selection gives a good risk/reward, especially with the fact that losing takes away all your money.\nEach unit seems to have a specific purpose and strength, and blowing all you energy/robots on one type: you're going to have a bad time. Aggressive/defensive strategies can both work well depending on the objective.\nGood reasons to go replay levels. The challenge is still there, and you get those extra items that can go a long way.\nLike the coin system actually played in the spinner system. Getting money, which is your ultimate goal, had multiple purposes.\nThere's some good humor, in particular with the robot announcer in between rounds. Not the greatest, but still good.\n-:\nThere's a steep learning curve. You'll fail a bunch at first....and you'll really be frustrated by the end of it.\nThe exploding enemies hitbox range feels rather deceptive, and several times that I thought I was out of the way of the blast radius, only to take damage. Led to some frustrating deaths.\nUI should have hotkey indicators so that it's easy to associate the key number with the robot, without having to do math in the head internally.\nWhile there's some humor that works, there's some parts that falls flat. Some repeated lines in particular really got on my nerves.\nThe pace of the game with pausing can really be up and down. Once you get more used to the game and it's mechanics, it gets better, but yeah, it's\nThose with a low frustration tolerance: you're probably going to want to look elsewhere. With the losing of money and sometimes one hit going a long way to your death, it can cause some major anger.\nThe game has controller support......but the game is not designed for the controller at all. Awkward on a lot of levels to use, in particular with switching from the sets of buildings/robots/powerups.","January 22","true","9.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","6","11","3","0"

Instead of being stuck onto a single map and having to defeat enemies wave after wave, Death by Game Show removes that element and replaces it with being able to walk around the battle feild spawning droids to help you survive.\n\nGameplayThis game takes a new way of playing tower defence games, and makes this game a very unique one at that. The way that you play the game is you are on this planet, there will be enemy droids spawning that will try to kill you. You have your buddy, which I can't really indentify what it is, that spawns friendly droids that will kill the other droids. The first few levels are fairly simple, you spawn in a bunch of droids to survive until the ship gets back so you can exit the level. But after the first few easy tutorial levels have finished then the game starts to get a lot more strategic. You cannot simply spawn in a bunch of friendly droids to kill all the others, as there is a energy bar that limits you to how many you can spawn at once. This game is fairly fun and easy to pick up and play. With a nice variety of different droids and buildings that you can place down to hekp hold off the opposing droids, there really is a lot of content in this game to play around with for the strategic side of the game. The game does seem to take a steep difficulty curve when you hit a specific level, dying over and over until you can either win or just exit the game completely. The soundtrack on the otherhand is truly brilliant and well suited to this type of game. I feel like there needs to be a bit more content in the game generally, as the game does seem to get repetitve after a little while of paying the game.\n\nThe graphics of this game are alright enough to stand upon looking at. But after a while of playing the game, it does get a little bit boring to look out. I think that most of the levels don't have much variaion in the background, and just seem to be copied from the previous level and added some buildings that spawn new enemies around the map. Although some of the buildings do look nice, there still just seems to be a lack of variation in what is in the backgrounds of each level.\n\nPros+ Unique styled Tower defence game\n+ Some nice graphics\n+ A great soundtrack\n+ Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Not much variation to background\n- Gets repetitve after a while.\n\nResult / Final thoughtsThis a very unique and interesting tower defence game that has some really nice graphics, but doesn't seem to have much variation when it comes to the background graphics. The soundtrack is brilliant, and the gameplay itself is fairly fun and simple to pick up after the first few levels. But, unfortunatly the game does seem to get repetitve after a while of playing the game.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow ReviewExperts curator group here.","March 28","true","1.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wilcotheman/recommended/409730/","wilcotheman","Wilco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wilcotheman/","168 products in account","Death By Game Show ReviewBy Wilco\n\nIntroAs of writing this review i have played 1.5 hours (90 minutes). I Will be writing about the gameplay and the graphics, i will also write about all the good and bad things i came across while playing the game.\n\nGameplayIn this game you are a smart human, the world has been taken over by robots called bots. You look your part, a classic fat kid with wierd glasses that looks smart, this game does alot of that, using stereo types and issues in society like STD's. It uses all these things and makes jokes of them, which it manages to do with success. You have been captured by  the bots because you are too smart, you are put on a game show by bots for bots and your goal is to survive and escape the game show (as far as I could tell).  You are put through a bunch of challenges by the bots, you land on a planet you either defend from the bots or attack them, and there is always a timer to make sure some preasure is applied. By killing robots and their buildings you get money, in some levels you need a certain amount within the time limit and in some levels its just for the high score. However, you dont have any guns, or melee weapons, how do you kill bots? By fighting fire with fire, you use bots of your own to fight their bots, by spawning them from your mobile flying factory that is chained to you, you can accually defend yourself from the robots or attack their buildings.\n\nSome robots fly, some walk, some drive, but they can all fight. For example some robots are used to blow up buildings on the fron lines and some are used to blow up buildings on the background. In some levels you get to place these buildings yourself. When you need to defend from the robots for example.\n\nIn many levels there is a difficulty slider where you can set how difficult you want the level to be. I have only played on 100% difficulty (probably the way the game is supposed to be played) but if a level is to hard you can half difficulty.\n\nOne thing i dont like about this game is that with the money you win you can buy extra bots to fight for you, special ones that are better but here is the deal, you get only one of them and one costs around 10 million I believe. In my oppinion this should be a matter of unlocking these bots and then you can spawn them in a challenge when you are able to spend your entire energy bar for example. Also with the money you win you can buy buildings, you can place one. I think it would be better if the amount you bought would be replenished at the start of every challenge.\n\nThe game lacks clarity of how to do things. A couple of times I ran into a situation where I finnaly realized after playing the level a couple of times what to do. The tutorial is a one time thing, meaning that once you click through it you cant get it back and you are on your own (as far as i know).\n\nGraphics, sound and musicThe graphics of this game are cartoon-ish but with more detail which is nice. it fits the game well i think. After all the whole game is based around a future where the robots have taken over and are producing entertainment for dumb humans by putting smart humans through deadly challenges on TV. The sound is just as cartoony, same for the music, it fits this game well, it goes along with the art style which is think is one of the most important things for sound and music.\n\nConclusionIts a fun little game, with humor. I like the game because its goofy and you can quickly hop in and play the game for a few minutes. The gameplay itself is fun although it sometimes does not make it clear what, how, when or why. The single use bots and buildings are a minor downside since you could probably pass every level without them but i would like to see that change as i described before.\n\nAfter taking all of this into consideration i give this game a 7/10. Its not a big game with tons of story to be had, the gameplay is simple yet fun. It could definatly improve on some pretty important aspects but i like it.\n\nTL;DR7/10. Fun Gameplay, good Graphics, nice sound and music, but gameplay could be improved uppon in diffrent areas.","May 3","true","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Take the example of U.H.Wutt who was tried in court for being too smart! Yes, you read it right. To make even worse, he was sentence to rehabilitation . . . In the 26th century, rehab means you are going to overcome serious challenges to stay alive, as you are being sent to this strange game show called. . .  Death by Game Show! Sounds like a walk in the park to me. Oh, I do not want to be rude but I think the game host is about to present our new contestant and I have the feeling it might be our dear U.H. Wutt!\n\nDeath by Game show is a strategy/action/tower defence game where you play the smart and groovy U.H.Wutt, who was sentenced to . . .  Death by Game Show! When the opening scene ends, you will be dropped by a rocket on a groovy stage show, where droids will take pictures of you (a bit like Japanese tourists, the flashlight never stops)! Here you will be able to see your next challenge, as well as the reward allocated for successfully completing the challenge. It might be reaching a specific number of points within a time frame to gain a structure or a new droid.\n\nYou will spawn on a field which will have an electronic fence on each end of the screen. These fences are not too far apart and all the action will take place within them. You will have to defend U.H.WUTT and his G.I.M.P.\n\nThe G.I.M.P is a giant floating locker strapped to you. It is also where your droids will spawn but it has a limited amount of energy. If the energy bar is at its lowest, you will still be able to order droids but they will be deployed rather slowly.  You will have up to 10 units to use, 6 special moves and 11 structures to choose from. You will be able to gain additional structures, units and special moves through the wheel of fortune (well, this is what I call it). To be able to spin the wheel you have to collect a specific number of coins. How do you get coins? It is rather simple; just destroy the enemy units and buildings, run over the coins or use your grapping tool to get them. As soon as you get the right number of coins, you will be able to use the wheel but it does not mean you‘ll get an extra unit, special move or structure - you could get nothing at all! Just the luck of the draw, I guess.  Just keep picking up coins! Plan and get the right gear to succeed in your next challenge.\n\nThis is a game that has a fair bit going on at once, and to be truly honest with you, could deter people. But I think it is a charm that makes this game stand out from the others! You will have plenty of failure, but as we say, a failure is one step closer to success.\n\nI really like the artwork in this game, it just fits so well. Great humour too, I like really like the voice saying “GET TO THE CHOPPER!” The controls are fine but it will take you some time to get used to all the units, special moves and buildings.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great artwork\n-	Challenging and fun to play\n-	Good humour\n-	Plenty re-playability\n-	Trading cards & Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Challenging levels can become frustrating at times\n\nDeath by Game Show is a challenging game with great artwork, humour and plenty of episodes/levels to play. Great fun!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Wonderful action strategy game with cartoon graphics and a Monty Python/Futurama sense of humour. The graphics in particular evoke memories as a kid of the Beano style comic annuals I used to read. Love the sound effects, especially ones that remind me of famous movie lines.\n\nThe gameplay is quick and action-packed, but still incorporates a degree of strategy and puzzle-solving so that you're rewarded for that  "just one more go" way of approaching this. Tremendously satisfying!\n\nI hope to see more games like this in the future: polished, lovely artwork, sound and humourous, but not sacrificing gameplay in any way.\n\nI just hope there's a sequel in the pipeline!!","May 4","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a funny fat character with a hook that looks like the portal gun, and the physics gun. What does it do? I'm telling that later. But you are in a world that looks like another universe, and you are there the only human, you must do a bunch of funny mini-games, DON'T think that they are easy, they begin easy, but later they aren't that easy! If you gonna click on play, first there opens a red canvas, and then there is a kind of weird robot which is talking to you and is making jokes/puns, then you can start a mini-game. A rocket brings you to the place, and there are you: Such a random guy with a hook. NOW I gonna tell about that hook, it's for if you kill the evil bots that try to kill YOU. If they die, you get a coin or an item, and you can grab it with your hook, you need to do that, so you can fill a power-meter that gives you nice power-ups! Well, what to do in the game, it's a kind like a tower defence, so you must defend your place and spawn you OWN bots to fight with the evil ones. There are other missions too, you have uhm, defend your place, do the task you get, don't die, and a much more tasks. It was a really funny game, a little bit difficult to know what to do if you play it for the first time. I thought that you must do something with the hook, so I shoot the hook at the enemies, but nothing happened, because it's only for coins, power-ups, etc. I had to spawn my own bots, but I didn't knew that hahaha, so for me it was a little bit boring in the begin, but when I knew how to play it, I played it very long and enjoyed playing this game. I haven't encountered a fault or bug or glitch at all! So this game was for me a little bit special...\n\nConclusion:A very nice game, I think it's for the guys who really enjoy playing tower defence games quite much funnier! On the trade forum is not that much of activity now, but it’s coming! I'm also not that guy that plays tower defence games, but this one was fun, it was also a great experience to try a new game like this one, now I gonna give this game a rating, I'll give this game: 7,5 - 10. That's quite high, because I really liked it! Well, this was my review about this cool game! I hope you enjoyed reading this!","May 8","true","4.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
