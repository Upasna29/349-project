I enjoy playing the solo games, but I like "screwing" my friends over and forcing them to attempt to answer quetions they don't know the answers to. Jack Attack is probably the thing I'm best at, both with knowledge and with fast fingers!","May 5, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact is you have so much fun you don't even care how much you're in the hole. You don't know jack is based on a game show (MAKE A LIVE TV GAME OF IT, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE) lmao. Get to know the game and play it often. One rule: if you don't know the answers I wouldn't guess. The host is really up for proving the motto.","February 17, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
