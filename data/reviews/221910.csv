Here is my real review for this game:\n\nThe Stanley parable is an interesting game, but it has no jumping, no zombie killing, and no Call Of Duty references in it, but a whole lot of button pressing.\n\nThis game gives you choices, but a small number of choices. The many endings are quite few and I believe there should have been more of them.\n\nThere's really not much more I can say about this game. It does have a balanced amount of humor and it is actually good humor. Wow, a game (better yet SOMETHING in modern America) with actually good jokes. Other than that, the game is pretty fun, for about 5 hours. To be honest, it gets kind of boring after playnig it for a while.\n\n7.5/10\n\nThis game has potentional and it is of acceptable quality, but it needs more to it.

'Why what?' I hear you ask. No! Just simply 'why'. A question you will constantly ask yourself, and probably never answer well enough to feel satisfied.\n\nSo what is the game? Well you play Stanley, who works in an office. And one day Stanley realises everyone else has disappeared and it is up to him to find out why ... or is it? You see the problem with describing this game is whilst there are many different endings, none of them seem to be 'the right one', or perhaps all of them are.\n\nYes I realise this review is not even slightly helpful in undertand what this game is, and wether or not you should buy it.  So here it is: Buy this game and play it! It is something that everyone should experience. Love it or hate it .... you really should try it.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io3c1USf0V4&list=PLE7DlYarj-Dd0n0idk-siWmqIFcXCzZ48&index=2","December 30, 2014","true","4.9"," 351 of 380 people (92%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","92","351","380","61","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/221910/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewThe Stanley Parable is a one of a kind game. You play as Stanley, an employee that has to press buttons. When suddenly, you stop and head out your office. A narrator describes your adventure and it's up to you to listen to him or not. Explore the office building and make different choices every playthrough and unlock all of the many endings possible!\n\nThe Pros:Beautiful - The graphics are decent, the lightning glorious, and walking through the building is pleasant to the eye.\n\nChoices - The best thing a game can do for you is let you be in control. The Stanley Parable makes you make your own story, every step of the way, and unlocking a different ending every time. Such decisions include taking the left or right door, going to the meeting or not, or turning off the evil machine... or not. Every action has a thing to say for the ending.\n\nComical - The narrator says things that are sometimes very funny, the way he reacts when you disobey him and the scenes you encounter have some very rich monologue.\n\nDeep - It might not look like this the first time you play, but as you uncover different endings you will see the hidden meaning behind Stanley's story. The writing is very cleverly done, the existance of the narrator poses further questions, and the very nature of reality bends amongst different endings.\nThe Cons:Repetitive up to a point - As the story forks at different intersections, you are bound to repeat parts of it until you reach the branching point. Some of the paths require waiting for long narrations to play, so you might become a little impatient along the process.\n\nUnconventional Achievements - Most achievements require a degree of witt to figure out what they want (or read a guide) but there are some that are really unnecessary, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, implying either BIOS Time Changing or leaving the PC idle for 24 hours, the Unachiveable, which requires configuration file tweaks and the Go Outside which makes you not play for... 5 years. Of course, circumventable with a little sly techniques, but they are not achievements related to the game. They don't track progress or skill, they're just there to mess with you and waste your time.\nConclusion:The Stanley Parable stand out amongst the rest of pshycological narratives and really puts the player in a position of power over his destiny, or at least gives him a very powerful delusion about it. Buy with confidence, it is an enjoyable experience.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

The writing is clever, and the narration is charming, while also managing to be just a little unsettling.  It's a game, so much in that you control movement and press buttons.  But there isn't any combat, and the freedom of choice is just an illusion (which is kinda the point).  It's meant to be played over and over again, just to see the different reactions you can get from the game.  And there are many many reactions to find.\n\nAnd if this doesn't sound like something you'd want to spend any time with, you can always treat it like a really obscure easter egg hunt.  Because there's a ton of those too.  If you are like me, and you try to break a game just for fun, you might find out that this game considers it a legitimate storytelling branch.\n\nAnd if that doesn't sell it to you either, you can consider it a narrator annoyance simulator.  It's something for everyone, provided you like these three things.","October 19, 2014","true","2.9"," 243 of 258 people (94%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","94","243","258","25","1"

Stanley works in a dead end job carrying out mindless tasks; and the story is told by one of the best narratives I have ever heard. Graphics isn't an important feature here, but that being said, it looks really nice.\n\nThe design of the world is very well done, you are essentially in an office building, but it does a very clever thing where you can sometimes be walking around in a circle, and then all of a sudden the world changes, and you are somewhere else. This made the experience feel more real to me. You can make this game as easy or as difficult as you want. There is fifteen different stories and endings to the Stanley Parable, each of them is amazingly written, probably one of, if not the best story in gaming I've experienced and well worth playing.  It has taken me almost seven hours to play through all of the endings, and do all but one of the achievements. After you have played all of the endings though, there is probably no need to go replay any of the game again.\n\nIs the game worth ¬£9, 99, sure? For about seven hours of gameplay and the amount of fun I had playing it; you cannot miss out on The Stanley Parable. This is now in my top ten favourite games of all time.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It places players in the mundane shoes of Stanley, a corporate desk jockey who is placed in an office in front of a computer where he punches buttons for a living. One day his monitor goes blank and the other corporate drones that he shares the office building with disappear and so begins your Journey as Stanley.  Being the dull chap that he is, Stanley himself doesn't offer much ion the area of entertainment, but a charming English narrator provides the personality and humor necessary to make The Stanley Parable an enjoyable experience. The narrator provides player with instructions, becoming almost like a GPS device that has confused itself for a raconteur.\n\nWhere most games are about following the rules, The Stanley Parable is best enjoyed when breaking them. If the narrator says go right, you will certainly find more satisfaction in taking a left and listening as the narrator's knickers become twisted by your wanton disobedience. By taking these divergent paths you will find yourself faced with one of the game's 15 different conclusions. Each conclusion revels something a bit different about Stanley and they range from conspiratorial to surreal. The game plays a few tricks on you by repeating rooms endlessly or swapping out props on the fly truing an office into an apartment space. All of this is rendered in a simple and clean visual style. The color palette is muted to reflect just what a dull and miserable existence our pal Stanley has and the props are equally generic creating an appropriately stodgy atmosphere. As advertised the texture work adds far more detail than could be found in the original mod and overall the HD remix has much greater visual appeal.\n\nSo is The Stanley Parable a biting satire of the way in which modern games tell their story by allowing us to control a character on a predetermined path where deviation is punished? Is it a parody of the life of the average key punching office drone? Or, is it just an excuse to have a rather cheeky British man tell us what to do? The answer is that it's all of these... and none of them. It's a game that will give each of it's players a different take away. Each playthrough lasts between 15 minutes and a half hour. This doesn't sound like a lot of playtime, and it isn't but there is a tremendous degree of satisfaction in finding new ways to get the game to react to what you are or, in some cases, are not doing. Seeing all 15 endings without consulting a guide will probably take around 3 hours. These 15 endings are not Mass Effect 3 style endings either‚Äîthey are wholly unique and there are a couple of treats for gamers to be uncovered. Ultimately, The Stanley Parable will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it holds a very special spot in the gaming landscape. It's a testament to satire and unconventional design as well as manipulating gamer's expectations. In short it's the antithesis of it's key punching dullard protagonist.","November 25, 2013","true","3.9"," 703 of 846 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","703","846","0","16"

You play as employee number 427; an employee who only pushes buttons as per the instructions of his superiors. Stanley, however, does not receive any orders one day, therefore, he gets up from his desk and starts investigating what exactly has happened.\n\nAnd this is where you take control of him in this FPS which uses the well-known game engine called Source. Our protagonist immediately notices that nobody else is present in the office - he passes empty cubicles and corridors trying to find the answers.\n\nThere are no weapons in this game. No NPCs you can interact with. No objectives. No goals. Stanley Parable is about exploration. And this exploration, this journey of our white-collar worker is accompanied by the narrator's voice.\n\nHowever, you will notice that the narrator tells Stanley, in advance, which door he is supposed to take. But you can refuse the command and go to the direction you desire. And this is the most crucial part of this game: it is about choices. Your choices.\n\nAnd these choices can yield you at least a dozen endings. Endings that are funny, serious, sarcastic and some are even meant to be no more than mere easter eggs.\n\nThis is not something you'll spend dozens of hours with. No, Stanley Parable can be completed in a mere 30 minutes, still, it's worth the journey and the appreciation.","October 25, 2014","true","27.2"," 174 of 194 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","174","194","7","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/221910/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Narrator: "Stanley was fascinated about reading reviews. On this particular day, a new review showed up on his news feed. Stanley got excited. Without hesitation, Stanley began to read it."\n\nNarrator: "Sorry, I said, without hesitation, Stanley began to read it."\n\nNarrator: "Ahem. Without hesitation, Stanley began to read it."\n\nNarrator: "STOP IGNORING ME!"\n\nThe Stanley Parable is an odd one partly because it is, in essence, a first-person walking simulator with minimal ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù in it.  So, does it qualify as a game? Not in the traditional sense, that is certain. So what is the catch then?\n\nUnlike other walking simulators you would find around, The Stanley Parable's gimmick is its narrative-driven "gameplay", so to speak. Taking the role of Stanley Parable, you find yourself alone at your desk in the office until one day when the computer screen turns blank and all your colleagues mysteriously vanish. At this point, you begin to follow The Narrator‚Äôs voice which ‚Äúguides‚Äù you through the complex by narrating what Stanley would have done in the first place.\n\nBut this is where the game shines and, arguably, distinguishes itself from other dull walking simulators. If you remember how games nowadays (maybe even in the past) boast about how they provide the player with choices and consequences which in reality are all just an illusion, then The Stanley Parable showcases and criticises the nature of those narrative constructions in video games. You are given various opportunities to not do what the voice tells you to do which leads to a range of interesting, but twisted events and endings - some are peculiar, some are rather sad and others are hilarious. During each ending though, the playthrough resets and takes you right back from the start where from there on it is up to you to do whatever you want, once again. Whilst this might seem weird, maybe even underwhelming since you begin to think that you just completed the ‚Äúgame‚Äù, in fact it is all a continuation. Each reset is a new experience where at least one thing is different from the previous playthrough. As much as I would like to discuss these events and endings, they should be left for the player to experience without spoiling anything. So, the"game"  indirectly encourages the player to break the flow of the narrative and does it in a very smart way, indeed.\n\nIt all comes down to the level design which was well thought out. At times, it even starts playing with your mind. It makes you question yourself: Are you in control? Or is the ‚Äúgame‚Äù? What if it is neither? Heck, it even mocks both you and itself, including The Narrator. The hidden story behind all this is rather deep once you uncover it. What it tries to achieve here is unprecedented. Additional praises include The Narrator‚Äôs voice acting which is excellent and the soundtrack that fits perfectly with the mood of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù. Visually, it looks similar to any recent Source game. It has a nice colour pallet and some of its aesthetics resemble something from Aperture Science. In truth, The Stanley Parable does many things right, it seems, making it very hard to criticise it for any flaws or to even be nitpicky. The most obvious observation would be that it is a very short ‚Äúgame‚Äù of up to four or five hours if you go for all its endings, I would say. It is even possible to complete it in about five minutes if you follow The Narrator‚Äôs instructions. However, based on its scope, I believe it has the right length and does not over stay its welcome. More would have definitely made it actually repetitive.\n\nIn conclusion, at the end of the day, I personally found the experience enjoyable and perhaps that is enough to warrant a recommendation. It is a not a traditional game, and I would even say that it is not a game. It acts almost like an interactive playground for the player to experiment various ways to break the narration. But it is uniquely designed, intelligently written and amusing at times. Yes, very creative. Actually, it might as well have the best narrative as far as I am concerned. Personally, I could not find any traditional faults with it, aside from having almost no "gameplay", if that counts. I will admit that this might be the first and only non-game which I really enjoyed. So if you are looking for a traditional game, then do not get The Stanley Parable. You will be disappointed. However, I strongly recommend it for its one-of-a-kind experience which should not be missed nor ignored.\n\nOne advice though: Do get it on a sale. I believe ten pounds, or your regional equivalent, is a tad too much for its amount of content, even if it is exceptional. Maybe that is its only flaw actually.","September 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 162 of 179 people (91%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","91","162","179","93","0"

It is one of those "first-person walking" games in which you wander around a completely non-violent experience exploring the environment and unravelling the story, like Dear Esther.\nYou are Stanley, an office worker. Stanley has the job to push buttons on command until some day those commands abruptly stop. Stanley is leaving his desk to investigate, his actions are directed by a narrator who guides him through the office facility to discover the truth.\nThe Stanley Parable is a game about walking from A to B. As you approach a pair of doors, the narrator will indicate that Stanley takes the left one. Whether you do and how you decide to follow up your revolt or acquiescence, tilts the game towards wildly different conclusions. A playthrough may only take minutes, but The Stanley Parable has a lot of choices and a lot of different endings. It will take a few hours to see everything and every ending.\nAt each of the game's many intersections, you can follow the narrator's instruction or ignore it and face the consequences of your petty resistance. Each combination of choices leads to something unique. Some of these "endings" are lighthearted, some are absurd and many centre around the narrator's attempts to get back to his story.\nThe Stanley Parable has not the best Source Engine graphics. Many of the environments are bland, but deliberately so. Delightful hidden details show their faces everywhere if you are willing to look.\nThe best part of The Stanley Parable is the voice acting of the omnipotent Narrator. He plays witness to every move which do you make. From a kindly, yet firm, guiding hand at the start of the game to an acerbic wit if you ignore him, the Narrator really adds a soul to the world of The Stanley Parable.\nI enjoyed the game and I would recommend the game to people who want to try out something different instead of the normal games, but I would advice everyone to try out The Stanley Parable Demo before buying the game. It will tell you nothing about the main game, but you should then be able to decide if the game is something for you or not.\nIf you should still be unsure, you can also try the free mod, to make your final decision. The mod does not actually require Half-Life 2 on PC, only the Source SDK.\n\nSounds 8/10\nGraphics 5/10\nGameplay 3/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","November 28, 2013","true","27.9"," 409 of 537 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","409","537","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviro/recommended/221910/","deviro","F|PFC. Deviro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviro/","88 products in account","This short review/analysis contains spoilers about the game. Stop reading if you want to have a fresh experience with the game. Everything below is my speculation, don't take them as definitive facts.\nThe Stanley Parable is everything and beyond video games. It's a giant commentary on todays game development philosophy. Throughout its unexpected span and twisty narrative, it has a clear message - there are problems with narrative in video games, which we have not addressed yet.\nIn recent years we have seen a great amount of open world/sand box games. But there hasn't been shortage in linear games with strict control over players actions. Invisible walls or direct threatening by the game if you go off the map, even in scenarios where the level design suggests more freedom than the available and, but not limited to - bugging out the whole game or level by reaching unexpected locations are common practices in multiplayer and even in singleplayer games since decades.\nThe layout of the office (which is briefly explained in the museum, behind the scenes room) is designed and created with the mind that the dialogue and attention span of the player would balance and lead to the first sense of conflict - the two doors.\nThis first dilemma is presented geniously - with a confident and calm voice. At this point the narrator is still following the hardcoded written script. Which is what I describe as the main and simple story the whole Stanely Parable is based around - there is a problem, the protagonist decides to end the tyranny of the evil force and it concludes with a happy ending.\nThe simple story has cartoonish elements. Toward the end of it, it cultivates exaggerated tone and willingly becomes boring, it's purpose is to show the most basic and at the same time intriguing story. But only if the player obeys/follows the steps the given by the narrator.\nNot obeying the narrative, leads to all sorts of interesting results, which ultimately don't explain the whole picture of The Stanley Parable, which is left to players imagination. The game doesn't feel the need to address any of the questions which the audience asks frantically after playing it. The same happened in the demonstration, particularly in the 'Escape elevator' sequence.\nThroughout the exploration/ending hunting there are many sections where the nature of narration and design in games is examined and often made fun out of.\nMany actions, which are not part of the hardcoded script, of the player are directly commentated by the narrator.\nLike the 'Broom closet' - this room has no place in the whole game. In traditional game narrative it would be a waste of time - there isn't a collectable or extra life and if the player decides to explore it, the game would punish him for doing so. But here, the comedic nature of TSP rewards the player for paying attention to it, even if it is only a piece of dialogue.\nAchievements are another device with which the The Stanley Parable mocks the current video game industry. Take the 'Click on door 430 five times' for example  - a great way to address the ridiculous amount of pointless achievements in some games. Or 'Unachievable' - an obvious phantom which doesn't have a solution. It is created solely that particular part of the player audience grinds through the game, desperately trying to get it.\nSo, how does The Stanley Parable get away with being so rude to every aspect in the modern video game industry, while being part of it?\nIts complete and constant self awareness makes TSP simply perfect. It is written and executed exceptionally well. It deflects most of the criticism, directed at it, simply by being one.","November 25, 2013","true","5.6"," 380 of 504 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","380","504","0","1"

In fact, there is only one single part in the entire game I would say could actually jump you, and it's an error noise.\n\nBut...something within me was bothered during my gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/221910/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","A gem in my opinion!\n\nThis is one of those games that I actually tell myself I‚Äôm so glad that I played. The concept of this game is great to me.\n\nYou play as Stanley. A man who works in a mundane job pushing buttons all day. Orders come through to his screen to push buttons and he does as told. One day, Stanley realises no orders are coming through, and that no one else is in the office. He gets up to see what‚Äôs going on.\n\nThat‚Äôs where we come in! You navigate Stanley around a very seemingly linear office, and quickly discover that you have a narrator dictating everything that you do, before you do it. Of course, leaving you room to either play out what he says, or go against it. You come to various paths and crossroads and are given the choice to either do what you‚Äôre told or not.\n\nWhat I love about this game is how it plays on pure human curiosity. If you go one way, you usually wonder‚Ä¶ but what would happen if I went the other way? There is many endings to the game, and as the narrator goes on with his story, you wonder what is true. If anything you‚Äôre being told is true, what the real story to the game is or if there even is one. It gets you thinking, and I love a game that‚Äôll make me think!\n\nI enjoyed this game very much. I have an odd ‚Äúfear‚Äù, kind of, of missing or losing things. So being given a game with many paths, endings and different things to find, admittedly I did OCD over it a bit and actually went as far as drawing myself a map (Don‚Äôt judge me). But it was a lot of fun! I had a great time playing this game and think it is something anyone could enjoy.\n\nThe graphics are nice. I wasn‚Äôt aware before, but this game actually started as a Half-Life 2 mod. As a standalone game I think it did really well for itself.\n\nThe characters are amazing. I love both Stanley, the narrator and the odd ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù they have with each other (Even though Stanley never speaks). The voice casting for the narrator is on point, I honestly couldn‚Äôt imagine the character any other way. He‚Äôs well-spoken and has a great charm about him. The narrator in ways kind of ‚Äútrolls‚Äù you a bit with how he tries to keep you on track or how he reacts when you go against him. But he‚Äôs a great character and that is important for a game so dependent on that character being entertaining.\n\nThe humour in this game was something I did enjoy quite a bit. The way things are done and played out I was quite impressed with.\n\nIn terms of achievements, a few can be a little tedious, but in ways you ain‚Äôt even mad. As said before the game can ‚Äútroll‚Äù you at times and it does so even more through the achievements. I would say that it‚Äôs still easy to 100%, but there is a few that you kind of need to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù to achievement. For example, an achievement titled ‚ÄúGo outside‚Äù, your task being to ‚Äúnot play The Stanley Parable for 5 years‚Äù. Which, come on!\n\nAll in all, I love this game and really think you should give it a try. If you like a good bit of humour and like your curiosity being tempted I think this game is a good one for that.\n\n\nTL ; DR : A great and unique game that tests your curiosity and gets you thinking. It has many endings to offer and generally is fun, definitely try it!\n","September 2, 2015","true","51.1"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","59","62","3","6"

Many games have had truly great lines in them. Who could forget that one to the left of the web on Tempest? The one that stretches out from the explosion in Minestorm? Ah, the beautiful lines that you crash your bike into in a game of Light Cycles. They were good lines. And as time went past, games got more lines. Then one day we decided that lines weren't enough and we had some triangles and we put the triangles together and we made videogames with triangles instead of dots and instead of lines and oh, what did we lose? But it was OK because then lines came back into fashion around 2006 and they sort of glowed too. Glowy lines! We made games with glowy lines and the lines in those games were great too. I didn't like the green ones so much in Geometry Wars but they were trying y'know?\n\nYears and years of great lines and yet, it took until 2013 for us to get THE BEST LINE. Ladies and everyone else out there, The Adventure Line is the best line in all of videogames. Let us take a moment to let that sink in. The. Adventure. Line.\n\nThe Adventure Line is the best line. Sing it from the rooftops because this is -the- Oscar worthy line performances, the BAFTA of road markings, the Laurence Olivier award of yellow. Thank you, Adventure Line. You're amazing.

"Games" where the designer just wanted to tell a story and occasionally has the player click something to move the story along but the player's actions never actually mean anything. The Stanley Parable is very much NOT that sort of game. It has some legitimately profound things to say about narration and choice in games and storytelling, but it never comes off as pretentious. But I can't really say much else, because I don't want to spoil it. I normally hate vague reviews that tell you "just play it, I don't want to spoil it!" but... it's true. Trust me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/221910/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","I was very reluctant to give this game a negative review because I have mixed feelings about it, but ultimately, I would not recommend it to anybody else, especially not for it's full asking price. After playing it through a few times, I believe that the game just simply isn't worth the money, perhaps on a very generous sale, but even ¬£4.99 for that matter is a bit of a stretch. While I really admire the concept behind The Stanley Parable, which is what drove me to purchace the game in the first place, I personally found it to be dull and disappointing.\nThe Stanley Parable has lots of positive (yet, unhelpful) reviews, which ultimately leads anybody to believe that it's a fun game, that is the main purpose of a game, right? Unfortunately for me, the game just didn't live up to the expectations set, so I am relieved that I didn't end up paying full price for it (¬£9.99 in my case), if I had, I'd certainly have felt cheated, let me elaborate.\n\nThe game itself is appealing because it is genuinely interesting and refreshingly different, the trailer and the highest rated user reviews don't really give much information away because it genuinely would ruin the experience, but all in all, this is not a game, it is a lecture.\nThe Stanley Parable attempts to convey a message about game design and the illusion of choice, and while this message is conveyed well through the narration (great voice acting) it is in no way a fun experience. Sure, some of the dialog can be amusing, but that for me is the only positive factor.\nThere is no real gameplay and there are no real objectives, The Stanley Parable offers nothing more than a few hours of exploration around repetitive and dull scenery, waiting for the next line of dialog to pop up more often than not. I can't speak for everybody, but having to sit and listen for instructions on what to do next is not my idea of a fun experience, and even though the project is very well made and has a good concept behind it, I believe that you would have had the exact same experience just watching a play through of it.\n\nFans of the game tend to use the argument that if you don't enjoy The Stanley Parable, it's because you don't understand it, which I'm afraid is simply untrue. I understood the messages conveyed and I think the idea and crafting behind the game is clever and very unique, but all in all, I regret spending money on a game that turned out to be an unsatisfying lecture. The reason I buy games is to have a fun experience, and unfortunately I didn't achieve that at all playing this one.\n\nI firmly stand by my suggestion to avoid paying the full asking price for The Stanley Parable, but again, it's all down to choice. If you do feel compelled to buy it regardless of any negative reviews in favour of the (mostly) vague positive reviews, don't expect any actual fun gameplay, because I honestly believe there isn't any to be found here.\n\nPlease note that this review is purely my own thoughts and opinions, so I know there will be people that agree with me and certainly others that do not. If you are one of the people who purchased this game and felt that you had spent your money well, then excellent, I'm glad that you enjoyed the experience more than I did.","June 22, 2014","false","4.2"," 255 of 394 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","255","394","3","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/recommended/221910/","thepastisbeyondrecovery","Vic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/","690 products in account","Any individual with even the slightest or most remote interest in video gaming as a medium of artistic expression must categorically play The Stanley Parable within their lifetime. It's, ostensibly, a re-release of the 2011 Half-Life 2 mod of the same name, and is still built on the Source engine and is, more or less, largely the same game but having been thoroughly redesigned in certain key ways, especially its themes and parts of its narrative structure.\n\nThe Stanley Parable (developed by a small indie studio named Galactic Cafe) is, essentially, as its demo states, "a game of endings". It's a game that poses some very important questions about the way games currently work - it's a parable (a story which illustrates a lesson), or rather a collection of parables each hidden within another. Each new playthrough represents a new part of the experience, revealing yet another of the game's many endings, each with a different existential or absurdist lesson that build into the game's broader thesis.\n\nIt's also a game of choice, in that it proposes that ludic notions of "choice" and "free will" are inherently absurd in all games, since they don't actually represent any kind of meaningful or significant choice: they're just slightly different parts of the same overall plan that the game designer has laid out before you, and thus subordinate to his own intentions and choices; and therefore, inconsequential. You're still only just walking that path - in fact, all you ever do in the Stanley Parable is walk; literally. And when you do press the use button (which is for ludic purposes the mouse button, but in the original mod, was the 'E' button), you hear the unmistakable sound of a key being pressed. And as the intro and several endings exemplify, that is the nature of Stanley's job and ultimately, the nature of his existence and of our experience within the game: pressing buttons, both in-game and out of game.\n\nIt also has a lot to say about endings, and the way choices feed into those endings. By presenting us with a closed environment with very minimal and sparse mechanics, The Stanley Parable is able to present us with an environment so sparse and so limited that the "choices" we are offered seem that much more significant and that much more abundant; and the same goes for its endings. But as much as the choices themselves mean nothing, they also lead the player into the aforementioned endings. No ending has finality, and no ending presents a perfect victory for Stanley or the player. In fact, in almost all the endings the respective thematic conflict between Stanley and the Narrator remains entirely open, but no ending feeds into another in any capacity, underlining the lack of meaning the notion of multiple endings in games can offer. Games teach the player that anything but a perfect win-state is a failure, and that further playthroughs can objectively improve the conclusion of the story, be it through moral superiority or mechanical perfection. The Stanley Parable, in comparison, gives us subjective endings which can be interpreted freely which all invariably lead into a restart of the game. As the game itself states: "the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never LOADING".\n\nIn the process, certain themes and concepts will be left underdeveloped; but isn't this the point of the game? Asking questions that only subsequent explorations of the game by way of critical commentary or subsequent works in the same vein (perhaps by Galactic Cafe, or other designers) will be able to answer? Leaving its own ideas open to interpretation and exploration? I certainly think so. And so, it's definitely worth experiencing for yourself. Set your prejudices regarding "walking simulators" or "ungames" aside and walk into The Stanley Parable without any expectations but those the game designer creates for himself and for his own vision.","December 1, 2013","true","6.9"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","38","50","0","0"

In a nutshell, this ‚Äògame‚Äô is essentially an attempt by you, Stanley, to discover what has happened to your co-workers and bosses, all of whom have completely disappeared.\n\nThat‚Äôs the game in its entirety on a superficial level without giving away any spoilers. The underlying message is regarding the choice, or the illusion of choice, that modern video games allude to offer. The developers seem to be responding to games such as Mass Effect, that suggest they offer the gamer real choice in the outcome of the narrative yet in reality the gamer only has a couple of options dressed up in different clothing. There is a clear critique here regarding the nature of ‚Äòchoice‚Äô in the video game industry and while it is welcomed change for video games to include a metaphorical message (beyond the simplistic), these messages and critiques should not exist in a vacuum, devoid of any gameplay. The point being that, there is a thought provoking message here, but this is not a game.\n\nStripped down, the Stanley Parable is a game of ‚Äòwalk and listen‚Äô. Yes there are some interesting points mentioned by the narrator relating to conscious decision making, but this same message could have been offered through or alongside gameplay features that stretched beyond walking around a corridor. Quite simply, this is a lecture, a chore of a lecture that unfortunately lasts for 2-3 hours before you realise you could have just read the same underlying message in a free online article in about 10 minutes without being subjected to this gaming con artistry.\n\nClearly there is a sense that the Stanley Parable is offering some ‚Äòhigh art‚Äô by not including actual gameplay, or that this ‚Äògenius indie title‚Äô will have your head scratching. There is a suggestion that if you ‚Äòdon‚Äôt get‚Äô intelligent games that you won‚Äôt appreciate the Stanley Parable, that you can‚Äôt grasp its deeper message. Well, that is quite frankly a gross lie and yet a master stroke in marketing. People are desperately scrabbling to offer rave reviews of this new form of game, eager to show they are not cut from the COD cloth of gaming, that they can enjoy this intellectual critique. Do not be fooled. This is a totally unsatisfactory experience especially considering the price charged.\n\nDo you want a thought provoking experience about the intricacies of the mind and the illusion of choice? Read a book. This is just pseudo-philosophical gaming at its very worst, conning the masses into feeling like an intellectual giant for a couple hours at the small price of being tricked by the illusion of gameplay. Who‚Äôs more of a sucker in this scenario, Stanley? Or us?\n\n'The game will end, the game will never end'. Sold to us as an interesting game of uncertainty. Well, there is at least one certainty about the Stanley Parable; you will never see the cash you spent again.\n\nAs always comments are welcomed and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.","May 18, 2014","false","1.3"," 842 of 1,432 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","842","1","5","156"

To be honest, though, I sometimes think I should've spent my money on something else. Since there isn't an option to classify you're review as mixed, since there were parts I liked about the game, I'm just labeling it as negative (not because I completely hated it).\n\nThe Narrator is a really funny character and I laughed at a lot of his reactions. However, that's all I really found enjoyable. It's not that I didn't like everything else, it's just there didn't seem to be much else to do.\n\nYou get different endings depending on your choices, but after playing it over and over for a while I already got most of the obvious (as in "easy to obtain") endings and was just running in to them again and again multiple times. I know there's more complex things you can do to get different endings, which I don't mind, but it made me think I could've just easily looked them up on YouTube instead of spending $15. I was playing a game with no real challenge to prevent me from getting to those endings.\n\nI understand that it's supposed to be more an experience then just a game, but I personally didn't find it that philosophical with it's message and would've been better off getting an actual game on Steam. I'd have probably enjoyed this more if it was either for free or at a lower price.

The short story is greatly represented by a narrator that follows every move you make. Now if you think that's cool try Bastion too :P\n\nThe path you thoroughly follow it matters towards the end of the story; multiple endings, hilarious dialogues and tons of secrets. It might be a short story but It's a solid one, well made and worth every second. If I could rate it I would give a 11 out of 10 seriously.\n\n------\nNow there is an achievement called [Go Outside] "Don't play The Stanley Parable for five years." which I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up... set my clock to 2021 and wrongly earned it without thinking decently.\nAfter 10 seconds .. I felt reallly bad. It was a mistake. I know that might sounds stupid but developers maybe had it for a reason. Luckily there is a command I found on steam discussions* that resets all 10-achievements to 0 and you must earn 'em again; a small price to pay.\n\nMoral: Don't rush things, just let 'em slide...\n\n*tsp_resetzaxis (~console)","February 2","true","8.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","2"

The demo is entirely original  content, and is easily as good as the main game.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nWith only about 3 hours worth of content and minimal replay value, it's hard to justify the purchase price. Pick it up if it goes on sale, though...\n\nSince the store page isn't very helpful, here's what the game is about. It's an exploration game in the same vein as Dear Esther or 30 Flights of Loving. You wander around looking at things and the environment is only minimally interactive. An extremely clever and witty narrator tells your story as you wander through the environment.\n\nGameplay uses FPS controls and there are few cutscenes to interrupt the immersion, but you will often find yourself trapped in a small area waiting for something. This is less annoying in The Stanley Parable than it is in other games since listening to the narration is basically the whole point of the game.\n\nThe plot moves along a lot like a choose-your-own-adventure. You'll be repeatedly sent back to the beginning of the game and need to repeat one of a few choices that select which ending you get. There aren't a lot of choices to make and only about 10 endings, but there are some random elements to the game and some of the endings have an effect on your next restart, so there is enough variety to keep the beginning of the game interesting even though you'll see it many times.\n\nThe plot is extremely witty, clever, and well narrated. The dialogue is easily as good as Portal II, even if the gameplay is rather bland. I liked it and I'm glad I played it, even though I feel I overpaid for it at $12.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page here\n\nView my other reviews here","October 20, 2013","true","9.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

Especially cuz of the amazing narrator. You can beat the game in less than 5 minutes or even speed run it. The key of the game is about making choices, and believe it or not, the narrator give comments on your choices, which will make you smile. Either way, it can go really deep too ... I played minecraft and portal in the game for some minutes, pushed a button million times to save a baby from fire but afterward failed anyway, I got litteraly mind-blown and I turned the game a few times off.\n\nIf you're not sure whether or not to buy this game, there's a demo available for you to try it.

Stanley's Parable is a game-shaped narrative experiment about game design tropes among other things. I don't want to say more but trust me, like or not, this is something you should play, even if it just for a little bit. Also, In an age with some many great indie game feature strong quirky narration, Stanley's narrator still stands out in the crowd. I could write a lot about Stanley Parable, but I don't have to because it has probably the best demo I've ever seen for a game, a demo that showcases the spirit and mechanics of the game but it's completely unique. Download it, and if you find it intriguing enough, then by all means, buy and play the real game.","June 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Yes.\nIs it as mysterious and thought provoking as it is supposed to be? Yes, not in a bad way either.\nI do have to say visually the game was more impressive than I expected, it uses Source pretty well.\nThe narration is beautiful, but of course that's obvious.\nThe game works. It really does. It's a pretty far-reaching concept and yet it's a success.\n\nHell, it even manages to use the loading screen as a plot device.\n\nBottom line, if you love games, you'll most likely love The Stanley Parable.

Very few have a playtime longer than 3-4 hours, because that's really all you can stretch out of it.     One of the achievements requires running the game up to 24 hours in a single setting (although you can trick the game by editing your BIOS)  My own review would only show about 2 hours of actual gameplay. The rest, was idling for the achievement. Almost every review that shows a play time over 24 hours is misleading if you think they actually got that much time and attention out of it. You can literally see and pick apart everything in the game in just a few hours, especially if you are particularly clever.  I have 8 friends who currently own this, i combined all of their total play times. approx. 16 hours combined. Add in the actual 2 hours I was playing, and we're sittin at 18 hours total. Its not a tremendous value.\n\nI bought it at a 75 percent off sale, and I still feel they were asking too much.  Its just a source mod with some clever writing. I wished there was more game here, because there's nothing wrong with what you get ! The "game" and the experience it provides is great!  but the price, oh lord. that price.\nBeing such a high priced game and having all the positive reviews simultaneously, i expected a lot more.\n\nIf this was $3.75 or less (what i paid) I would change my review to positive. For 14.99, you could get so much more than what this will offer you.","July 2, 2015","false","27.1"," 133 of 230 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","133","230","5","15"

That Game You've Heard Of.Genre: 1st Person Self Exploration.\nDeveloped & Published by: Galactic Cafe\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nIs Stanley Parable a game? Are you a real person? Ok, you've probably gotten sick of hearing this joke when it comes to reviews about the Stanley Parable, so I'll knock it off. But cmon, I had to have a little fun. Yea, that joke was old even when I originally posted this review. So, time to put a bit of strikethrough it and put some actual effort into talking about the game itself. You play as Stanley, an office worker that wants something more out of life. Or maybe he doesn't. The game mechanics are simple: you walk through doors, hallways and rooms while listening to an excellent British accent describing what you are or aren't doing. Or going on a rambling about some unrelated happening. Or maybe its incredibly related and you don't realize it. Sometimes you'll push buttons, open doors or fall to your death. But really, those actions that you perform aren't what matter most. It's what you take away from the experience that matters. You'll be replaying the levels over and over again as different actions can cause different little "stories" to play themselves out. It's a pretty passive experience though as you can't really do anything other than choose minor actions at certain times.\n\nThis could have easily been a game stuck up on itself but it's clear that the developers want us to consider what it is to live this life and to play videogames. How we interact and deal with videogames on a regular basis. There's quite a bit more under the surface than even I gave it credit for after I finished playing it and watched some other people talk about it.\n\nPC Settings\nThe game comes with more PC settings than you could possibly ever want or need for a game like TSP. Resolutions, FoV slider, AA/Shader/Effect/Texture detail controls and much more. Everything is here, even support for high framerates. The game is very stable from all that I can tell and have heard. There is nothing missing that I can think you would need.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis is a title where I don't think it matters what I think. I think it's a title you need to explore for yourself and take away from it what you will. It is essentially a walking simulator, I won't deny that. And the player interactivity is minimal at best. But, I think its worth checking out. Take the time to appreciate what's being said and shown to you.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]","May 9, 2014","true","5.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

Honestly I can't stand them. They usually sacrifice graphics, gameplay, playtime, and other important things just so they can make "art". It drives me nuts when I see some stupid indie game with potato graphics get praised by everyone, break sales records, and generally make hipster gamers go on and on about "games as art" as if more standard games aren't art.\n\nStanley Parable does everything wrong (considering my above statement) but in the end it's all just right. Despite the fact that it's short, the gameplay is extremely limited, it can be a bit pretentious at times, and the graphics are just middle of the road Source engine, it's one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure to engage in.\n\nFunny, sad, shocking, irreverent, serious, and ridiculous at different times, this game has an emotional and artistic depth that you just won't find in most other games. Down one passageway is an inspiring emotional moment, around the corner a silly laugh, across a chasm the 5th wall breaks entirely, and down a cleverly hidden walkway is an examination of art and life of a depth that you probably never thought you would ever find in a video game.\n\nBut the real star of the game, the part that kept me enraptured for every solitary minute is the Narrator. Equal parts comrade and torturer, he accompanies you through the entire game commenting on your every move, applauding every "correct" decision and chiding every "wrong" choice. His performance sweeping back and forth from inspiring highs to admonishing lows. He is the reason you keep playing, keep searching, keep digging to find more of the game. His happiness is yours, and equal parts his sadness.\n\nHonestly I cannot say enough good things about this game, but to praise it any more would require spoiling the manifold layers of the game, and the numerous surprises and hidden secrets this game holds. All I can say is, if you are ready for something different, unique, and emotionally resonant then this is the game for you.","June 28, 2014","true","8.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","2"

Since here begins the branching story of "The Stanley Parable".\n\nTSP is more or less an interactive adventure, a simpler version of the 80's game "Alter Ego" if you will. This goes along pretty well especially due the witty nature of the Narrator, which guides you through the game and choices.\n\nIt's overall cleverly written and dances between the ‚ÄúIt's oh so random‚Äù and ‚Äú2deep4you‚Äù themes so well, that you willingly fill the gaps and contradictions with your own meaning.

What is obscene is what is hidden.‚Äù -Nagisa Oshima***Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to my fianc√© for proofing this review for me, as well as to wish her an early Happy Anniversary. Thank you for giving me the five most wonderful years of my life.\nWhat some consider to be an Indie gem while others plea confusion as to the course of this title, The Stanley Parable is a game about choice and consequence, with moderately brief journeys being the focus of play. The player takes control of Stanley, an office worker whose position entails the pressing of buttons throughout the day; the operation of these simple devices is his sole function, until one bizarre day, all of his coworkers vanish. From here Stanley leaves his office unprompted in search of some answers. I will do my best to refrain from writing this review in the identical joking tone of most writings, though the comedy in this title is infectious.\nHere are just a few reasons to give this memorably fantastic game a try:\n\nAtmosphere - This title progresses through Stanley‚Äôs well-crafted office space as the player maneuvers through the expected rooms and hallways that you would foresee composing a business department. I do not wish to spoil much about the broom closet, cargo lift, mind control facility, or other sections of The Stanley Parable‚Äôs branching story for the sake of having you experience them for yourself.\n\nGameplay - As stated in the introduction, players assume the role of Stanley from a first person perspective as he explores his abandoned office spaces, through multiple unique rooms and themes in order to discover the ‚Äòfinale‚Äô for the tale. The controls are simple, with the W, A, S, and D keys acting as movement commands; the Control key assuming the crouched position; and the LMB allowing the player to interact with various objects within the environment. There are both hidden and pronounced articles within the environment that can be toggled to alter story paths-covered in the coming section.\n\nWriting - As unambiguous as this game appears to be, this story-rich satire is far from any other market experience. The Stanley Parable performs as expected, with the players unraveling new beginnings and ends while probing for secluded secrets. Between these points of interest, the brilliant Kevan Brighting voices each interaction-or lack there-of-to entail a sense of accomplishment for the player, in the stead of simply stalling in a daft room until prompted otherwise. This commentary is extremely witty, and displays each critical action Stanley makes. In a sense, this is more of a powerful placebo to gaming: it takes the form of what you expect any game would yet lacks just the right amount of properties, toning it a simulation.\n\nTL:DR - As with the quote above, The Stanley Parable is an obscure game which presents the perfect amount of subtly in its processes. There can never be a proper review for The Stanley Parable due to how absurdly miraculous it is, yet every review written about it is the perfect review since it is that of individuality, such as with this title; the only true way to understand this title is to simply play it for yourself. As much as I would love to write on and on about this title, no words can do it justice, as it is difficult to pinpoint every exceptional portion of this work. I highly recommend this title to those who enjoy titles depicting choice and consequence, as well as narratives. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

During most of my time playing it, I had at best a vague idea of what was going on. And although it tried everything in its power to defeat me (at one point it was literally begging me to stop playing), I pressed on.\n\nThe game is ruthless in its mission of deconstructing the concepts of video game narration. It draws back the curtain and exposes the man who pulls the strings. Or pushes the buttons, as it were. Am I able to simply go back to normal games with normal stories, pretend I didn't gaze into the abyss? I can only hope.\n\nI think I've come reasonably close to hearing everything that The Stanley Parable has to tell. Its attention to detail is impressive, the love and skill that went into it easily apparent. At times I felt like Sherlock Holmes, with my personal Moriarty always one tantalizing step ahead. Other times I felt a sense of true companionship when my friend and I forged ahead towards destiny. Yet other times I was confronted with a sadistic psychopath, a gentle father figure, or a petty, passive-agressive bystander.\n\nThe Stanley Parable raises more questions than it answers. Fortunately they are the right kind of questions, the ones that keep you questioning yourself and the world around you rather than frustrate and paralyze you. I'm still relishing the afterglow, so my opinion may shift slightly when I've made more progress processing my experiences.\n\nRight now though, there is nothing about The Stanley Parable that I don't love.","October 29, 2013","true","4.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

It's about the relationship between the player and the game and the interactivity that makes this medium unique.\n\nThat's about as much as I can say about The Stanley Parable without giving anything away. There are no mechanics bound to your keyboard and mouse beyond move, look, open doors and push buttons. The central mechanic of the game is your choice and your perception of the game, incarnated as the Narrator.\n\nThe game is essentially a choose your own adventure book, elevated to become something truly special by excellent writing, one of the endings features a profound paradox, and phenomenal delivery by the Narrator.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is extremely clever, amusing and thought-provoking. An absolute must-buy, though I would recommend playing the demo first.\n\n<3","October 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It's an adventure that changes with each playthrough based on the decisions you make. You are Stanley and you start out in your stale office, in your stale job, in your stale life....or do you? Perhaps your life is amazing, sad, depressed, happy...whatever. The choice is yours.\n\nThe gameplay is seamless. Perfect controls for the game. The graphics are also top notch. It actually looks like the Unity engine a bit, but if it was, the developer maximized what he got out of it. Some of the puzzles can be challenging, and deception factors in to some aspects of this game as well.\n\nThe narration however is really where this game is at. There are only two other games that I can think of that rivals this one in that regard (Battleblock Theater, Bastion), although their styles couldnt be more different.\n\nI have seen something like 18 different endings with this game. Not sure how many there really are, but there are a lot, and so as you can expect, there is a ton of replay value with this game.\n\nThe developer also had some fun with the achievements. One of them is to play all day (24 hours) on a Tuesday, lol. One is to play, and then play again a year later. Etc....\n\nThis game is an easy 10/10.

Right when I saw it on steam I had no idea what to think. All it shows is a bunch of office cubicles and computers, and the discription, though interesting, didn't really help me decide whether to buy it or not. I almost gave it a pass, until I heard everyone and their grandmother going on about, "Have you played 'Stanley Parable? It's AMAZING!' It's hilarious! It make's you question your existance!" So I finally decided to give it a try when I saw it on sale. And...\n\nIt's unbelievable. I never thought I could play something so hilarious, so drawing, so strangely thought provoking in my life. I honestly don't know where to begin because, and I know everyone whose reviewed this has said this but, I'm afraid I'll spoil something. I don't even want to upload any screenshots. Just trust everyone on this, this is a game that no one, I mean no one should pass up.\n\nOkay I'll give a little bit more detail, here's what I love best about it. Every joke works, I mean it. It has, what might be hundreds of jokes packed in there, and every one of them had me flinging my head back with laughter. A lot of the jokes are Fourth-wall jokes (and if you don't know what the Fourth-Wall is look it up on TVTropes.com), addressing the player directly. The game also likes to screw with you, but not in a scary way. As you progress the environment starts to change, sometimes drastically. To the point where you may throw your hands in the air and scream "What's happening!?" as I did at one point. The game may make you start to question reality as well...\n\nLook the point is stop reading this review and BUY THIS GAME! Every thing you've heard about it is true.

The Stanley Parable is -- to employ an outdated and well-trodden expression -- "like a Choose Your Own Adventure on crack".\n\nIt's a game about choice.  Your coworkers have vanished, and you are tasked with finding out why.\n\nWill you bother to discover where they went?  Or maybe you'll forge your own path.  But what consequences could there be for straying from the story?  What if compliance was actually...in your best interest?  Will you ever find the myriad secrets and endings tucked away?  Will you even go so far as to cheat to find them?!  (Seriously?!)\n\nThe Stanley Parable has been a deeply memorable experience. It's a haunting, yet hilarious, unconventional journey.  For me, it is second only to Antichamber in my personal Top 10 list of great gaming experiences.\n\n(For those who have played the original, free HL2 mod of this game, it is WELL WORTH picking up this new retail version.

Choice and free will, a meta commentary on videogame narration and player agency, and so on.\n\nVery meta, very funny, each playthrough is short but sweet and got me excited to try new things and see how the narrator would react.","December 24, 2014","true","2.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Multiple endings and converations with several answers are merely an illusion of having a free will.\nEven the biggest roleplaying games feel like being on a railcar that drives you through a storyline in comparison with The Stanley Parable.\nThe duration of a single playthrough is short, but everytime you start anew, everything can and will be different. Even choosing the same path over and over again, will be different from the first, second and even third time you did.\nI highly recommend playing it, to give yourself the chance to see what a truly interactive game can be -- and not just by the watered-down definition the medium uses.\n","August 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Really unique and will make you listen and think, listening mostly, but still, this is amazing. It's really immersive, I also recommend playing the demo too (when in doubt or not) because the demo literally explains a lot of what you'll get in the main game, and you'll enjoy it as well. There are so many choices that will leave you craving to find out "What would happen if I do this?" and the game will give you unpredictable answers (mostly).\n\nI wish to see more games with this kind of uniqueness in the future.","November 30, 2013","true","4.3"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","1"

Do you listen to the voice, do you ignore it, do you prove the voice wrong, do you sometimes follow the voice. That's up to you.\n\nWithout ruining the game. You have the ability to retry the story and see how different decision may impact your success.\n\nThe narrator/ominous voice was very good (well chosen voice actor).\n\nI hope this game comes out with more contect (hopefully not having to purchase DLC) cause I would be interest to see if any changes occur if another option appears or another decision is made.","January 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

There's not much I can say about this game without spoiling things for you. Because of this, all I can say is: this game is amazing. I can't tell you why because that would ruin it. Don't look it up online. Just buy it and play it blindly for the best experience. Trust me, it's worth it. The only thing I will say is that there are several endings, so be sure to play through the game like 5 to 10 times (It's worth it).\n\nAlthough I can't talk about things that are in the game, I can give you some tips to improve your experience.\n\nHELPFUL TIPS:\n\nDO NOT SKIP THE INTRO CUT SCENE\n\nJust don't.\n\nLISTEN TO THE NARRATOR\n\nYou don't have to do what he says, but listen to what he has to say.\n\nGET THE DOOR 430 ACHIEVEMENT\n\n(After playing through the game a time or two)\n\n\nThat's about it.

This is not a typical video game in the most common sense. Instead, it is an effective vehicle for some of the most important subjects pertaining to video games and their narrative. Where Dear Esther failed by wasting the video game medium for its narrative, The Stanley Parable succeeded by making full use of video game mechanics, and then subverts them in a humourous, and yet elegant way.\n\nThis game is designed to be played several times, and the real value of this game is to see what happens when you stray from the narrative that the game sets the player out to follow.\n\nI will not discuss the specifics of this game, as doing so will ruin the sense of discovery so vital to keeping the experience effective, Instead, I will tell you to go pick it up and experience it, several times.

It being a sale at the time of writing, you should pick this up regardless.\n\nNote: if, like me, you played the original mod back in the day, you'll get an even bigger kick from the game, but I would not recommend you going back to play that now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeVEQANN/recommended/221910/","DeVEQANN","DeVEQANN[Kusoge detector]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeVEQANN/","293 products in account","Giving this game a thrumb up is as hard as giving it a thrumb down.\nThe Stanley Parable is a WITTY game.\n\nPros:\n+ Multiple Endings\n+ Good immersive deriving from interactions with the Narrator\n+ Impressive combination of scene and narration\n+ Countless Easter Eggs\n+\n\nCons:\n- Short contents\n- Pseudo-intelletual plot\n-\n\nIn the game, the game-makers show us an interesting story with their inspirational thinking through the endless loop of our protagnist, Stanley's fate. It trys to discuss the probabilities that derive from obedience and rebellion, and to achieve a high-level of interaction between players and the game. I cannot allege it is successful, but this attempt is praisable.\n\nVarious endings is an attraction of the game. Among those endings, my favoriate one is the 'Crazy Ending', which will be achieved by walking down the stairs instead of up. The final narration is so good that it makes me feel I am Stanley, and being assisted by repetitive rooms, description of thinking and the style of stream-of-consciousness, it gives players an intense atomsphere and great immersive. Every ending is so distictive and interesting that can inspire players to try every choice over and over again. Under those circunstances, I think, it is as a metapher, instead of as a simple character, that should Stanley be defined.\n\nThe narrator is the most important role in the game. It is he who continuously pushs the story forward and guides Stanley into different endings. He can be regarded as a highlight and also a drawback of the game. His words and tone contribute to game's style and atmosphere, but also undermine it's reality. If most of the narration can be replaced by text and make it focus on pushing the climax(just like what he does in the Crazy Ending), it would be more splendid.\n\nExcept those advantages, this game is quite boring. Although it seems like players are exploring the game, but they not. All they can do is just walk along the routes that pre-designed by game-makers, and repetitive narration helps me comfirm it. Simply, throughout the game what players play is to choose 'left or right?'. It does provide some interesting things, but the gameplay and replaybility are poor. But you can regarded it as a voiced novel.\n\nAnother drawback is that the game is so short that players can beat it within 10 mins. Although it contains multiple endings and the plot will be changed just result from slight changes in choices‚Äî‚Äîit is still too short ‚Üí_‚Üí. $15 is too much, so I strongly suggest anyone who wants to try this game keep waiting for this game apparing in bundles.\n\nHow to define this game? Or, more prudentlyÔºåshould it be defined as a game?\nWithout a doubt it is a good experiment. Yet, compared with novels and movies of the same type, The Stanley Parable seems still primitive.","May 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/221910/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Prepare for spoilers. Normally I don't spoil, but it's mighty hard with this one.\n\nTo enjoy The Stanley Parable, it takes a peculiar type of person. Or types of persons. There is no 'action' to speak of in this game. No guns to shoot and, debatably, not even a failure condition. (even if you CAN die...)\n\nI've been troubled in finding the best way to describe this game. People have called it a mind‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, something that messes with your logic. But from the moment I defied the narrator, I never felt like that. I didn't feel like I was being tossed around with. I felt like I was in a thought experiment. A thought experiment that got out of hand and resulted in other thought experiments, until it had evolved into a narrative in how I'm seemingly breaking the purpose of these by simply not cooperating.\n\nWhat I've concluded is that The Stanley Parable is a narrative genius. A statement on multiple facets. For example, the question can be asked how the power of the narrator compares to that of a hypothetical God? And what if the subjects in the universe the narrator and/or hypothetical god are ruling, become sentient?\n\nBut that's not the only question that can surface. Your question could be "how defiant can I be and not die? What if death is part of the pathway and continuing forward will actually result in a different outcome based on the fact that I died?"\nYes, that seems like a very long and convoluted question...\n\nBut that's what this game does. It makes you question the reality it resides in. The non-eucledian level design (Google it) means that any progress is progress permitted to you by the narrator. But then you reach a point where even the narrator questions their own power and choices.\n\nOr you could have taken such choices that angered the narrator so much that he instead turned confrontational and made you face the fact that, even if you are walking around, you are still an automaton of a human pressing buttons.\n\nMaybe you instead drive the narrator so desperate enough that his last resort is a splendor of a room with particle effects where he seems to feel at peace and happy, with your only physical choice being to stand there for eternity, or kill yourself, stealing away the narrator's happiness.\n\nIn that perspective, you could question whether you are Stanley to begin with. Maybe Stanley is a very complicated tool for you to control the narrator. Maybe you are the hypothetical God, whom's tenacity can undo or counter anything the narrator does or commands.\n\nI am far from done on describing What this game is like. The narrator could be a villain, a desperate companion, a frustrated writer... But what stands central is choice. You can only move and interact, but the choices you physically make can last so far that you wonder... not if you should do it, but what first?\n\nThe Stanley Parable can be funny. Can be sad, inspiring pity within. But should you really forget yourself? Who are you anyway? Are you even real? Do you even exist? Who says you are not dreaming this and are still pressing those buttons on that keyboard?\n\nBut there is one central truth to this game: It rewards semi-lineair exploration. It's not open world, but it can very much be explored and said exploration can get out of hand. And that's where the strength of the storytelling comes\n\nIf you like narration, spoken by a very skilled narrator, and like to pay attention to the story (as non traditional as this very much is) then you'll be in for a treat.\n\nBut again, I can't state this enough: this is not a game for people who only wish action and effects. Such people will probably find this a boring experience, so be forewarned. If you can bring yourself to slow down your pace and allow yourself to think, you may yet enjoy it.\n\nBecause I sure did. As an amateur writer, The Stanley Parable has employed many narrative tools and tricks, chastizing or rewarding you for falling for them, or not doing so at all. Carrots on a stick and red herrings, It is a thought experiment encompassing several of it's kind with a carefully laid out madness.\n\nI wish I could keep on writing about this game. But I have to stop at some point.\n\nGood job, Galactic Cafe.","December 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The story is self-explanatory enough (and I do not want to spoil it, that is half the fun), and the mechanics is just brilliant. I would and I will just say this: the game itself is amazing, but the best part is the thought behind such a concept, and will ask you some questions that you will never think of when you are playing other games.\n\nIf you want another CoD / HL2 shooty-blasty-killing FPS variant, this is not the game that you want, BUT...if you want to play a thought-driven experimental with will-crafted humor like Portal, you would enjoy this game as much as I did, and remember this experience for a long time.\n\nAs for the price itself, I almost got every content within the eight hours that I played, so the original price is not that good compare to other games that can let you be enjoyable for hours and hours for 15 bucks (or less).

The Stanley Parable was originally developed as a Source engine mod back in 2010. Its creator Davey Wreden said that he set out to discover something about video games that hadn't been explored yet. More specifically, what would happen if you could disobey their rules.\n\nThe game tells the story of Stanley, an average man who finds solace in his simple mundane office job. However on one particular day it appears that all his co-workers have suddenly disappeared. Guided by the narrator, Stanley must step out of the safety of his little cubical and begin his adventure to find out what exactly is going on.\n\nAt first glance it might seem easy to categorise this as another artsy "walk 'em up" in the vein of something like Dear Esther or Proteus. It has a simple setting, lots of long-winded narration, not much to interact with and of course no jump or weapons, so what exactly do you do in The Stanley Parable? Well, essentially you make decisions. This is because the driving force behind the game is that of "choice". You decide HOW you play the game, and the game responds accordingly. And these decisions may appear simple, left or right? Over there? Over here? Touch that?\n\nMeanwhile you're guided by the soothing sound of 'the narrator' voiced brilliantly by British voice actor Kevan Brighting! The narrator attempts to lead you to successfully complete the game by advising you which path to take as well as narrating the inner monologue of the troubled protagonist Stanley. And it's through this narration that the game achieves a level of hysterical self awareness and brilliant charm very similar to the Portal series. This dynamic narration will react to the decisions you make, often breaking the fourth wall to talk to you directly. And should you decide not to listen to these directions and "disobey" the resulting dialogue and consequences can easily spiral out of control into the strange and surreal.\n\nBut to say anymore would no doubt ruin your experience of The Stanley Parable as no two play throughs are really the same. And multiple play throughs are inevitable in a game that encourages you to poke and prod at its structure, almost everyone I know who've played this walked away from this game with a different story to tell.\n\nDepending on how your experience plays out, at some stage or another you will no doubt be forced to return to Stanley's office to once again set out to look for your co-workers, and it's here that you might decide to stop playing the game and that's totally fine, but in my experience, once you've been presented with so many variables, it's very hard to resist that urge to go back and try out every possible deviation, especially when they can alter the game so radically beyond your expectations.\n\nAnd this kind of thinking is just so refreshing, I found myself laughing with confusion and disbelief because every time I pushed the game, it would push back. I guess the only disappointing moment was when I came to the stark realisation that the game couldn't possibly live up to the illusion of infinite choice. However this was more bitter sweet, as I soon came to the realisation that any game that gave me this feeling of absolute freedom, if only for the briefest moment in time, was truly remarkable.\n\nThe Stanley Parable might not be for everyone, but in my opinion it should be played by everyone. It's a hilarious experiment in psychology and non-linear game design that will probably teach you more about yourself as a gamer than you might want to know.\n\n\n\n","June 25, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I would say that's the kind of effort that warrants recognition."\n\nClick 20 times on door 430: "Hmm. I have to say, I'm still not feeling the satisfaction of witnessing true effort for a noble cause. Perhaps 50 clicks will do it - yes, almost certainly, 50 clicks."\n\nClick 50 times on door 430: "No, no, I'm still not feeling it. I want this Achievement to have meant something - it has to be a true reward for valiant effort. I want to see some hustle, Stanley.

I suppose it‚Äôs understandable to a degree, as The Stanley Parable is undeniably witty and unconventional, with a quirky charm and dry self-awareness. It is so overwhelmingly eccentric that it can begin to feel as if not playing along with it and laughing at every joke is an act of disrespect, such is the perception The Stanley Parable cultivates within moments of leaving the main menu to venture forth into a cornucopia of contextually appropriate satire and bizarre dark humor.\n\nThe Stanley Parable gives off such a sense of self-prescribed brilliance that I feel both dumbfounded and maybe even a little angry at just how much I dislike it. I get the joke and admire its delivery, but when approached from any angle but the one the game so strongly attempts to cultivate, The Stanley Parable feels like little more than a few intelligent observations on modern game design strung along by a series of amusing, yet immensely inconsistent and inscrutable scenes with no conclusions to be found.\n\nI understand that the lack of closure is part of the point. I can find a certain poetic appreciation for the circular design of the game, and as a lesson in abstract game design The Stanley Parable certainly gets marks for trying. But then it tries some more, and eventually (which is to say sometime within the first 20 minutes of play) I became rather weary of hearing the same joke play out as I raged a supposedly hilarious war with the narrator over increasingly innocuous choices.\n\nThere is such an abundance of creativity to be admired within The Stanley Parable, one would think that even in worst case scenarios everyone will be able to find something to like buried in its labyrinth of compounding decisions. But by design each disconnected moment is compiled with the next, creating a sequence of random and oddly directed scenes for which the primary goal is to disorient the player as they continue bumbling through a game with no rules and a rather antagonistic sense of progression.\n\nThe Stanley Parable without a doubt knows what it‚Äôs doing. The script is tight, the pacing smooth, and the overall concept worthy of praise. And yet I found myself despising every moment I spent with the game. The more I tried to peel back its layers to find the game I had seen praised to the ends of the earth and back, the more I was confronted with the same shallow and narcissistic experience that only became more meandering and unfulfilling the longer I stuck with it. I suppose it was fitting that I eventually arrived in a museum dedicated to the game itself; an internal monument to a project which clearly recognizes its own genius even as I struggle to understand the appeal.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 9, 2015","false","1.9"," 99 of 187 people (53%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","53","99","187","16","16"

Then it shoves its hand through the tropes and the wall behind them, shattering a hole into a Escher-like dimension of allegory and humor spiraling endlessly around a story that deliberately falls afoul of the same tropes it works so hard to identify and undermine.\n\nThen the game restarts, or maybe it doesn't restart.  Maybe you restarted it, but did you restart it because you wanted to, or because the game wanted you to?  And is this really a game anymore?\n\nTo perhaps make that rambling a bit more clear, The Stanley Parable is a game about a man, which is really allegory about games, which in turn is a metaphor about life and choice and free will and about a billion other things.  There are so many layers to the story you could get lost in it all, but the beauty is that you don't have to.  You can be philisophical about what it all means, or you can simply laugh hysterically at the spot on narration describing, bemoaning, and sometimes belittling you, the story, and who knows what else.\n\nIn short, The Stanley Parable is a beautiful mix of humor, philosophy, allegory, and self-aware commentary on video games, requiring almost no skill to understand and enjoy.  It is a masterpiece that blurs the line between game, story, commentary, and art.","March 15, 2015","true","29.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

So i will try the best i can.\n\n"The Stanley Parable" is a game that isn't a game, it isn't something you "play", neither is something with an objective. It's a narrative that, at first, seems really linear, but, when you start to explore, there will be a mass amount of possibilities.\nDifferent from most games, you don't have a prize at the end, there's no reward or resolution whatsoever, the only thing that you get is a different ending each time that you play it in a different way. Witch is pretty good! Because i can, by my actions, see the resolution to MY story.\nWitch gets me to the first topic: The Story.\nThe story is simples: You are Stanley, a normal worker that only press buttons everyday. And this it. Many times in the game, it seems that you have a wife to take care of and because of she, you can't get out of your prison, that is your work. But when you receive no more orders, you get out of your office and see that everyone that worked with you was gone, without any trace of what happened whatsoever. That's where YOUR story begins. The game does an awesome job making you and Stanley the same person. This is your story and you will decide what to do with it. You can follow the voice of The Narrator (witch can be a protagonist or an antagonist, depending on your actions) or make your own way. There's a lot of endings ("Normal" ending, The Nuclear Explosion Ending, The Crazy Stanley Ending, The Adventure Line Ending, The Escape Ending, The "You Actually Made A Choise" Ending, The Death Of Stanley Ending, The Space Ending, The Serious Ending, The Story Of Stanley And His Wife Ending, The "But Stanley Couldn't Force Himself" Ending, The "I'm Sick Of This Gag" Ending, The "I'm Not Sick Of This Gag" Ending, The Stanley Heaven Ending (this one is quite awesome, buttons everywhere :D), The WhiteBoard Ending and The "Since You Don't Like This Game, Let's Try Another One" (This one has a total of three posibilities: The one where the narrator takes you directly to the "baby game", the one that, before he takes you to his game, he takes you to Minecraft and Portal and the one that, while you are in Portal, you can walk to the elevator, fall on it and actually step in the original "The Stanley Parable" mod game). I don't know if i forgot some, but for me, it's a total of 18 endings (counting the multiple possibilities of the "Don't like this game" ending). I also don't know if all of then are right, i don't remember they correctly, but i'm certain that THEY ARE in this game.\nThe sound is actually...Well, there must be like 3 musics on the game. That's because the most important is The Narrator's voice. It remembers A LOT GLaDOS from Portal. Not just because it's actually pretty well done, but because it varies so much, sometimes he is just mocking with you, others, he just trying to help you. And this goes on and on...You never know when the narrator is your friend or your enemy, only your actions will change how he is with you and how you will like him or not.\nGameplay is quite simple. You walk and interact. Most doors don't open, but there a quite few Easter Eggs through the scenarios that will only activate when you complety a certain action. Some achievements requires this. (Including one that's pretty obvious).\nOverall, great "game". Because, most people consider this a thing that it's different from a game. It's fun, it tricks with your mind, it has a lot of content hidden and, when you're done with, you still don't know how to describe this. That's the magic of this "game". It shows not only how videogames should be, but how with simply follow the orders that is given to us in gaming, instead of doing what we want. The freedom, paradox and immersion of this game is what it made it so special and so acclaimed by both the users and the critic. This is a 10/10 without doubt, a piece of art and maybe one of the best games i have ever played.","December 19, 2013","true","3.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

Even though it's more of a self-telling short story than a video game, you'll have yourself shaking your head and chuckling every time you walk through it... because your walkthrough will change with the smallest decision.\n\nThe Pros:\n¬∑ Great and entertaining narration will follow every step you take...\n¬∑ ... and every step you take feels surprisingly drastic, as something as little as going left or right will determine the way the story is told.\n¬∑ Every decision you make will spin its own web, making it a joy to replay as it will rarely be the same.\n¬∑ Asides from the light and humoristic narration, the game actually manages to adress some things we rarely think about, what gives you a unique sense of vulnerability even though not a single bullet will be shot or axe swung. You will have complete freedom, yet you're trapped from the very beginning.\n\nThe Cons:\n¬∑ Even though there are many different ways you can go, the options aren't limitless. There is no real reason to play through the game the exact same way multiple times.\n¬∑ Definately not for everyone. It's pure exploration that minimalises gameplay to simple environmental interactions with buttons and doors.\n\nThe Looks:\n¬∑ The Stanley Parable runs on the Source Engine, and that shows... in a good way. The lighting and textures are phenomenal and soak you into the game's unique atmosphere that complements the entire story you get to tell.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nAlthough it won't be for everyone, The Stanley Parable manages to suck you into its complexely simple story that is a joy to discover and rediscover differently the next time you play it. 8/10.","May 18, 2014","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It tells some fantastic jokes, makes some self-indulgent commentary, but then it proceeds to get stranger and more intimate and less pointed and more interesting the more you poke at it. It isn't making fun of games for the sake of some self-appointed enlightened savior of gaming and it doesn't seem to be strange for the sake of strangeness.\n\nWhat makes Stanley Parable feel so fresh isn't the humor or the satire or the criticsm that's baked into it--those are enjyoable, but they weren't what impressed me. What makes it feel fresh is how intimately it converses with the player. I'm reminded very much of a game called Save the Date--though that was a smaller and simpler affair. Both games start with meta commentary and then submerge from there, talking carefully with you about how the narrator, creator or other characters think, feel and the ramifications of that for your behavior and your experience of the product. The secret of both of these games which drape themselves in the trappings of meta-narrative is that they do actually contain characters who you will learn about, be asked to empathize with, be asked to listen to, and be asked, after it all, to act on your conclusions should you have reached any.\n\nThey are games that start with the nature of games, then the nature of reality, and then quietly, timidly, reveal that at their heart they are about the same intimacies and relationships as most intersting or moving stories. For all of the delightful jokes, strangeness, non-linearity and surreality of The Stanley Parable my most clear feeling when I stopped playing was one of loss; I had run out of ways to communicate with this person with whom I formed a relationship. I had run out of things to say and ways to prove I was listening.\n\nI was alone.","January 8","true","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The game seems witty enough. There is a narrator and he does a wonderful job.\n\nHowever, there's not much to really do apart from walk around and listen to the narrator. The amount of content is severely lacking - you could 'finish' the game within 5 minutes, although it is meant to be played through more than once. The replayability, which is supposed to be one of the game's strong suits, eventually becomes a weakness. Once you've seen an ending, you may not want to bother seeing it again.\n\nThe Stanley Parable reminded me of a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book, but choice alone does not lend itself very well to gaming. Interaction is what makes gaming different and fun, and the game has little interaction further than choosing which door to enter.\n\nI don't think The Stanley Parable lives up to all the praise that is heaped on it (mainly by critics). If you're going to get it, wait until it is heavily discounted. Or get Antichamber instead.","December 22, 2013","false","1.9"," 185 of 356 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","185","356","2","7"

I think I've broken double digits? Whatever, not running a game into the ground hasn't stopped me before, so here it is!\nBuy it. Boom. Done. You need this game in your life. Because it's not just a game, but a story. And not a story like most first person shooters are stories, but it's a story that's 100% about player choice. Some of these choices are hilarious (the Confusion Ending, the Whiteboard Ending) while other result in your death (the Escape Ending, the Downstairs Ending); many of them find a way to re-route you to the beginning of the game, with minor cosmetic changes that leave you uncertain as to whether or not you're truly restarting.\nThe game's primary draw has to be the narration. The VO is soothing, witty, full of emotion; it's also surprisingly complete, with many dialogues going on much longer than one would expect. The game is all about the joy of discovery, and the narration encapsulates this perfectly, as you can't wait to hear what he says next.\nBecause of the nature of The Stanley Parable, it does get repetitive after a while. This is why it's best to set aside a full day (preferably a Tuesday) to play through everything at once, so the game can continuously update itself for you. It'll be a good day, I promise.","February 12, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quazillionaire/recommended/221910/","quazillionaire","Quazillionaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quazillionaire/","150 products in account","The Definitive Review of The Stanley Parable\n\nSo, I was browsing through the Stanley Parable community page, and I inevitably ended up coming across a number of reviews. To be honest, I was actually surprised at how many negative reviews it got, and not just a bit disturbed at how many people found those reviews ‚Äúhelpful.‚Äù After reading several of those reviews, I came to the conclusion that many gamers do not really understand The Stanley Parable or how to go about playing it.\n\nThe first and most important thing I feel like I should address comes from the several reviews I read which stated how they ‚Äúbeat the game‚Äù in such a short amount of time, and how that made it not worth the money. The thing is, The Stanley Parable is not by any means a normal game. In fact, as many people have pointed out all over the place in a somewhat fanboyish fashion, it is not even really a ‚Äúgame‚Äù at all, in the familiar sense of the word. It is, in fact, exactly what it says it is: a parable. For those who don't really know what that is (don't be ashamed: I had to look it up, too), here's the definition, courtesy of the late Ms. Merriam-Webster:\n\npar¬∑a¬∑ble\nnoun \Ààpa-r…ô-b…ôl\\na short story that teaches a moral or spiritual lesson\n\nThe point is, you can't ‚Äúbeat‚Äù The Stanley Parable any more than you could beat a movie or a book. You can finish it, true. Once you've found every ending and heard every bit of dialogue, you can safely say that you've finished it; but there's no award at the end, no ‚ÄúStory Progress: 100%,‚Äù no achievement for finding all of the endings, nothing at all to say that you've ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù it. And besides, ‚Äúbeating‚Äù something implies that there was a challenge in the first place. The Stanley Parable isn't about any challenge; it's about exploration and discovery, along with some intriguing and entertaining psychological wizardry.\n\nNow I've talked about the ‚Äúbeat the game‚Äù part, I want to discuss the ‚Äúlength‚Äù of the game a bit. Basically, The Stanley Parable is short for a reason. Each ending probably takes no more than half an hour to reach, often less. If all the endings took even just one hour, let alone the multiple hours most modern game storylines last, nobody would have the patience or curiosity to start over and find out what happens if you do it a different way.\n\nIn the end, The Stanley Parable may just not be for you. If you enjoy linear plot lines without pesky deviations and multiple endings, don't get it. If you don't have the patience to search for every possibly dialogue trigger, don't bother. If you get frustrated when you have to start something over, try something else. It's as simple as that. Think and research before you buy. If you wasted your money on The Stanley Parable, it's not because it failed to live up to your expectations, but because you did not know what to expect.\n\nFinally, here is my verdict on The Stanley Parable. An enthusiastic thumbs-up, ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ, at least 94/100, whatever you want to call it; it is well-made, cleverly designed, and ingeniously implemented; the dialogue is involving, emotional, and filled with dry, quick-witted humor. In many ways it is very reminiscent of Portal ‚Äì it was made in Source, after all. I absolutely love it, and I highly recommend it.\n\nAnyways, this was more or less a product of my boredom. I hope it was nevertheless helpful to some people. I did try to stay objective, except during that last paragraph, and I hope I succeeded in that. Enjoy your day, and enjoy The Stanley Parable. I know I do.\n\nNot insincerely,\n~~~~~~~TheQZ","January 4, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

It lead me to consider what was even the game's doing and what was me somehow making everything break, etc.\n\nAll that aside, awesome game if you're into exploring outside of the box experiences as well as a fair sense of humor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quazillionaire/recommended/221910/","quazillionaire","Quazillionaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quazillionaire/","150 products in account","The Definitive Review of The Stanley Parable\n\nSo, I was browsing through the Stanley Parable community page, and I inevitably ended up coming across a number of reviews. To be honest, I was actually surprised at how many negative reviews it got, and not just a bit disturbed at how many people found those reviews ‚Äúhelpful.‚Äù After reading several of those reviews, I came to the conclusion that many gamers do not really understand The Stanley Parable or how to go about playing it.\n\nThe first and most important thing I feel like I should address comes from the several reviews I read which stated how they ‚Äúbeat the game‚Äù in such a short amount of time, and how that made it not worth the money. The thing is, The Stanley Parable is not by any means a normal game. In fact, as many people have pointed out all over the place in a somewhat fanboyish fashion, it is not even really a ‚Äúgame‚Äù at all, in the familiar sense of the word. It is, in fact, exactly what it says it is: a parable. For those who don't really know what that is (don't be ashamed: I had to look it up, too), here's the definition, courtesy of the late Ms. Merriam-Webster:\n\npar¬∑a¬∑ble\nnoun \Ààpa-r…ô-b…ôl\\na short story that teaches a moral or spiritual lesson\n\nThe point is, you can't ‚Äúbeat‚Äù The Stanley Parable any more than you could beat a movie or a book. You can finish it, true. Once you've found every ending and heard every bit of dialogue, you can safely say that you've finished it; but there's no award at the end, no ‚ÄúStory Progress: 100%,‚Äù no achievement for finding all of the endings, nothing at all to say that you've ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù it. And besides, ‚Äúbeating‚Äù something implies that there was a challenge in the first place. The Stanley Parable isn't about any challenge; it's about exploration and discovery, along with some intriguing and entertaining psychological wizardry.\n\nNow I've talked about the ‚Äúbeat the game‚Äù part, I want to discuss the ‚Äúlength‚Äù of the game a bit. Basically, The Stanley Parable is short for a reason. Each ending probably takes no more than half an hour to reach, often less. If all the endings took even just one hour, let alone the multiple hours most modern game storylines last, nobody would have the patience or curiosity to start over and find out what happens if you do it a different way.\n\nIn the end, The Stanley Parable may just not be for you. If you enjoy linear plot lines without pesky deviations and multiple endings, don't get it. If you don't have the patience to search for every possibly dialogue trigger, don't bother. If you get frustrated when you have to start something over, try something else. It's as simple as that. Think and research before you buy. If you wasted your money on The Stanley Parable, it's not because it failed to live up to your expectations, but because you did not know what to expect.\n\nFinally, here is my verdict on The Stanley Parable. An enthusiastic thumbs-up, ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ, at least 94/100, whatever you want to call it; it is well-made, cleverly designed, and ingeniously implemented; the dialogue is involving, emotional, and filled with dry, quick-witted humor. In many ways it is very reminiscent of Portal ‚Äì it was made in Source, after all. I absolutely love it, and I highly recommend it.\n\nAnyways, this was more or less a product of my boredom. I hope it was nevertheless helpful to some people. I did try to stay objective, except during that last paragraph, and I hope I succeeded in that. Enjoy your day, and enjoy The Stanley Parable. I know I do.\n\nNot insincerely,\n~~~~~~~TheQZ","January 4, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

I think I've broken double digits? Whatever, not running a game into the ground hasn't stopped me before, so here it is!\nBuy it. Boom. Done. You need this game in your life. Because it's not just a game, but a story. And not a story like most first person shooters are stories, but it's a story that's 100% about player choice. Some of these choices are hilarious (the Confusion Ending, the Whiteboard Ending) while other result in your death (the Escape Ending, the Downstairs Ending); many of them find a way to re-route you to the beginning of the game, with minor cosmetic changes that leave you uncertain as to whether or not you're truly restarting.\nThe game's primary draw has to be the narration. The VO is soothing, witty, full of emotion; it's also surprisingly complete, with many dialogues going on much longer than one would expect. The game is all about the joy of discovery, and the narration encapsulates this perfectly, as you can't wait to hear what he says next.\nBecause of the nature of The Stanley Parable, it does get repetitive after a while. This is why it's best to set aside a full day (preferably a Tuesday) to play through everything at once, so the game can continuously update itself for you. It'll be a good day, I promise.","February 12, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Throughout the game, the narrator implicitly mocks the linear structure of gaming design, achievements, winning conditions, and choices. Recently we have open world/roguelike/sandbox games but still the majority of the most popular titles are quest-driven and poorly/linearly designed.\n\nThe Stanley Parable subverts stereotypical elements of video games. For example;\n\n-There is no winning condition in TSP so it is impossible to beat the game. There is no legitimate ending and beginning. Storyline is twisty and unpredictable. TSP makes you question why we are so preoccupied with the idea of winning and completing quests.\n\n- Do choices really matter in games? No matter what you choose, you always operate within the confines of the game structure. Escaping from the reality in real world, you are confined in a fictional digital world. And like real life, true choices are just an illusion.\n\n- Why there is no midway between dying and following the narrator or NPCs. Witnessing the terror and panic of the narrator, when you do not follow his orders, you realize that it is really fun to step out ot the script and the linear boundaries of the game.\n\nTSP is really clever and accurate in presenting the philosophical questions and criticism on the current status quo of the gaming industry, deconstructing the linear structure of game titles and leading gamers to interpret how they interact with game mechanics and narration in their pseudo-characters in the digital world.","February 14","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/utkugurel/recommended/221910/","utkugurel","Utku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/utkugurel/","321 products in account","Stanley Parable is a sarcastic commentary on the generic structure of video games and the trivial efforts of addicted gamers within them. Throughout the game, the narrator implicitly mocks the linear structure of gaming design, achievements, winning conditions, and choices. Recently we have open world/roguelike/sandbox games but still the majority of the most popular titles are quest-driven and poorly/linearly designed.\n\nThe Stanley Parable subverts stereotypical elements of video games. For example;\n\n-There is no winning condition in TSP so it is impossible to beat the game. There is no legitimate ending and beginning. Storyline is twisty and unpredictable. TSP makes you question why we are so preoccupied with the idea of winning and completing quests.\n\n- Do choices really matter in games? No matter what you choose, you always operate within the confines of the game structure. Escaping from the reality in real world, you are confined in a fictional digital world. And like real life, true choices are just an illusion.\n\n- Why there is no midway between dying and following the narrator or NPCs. Witnessing the terror and panic of the narrator, when you do not follow his orders, you realize that it is really fun to step out ot the script and the linear boundaries of the game.\n\nTSP is really clever and accurate in presenting the philosophical questions and criticism on the current status quo of the gaming industry, deconstructing the linear structure of game titles and leading gamers to interpret how they interact with game mechanics and narration in their pseudo-characters in the digital world.","February 14","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/utkugurel/recommended/221910/","utkugurel","Utku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/utkugurel/","321 products in account","Stanley Parable is a sarcastic commentary on the generic structure of video games and the trivial efforts of addicted gamers within them. Throughout the game, the narrator implicitly mocks the linear structure of gaming design, achievements, winning conditions, and choices. Recently we have open world/roguelike/sandbox games but still the majority of the most popular titles are quest-driven and poorly/linearly designed.\n\nThe Stanley Parable subverts stereotypical elements of video games. For example;\n\n-There is no winning condition in TSP so it is impossible to beat the game. There is no legitimate ending and beginning. Storyline is twisty and unpredictable. TSP makes you question why we are so preoccupied with the idea of winning and completing quests.\n\n- Do choices really matter in games? No matter what you choose, you always operate within the confines of the game structure. Escaping from the reality in real world, you are confined in a fictional digital world. And like real life, true choices are just an illusion.\n\n- Why there is no midway between dying and following the narrator or NPCs. Witnessing the terror and panic of the narrator, when you do not follow his orders, you realize that it is really fun to step out ot the script and the linear boundaries of the game.\n\nTSP is really clever and accurate in presenting the philosophical questions and criticism on the current status quo of the gaming industry, deconstructing the linear structure of game titles and leading gamers to interpret how they interact with game mechanics and narration in their pseudo-characters in the digital world.","February 14","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The player has the opportunity to make numerous decisions on which paths to take, and because at times the narrator says what Stanley will do next, the player can choose to ignore the narration and make a different choice. Every choice made by the player is commented on by the narrator, and depending on the choices the player makes, they will encounter different endings to the game before it restarts.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nAstute, witty commentary on video game tropes\nNarrator's voice is so, so good\nSpectacularly funny\nChoices that offer delightfully surprising results\nIncredibly smart\n\n\nCons\n\nFinding the last few endings is tedious\nWhen you find an action without commentary, you'll feel sad\n\n\nAn Ending\n\nThe Stanley Parable is an exceptional game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/221910/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","A lot of people think that The Stanley Parable is a difficult game to describe, but I don't think it is that hard. It is a game about storytelling and player choice in video games. It is very aware of the fact that it is a video game, and there are many jokes about how games operate and the kinds of choices that you are allowed to make in them. As an avid story-based game player, I enjoyed the humor immensely. If this kind of meta-humor sounds at all interesting, go try out the demo. Even if you know you are going to buy the game, play the demo anyway because the content of the demo is not in the full game. Because this humor is really the core of the game, the more I tell you about the game, the less you will get out of it when you play it; it is best to discover everything for yourself. Therefore I want you to stop reading this review as soon as you are convinced to play the game. If you make it to the end and are still not convinced, then you and I have very different tastes and I don't know why you take my advice on anything entertainment related.\n\n\n\nA voice narrates your journey as you play as Stanley, an office worker who realizes that nobody is in the office building today. The narrator will tell you the path that Stanley took, but you are often free to try another path. The narrator will try to convince you to get back on track. At first he tries to rationalize why Stanley went the wrong way in the context of the story he is telling, but it doesn't take him long to break the fourth wall and address the player directly. There are many different branching paths in the game, but don't worry; the game starts back from the beginning when you get to the end of any of them.\n\nOne of my favorite wall-breaking moments involved the broom closet above.\nThe first time I played through, I tried to open every single door I came across. When the broom closet unexpectedly opened, I went inside. The narrator said, "Stanley went into the broom closet, but seeing that there was nothing in there he turned around and got back on track." So I did.\nThe second time I went into the broom closet again, and the narrator said, "Seriously? I'm not even going to narrate this for you. Just do whatever it is you think is worth going into a broom closet for, and then let's get back to the story. I can wait."\nThe third time the broom closet was boarded up. I laughed for a good 30 seconds.\n\nThere were of course the mandatory jokes about office life, and how pointless meetings can be.\n\nIf you defy the narrator enough times in one play through, the game world will start to deteriorate and the narrator will panic. That was a really fun thread.\n\nThere is also a museum about the game and the creation of the game within the game. That was probably the most meta moment in the game.\n\nThen there was the time that the narrator tried to improve the game by adding more choices and global leader boards. He even decided to show you some other games that he did not make, namely Minecraft and Portal.\n\nMost of these are very silly, but some were much more serious and/or philosophical. In one Stanley thought he was in a dream, because that was the only explanation he could think of for all of the video game logic (he couldn't see his feet, the doors automatically closed behind him, etc.) In another Stanley died.\n\nAchievement hunting in The Stanley Parable is an absolute riot. Only a couple of the achievements are obtained through traditional means. Others are found in the main menu, or require you to exit the game and come back to it, or play throughout a Tuesday. Yeah, they're pretty intense.\n\nSeriously, you should go get The Stanley Parable, it will be the best two hours of your day. Even if you think the $15 price tag is too much for such a short game, you should at least check out the demo. You won't regret it.","October 26, 2013","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

He thought back at all the good times he had with Stanley, the Narrator, and The Adventure Line.  But a thought crossed his mind, is it really a game?  The setting, story and dialogue are all there (with quite high quality voice acting even!), but what of the gameplay?  Is the mere act of movement enough of a world and pushing buttons, gameplay?\n\nJames then realized the obvious: it did not matter.  What is important is the same thing that is important in all other games, the experiance.  As James looked over the hour's played count for The Stanley Parable, he noticed that he had poured hours into it, much of which were spent joyously listening to the narrator's witty remarks.\n\nJames recommends the game highly.","October 17, 2013","true","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

But as i found the narrator's words luring me even deeper into this game i coudn't help but walk forward, even when many parts would say to stop, ignore them, but i found the bond between them hypnotic.Not only could i not turn myself away from this game, i played it for 3 hours straight seemingly to play the same story over and over again, and i couldnt stop. And soon i found myself in stanley's shoes...the same thing over and over and over, never asking questions or changing my path. This was when i truly understood the stanley parable, you stay with him through the narrator's moments and his struggles. You just can't stop, you must play with stanley, fight with him, struggle with him, and find each other on a deeper level.

First off, I'm giving it a thumbs up but for some people this title is probably not worth its full price - wait for a sale if you're in doubt.\nAnyway, stop reading now because the following will contain spoilers - no game breaking ones but spoilers which spoil the gameplay and will take away some of your own experience and exploration and most of the free approach to the game. Starting now [ongoing SPOILER ALERT]:\n\nFor me it comes to a double-edged sword regarding this game. There is one big and simple reason: If you consider the conserative way and understanding of beating a game in this case you do so by simply following the rules of the game - namely the primary intention of the narrator. So the primary way - sticking to the "rule set" - will directly lead you to one end of the game - not THE end (there isn't one per se) - but one. And if it happens to you that at your first playthrough you do so, you might be disappointed heavily. I started off with the "rebel approach" ignoring orders, disobeying. Well, this possible playthrough is more satisfying and I'm grateful that I played this way. It even gave me some moments of fear - psychological horror elements occur - even they get obscured by the overly satirical setting. Well, the big letdown here is, that all in all you only have a couple of minutes of game experience, yes they are dense and deep if you immerse yourself but it's all over too soon! Even if you take your time and don't rush, it's over like a short summer storm.\nThe replayability and multiple paths may get you coming back to this game but the initial punchline is lost.\nThat's why I consider this game as hyped but nonetheless refreshing. That's it basically - it took longer than intended...\nBesides this philosphical, game-theoretical thoughts please consider other reviews that address gameplay, soundtrack, voice-acting etc.\nYours,\nB.","July 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But then, something feels amiss when no orders arrive on his monitor. While Stanley could very well close the door and meekly continue waiting, he also felt a compelling force directing him outside. Out through the door of Room 427 and out into the unknown, that is where the exciting story can begin.\n\nWhen it does, the writing will leave you breathless. Oh, the twists and the turns of the plot, how they'll dazzle you. And let us not forget the witty commentary, the emotion-packed drama, the suspenseful sequences, and the mind-blowing revelations! A perfect example of everything thus described can be seen when...\n\nOh dear, I can't just tell you what happens. That would ruin the surprise of the story, and the story is the best part of The Stanley Parable. I can't just spill all the juicy details in a review like an ill-thought-out movie trailer. Why, it'd be like telling you about how Sasuke kills Dumbledore in that upcoming secret Harry Potter/Naruto crossover movie, or showing you that scene where Donald Duck is turned to the dark side by Sith Lord Deadpool in Kingdom Hearts VII. It would completely ruin the emotional impact when you finally experience the plot yourself, so it's a good thing I didn't spoil anything.\n\nHowever, the question remains... how to convince you of the excellence inherent in The Stanley Parable when describing any part of its plot would ruin the experience for you. After all, it's not like you haven't already prowled around for trailers of the Stanley Parable, possibly located in a convenient central area where a collection of highly insightful and deeply moving trailers are gathered for perusal at one's leisure. Certainly, you wouldn't be here at all if you had listened to The Stanley Parable's inspirational and masterfully orchestrated music[syntheticorchestra.bandcamp.com], or wisely sought out the opinions of professional reviewers. Of course not, witnessing any of the things I had just described would have instantly led you to the logical decision of buying The Stanley Parable and playing it to your heart's content like a sensible human being.\n\nUnless... ah, I see what you're doing. You're being savvy. "Not so fast game developers," You doubtless say to yourself every morning. "I don't buy based on irrational impulses. Much like the wise tortoises of yore, I too slowly and carefully consider various criteria before choosing which game I want to purchase."\n\nWell, there's not much else I can say, now is there? No, not with your stony aloof countenance, like a lonely game-avoiding statue upon a cliff, looking down upon a roiling decadent sea of electronic entertainment. Will nothing sway your cold soul? Will no entreaty convince you to let The Stanley Parable past your defenses and into your heart? Surely there must be one last thing that could tip the scales. Informative pamphlets? Videos of baby animals pretending to be Stanley? A comprehensive demonstration model of The Stanley Parable that accurately and effectively conveys The Stanley Parable experience[www.stanleyparable.com]? If only there was just one last thing!\n\nBut then again, ifs are for the Stanleys of this world; "If I only did this" or "Perhaps I should have done that". Minds perpetually rewinding themselves over the most minor branching paths, wondering and hypothesizing over what could have been and how it could have been. Not trapped like rats in a maze because at least rats can still choose and move to some degree, but trapped like slinkies falling down the stairs. Always moving downwards and never in control, only capable of waiting for that last step and that final abrupt stop.\n\nThank goodness we're not like that, hm? We choose where we go and what we do. In The Stanley Parable and in life, We are in control. We are not trapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we?","April 18","true","35.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The Stanley Parable is a\nnarration based game told from a first person perspective .  Through the eyes\nof the main character, Stanley, you are taken on many bizarre, twisting\nadventures  narrated by sarcastic, hilarious inner dialogue that explore the\nmeaning of life, and ferns though parables.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly basic.  As you progress through the levels, it\noffers choices that affect your current and future playthroughs. The level\ndesign is layer upon layer of rooms that seem to twist in on themselves to\nconfuse your sense of direction and add to the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/recommended/221910/","seriouscatnz","SeriousCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/","365 products in account","Rating: 10/10\n\nThe Stanley Parable is a humourous satire on the absurdity of modern life, told using three themes almost all gamers can relate to in their personal lives: clich√©d story tropes used in fiction; strange restrictins in video game mechanics, particularly in level design; and the monotomy of working life. You play as Stanley, an office worker that finds himself alone when everyone has seemingly disappeared. Stanley travels from his office to investigate. Accompanied by an ironic and witty narrator, whom seems to know his every move and thought, Stanley moves through the office to uncover this mystery. As Stanley, you can either follow the directions of the narrator, or frustrate him by going against his narrations (read 'instructions') and create your own choices.\n\nThis isn't a traditional adventure game, with plot lines and character development. There are no players, enemies, weapons, combat, scores, levelling, or other elements usually considered mandatory for any sort of game. Rather, this is a story about discovering the absudity of life (see "Heaven Ending") and how as people we simply accept a role in life that reduces our choices to a few points of interaction, where you aren't making decisions at all‚Äîyou're simply continuing to exist. Whether it's periodically pulling a lever or pushing a few buttons at a computer desk every day for decades until retirement, this game may inspire you to question whether you're really living a life of variety and fulfillment.\n\nThere are multiple endings and it's up to the persistence and creative disobedience of each player to discover them all. It'll take you around 2 hours to find all the endings, but you'll want to revisit particular endings every once so often, as I have, just to remind yourself of what you'll learn.","December 4, 2013","true","29.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

For somebody who prefers non-linear games, this preachiness gets annoying fast, as it is neither a revelation nor very interesting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lapfox/recommended/221910/","lapfox","Limie Pie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lapfox/","552 products in account","This is a game about the honorable knight of a modern century. Stanley uses his power of thought to fight against the realms of forgotten human fears. The fears all of us have. Almost all of us. Stanley isn't afraid of our mere troubles, they're way too small for his thoughtful brain. He is a hero.\n\nOh, the game, right. It takes place in space, where Stanley fights against demons disguised as giant stars. They will try  to seduce him, but we all know that this is impossible. Stanley cannot be controlled. He's the one controlling. He saves people and planents just on his own. Entire universe is fighting against him, but he will manage to strike back. He's a hero after all.\n\nBut Stanley isn't one of the shining armor knights riding a white horse. He's close to our human beings. He has feelings. He sleeps, he laughs, he coughs, he frightens, he washes floors for free being a nice generous guy. See? He's just like you and me. He will never  give up trying to prove to this world being a perfect person who deserves this title.\n\nLevels? Who need them? The game runs perfectly well using two maps with giant attention to detail. Every piece of paper has it's own unique messages about Stanley being awesome. Every single chair has a bubblegum attached underneath. Even more: each gum has it's own flavour! Real revolution in game design will let you feel to be there, with Stanley.\n\nThe story adjusts to your game style! It may be either fast-paced or slow walk on a park. Or maybe you will run across that park with bunch of sharks on your tail. Stanley doesn't have a tail like most of us. Another similarity! You're pretty much alike with Stanley! Except he does what he wants.\n\nBut this game is not about what Stanley wants. This game is about what you want. You want to get another game where you play as a wizard,  because you want to be one, but simply can't. You want a game where you play as someone better than you. A game, where you can escape your daily routine and dive into a thriling adventure you will never get in your boring life. Stanley doesn't need neither you nor me nor anyone else. His story is perfect and complete.\n\nBut you want to see it in action. Let all those puppets dance just for you. You were not even paying attention to what I was saying. It's a human nature to be maximally boring and minimally paying any attention to the matter of facts. I bet you can't wait to finish reading this very review to post a comment about both grammatical mistakes I've made, or maybe even about double spaces. Why are you reading this then? Most of you has already played the game and read this just to find some person to mock up because of his writing or spelling skills. Because none of you make mistakes. You're all perfect. Like Stanley is.","November 26, 2013","true","33.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

A narrative and satire, not a game (but still a decent narrative. I enjoyed the narration for what it's worth. Kinda funny). Don't fall for the cryptic desciptions on steam thinking there's a mystery to solve that nobody wants to give away like I did.\n\nThe concept is pretty clever and it has it's moments but The Stanley Parable is still overpriced for what it offers in my opinion. I didn't exactly know what I was paying for when I bought it, but I heard/read it was somthing amazing and this and that. I'm not usually swayed by those types of reviews but this one had some type of psycological lure to it I couldnt resist. The  demo didn't clarify the game for me but made me more curious, so I guess it served it's purpose (lol).... When I actually bought it I expected a challenge of some sort, and because I don't like to be spoiled I was reluctant to read some reviews labled 'spoiler' or watch many videos. When I realized the 'point' of the stanley parable was the whole spoiler nobody wants to give away I stopped playing, feeling the same way alot of other reviwers did. . I felt like I could have watched someone play it for free and recieve the message just fine.\n\nMoral of the story: Know what you're paying for.

What can you do?  Walk around.  Sometimes, you interact with an object or two.  The only other being present is the brilliantly voiced narator.

If you want to laugh out loud, this is the game for you. Once you've seen everything there is to see, the game doesn't offer much replay value, but this is not an experience to be missed.","January 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've already beat all of the stories to this game even though there never is an end to it. For me it seemed a little disturbing but i got used to it, I played this game so many times but there is one question i have about it, which is... What is the game about? Is it about an insane man with a voice coming from his head? Or is it just simply Stanley talking? I would love to know but i don't want to know because that's what makes this game exciting.

There are games that are eyeball-poppingly beautiful, of course, and games that make your brain cells implode--looking at you, Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite--but I have never before found a game that really made the player delve into their own psyche, a game that surpassed the boundaries of common narative functions and made the player the true star of the show.\nThus enters this little game.  What can you do?  Walk around.  Sometimes, you interact with an object or two.  The only other being present is the brilliantly voiced narator.   Mostly, you walk, listen, walk some more, and listen some more.\nBut, oh, that's the beauty of it.  Forget "gaming" mechanics, forget all the bells and whistles.  This game exists to get in your mind, where all the real action occurs.  It is a stunningly deep and riotously funny condiut for some of the most incredible glimpses of human nature I've had the pleasure of witnessing--via game or other media.  The Stanley Parable is a wonderful play for anyone with a sense of humor and a pension for self-examination.  This is a game about you--your importance, and your dispensibility, but even more so, about... well, I can't really say, lest I run the risk of spoiling the fun.

I wrote a review of the Demo and the original mod before the full game came out awhile back and never got around to writing a review for this one, but I can say that this was well worth the $15. For those who played the original, know that it is not just an HD remix of the original Source mod. It also adds plenty of new endings, as well as new secrets. The original made it quite obvious to the player the choices available and the amount of endings that could be had, but now they've changed plenty of things around to add more secrets, endings, and oh, the replayability!\n\nNow, every time you finish the game, the game will begin again and sometimes after certain endings certain things will change, and it has some hilarious achievements, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, or not playing for five years, or the "Unacheivable" acheivement (which is apparently somehow acheivable but I'm not sure how to legitly yet).\n\nI definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE.\n\nPS: Don't look up any videos or any information about it.

"Stanley [...] has a job that demands nothing of him, and every button that he pushes is a reminder of the inconsequential nature of his existence. Look at him there: pushing buttons, doing exactly what he's told to do. Now, he's pushing a button. Now, he's eating lunch. Now, he's going home; now, he's coming back to work. One might even feel sorry for him, except that he's chosen this life." As Stanley is not questioning the repetitiveness of his job so the player might not be questioning certain patterns that he is automatically following in his gameplay sessions; in The Stanley Parable these patterns are usually bringing the player to look for something that he's used to get in other games, only to end up getting it in a very ridiculing form ( just think of the competitive leaderboards and the achievements ).\n\nIn most of the cases, by giving the players exactly the contrary to what they wanted from the game, The Stanley Parable pushes the player to obtain a sort of third person self analytical perspective (even intensified in one of the endings in which  the game ends with a third person view on Stanley incapable of making a choice ), the so called (by me) "self extrospection", in which he is asked to reflect on the nature of his impulsive attractions or behaviours. The arising questions and the following thoughts are many: is what the players are looking for something really worth to look for, or are they just grown accustomed to have it and therefore they're feeling its absence when it's not given to them? But it is only when this perspective is moved to other entertainment forms, which are also demanding nothing of people and just drench them with a shower of positive or shocking stimuli, that we can really start to question the level of free will that we possess; as Gustave Le Bon writes in his book "The Crowd ‚Äì A Study of the Popular Mind": ‚ÄùIt is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of crowds that it can be understood [...] how powerless they are to hold any opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them and what seduces them.‚Äù\n\nHow much are we automatically doing because we've been pushed to grow accustomed to it? Are we laughing at a video where someone crashes with a motorbike because it is really funny and not at all unethical, or are we doing that to relief some of our personal frustrations by watching someone else failing? "Yes, it's all very amusing. And we laugh and we call our friends over and they laugh too and soon the whole world laughs and laughs and laughs at the man who failed. [...] But [...] you, sitting there: what have you gained watching this video? What have you learned?" And if we do it because of the frustrating monotony of our life, why are we then allowing the frustration to latently exist? Are we so accustomed to our life as it is that we're scared of doing any changes? How many non-influenced choices are we making? What's the worth of those choices?\n\nStanley might be starting to understand all of this: "in and amongst his aimless meandering, I think he is actually beginning to discover something: he is getting closer to  an answer, an explaination, an exit. He is beginning to earn his freedom", but he is a videogame character bound to narrative limits and cannot escape his own story. He is Stanley and can only be Stanley.\nBut what about us?\n"Now, if I could truly put you in his shoes, to show you the paths he walked and the choices he made.. [...] soon you will be the one to walk: the controls will be in your hands. [...] Oh, I think I'm going to enjoy this. When you find out how alone you truly are.. I will be laughing more than anyone."\n\nIs this a time in which we should break the old entertaining clich√©s of the videogame medium\nand release some of its pedagogical potential? Afterall "men never shape their conduct upon the teaching of pure reason" as Le Bon writes, and we can deduce that they learn by empirically experiencing reality. But if the virtuality is empirically making them experience and hate their own reality, isn't that potentially a formative experience?\n\nIs this then a case in which "ludus est magister vitae"?\nWell, it's certainly worth a thought.\n\n\nThe Stanley Parable Personal Review\nRenzo "Stermayer" Arcuri","January 16, 2014","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wrote a review of the Demo and the original mod before the full game came out awhile back and never got around to writing a review for this one, but I can say that this was well worth the $15. For those who played the original, know that it is not just an HD remix of the original Source mod. It also adds plenty of new endings, as well as new secrets. The original made it quite obvious to the player the choices available and the amount of endings that could be had, but now they've changed plenty of things around to add more secrets, endings, and oh, the replayability!\n\nNow, every time you finish the game, the game will begin again and sometimes after certain endings certain things will change, and it has some hilarious achievements, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, or not playing for five years, or the "Unacheivable" acheivement (which is apparently somehow acheivable but I'm not sure how to legitly yet).\n\nI definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE.\n\nPS: Don't look up any videos or any information about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/6rays/recommended/221910/","6rays","6rays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/6rays/","119 products in account","‚ÄúThis is a story of a man named Stanley‚Äù\nPremise\nIn The Stanley Parable, the player takes on the role of a man simply named Stanley. Stanley‚Äôs job is just as simple as his name: an average everyday office worker. The only thing that sounds more boring than Stanley‚Äôs job and name, are his job requirements: press certain buttons as directed by a computer monitor. But don‚Äôt let this boring premise deter you from this game, it‚Äôs brilliant beyond measure.\n\nDespite sounding mindless, Stanley has a passion for his boring office job. Such a mindless passion, that when the orders stop coming in for him to press buttons from the monitor, he waits an entire hour beginning to question the lack of instruction. It‚Äôs this lack of instruction that causes Stanley to become self aware for the first time in his career (and possibly his life), and drives the beginning of the game. It also helps him notice other strange occurrences around the office and makes him ask questions. Where did my co-workers go? Did I miss a memo? Stanley finally has to make his own choices. He has to speak up. He has to think on his own. Where to I walk? What do I interact with? Stanley had been shielded from independent thinking his entire life it appears, all thanks to a computer monitor always telling him what to do. The choices and the independent thinking are where the finally player comes in, and where the excitement of the game is found. Or more accurately, the lack of choice is where the amusement is found. Mwahahahah. Ahem, carrying on.\n\nBulk of Review\nChoices (and the lack of) are undoubtedly the cause of entertainment and humor in this game, but it‚Äôs the way these choices go hand-in-hand with the witty commentary that makes this game truly amusing. Wait, commentary? What commentary? I think it's a point of emphasis that I mention this a narration-driven game. When Stanley finally gains awareness, a narrator begins to narrate Stanley‚Äôs story audibly, remarking his thoughts and actions. The narrator is the one who woke up Stanley from his mindless slumber in the first place. He decides of what happens in the story just as much as the player does. Scratch that-- the narrator is an all powerful omnipotent being who limits the player in every thinkable way possible. That‚Äôs the point of the game in a nutshell.\n\nThe thrill of the game is toying with the soothing narrator, who comments on every action and choice the player makes, or for that matter, refuses to make. The narrator not only makes comments, but directs and eventually commands Stanley to go down certain passageways and up certain staircases. He wants to control Stanley as much as you yearn to rebel against him. The true amusement is resisting and compromising with the narrator when he directs you to go down a hallway or through a door. In essence, that is the idea of the game. The struggle for control between the narrator of you and you-- No, not this door, I‚Äôll go through this hallway instead. The narrator‚Äôs frustration and responses with his own character is hilarious and the most thought out part of this game.\n\nThe game has very little visual feedback and reinforcement, which can be it‚Äôs downfall and it‚Äôs strength depending on the person. In most cases, I‚Äôd call it a strength. The player can only interact with a handful of objects, which are limited to doors, computers and buttons. This is what makes The Stanley Parable a breath of fresh air. For the first time in my gaming experience, a game relies on the majority of it‚Äôs feedback being audible instead of visual. That‚Äôs a strikingly new concept despite how simple it is to implement and carry out.\n\nIf you like the Portal franchise or puzzle games like Antichamber, The Stanley Parable is comparable to a good mix of both, while still maintaining it‚Äôs own personality as a video game. The witty commentary and it‚Äôs amusement that comes with it draws an easy parallel between Portal and The Stanley Parable. If you like GLaDOS‚Äôs company, the game will do a excellent job of keeping you entertained. This game best caters to those who are willing to question everything in the room, and have an eye for patterns and details. The game has a total of 18 different endings depending on how you and the narrator get along, and how well you can think for yourself despite having limited alternatives to what the narrator says.\n\nSome Criticism\nSo what is this game lacking? Choice. Despite the fact lack of choice is one of the key features of the game, it‚Äôs nonetheless a bit too limited. The vast majority of doors go unlocked and sometimes the player feels very forced into complying with the narrator. Of course, it‚Äôs worth noting the game itself is a analysis on the state of choice in video games. In video games as a medium, we are often more limited with our choices than we care to admit. The Stanley Parable makes light of this. We tend to accept the premise prematurely often too much. We blindly accept the number of choices that are presented, are the number of choices there are. Even with that being the case, the game needs more endings. 18 endings is great, but I feel there is a perfect threshold for this game to capture so it can still make it‚Äôs point about the lack of choice, and have more choice. Perhaps I‚Äôm sour I‚Äôve completed the game and found all the endings, but hey, who wouldn‚Äôt want to rebel against an omnipotent soothing narrator a little more?\n\nConclusion\nCurrently, The Stanley Parable goes for a decent $15 on Steam. At best, it will give you 7 hours of gameplay if you‚Äôre sure to analyze every detail. For the average player however, 3 hours is what‚Äôs expected. Due to the nature of the game, it‚Äôs a rainy day experience. And while it has brilliant commentary and thought-provoking critique on the nature of choice in video games, $15 is a bit much for a day‚Äôs worth of entertainment. I‚Äôd strongly recommend waiting for a sale, but if you love Portal and soothing voices, I can empathize if you can‚Äôt.\n\n\nA Fair Recommendation - 8.7/10","June 30, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wrote a review of the Demo and the original mod before the full game came out awhile back and never got around to writing a review for this one, but I can say that this was well worth the $15. For those who played the original, know that it is not just an HD remix of the original Source mod. It also adds plenty of new endings, as well as new secrets. The original made it quite obvious to the player the choices available and the amount of endings that could be had, but now they've changed plenty of things around to add more secrets, endings, and oh, the replayability!\n\nNow, every time you finish the game, the game will begin again and sometimes after certain endings certain things will change, and it has some hilarious achievements, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, or not playing for five years, or the "Unacheivable" acheivement (which is apparently somehow acheivable but I'm not sure how to legitly yet).\n\nI definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE.\n\nPS: Don't look up any videos or any information about it. It's best experienced first-hand; there's a reason the Store page tells you nothing about the game. If you aren't prepared to throw your money around without knowing about it, play the Demo. Actually‚Äîeither way, play the demo first. It has exclusive content from the actual game and is hilarious in its own right‚Äìit's the best Demo ever, such a good Demo that I wrote a review of the demo.... yeah.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, you can play the original mod if you want. It's on Desura and IndieDB for free‚Äìyou don't need Half-Life 2, just the Source SDK Base 2007 will do it.\n\nI rate this game 8.8888 Stanleys out of 8.8888","November 27, 2013","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Having a separate opinion is perfectly acceptable, and makes you special and unique.\n\nIn fact, I would recommend forming your own opinion on just about everything in your life. Try doing so now, by looking around your current surroundings, and picking an object nearby (a pencil, cup, or piece of paper will do nicely). Now, try and form your own opinion about that object.\n\nI'll wait.\n\n...\n\nhmmm hmmm hmmmm.....\n\n...\n\nHave you formed an opinion yet?\n\nGood!\n\nNow, imagine that opinion was about this game. Makes this game that much more appealing, doesn't it? Unless you have a negative opinion, in which case you haven't done this right, and need to reevaluate your worth to society.\n\nOh, I see, you must be having trouble applying an opinion to the game? Ahhh...  you haven't bought the game yet. This is fine at the moment, but is really putting you at a loss in this review.  Let me guess, you must want to wait and reserve your opinion until after you have played the game?\n\nThat shows wisdom.\n\nIf you MUST see what this game is like,  I would recommend the demo, which is in fact free.  Actually, I will go ahead and review the demo for you. It is fantastic! Better than any other free demo about the Stanley Parable I have played. well worth your time if you are, in fact, interested in The Stanley Parable. Which I am guessing you are, as you are still reading this.\n\nNow, where was I?\n\nOh yes! The Stanley Parable review.  Unfortunately I must hold off on that at the moment, as someone picked the door on the right, and I need to have a talk with them about the implications of such an action.","February 10, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UlmGoneWild/recommended/221910/","UlmGoneWild","Jeanne D'arc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UlmGoneWild/","423 products in account","To describe anything about the game, that is to describe any scene that is going on in the game, any moment that stood out to me would be telling you too much. It would be too big a spoiler, no matter how insignificant the scene might seem. For nothing is really insignificant in the Stanley Parable. A butterfly flaps its wings and creates a hurricane, Stanley does something and chaos ensues.\n\nYou can follow the narrator, or you can disobey him and watch what happens. What does happen would be a spoiler, however it leads to both hilarious dialogue and at the same time, somehow, without sacrificing comedy, it manages to make you think things over. It manages to question the nature of choice and free will. Are you truly free to do anything in the Stanley Parable? After all, the game has been predetermined, hasn't it? It has been built by a developer, and as such as a finite number of endings... But that's the thing, it never seems to end. Even after playing it for four hours straight, I had only found what, 7 endings? And I'm sure there's more to find, since I only explored the endings from the choices you were given, and I am told there are 18.\n\nSpeaking of the narrator, you thought GLaDOS was good? This is basically GLaDOS on steroids. His voice is soothing, he is well written, and he has the right amount of intonation into everything he says, every line is delivered to perfection.\n\nThe only complaint I could possibly have about the game is that it's on the short side, but that's good. It's like the original Portal, its length means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and that it keeps everything fresh.\n\nIf I had to give it a number, I'd give it a solid 10 out of 10.","December 29, 2013","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Plus, most of what the story is about is discovered over time and unraveled throughout the game. I'll do my best all the same.\nYou are cast into an eerily vacant office space, full of mystery and the echoes of an ironic and altogether fitting British man giving you orders by means of telling your story, before it actually happens. I won't give too much detail for fear of ruining it, but there often is a choice. Follow what you are told, or revolt against what you are told. It is up to you. I won't say any more.

Carbon's job was simple: He sat at his desk in his room, and recorded footage of him playing games. Order's came to him via the comments on his videos, telling him what to play, how long, and who with. This is what Carbon did every day, of every month, of every year, and although others might have considered it boring, Carbon relished every moment someone commented on his video, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Carbon was happy.\n\nAnd then one day, Carbon downloaded the Stanley Parable, played it for a while, and posted a video on it. Then something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Carbon; something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single comment had been made on his new video. No one had shown up to give him hatred, constructive feedback, or even say 'hi.' Never in all his years at home had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong.\n\nShocked, frozen solid, Carbon found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his room.\n\nAll of his friends were gone, what could it mean? Carbon then realised he had been playing this game for way too long.

"Stanley [...] has a job that demands nothing of him, and every button that he pushes is a reminder of the inconsequential nature of his existence. Look at him there: pushing buttons, doing exactly what he's told to do. Now, he's pushing a button. Now, he's eating lunch. Now, he's going home; now, he's coming back to work. One might even feel sorry for him, except that he's chosen this life." As Stanley is not questioning the repetitiveness of his job so the player might not be questioning certain patterns that he is automatically following in his gameplay sessions; in The Stanley Parable these patterns are usually bringing the player to look for something that he's used to get in other games, only to end up getting it in a very ridiculing form ( just think of the competitive leaderboards and the achievements ).\n\nIn most of the cases, by giving the players exactly the contrary to what they wanted from the game, The Stanley Parable pushes the player to obtain a sort of third person self analytical perspective (even intensified in one of the endings in which  the game ends with a third person view on Stanley incapable of making a choice ), the so called (by me) "self extrospection", in which he is asked to reflect on the nature of his impulsive attractions or behaviours. The arising questions and the following thoughts are many: is what the players are looking for something really worth to look for, or are they just grown accustomed to have it and therefore they're feeling its absence when it's not given to them? But it is only when this perspective is moved to other entertainment forms, which are also demanding nothing of people and just drench them with a shower of positive or shocking stimuli, that we can really start to question the level of free will that we possess; as Gustave Le Bon writes in his book "The Crowd ‚Äì A Study of the Popular Mind": ‚ÄùIt is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of crowds that it can be understood [...] how powerless they are to hold any opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them and what seduces them.‚Äù\n\nHow much are we automatically doing because we've been pushed to grow accustomed to it? Are we laughing at a video where someone crashes with a motorbike because it is really funny and not at all unethical, or are we doing that to relief some of our personal frustrations by watching someone else failing? "Yes, it's all very amusing. And we laugh and we call our friends over and they laugh too and soon the whole world laughs and laughs and laughs at the man who failed. [...] But [...] you, sitting there: what have you gained watching this video? What have you learned?" And if we do it because of the frustrating monotony of our life, why are we then allowing the frustration to latently exist? Are we so accustomed to our life as it is that we're scared of doing any changes? How many non-influenced choices are we making? What's the worth of those choices?\n\nStanley might be starting to understand all of this: "in and amongst his aimless meandering, I think he is actually beginning to discover something: he is getting closer to  an answer, an explaination, an exit. He is beginning to earn his freedom", but he is a videogame character bound to narrative limits and cannot escape his own story. He is Stanley and can only be Stanley.\nBut what about us?\n"Now, if I could truly put you in his shoes, to show you the paths he walked and the choices he made.. [...] soon you will be the one to walk: the controls will be in your hands. [...] Oh, I think I'm going to enjoy this. When you find out how alone you truly are.. I will be laughing more than anyone."\n\nIs this a time in which we should break the old entertaining clich√©s of the videogame medium\nand release some of its pedagogical potential? Afterall "men never shape their conduct upon the teaching of pure reason" as Le Bon writes, and we can deduce that they learn by empirically experiencing reality. But if the virtuality is empirically making them experience and hate their own reality, isn't that potentially a formative experience?\n\nIs this then a case in which "ludus est magister vitae"?\nWell, it's certainly worth a thought.\n\n\nThe Stanley Parable Personal Review\nRenzo "Stermayer" Arcuri","January 16, 2014","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And yes, in most cases I'd agree with you. However, there are some circumstances in which paying what feels like more-than-average is entirely okay. This is one of those cases.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is one of the most original, creative, and though-provoking games (or THINGS, for that matter) I've ever played. Once you finish it, you've finished it. You can go back and do everything as many times as you want, but once you've done it, you've done it.\nAnd that's okay.\n\nI've played this game for about 6 hours (at the time of review) and while I've done pretty much everything there is to do, I've spent hours in reflection of what any of it means. You will learn from this game if you allow yourself to.\nIt can be silly. It can be unsettling. Most importantly, it can be touching.\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough. If you're on a budget, waiting wouldn't hurt, but if its on sale for as cheap as it gets (I think around $3.75?), there's no reason not to buy it.\n\nI love this game, and it's made its way into my list of favorites with ease.\n\nP.S.

It now seems to be a fun little game, with some silly moments, biting insults, and multiple endings. But as you play the game even more, you start to notice even more things. Like that as you were playing the game, the game was playing you. Every decision you make is manipulated by the game. From the first time you escaped, to your rebellious decision to take the door on the right, to every playthrough after that. You don't play this game, the game plays you.\nEventually you notice something amazing. This isn't even a game. The name states that. It's something much greater than just a game, it's a parable.

It is a very cerebral game at heart, that demands many more hours thinking about the story and how it plays out, than actually playing in it virtually.\n\nThe voice acting of Kevan Brighting (Narrator) is also exceptional.

At first it may seem like a simple game, you walk, go where you are told, and finish the game. But after a bit of playing, you start to find new ways to play the game, and find it to be much larger than you first imagined. It now seems to be a fun little game, with some silly moments, biting insults, and multiple endings. But as you play the game even more, you start to notice even more things. Like that as you were playing the game, the game was playing you. Every decision you make is manipulated by the game. From the first time you escaped, to your rebellious decision to take the door on the right, to every playthrough after that. You don't play this game, the game plays you.\nEventually you notice something amazing. This isn't even a game. The name states that. It's something much greater than just a game, it's a parable. A parable is a story told to teach a moral lesson. I think this game makes a great parable. But, what lesson does it teach?

I do belive that although there are many possbilities it has no replay value and i ran out of possibilities very quickly. There is an achievement called "Go outside" which is quite fun and can only be obtained by not playing stanley parable for 5 years. I felt they did not need to make this a thing as I wan't going to play beyond a week. The rest of the achievements are still funny and quircky and is is nice to see a game with such humour.

At first it may seem like a simple game, you walk, go where you are told, and finish the game. But after a bit of playing, you start to find new ways to play the game, and find it to be much larger than you first imagined. It now seems to be a fun little game, with some silly moments, biting insults, and multiple endings. But as you play the game even more, you start to notice even more things. Like that as you were playing the game, the game was playing you. Every decision you make is manipulated by the game. From the first time you escaped, to your rebellious decision to take the door on the right, to every playthrough after that. You don't play this game, the game plays you.\nEventually you notice something amazing. This isn't even a game. The name states that. It's something much greater than just a game, it's a parable. A parable is a story told to teach a moral lesson. I think this game makes a great parable. But, what lesson does it teach? You'll have to play to find out.\n","October 6, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first it may seem like a simple game, you walk, go where you are told, and finish the game. But after a bit of playing, you start to find new ways to play the game, and find it to be much larger than you first imagined. It now seems to be a fun little game, with some silly moments, biting insults, and multiple endings. But as you play the game even more, you start to notice even more things. Like that as you were playing the game, the game was playing you. Every decision you make is manipulated by the game. From the first time you escaped, to your rebellious decision to take the door on the right, to every playthrough after that. You don't play this game, the game plays you.\nEventually you notice something amazing. This isn't even a game. The name states that. It's something much greater than just a game, it's a parable. A parable is a story told to teach a moral lesson. I think this game makes a great parable. But, what lesson does it teach? You'll have to play to find out.\n","October 6, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Carbon's job was simple: He sat at his desk in his room, and recorded footage of him playing games. Order's came to him via the comments on his videos, telling him what to play, how long, and who with. This is what Carbon did every day, of every month, of every year, and although others might have considered it boring, Carbon relished every moment someone commented on his video, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Carbon was happy.\n\nAnd then one day, Carbon downloaded the Stanley Parable, played it for a while, and posted a video on it. Then something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Carbon; something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single comment had been made on his new video. No one had shown up to give him hatred, constructive feedback, or even say 'hi.' Never in all his years at home had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong.\n\nShocked, frozen solid, Carbon found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his room.\n\nAll of his friends were gone, what could it mean? Carbon then realised he had been playing this game for way too long. That the year was now 2097, and everyone he knew was dead.\n\n10/10, lost all my friends","February 1","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/6rays/recommended/221910/","6rays","6rays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/6rays/","119 products in account","‚ÄúThis is a story of a man named Stanley‚Äù\nPremise\nIn The Stanley Parable, the player takes on the role of a man simply named Stanley. Stanley‚Äôs job is just as simple as his name: an average everyday office worker. The only thing that sounds more boring than Stanley‚Äôs job and name, are his job requirements: press certain buttons as directed by a computer monitor. But don‚Äôt let this boring premise deter you from this game, it‚Äôs brilliant beyond measure.\n\nDespite sounding mindless, Stanley has a passion for his boring office job. Such a mindless passion, that when the orders stop coming in for him to press buttons from the monitor, he waits an entire hour beginning to question the lack of instruction. It‚Äôs this lack of instruction that causes Stanley to become self aware for the first time in his career (and possibly his life), and drives the beginning of the game. It also helps him notice other strange occurrences around the office and makes him ask questions. Where did my co-workers go? Did I miss a memo? Stanley finally has to make his own choices. He has to speak up. He has to think on his own. Where to I walk? What do I interact with? Stanley had been shielded from independent thinking his entire life it appears, all thanks to a computer monitor always telling him what to do. The choices and the independent thinking are where the finally player comes in, and where the excitement of the game is found. Or more accurately, the lack of choice is where the amusement is found. Mwahahahah. Ahem, carrying on.\n\nBulk of Review\nChoices (and the lack of) are undoubtedly the cause of entertainment and humor in this game, but it‚Äôs the way these choices go hand-in-hand with the witty commentary that makes this game truly amusing. Wait, commentary? What commentary? I think it's a point of emphasis that I mention this a narration-driven game. When Stanley finally gains awareness, a narrator begins to narrate Stanley‚Äôs story audibly, remarking his thoughts and actions. The narrator is the one who woke up Stanley from his mindless slumber in the first place. He decides of what happens in the story just as much as the player does. Scratch that-- the narrator is an all powerful omnipotent being who limits the player in every thinkable way possible. That‚Äôs the point of the game in a nutshell.\n\nThe thrill of the game is toying with the soothing narrator, who comments on every action and choice the player makes, or for that matter, refuses to make. The narrator not only makes comments, but directs and eventually commands Stanley to go down certain passageways and up certain staircases. He wants to control Stanley as much as you yearn to rebel against him. The true amusement is resisting and compromising with the narrator when he directs you to go down a hallway or through a door. In essence, that is the idea of the game. The struggle for control between the narrator of you and you-- No, not this door, I‚Äôll go through this hallway instead. The narrator‚Äôs frustration and responses with his own character is hilarious and the most thought out part of this game.\n\nThe game has very little visual feedback and reinforcement, which can be it‚Äôs downfall and it‚Äôs strength depending on the person. In most cases, I‚Äôd call it a strength. The player can only interact with a handful of objects, which are limited to doors, computers and buttons. This is what makes The Stanley Parable a breath of fresh air. For the first time in my gaming experience, a game relies on the majority of it‚Äôs feedback being audible instead of visual. That‚Äôs a strikingly new concept despite how simple it is to implement and carry out.\n\nIf you like the Portal franchise or puzzle games like Antichamber, The Stanley Parable is comparable to a good mix of both, while still maintaining it‚Äôs own personality as a video game. The witty commentary and it‚Äôs amusement that comes with it draws an easy parallel between Portal and The Stanley Parable. If you like GLaDOS‚Äôs company, the game will do a excellent job of keeping you entertained. This game best caters to those who are willing to question everything in the room, and have an eye for patterns and details. The game has a total of 18 different endings depending on how you and the narrator get along, and how well you can think for yourself despite having limited alternatives to what the narrator says.\n\nSome Criticism\nSo what is this game lacking? Choice. Despite the fact lack of choice is one of the key features of the game, it‚Äôs nonetheless a bit too limited. The vast majority of doors go unlocked and sometimes the player feels very forced into complying with the narrator. Of course, it‚Äôs worth noting the game itself is a analysis on the state of choice in video games. In video games as a medium, we are often more limited with our choices than we care to admit. The Stanley Parable makes light of this. We tend to accept the premise prematurely often too much. We blindly accept the number of choices that are presented, are the number of choices there are. Even with that being the case, the game needs more endings. 18 endings is great, but I feel there is a perfect threshold for this game to capture so it can still make it‚Äôs point about the lack of choice, and have more choice. Perhaps I‚Äôm sour I‚Äôve completed the game and found all the endings, but hey, who wouldn‚Äôt want to rebel against an omnipotent soothing narrator a little more?\n\nConclusion\nCurrently, The Stanley Parable goes for a decent $15 on Steam. At best, it will give you 7 hours of gameplay if you‚Äôre sure to analyze every detail. For the average player however, 3 hours is what‚Äôs expected. Due to the nature of the game, it‚Äôs a rainy day experience. And while it has brilliant commentary and thought-provoking critique on the nature of choice in video games, $15 is a bit much for a day‚Äôs worth of entertainment. I‚Äôd strongly recommend waiting for a sale, but if you love Portal and soothing voices, I can empathize if you can‚Äôt.\n\n\nA Fair Recommendation - 8.7/10","June 30, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You cannot break this game. (Okay you CAN but that's somewhat hard to do.) The developers have thought of everything and have considered how you would react as a person, so they've added as much as they could. "What if I revisit this ending?" They considered that, too.\n\nThis seems to be a game with an illusion of choice that's aware of that illusion. Or is it a game? Is it an interactive story? Can it really be a story? A walking sim with soul, really? And what of the narrator? Is he too, just an illusion? You're going to ask yourself a lot of questions. "What was that I just experienced? I need to do that again. But what if I just go through this door this time?"\n\nI kept clicking. I clicked when there was no obvious objective and discovered that was the right way. Or was that the wrong way? The irritation I caused the narrator delighted me, so this seemed like the right way to play to me. Of course until I splattered against the pavement, causing him much horror and sadness because "I must hate him" for some reason.\n\nWhat's the downside? Well, it's pretty easy to get the majority of endings in a short amount of time if you're that eager to keep going because you're just that interested. There is a hard ending that will take hours of dedicated game play, but even that becomes simple once you realize that yes, the developers have even thought about ways to obtain that ending. You'll end up resorting to playing just to take a screenshot of every easter egg just to say you found it. Not a horrible thing, but replayability-wise, the game doesn't sink a huge amount of time.\n\nThat's about it, though. Otherwise, allow me to join those adding their voices to the glowing praise to The Stanley Parable.\n\nThe break room is truly a work of art.\n\nTruly.","April 4, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I know you spent some hard-earned-cash on this thing you call a piece of art, but you know what? Games are bloody ridiculous! You're sitting here in front of your PC screen while pressing random buttons just because the game tells you to. You're wasting your precious time! OK, I know that you will never be a rocket scientist or find the cure for cancer, but instead of video games, you should go out and enjoy the beauty of the world we live in.\n\nHow do I know that?\nWell, for me it's obvious. When you follow all of the narrator's commands , you'll reach an ending where Stanley (and you at the same) shut off the so-called 'mind-control-facility' and then leave it through a garage door leading straight into a bright, greenish landscape. Shortly thereafter you lose control over Stanley who continues walking by himself and then the screen fades to black while you get an achievement that you beat the game.\n\nBut the confusing thing about The Stanley Parable is that it also offers you other endings which deal with totally different stuff.After all, it is a game about choice and consequence. Wherever you go changes the ending of the game. While it may be a game which had less budget than an AAA-title, it is by far more complex concerning the story.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is worth both your time and your cash. Buy it and let yourself be entertained by this innovative piece of art.\nAnd then don't play it for five years and be rewarded for doing so the day you decide that you want to be Stanley again.","January 8","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Funny, interesting, and involving.\n\nBasic Gameplay:\n\nYou are Stanley, an ordinary employee (number 427) in an ordinary office building. One day, you are pushing buttons at your desk when you realize no one else is there. Your life is narrated by "The Impeccable Kevan Brighting." I won't say anything else for fear of spoilers, but here's my Pro/Con list:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Engaging gameplay\n+ Easy controls\n+ Wonderful, interesting storyline\n+ 19 possible endings\n+ New, unique idea\n+ The narrator\n+ Small changes with each playthrough\n+ Fun Easter eggs and jokes if you take your time\n\nCONS:\n\n- Gets repetitive\n- When you exhaust all endings, there isn't much more content\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.","March 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Stanley Parable is a gem, it really is. It's one of those games filled to the brim with sublte mystery and -fantastic- narration. Every path you take delivers witty dialogue, clever jokes, and an all-around, genuinely good time. As far as replayability is concerned, well, technically that's what this game is about--you've just got to find all the secrets and endings scattered around here and there, hoping to find something new, testing things you haven't tested before--pushing you to limits of clicking on just about everything--still, once you find satisfaction, picking up this game again might be challenging. For instance, I won't be playing this game for another five years in order to get a certain achievement, and no, I won't be resetting my clock to do so.","June 26, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
