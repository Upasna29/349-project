"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/268810/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account",""The scariest bit was his face"\n\nMy attention was brought to this game while it was still trying to get through Steam Greenlight and was offering free keys to users willing to vote. Now the game is up, and while me and many other users are still awaiting the promised keys, this game appeared in a bundle, so I've picked it up there so I can play and review the game for all those who are still waiting.\n\nStory\nAs someone who doesn't watch television, my knowledge of this was minimal until I looked it up for my review. The knowledge that the series was supposed to be reality TV just makes this so much worse. Anyway, this game has the team, along with you, a new guy who doesn't receive a name, go to see someone about some recently strangeness at the site of a Civil War battle. This really was a weak point of the game, and given I know now of the 'reality TV' series, I can only face palm at the thought that it would be so poor as well.\n\nPresentation\nExpressionless faces and emotionless voices. This was so bad. The characters from the TV show have some poor caricatures, most of which don't closely match the original characters. Still, they aren't so bad you couldn't match them to a photo. The fact that the faces are never changing, no matter the current events, well, that is less forgivable. The main character just has a creepy stare that never changes through the game, and the rest aren't much better. I've been informed that the voice acting isn't from the original actors either, which doesn't bother me as I've never watched it, but the poor quality of it certainly does. Little emotion to it, and bad all round.\n\nAt least once you ignore the characters, the rest is at the expected level of quality for a hidden objects games. Items are clear, but don't stand out, which is what you would want from the genre. Nothing special to mention, but no more complaints from this section.\n\nControls\nPurely point and click with the mouse. The only problem here was picking up an item to use on the same screen, as where you would expect the pointer to be isn't always correct, resulting in trying to guess the correct positioning to continue on.\n\nGameplay\nWith a hidden object game, there isn't a lot to the gameplay. A number of rooms to look through, finding hidden object puzzles, logic puzzles and items for solving the logic puzzles. In two of these, the game is fine. Hidden object puzzles went as expected, even if it doesn't bring anything special to the table. Locating items for the other puzzles is also simple enough.\n\nThe logic puzzles, here there are some more problems to add to the list of flaws. Some of these are quite alright, while some of them seem to have no logic to them, just attempting everything until it works. One early puzzle was to get the electricity working by replacing fuses. You have several empty slots and several coloured fuses. The slots weren't marked in any way that I could see, you just tried each fuse until a small light lit up, then moved to the next. That isn't any sort of puzzle, just random guessing. If there was a logical solution, it wasn't visible to me. There were several others handled just as poorly.\n\nLifespan\nThis game is quite short, being under 5 hours to beat both the original campaign and the bonus content unlocked after that, though that is an acceptable length for the genre. There are also 20 achievements, but most if not all will be unlocked the first time around. There are some difficulty settings but this only effects what level of hints you will receive during the game, something I never used myself. Chances are you won't bother with this game once you have completed it the first time.\n\nClosing\nOverall, this game really isn't worth a purchase, at least not at the asking price. There are many better games available capable of testing both your eyes and your mind, without inflicting the problems mentioned.\n\n4 / 10","April 27, 2014","false","5.0"," 113 of 176 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","113","176","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/afaris/recommended/268810/","afaris","Shura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/afaris/","122 products in account","Well it is not bad, in that I completed it and didn't feel ripped off, there weren't any technical issues.  However there are many other similar and better games on Steam that I wouldn't recommend this one unless you are starting to exhaust Steam's catalogue of hidden object games.\n\nIt is not scary, there are a couple of jump scares but they don't really affect the scariness of the game.  However I did feel uncomfortable playing this game for the following reasons.\n\nThe art work in general is very good.  However the character animation during dialogue is really uncanny as it is just large blinking eyes and in the group scene at the beginning strange head tilts.\n\nThe characters motivation is a bit off, you play as the newest member of the paranormal investigation group, but you are given all of the equipment during the game and sent off to do almost all of the work, so you end up wanting to tell the other members of the team to get up of their backsides and do something. I would understand if you were split from the group or there was some story dynamic to make you do it, but there isn’t. An early example  is that you have to answer the phone in the back of the car on the way there, even though you are in the front passenger seat and there are four people in the back who are nearer the phone, and are more likely to know the person on the other end.  Assembling an electrical item with the technical expert next to you, because he cannot be bothered? It gets worse.\n\nHidden Object Scenes, not too difficult to implement you would think, but these are the most annoying I have ever played. Using synonyms is ok, half hiding objects are ok, but most of the scenes have objects which require multiple actions to find.  Which is fine but there are a lot of them.  I should mention that the hidden objects appear to be the same in subsequent play throughs. Normally I would expect a scene to have 12-15 hidden objects selected out of database of a greater number of possible objects, sometimes they always include a particular object needed to advance the plot, but there is usually some variation, in this game there isn't any. This is made worse because even when you know two objects work together clicking on one with the other is difficult due to the detection of the game engine, if often doesn’t detect the click unless you click a certain part of the object but this seems to vary, and not in a predictable or intelligent way.\n\nThe first hidden object scene contains 4 objects out of 12 which require multiple actions; the highest appears to be 6 out of 12. Some of the solutions are nonsensical. It is almost as bad as the famous puzzle in one of the Gabriel Knight games that requires you to place tape over a hole in a fence to chase a cat through, such that hair is stuck to the tape, which you then use to make a fake moustache to disguise yourself as a character that doesn’t have a moustache.\n\nThis followed through into the other puzzles,  melt that substance with a melting point over 1000 degrees C on a campfire ok. Go to great lengths to get a source of light, even though there is an electric work light only feet away etc.\n\nGameplay aside I felt uncomfortable playing the game for three main reasons.\n\n1) The game requires you to vandalise and steal items during you investigation at times when there is no urgency. If the game required me to steal a first aid kit to help someone who was dying, I would say fair enough, or break a car window to retrieve a phone to call for the police, well they can just bill me for the window.\n\nHowever the game requires me to steal and cause damage at times in the game when as far as the group is concerned, no one is in immediate danger, or the only reason to break the law is for the benefit of our investigation. Randomly destroy and damage Native American artefacts for no reason because later on you will just happen to need them, take whatever you want even though the owners are not far away, because well who cares.\n\n2) Health and safety, running into a burning building to rescue someone, dangerous but necessary. But don't worry; you won’t be doing anything like that.\n\nInstead:\n\nInstead thrill in the danger of lighting candles so you can see to fill a gas tank, because someone cannot be bothered to go back to the car and get a torch.\n\nDamage a building water supply and leave it leaking in a room with the electricity switch on, to clean a mirror to see something in the reflection which you would see by just turning around.\n\n3) Native Americans, I don't know much about Native American culture, however it is featured and plays a prominent part of the game. But it all seems very stereotypical, dream catchers - check, Indians wearing fringed buckskin - check, big head dresses - check, totem poles - check. Everything from old cowboy films before laws were brought in to stop white people in makeup playing Native Americans - check. I doubt that all of the Native American symbolism used is genuine, and even with the genuine items, I doubt that any one nation included all of these elements. It would have been less of a problem in a more fantastic setting, but the associated TV show is delivered as a documentary, and the game is set in a real world setting. It made me cringe and I am a white Englishman, so I expect it would really upset actual Native Americans. I just felt that it was all a bit racist, and apart from holding my hand up and saying "How", it couldn't have gotten anymore unpleasant.\n\nSo I would in closing say, the game is not terrible, but almost all of the hidden object games on Steam are better. It is really only for fans of the TV show. Go play something by Artifex Mundi (Developed not just distributed by.) and you will have a better experience for a bit less money.","August 30, 2014","false","8.1"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","33","45","0","0"

Lots of different puzzles to keep things interesting.  This game is based on an A&E show, players are a member of a college club called the Paranormal Research Society, or as the cool kids say PRS.  In Poison Spring all kinds of creepy stuff happen, and the game is even scary as well at parts!  One of the characters Ryan Buell just looks creepy, the characters in cinematics look expressionless which also makes it eerie.  Dont let steelhands get away with his master plan to decieve this group of pesky kids, they are supposed to be in college but they all look way to old and one of them looks 90 so not sure what that is about.\n\nFeels pretty short, after beating the game is a bonus game where you return to the dreaded Poison Spring to solve yet another mystery.  The puzzles are very well put together, the hidden object parts really fit and dont look like a garage sale vomited stuff all over, each part has a sound, or most do making it feel in depth.  Be careful behind some objects are ghosts!  Lots of those weird ghost hunting gadgets from the audio device to the camera and a digital signature thing is in the game making you feel all x filey.\n\nHere is a link for history buffs:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Poison_Spring\n\n*If game is blinking, right click the exe and set it to disable DPI scaling...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/268810/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","I'm gonna be completely honest here, I hated this game, and this is coming from someone who enjoys hidden object games quite a bit.  This review will be based on the game's merits regardless of the fact that I received it free, as I think that would be unfair to anyone looking to purchase it.\n\nLet me first state that I am not a fan of the premise...at...all.  I've never watched the show, but even so, the whole paranormal investigator thing is so hokey and contrived that it right off the bat turned me off.  Despite the story, I was willing to give the game a chance focusing on the gameplay; it's not as if HOGs have the greatest narratives in gaming anyway, and it's usually the artwork, atmosphere and gameplay that keeps me entertained.\n\nIn all honesty, the artwork is pretty decent, at least the non-character graphics.  They're pretty much par for the course in the genre and are pleasant enough to look at.  The character models though, boy...again, I haven't watched the show, but I found the characters' emotionless stares far more creepy than anything the ghosts toss at you.  And the somewhat monotone voice acting doesn't help them either.\n\nThe gameplay in the adventure portions was average, nothing I haven't seen before.  The puzzles were OK, again, nothing I haven't seen before, but mildly stimulating all the same.  The hidden object scenes, though, I grit my teeth even thinking about them.  It's kind of hard to mess these up, but they managed to do it here.  For one, there are way too many multi-action items; 2-3 per scene is usually pretty good, but later in the game nearly half of the items in each scene require 2-3 steps to clear.  Ok, no big deal...but some of the actions are so illogical, I don't know how they expected people to figure them out without either clicking on everything like crazy or taking the easy route and using the help button, which I usually avoid at all costs but used more times than I can count because I just didn't have to patience for this game.  Other items were what I would consider deceptively hidden, which is something I will always criticize as an artificial means of adding difficulty.  The best hidden object scenes utilize clever synonyms and unique word usage to add difficulty as well as help improve vocabulary, but that's rarely the case here.  And I haven't even mentioned the buggy cursor that wouldn't select/pick up certain items without clicking 20+ times trying to find the right pixel to trigger...\n\nBottom line, the gameplay was not enough to make up for the stinker of a premise/story.  Folks, there are a LOT better hidden object games out there to spend your money on.  I would advise avoiding this one unless you're a rabid fan of the TV show and need a fix or end up getting it in a bundle.","May 14, 2014","false","5.1"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","35","53","2","0"

This is my first time playing a HOG that is both a HOG and a Point and Click adventure game, and let me tell you, it is a lot of fun.  When I played other HOGs I got bored of doing nothing but hidden object scenes non-stop, and I often would not even finish the game.   This game, I see myself finishing and maybe even coming back to play again a 2nd time.   The game is that much fun and it is never boring.   In between doing hidden objects, you got plenty of mini-games and puzzles to solve.   I highly recommend that nobody who plays this game, use the skip button on any mini-game.   The fun of this game is solving the mini-games and puzzles.  If you skip them, then you are losing out on a lot of the fun.\n\nOne of the things that makes this game great is that the hidden object scenes "fit".   In other HOG games, the hidden object scenes would not fit.   Like a cemetery scene that was so cluttered that it didn't even look like a real cemetery.   In this game, every hidden object scene feels like it is part of the world.   I would say the scenes fit into the world about 95% of the way in this game, and that is pretty good.   Every HOG game has a lot of hidden objects that don't belong in a certain place, so no scene will fit 100% but fitting about 95% is pretty good.\n\nOne of the things that makes this game both unique and great, is that there are interactive objects in the hidden object scenes.   For example, you may have to cut something open.  So you first need to find the right item that is able to cut the thing open, and then you need to do it.   I ran into some interesting interactive objects during my time playing so far, such as the spider web.   I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't say anymore about the spider web.   But I will say, it makes this a unique game in having these interactive objects.  Having them in the game also makes it more interesting and fun.\n\nAnother thing that makes this game great, is you feel motivated to continue playing the game until you finish it.   Other HOG games, I got bored with, but not with this game.   This game, I feel motivated to play.   I just started playing the game today, and I played for almost 3 hours in one day.   I will finish the game in the next few days.   What keeps me motivated is that every time you finish a hidden object scene, you get rewarded with an object that you can use in the point and click adventure part of the game.    Also as I said earlier in the review, it is not nothing but hidden object scenes, so you have variety in this game.   The variety keeps me interested and motivated.    I plan to solve every mini-game and puzzle in the game, without using a walkthrough.   Even if that means taking a little longer then other people to finish the game.   I will get more fun out of the game that way.\n\nI highly recommend this game for people who enjoy HOGs, especially if you like a HOG with point and click adventure elements in it.","October 5, 2014","true","10.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

He's the leader of some rag-tag Scooby gang that goes around and uses their dad's spare electronics to pretend ghosts exist. Some ♥♥♥♥'s going down in a state park built on an old Civil War battleground and you get to help them suss it out.\n\nAside from the fearless leader and the contrived-as-hell plot, this is a very solid game. The graphics are clear and detailed, which you would think would be a regular priority in games where you have to find things. It really does make a huge difference in the item searches, which are a small step backwards from Infected in that you have to find some really obtuse, nonsensical items like shadows and symbols. They're still quite fun and seem easier than in similar games. The puzzles are also great, clearly explained and easy to get the hang of, but still provide a decent challenge. The detail extends to the environments you navigate, with lots of things to examine and learn more about the park from. There are even some hidden objects scattered around the map to find just for fun. I think this one makes a perfect entry-level hidden object game for people new to the genre, and is polished and fun enough for veterans as well. Thumbs up.\n\nSeriously though, he makes that kind of face through the entire game.","September 16, 2015","true","4.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

There were spiritboards, cemetaries under the properties,  demonic possessions, EVPs, thermal readings, exorcisms, etc. Everything that one associates with the paranormal from mythology to spirtuality to gadgetry... all crammed into each 22 minute episode.\n\nThis game is a lot like that... it's somewhat short (much longer than 22 minutes) and you will experience all of the typical stuff you associate with paranormal research and especially with the show Paranormal State.\n\nSPOILERS:\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the center is Native American lore, wrapped around the story of ghosts of forbidden lovers, in the midst of a demonic possession (see, I told you this title was like the TV show with a bunch of stuff packed in)... and you can just use your imagination to go from there... you will use dowsing rods, spirit boards, EVP recorders, thermal imaging... all of it... to save the day for the Paranormal State crew.\n\nIt's mildly entertaining, but don't expect much unless you find amusement of whatever sort in the TV show.\n\nComplaint: No Chip Coffey in the game.\nHighlight: Upon game launch, Ryan Buells eyes blinking creepily at you.","April 12, 2014","true","19.8"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","35","55","0","0"

Fictional Poison Springs was the scene of a civil war battle where the union soldiers were to sent to stop a supply shipment to the conferate army.  During the course of the investigation, the ghosts of a conferate civil war soldier and a Cherokee girl help guide the team to discover the source of the "hauntings".  Of course, the team is also there to stop the "hauntings" as well, and they have called in the help of Lorraine Warren, a renown spiritual exocist.\n\nFirst I would like to address various reviews which point out this was made in conjunction with A&E (TV network) about a most likely popular show called "Paranormal State".  I have never seen the show or even heard of it before reading the reviews (after I played the game).  So my opinion about this is: fan service, big deal.  Half the anime shows on TV and many games on Steam are fan service.  (Shrug)  The second thing: It seems everyone points out this game is about the paranormal, and they use the word paranormal when stating, in most cases, why they do not like the premise.  Would the word ghosts have been better?  I notice no one complains about ghosts.  My one and only complaint is this arena of real people being depicted in a fan service fictional game is the developers and A&E really should have used the actual real people to do the voices, not voice actors.  It is fan service after all.\n\nGameplay:  This game is more point and click then Hidden Object.  Being a fan service game, it is very simple and meant for a wider and most likely non-gaming or at least non-Hidden Object/ point and click gaming audience.  There is some backtracking and some relatively pointless back and forth movement as the gamer is the "newest team member" gets sent to the other team members to get equipment or information.  Also as the newest member the gamer gets all "the work".  This game being designed as a nearly interactive game ends up bordering on annoying for someone like me who is a HO junkie.  On one side of that annoyance is team leader Ryan Buell who almost comes off as a jerk by sending his newest member to do all the tasks while he and his team sits about.  Yet on the other side of that annoyance is the gamer is interactive in the investigation and gets to play with all the "toys".  I must say playing with all the "toys" is actually what made the game for me, as well as the actual real life way the investigation is presented such as research and talking with people.  (Though the gamer is only given that information since other team members are responsible for that.)\n\nThe gameplay is set up in about 5 scenerios which depending on your point of view may or may not seem out of place or illogical in progression.  Maintaining the investigative spirit while playing makes the progression logical, as facts and information are uncovered by the team and pointed out by the helpful ghosts.\n\nPuzzles/Hidden Object scenes:  OOOOH .... I really liked the actual puzzles.  Those were definitely brain twisters and some out-of-box thinking.  Most if I remember correctly were old fashioned logic puzzles, and a couple the hair pulling kind.  The Hidden Objects scenes were easy and solvable in a couple of minutes.\n\nOverall: The game was worth the play, and I would rate it family oriented.  Nothing too hard, the premise fair enough and for those who are not into "paranormal" just leave "reality" at the door and think ghosts instead.  As I said before this is fan service and should be treated as such.","November 11, 2015","true","14.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

But only a little so.\n\nThe graphics of this HOG game are ok, it is an collectors edition with additional contents and the sound is atmospheric, only at the end the sound can be quite unnerving.\n\nThe reason for the disappointment was in fact, that the game crashed several times after solving either a HOG-scene or using the thermal-camera in the game. It happened about eight times during the run of the game. But that might also have something to do with a defect Steam-Overlay or some update crashes.\n\nI played it through, the story was ok, even if a bit too cheesy. The hidden object scenes were on a quite easy level, even on expert mode. The riddles were also quite simple, but also entertaining. This game is a casual game, so I didn't expect more about that. The game was rewarding during it's course of run. I would say that a younger audience might have a lot of fun with this game ... and it might even surprise older players. It plays like an adventure game often, so you don't have the feeling you are stuck in a "HOG-Scene after HOG-Scene" nightmare.\n\nThe important question is, can I recomend this game? I would say yes, even though there are minor issues, for example the price is a tad too high for a HOG game with about four to six hours of playtime. But if you get a 50 %, 66 % or even a 90 % coupon, or if this game is cheap in a bundle or in a sale, you might think about adding this game to your library. Another issues is the repeated crashing on one of my machines, without any real reason behind this weird behaviour - but since this game has a good step for step save game, you aren't forced to replay too much of the content you already solved (in fact, it seemed that the crashs happened after the checkpoint was saved - so you could in my case just end the task and restart right were you were kicked out of the story). Another thing was the sound at the end of the story, it wore down my normaly quite strong nerves with this pulsing, crunchy sound in the background - just enervating, not horror just plain enervating - like horse flies in the summer after you had a long dive in the pool and lie down on your chair to savour your well earned glass of scotch...","December 14, 2014","true","13.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

This is not a horror themed game at all. It's mildly spooky at best. The game itself is an adventure game with quite frustrating and random hidden object scenes and some odd puzzles thrown in. The hidden object scenes require a ridiculous amount of interaction to reveal some of the objects. This adds to the adventure character of the game, but it certainly feels like a missed point in a hidden object scene. The game might have benefited from a traditional point and click approach.\n\nAlso some of the puzzles feel really forced (match barely identifiable symbol to match their 'yummy' partner for instance) and rather take away from the game. The story isn't really good and neither is the animation (almost none anyway) or the voice acting. Granted the voice acting isn't terrible either, but it fails to deliver any suspense. The graphics and sounds otherwise are good.\n\nI'd say for half the price this game isn't a bad way to spend 2-3 hours. There's a pretty decent game in there that got messed up by bad design mistakes.

You can skip every one if you want, or get a hint on the hidden object ones, and there are 3 levels of hinting that you can set as the game difficulty. Also, in this edition the journal contains a complete "strategy guide" which is a step-by-step walkthrough. The collection is held together by a story taking place on a number of pre-drawn screens (with next to no animation) and competent voice-acting. The story and gameplay is mostly linear, and you can check the map to see where you need to be to progress. You'll be traveling back and forth a lot as new puzzles might be unlocked for you later. There is a short bonus chapter tacked on that is interesting not so much for its three puzzles, but rather for another take on the same scenes you saw in the main game.\n\nI found it a diverse collection of puzzles married to a casual adventure; granted, it's not exceptional, but for its budget, it is well executed, and if you don't skip too often, should keep you pleasantly occupied for a few hours.","October 7, 2014","true","9.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

He is joined by Eiffel 65 (some hippie woman), Sergei Federov (a tech guy), Hurricane Katrina (the interview woman), his gramma Lorraine, and some other woman with a creepy smile as they struggle to discover the sinister events occurring at Poison Spring. This game is a documentary, and the events were filmed in real time.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, PS:PS is solid. The hidden object scenes are a tad on the easy side, but they never repeat themselves, The other puzzles tend to be enjoyably difficult, with the exception of two Tower of Hanoi (more like Tower of ANNOY) puzzles that show up, and a boring 'jump stones over other stones until only one's left' puzzle.\n\nThe story itself is pretty unusual, for being based on real events. (After all, something with the name Paranormal State would never lie about ghosts, right?) The Ghostbusters roll into Poison Spring to help Iris (the curator of the park) fend off the Cherokee version of Satan, along with the help of some old fogey Indiana Jones wannabe (seriously, the dude has fedoras all over the place, and a whip, and he has a poster of Indy in his tent). You also meet the ghosts of a black Union soldier and his Cherokee lover, the daughter of the dude who summoned the Cherokee Satan in the first place (so, your typical Romeo and Juliet stuff). I really had no idea the Civil War was almost decided by a demon summoning, so this game is truly edutainment. (That couldn't be wrong, could it? After all, a show with the integrity of Paranormal State would never lie...would it? ...Nahhhh!)\n\nOverall, a fine experience for any fan of HOGs, or the show this was adapted from. Plus, an extra 10/10 for demonstrably proving the existence of demons, life after death, and time travel (since I found sushi in a Native American grave that had been sealed since the Civil War).","May 17, 2015","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

It's a very solid hidden object game though I'm not quite sure on the price or the TV show background. (Who watches TV anymore?)\n\nPros:\n- Great art for the scenery, the objects, and the characters (I will get back to the characters part...)\n- I can't recall any objects being reused In the actual hidden object puzzles throughout the entire game, that's impressive.\n- Three difficulty to chose from that actually affect the game it self instead of just the hint timer.\n- Voice acting done well\n- A nice selection of mini games.\n- Some replayability (Holy crap a Hidden Object game with some replayability?) This game has something I haven't seen in a hidden object game before, After beating the main story it actually has bonus levels that weren't included in the actual story so they aren't just rehashes. Major points in my book.\n- Steam Achievement and Steam Trading Cards\n- Between 4 - 6 hours of gameplay for the main story plus the bonus after story.\n- Decent story giving you a reason to go from area to area.\nCons:\n- Characters (oh the characters...) While the artwork for the characters was amazingly well drawn I found them boring and unmemorable, the only memorable feature about them was the fact that through the entire game the only animation they have is that they blink every few seconds, Even though they could have gone with mouth moving for the voice acting they went with blinking. (WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?)\n- No Quick travel, Which goes with my next point (You have a map telling you where you need to go why can't you just click on that scene? Maybe other Hidden Object Games have spoiled me.)\n- Lots of back tracking. (Seriously, Lots.)\n\nOverall Score: 10/10 Even with the things I mentioned in the cons I have to give this game a 10 out of 10 for the things I mentioned in the pros, Especially the replayability due to the actual difficulty differences and the bonus after story. The only real sticking point I can see is the price, Sure I got it for free but 10$ feels like a lot for a Hidden Object game although I understand they have to pay the artists, programmers and voice actors hidden object games get really low in price on steam so it might make the difference to many between buying it or not. If you like Hidden Object games and the price doesn't bother you Buy it, it's great. If that price is a bit much pick it up on sale it's well worth it.","October 17, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The puzzles are mostly pretty easy, although I suck at the peg board jumping over one so I had to skip that particular, but fairly varied. There tends to be no explanation of why everyone has weird puzzle locks on their doors and handbags, but that is so common in the genre it hardly even counts as a negative.\n\nOne note on achievements is that there is a certain part after completing the old house where half the areas previously unlocked are now unavailable (including the old house itself), so ensure you have found all the collectibles before finishing this part or you will need to replay most of the game again (luckily you don't have to get all 20 in one playthrough if you mess up and miss a couple like I did). Otherwise you will mostly be able to get all the achievements in one playthrough (minus the 1 minute HOG timer which probably will require redoing the first one or two scenes knowing where everything is).\n\nThe point and click sections between are mostly fairly good, although prone to the common hidden object game flaw that half the game could be saved by a protaganist that thinks to bring along a basic set of common tools like screwdrivers, hammers, knives, etc. and didn't throw them away every time they are used. Otherwise they are mostly reasonably logical, or at least not completely silly and immersion breaking anyway.\n\nThere are also some sections where you use some spook detecting equipment - some equivalent of a ghostbusters style PKE meter which needs you to find symbols randomly scattered around a screen, a heat camera which is a simple tile swapping/matching exercise, and a noise recorder where you have to fiddle with the amplitude and volume of a recording to match the target line. Oh and plus a metal detector you use once. These all are done fairly well and add a bit more variety to things.\n\nOverall it is fine, if a bit cheesy, so if you have an evening to waste it is an okay option, especially at the current price. Probably more for fans of the series, but it isn't so bad anyone else that likes this genre won't get on fine with it.","December 27, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you liked the first Enigmatis, this is a good bet, as the production values, feature set, and puzzle to hidden object ratio are similar.\n\nThe only negative is that the hotspots are tiny. If you remember to click with the top left pixel of whatever thing you're using -- rather than what visually makes sense -- everything goes smoothly.

I don't really recommend or not recommend it... read below why if you wish.\n\nYet another hidden object game... one with seemingly slightly higher production values than some (that's not saying much). Carrying a paranormal documentary series license, it features real people digitized... horribly. The backgrounds are generally well done, the hidden object scenes aren't an eyesore (most of the time). So that's a plus. Some effort was put into the surroundings, some details etc., and it can look really good here & there, but the story that, while it contains an somewhat interesting background, degenerates into nonsense every time in every other dialogue.\n\nVoice acting is... well... ok I guess - hit & miss. Scary? Nah, maybe one "boo" moment when it shouldn't happen and that's it, with some attempts being laughable.\n\nIt packs some meat for the genre, what with 5 hours (305 minutes, including menu time & dunno, watching credits) it took me to finish both the main game and the Collector's Edition mission, and it doesn't exactly turn you away with the story, but there will be groans.\n\nThe puzzles are oversimplified and nothing new to the genre - there's maybe  one that requires you to actually think about what you're doing for a second - and those incapable of getting it (how?!) can just skip it. Go them. In most of them, the only variety you see is graphical. They actually advertise this as "fast-paced" - which basically translates to easy to solve.\n\nAh, dunno, it has big pluses for the genre - most aspects of it aren't half-♥♥♥♥♥ for example (though not all), and you can see actual care put into it here & there, but it's far, faaar from perfect. If you're a lover of the genre (hm) and can grab it on sale/in a bundle, get it. For 10$ normal price, it's a No.\n\nPS. The Collector's Edition episode is extremely short, silly & simplistic.\nPPS.

Of course with them popping up more and more in bundles and in this games case with trading cards its a given I'll be trying them out.  Only played a couple I think and like many games they don't get more than a couple minutes of attention before its AFK for the obligitory 2 hours to get the trading cards.  This one however despite the immediate put off of the main NPC and horrible! voice acting, had something going for it.  Occult games are pretty run of the mill in adventure/hidden object games but the story was somewhat intriguing.  Also the game itself is well designed an I didn't hit any bang your head moments, despite after a certain while their being a skip/hint system which i never needed.  The music is far better than I would expect from a game like this and had a STALKER esque vibe to it at times which was strange.  So yeah the game isn't too difficult, somewhat intriguing, and the voice acting so ridiculously bad its somewhat enjoyable.  I recommend playing it if you have it and if you can grab it for a handful of dollars that would be a good deal.  There was even a bonus episode that takes place after you finish the main game which I thought was a nice touch.

There is another scene where your character falls thru a hole in the floor of the house. Do they offer aid and try and get you out? Nope just a well I know you can make your own way out. Wow thanks for the concern there fellows.\n\nThe thing is there are already games out there that do this exact formula and do it a lot better then this. Examples would be Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden, Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart, The Midnight Mystery games. These games have better puzzles and the stories are a lot more interesting and they tell a good story. Buy these other games first and if you can find this for cheap as I did then pick it up if this kind of game interest you. NOt a terrible game but could be so much better then it is.","May 3, 2014","false","3.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

The graphics are very good but the animations and soundtracks are meh. The story had it's good moments but... In the end it's not really satisfying.

On the one hand it's a nice enough casual point and click/hidden object game with an OK plot (nothing spectacular but OK) and I enjoyed playing it. On the other hand there is a pretty major issue present though: due to a game breaking bug I was forced to restart my experience with the game from scratch (the game's autosave system prevented me from just reverting to an older save). I enjoyed the game, but can I honestly say I would recommend a game I knew had at least one game breaking bug in it? That's what's so tricky with Steam's system.\n\nThe bug in question occurred in the Excavation Pit section of the game which involves using a tool called the EMF reader. There are prior times in the game where the same tool is used and I completed these without issue. However on this one upon what should have been completion of the puzzle nothing happened. Neither does the game's skip feature that you can use if a puzzle is giving you trouble actually work in this case, ending any and all further progress in the game.\n\nI was very tempted to stop and uninstall there as I'm sure you can understand, but fortunately this is the type of game that can be done much faster once you know what you have to do for each scene, so I was quickly able to redo my lost progress and I was intrigued enough by the plot to what to do how it ended. Fortunately the bug did not happen a second time and I was able to complete the game without any further hitches. It is a good game if you enjoy casual titles but given that I only have two options to score this I can't honestly say I'd recommend someone something I knew had a game breaker in it.","October 30, 2014","false","9.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story telling and voice acting are complete write-offs and often the gamer will find themselves pushing through just to get to the next hidden object puzzle.\n\nThere are odd times when you get to use the 'ghost hunting' equipment such as the EMF Meter and Thermal Cam, but only a couple of times each during the longevity of the game. There's also a bonus mission unlocked upon completion of the main story, but personally I couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to complete it. It would've also been a hell of a lot better if the cast members actually played their own rolls in the game, but that may have been too big budget for an indie release.\n\nConsidering that this game was only released in the late quarter of 2013 and I just got it in an Indie Gala bundle that came with six other games for $2.00 USD, that should tell you how popular this title is. It's a tough call for the current price, as the artists did put a lot of attention to detail in the landscapes and puzzles, but the rest of the game is dreary and would see $9.99 USD as an overpriced 'pay for the brand' purchase.\n\nRating: 1.5/5.0","May 5, 2014","false","5.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

P&C adventure games (including here the HOG little cousins) should be mostly about the interesting story and engaging interaction which furthers that story. What we have here is regular effort to make a bog standard HOGame. Regular plot, regular obligatory jump-scares, regular "twists", regular puzzles. I mean how many more 100s of times do we have to fill up the electric generator with fuel to turn the lights on to procede a screen further?!\nI got the game as part of a mystery bundle and since I like the HOG genre and am currently stuck with entry-level laptop, I gave it a try, but otherwise I don't think I'd have patience enough for all it's procedural nonsense. Yet again every door is (in)conveniently locked, every handle is either missing or stuck, every opening mechanism an unconventionally complex and poorly explained puzzle.\nNow I'm not american, so I was mildly aware there existed some mildly popular reality thing about ghosts and have became aware that this was an official tie-in game for an actual show solely from other reviews here on Steam. Since I believe everything paranormal is 99.9999999999999 times just a bling-bling entertainment and most of the phaenomena are just NOT-explained, rather than UN-explainable (and that other minuscule rest no one can possibly claim true or false anyways), I can only comment that character portraits in the game are... strangely drawn, are overtly stiff and the little animations look cheap and not very proffessional. Same goes for voice acting, though, again, I don't have a slightest clue if that are real original actors/TV personalities, or just some look... well.. sound-alikes.\nSimply put, there are far more well made HOG-adventure hybrids. Some even on Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarling/recommended/268810/","tarling","tarling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarling/","372 products in account","I absolutely love Hidden Object games, and this one looks okay - the idea or initial concept was probably good. However I had to abandon the game fairly early in simply because there were just too many things I found simply makes the game too annoying to continue playing [strictly my personal taste - really young players may still enjoy it].\n\nFirst off, the puzzles were very simplistic [kid level challenges], so no mental dexterity really needed. I don't mind simplistic or easier Hidden Object games though, as long as the main game has a good flow.\n\nHowever - Paranormal State is also extremely linear. I know many HO games are as well, but this one was overtly locked into each sequence. You can't explore or chose which puzzles or challenges to do first - you're blatantly guided each step and each click of the way (and must do each task in order - no venturing around screens). Again I'm assuming it's targeted to give very young players [kids] "a spooky game", so I can live with that.\n\nBut here come the game breakers for me [incredibly irritating stuff which reminded me a lot like a really super low budget movie [made entirely on what one credit card would allow, and all your friends acting in it for free type quality].\n\nThe graphics in the game look nice, and I can understand the concept of having characters moving their heads, blinking eyes, and making small animated actions while the dialogue is going on -- but still cut shots would have had more effect [e.g. just a picture of a character looking, and then switching to a picture of the character startled expression].\n\nWhat makes the 3rd party characters really bad is that their expressions and reactions aren't even remotely close to what's happening on the screen, in the dialogue, or even according to "fear" or danger warnings the other characters are somehow supposed to be trying to convey... None of the characters seem to have even partially parted lips to give a sense of dialogue [they all seem to have parsed lips]... and they all look bored to death in their expressions [quite literally] -- it looks like they're reading a magazine while all the "activity and excitement" is going on.\n\nIt's also rather annoying that we're presented with a whole team of paranormal sleuths, yet they play no role in the game whatsoever -- it's always "You go solve it, we'll just wait here doing nothing" [the characters really don't even do anything in the story except pat themselves on the back for the puzzle YOU solved without any info or help from them].\n\nIt's all kind of emphasized by a really badly written script - there are tons of endless unnecessary dialogue from the other characters which serve no purpose (no information, story reveals, plot motivation -- it's almost all "we'll wait here while you go get something" followed by "yay, we can move on... [next room] okay we'll wait here again while you go get something" [repeat]\n\nThe real game killer for me was the voice acting [or rather "welcome to grade skill read in front of the class amateur hour]... I usually don't mind some bad scripts or voice acting, but every line of dialogue I sat through was very much like a student feeling extremely uncomfortable reading out loud, and reciting the words on a page with absolutely no reaction or emotion [i.e. the voice acting doesn't really even meet amateur acting status].\n\nNow, it may not be completely the voice actors' fault either -- there really wasn't much to work with in the scripted dialogue. It seemed like none of the other characters in the story were even given a real purpose for being there...\n\n\nAgain, having played so many HO games, there are bound to be good one, some not so good ones, and a few really bad ones...\n\nI wouldn't classify this one as bad - just exceptionally mediocre at best, and probably meant for kids (so they can have what they would consider a "scary" game). If a kid reads Harry Potter, they would probably find this game way to low level to enjoy... but if the read at the level of Goosebump books, then this might be a good fit for them to have fun playing.\n\nOnce more, the graphics and concept were nice, but the presentation just didn't do it for me.","October 31, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be fair, there are plenty of HOGs out there that are worse than this,  but this one still falls on the wrong side of mediocre.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is that it was clearly crapped out hastily to promote a "reality" show that ran on A&E from 2007 to 2011.  As a result the game frequently requires you to look at static images of the show's core cast -- particularly a guy named Ryan who it nearly deifies -- while listening to them advance the plot through monologues.   And the voice work ranges from tolerable-but-unimpressive to downright awful.\n\nDespite the game's origins in a ghost-hunting reality show, the paranormal reveals itself in more than just some cold spots and EMF spikes in a draughty house with decayed wiring; things move around, key items are supernaturally handed to you, and a couple of ghosts are regularly appearing to provide plot exposition in risible accents.  Spooky atmosphere is well-maintained, if a bit ham-fisted, and there are a few mild jump scares.\n\nThe plot and writing of the main story is a bit weak, but easily overlooked.  The bonus chapter's effort at story is awful, though.  The puzzles are unchallenging, the HO scenes likewise, and the whole thing is rather short.  If you didn't pick this up as part of some bundle, as I did, then you can find something much better than this for your fix of HO gaming.","November 25, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, I gave Paranormal State a fair chance and I don't regret my time spent. The story is ridiculous, the art and animation of the characters makes them look like emotionless zombies which is pretty hilarious when they're saying how afraid they are and they just look deadpan. All these things aren't really dealbreakers for me though and I found that Paranormal State was honestly a pretty engaging game. It's far from a masterpiece but the puzzles are interesting but never super difficult, the setpieces are neat, the writing is decent and the voice acting is pretty great for the most part. All in all, I recommend this game. Wait for a sale or bundle though.\n\n7/10","November 23, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The visual look of everything BUT people is quite good, but the faces of everyone lie solidly in the bottom of the uncanny valley.
