"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyleclam/recommended/2310/","kyleclam","KyleClam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyleclam/","247 products in account","Quake is a masterpiece, plain and simple.\n\nQuake may be one of my favorite games, but I'll try to make this review as unbiased as possible. Created in 1996, Quake was revolutionary at the time. Following after Doom (Both created by the wonderful ID Software), Quake took all of what Doom did right and pushed it into the third dimension. The levels, music, and enemies all go beyond the call of duty and make this game a timeless classic.\n\nQuake is heavily inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, creating a dark and medieval setting. The dark shades of brown, green and bright reds in later levels really play to this note. This is not just to play homage to Lovecraft, but it doubles up as a way to put the player into an uneasy, unfamiliar, and terrifying world. Playing the game in linear order allows you to slowly creep into these unfamiliar waters. The levels are easy to commute, and allow for minor exploration to find secrets and health/ammo packs. When you run into a group of enemies, you rarely feel unprepared. That's not saying that this game is easy, because it'll tear you a new one if you don't watch out. This game isn't about unfairly pairing you with hard enemies; it’s about a gradual learning curve that teaches you to manage ammo, health and enemies.\n\nThe enemies in Quake are also inspired by Lovecraft's novels. Otherworldly beings with a cameo appearance by the “Lord of the Wood” are just a sampler of what you are in store for. Like I touched on in my levels section, the enemies never feel too tough to beat. The first enemies you'll face are dogs and soldiers, gradually building up to Fiends, Shamblers, and Spawns (Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ these guys). You are introduced to new weapons semi-regularly, and are given a good amount of time to find out what to use on the different enemies. An example (and quick tip) are the Zombies. You can mow the Zombies down with your shotgun, but after awhile they will stand back up to fight. Then how do you kill them? When the level first starts you are given a grenade launcher. The first enemies you see? Zombies. With this new weapon already ready to fire, you unload on the group to find that you gib (kill) the zombies for good. From that point on you know how to dispose of them, and that you shouldn't waste your grenades on enemies other than zombies (with an exception for tougher enemies).\n\nWith this dark fantasy world coming together with the level design and enemies, there's one last piece missing. Music. The music in Quake was composed by Nine-Inch-Nails. I'm not sure that I can say much else than that. The music fits the game perfectly with eerie, yet appropriate tracks. Take a look at the nail gun ammo boxes for a subtle nod.\n\nNobody is perfect, and sadly this port isn't an exception to that rule. The Steam version of Quake comes without the classic Nine-Inch-Nails soundtrack, and the mouse is locked horizontally. This is quickly fixed however by downloading this fix from the community page - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113166739\n\nAll in all, Quake is worth the $10 price tag normally, but is an absolute steal during sales, dropping to around $5. The amazing level design, challenging enemies, and great music all come together to create one of video game histories greatest. Never think that you are finished playing Quake. While the main story may have been finished, the lively modding community is doing its job to keep Quake alive. Brand new stories, fun game modes (Team Fortress 2 has roots set in Quake), and many more changes make this game that keeps on giving. I cannot recommend this game more, you'll have to try it for yourself.","July 9, 2014","true","31.7"," 118 of 123 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","118","123","0","0"

You don't get this sort of frenzied action and complex level design anymore, and it's wonderfully dark and gloomy.\n\nThe soundtrack, made by Nine Inch Nails in the Downward Spiral era, is absolutely fantastic, one of the best soundtracks of all time, incredibly dark and eerie. The graphics look outdated to say the least, but that CD soundtrack didn't age a day, quite the contrary. Alone, the game's darkness can't really impress anymore, but with the soundtrack it really comes to life.\n\nAnd there's the problem. This Steam version comes without the soundtrack. It doesn't even have any. Selling Quake without its epic soundtrack is ridiculous, because it's such an important part of it. I haven't seen any well visible warning on the store page that informs you about this, so it's borderline fraud.\n\nThere seem to be workarounds if you are willing to download it from the internet (probably illegal).

Most popular game engine of its time. If you don't have this already, what are you waiting for?! For current generation play, I recommend one of the common source ports, such as Ultimate Quake (DarkPlaces+).\n\nIn-depth review, not for the faint of heart: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here":\n\n1996. DooM had introduced "Deathmatch" to the popular lexicon three years earlier. id Software managed to capitalize on the addictive nature of online multiplay, while advancing the technical limits of FPS gaming. What followed was the most popular game engine of its time, and it revolutionized online multiplay. Engine novelties included polygonal models, fully 3D environments, easy tools for Game Modding and hardware 3D acceleration. Quake may single handedly be the game that made a cutting-edge graphics card an essential component for the modern PC gamer. Unique gameplay features included bunny hopping and rocket-jumping. Game emphasis was on the online, multiplayer experience, utilizing a client-server model rather than peer to peer, the preeminent model of the time. This model allowed players to create and mantain a session, while additional players would be able to join or leave at any time, without disrupting the game.\n\nStory:\n\nBAHAHAHAHAHAH!! Story?! Pffffftt. Don't let it get in the way of an epic, legendary, awesome FPS game. Beat the 4 episodes and collect the rune at the end, solve environmental puzzles, kill everything with a pulse...or rather, that moves! 'Nuff Said. There is something resembling a story that was thrown in to provide the semblance of a gaming thread.\n\nGameplay:\n\nFast paced, bunny hopping, rocket jumpin' non-stop, edge of your seat, deathmatchin' action. Gameplay intuitive enough to allow a beginner to jump in and start fraggin', yet, complex enough to allow a bustlin' pro scene to develop, and spawn a successful franchise. Responsive controls allow you to float through inspired levels and maneuver your character, even when airborne! Weapon selection established the standard with a good variety of now conventional, classic weapons; including the revered Shotgun, the seminal Rocket Launcher and the mighty Lighting Gun. Weapon balance and choice, depending on level design and range of combat, had never been this intricate.\n\nDesign:\n\nIconic palette hard on black/browns with excellent use of lighting and shadows for emphasis and scares. Weapon design is a bit blocky, by today's standards, but sits nicely with the dark, medieval theme. Enemy/monster designs are inventive, with great variety, and a multitude of baddies that attack from above, at ground level and in the water. At the time, probably the only other big title that offered hazards with such a degree of freedom of movement was "Descent."  Enemies appear as something out of a medieval demonic nightmare with a hodgepodge of humanoid, hellish Lovecraftian creatures coming at you and wielding a good array of weapons and attacks. The color palette and enemy design allows for baddies to pop out of dark corners and portions of the level, setting up multiple scares, providing a racemic mixture of action and horror that is hard to match.\n\nThe level design, with its gothic architecture and variety of environmental puzzles and hazards, resulted in classic levels that would eventually be ported to multiple other engines and games.\n\nSound:\n\nImmaculate, crisp environmental, creature, character and weapon sound effects that were mostly concocted/mixed in-house by the talented id crew utilizing innovative techniques and processing. Trent Reznor/NIN soundtrack provides a chilling backdrop with industrial, ambiental brilliance that peppers the game with a pumping, blood curling soundtrack, which seamlessly potentiates the dark visuals and sound effects.\n\nReplayability:\n\nThe online multiplayer experience is at the core of Quake. It would offer more options than any other FPS at the time and, out of the box, would allow for Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Cooperative Play. It would also allow for Time and/or Frag limits. After some time, popular free modifications included Team Fortress and Capture the Flag modes. The transition to a Client:Server model would permit a server to run continuously and for players to drop in and pop out of the game, without interrupting it. This dramatically improved the chances of finding a working game. Moreover, whereas most multiplayer experiences at the time emphasized 1:1 or games of up to 8 players, Quake allowed up to 16 simultaneous players in its original iteration; resulting in unprecedented chaos and murderous destruction.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nQuake is a legendary, classic game from FPS greats, id Software (id Tech 2). The Quake engine fueled the upcoming games for a generation and set the blueprint for FPS and online gaming. Dark atmosphere with ghoulish, sadistic enemy design set in a medieval, gothic world full of environmental dangers and light puzzles. Online experience is the core of the game, and would shape the FPS landscape for the foreseeable future. If you enjoy FPS, horror, inventive level design, Lovecraftian creatures, NIN/Trent Reznor or are just interested in gaming history, you cannot go wrong with this game.","February 25, 2015","true","1.7"," 104 of 116 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","104","116","12","14"

Quake was, and in my opinion, still is a benchmark of what a  good  absolutely amazing game should be. And that benchmark doesn't only aply to the FPS genre, but all games.\n\nWhen this game first came out, there was a demo for it. (That's a sample of a game that lets you try it out for free to know if you like it). Only quake didn't do what most games do now. Firstly, It HAD a demo, and it was non-restrictive. No time limit, nothing. You didn't get the whole game of cource, but you got ONE QUARTER of it! That's better than the one dinky level you get to play with in modern game demos. Or the $4.99 you have to pay for a...sports game demo. *Cough* EA *Cough*.\n\nIts this kind of commitment to giving the customer a great experience that contributes to Quake's general awesome factor.\n\nThis game came out before Triple A companies were pandering to people with... How should I put it... Less than adequate skills to beat a level. If you chose a hard difficulty, the game let you know, by PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE if you were inept enough to shoot yourself in the face with a rocket, or give a Shambler a bear hug. Quake asks the question "What's regenerative health? You messed up and had yourself a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripped by a demon? Tough luck bud, you're gonna play though the next two minutes with ONE helth!" This game made you feel like you actually acomplished something if you beat it on the harder difficulties. If you played through on easy, yah you beat it, but you can't look someone in the eye and say "I beat quake". You have to beat it on HARD...or NIGHTMARE. In fact, only the worthy Quakers could beat the game on nightmare mode because they hid it. That's right. They didn't want people smashing their computer screens because they thought they were home free with 49/50 kills, only to be mucked by a fiend.\n\nThere was more to this game, and more though put into it in 1996 than there is in a lot of big budget games of today. The levels weren't linear and you weren't forced to do anything, because that's stupid...STUPID!. I lookin' at you Call of Duty. All Quake did was say "Hey. You see that level there? There's an exit somewhere in there. If you find it, you beat the level." Then Quake patted you on the head, and let yo go on your merry way. There was no loud messages says "PICK UP THE GUNS AND SHOOT THAT ONE SPECIFIC GUY!". You could run though the levels dodging all the enemies and picking literally nothing up, although I speak from experience when I say that does NOT work on harder difficulty levels.\n\nQuake has a lot of replay value. Mostly because unless you go down the scrub road and watch a walk through so you can brag "I got 100% completion on Quake on my frist play though!", then you're gonna miss stuff, such as secrets. Hell, sometimes even I forget to walk through that one window that looks slightly different than all the rest. But when you DO get all secrets and all kills on all four episodes (yes there are four), each of which contains 7 levels (not including the SECRET FREAKIN LEVELS), then you have won not only Quake, but life itself. Quake doesn't have achievements because it doesn't need them, because when you tell osmeone you got 100% on Quake on NIGHTMARE mode, they believe you. Because one does not simply lie about gett 100% on nightmare mode on Quake. Besides, if you want to play Quake for achievements, you're playin' it for the wrong reason.\n\nLet's quickly talk about the story of Quake. There's not really a story to Quake, aside from a dinky little .txt file. That's because Quake IS the story. If somebody asks me what the story line of 'That old ♥♥♥ game' I'm playing is, I yell in a very peculiar voice "QUAKE. That's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story!"\n\nThe enemies in Quake are amazing. They show no mercy. They don't have some stupid weak spot for you to shoot while they stand still for 10 seconds. Oh no. If you're low on ammo, and you see a Shambler, you don't simply try and kill it. You have two choises. Run, fast, in as straight a line as possible to ammo, and to health because you had half of it zapped straigh out of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or you climb to the tallest tower that's convenient, jump off, and restart the level, this time not being so dumb as to forget to pick up that pack of ammo. If you're looking for epic climactic (hehe, that's a double entendre) boss fights, then you might be disappointed with Quake. There's two of them if you really want to call them that, but again, if you're playing Quake for boss fights, you're playing it wrong. Quake is about fighting through hoards of ememies that on their own may not put up a huge fight (although most of them could single handedly rip off your face while reading shakespear), when you have 10 grenades flying at your face at the same time as your testies are being gnawed off by demond fishies, you health goes from 100 to squichy mush pile status real fast.\n\nSound design is something that Triple A companies like to talk about a lot, but then they often end up goofing it up, providing me with a symphony of mushy repeating sounds. Quake isn't like that. The ambiant noise is actually scary sometimes. Not spooky... Scary. They sound track is bang on. People often ♥♥♥♥♥ that the Steam version's sound track doesn't work. It doesn't work 'right out of the box' so to speak, but give the game a break. Its running on an operating system SIX..count 'em...SIX generations newer than it was designed to do. That game was made in '96 and its 2016. The ♥♥♥♥in' game's onlder than I am, and I can't play that sound track either. But I digress. The sound track works fine with a few little tweaks, and its amazing.\n\nMultiplayer is also something that is, or rather I should say 'should' be important today. It was important for Quake though. Over the years, there have been many MANY Quake tournaments. And they're still going on. There were no official dedicated quake servers, but there are dozens that you can connect to that have been running since '96. Have you got ANY idea how amazing it is that there are still multiplayer servers with people on them? Codemasters shut down all their Race Driver Grid servers two years ago for whatever new game they were releasing at the time, which nobody played online anyway. The Quake community does it RIGHT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.\n\nIn 1996 people loved to mod Quake. Today, there is still a huge modding community (where's our gaddamn steamworks!?). You can play Quake in a client that can make it look comparable to some modern games (and no I'm not talking Minecraft or Clash of Clans graphics either. Proper graphics from today). And your not going to have some dickweed company try and ban you for enhancing graphics. Also, this game is DRM free, because DRM wasn't a thing in 1996, and thank ♥♥♥♥ that Steam or ID didn't try to empose some form of BS DRM on the Steam version of Quake. When I buy a game, and give somebody my money for their game, I don't wana have them check in on me every half our to see if I'm doing 'illegal ♥♥♥♥' with my game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT! *Clears throat* Anywho, you can get countless mods and maps (some with stories too!) from a bunch of different websites over this magical thing called the internet. And the game wasn't built to reject mods because they didn't want you to 'tamper' with their baby...*Cough* Rockstar *Cough*\n\nIn conclusion, this game is WAY beyond amazing. No joke, I give this game 10/10. This may be the best game ever made.\n\nRemember this. Whether or not you know it or not, you love Quake. And Quake loves you... In a rip you face of and make you restart the level because this game is not for the weak of heart and doesn't have stupid annoying auto save and you forgot to save your progress kind of way.","January 7","true","0.7"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","94","84","89","28","4"

The game most often given the title of the original first person shooter is Wolfenstein 3D, released in May of 1992 by id Software. This FPS is extremely primitive by today's standards, consisting of mostly barren environments with many repetitive sprites, but it left a strong impression on the gaming world as being an innovative and exciting game that made you feel like you were a soldier directly killing Nazis. Only eighteen months later, in December of 1993, id Software would revolutionize the gaming world with the quintessential DOOM, a much more detailed, aggressive, and yet comedic game than id's previous game. DOOM quickly became a beloved classic and was one of the most important, if not THE most important FPS of the 90s because of its refined controls, weapon variety, unique environments, hellish setting, memorable music, comedic value, and bright, cartoonish, characteristic and instantly recognizable art style. DOOM may have been gorier and superficially darker than W3D, but the game itself was quite bright and retained a simplistic manner that was palettable to audiences worldwide. Less than a year later, id Software released DOOM 2: Hell on Earth, a stylistically very similar game to its initial DOOM release, albeit with some graphical enhancements. The setting and weapons were similar and the game maintained its predecessor's cartoonish look and feel. There weren't many noticeable differences between the original game and its sequel, save for much better multiplayer and refinements to the original game.\n\nThen, in June 1996, id Software released Quake. This game changed nearly everything from the DOOM playstyle. The gameplay was faster. Enemies were more nightmarish and unpredictable. The game used a 3D engine so the game actually gave the player a sense of depth and weight. The setting was dark, foreboding, and more in line with horror. The light/darkness was closer to depicting reality than a cartoon. Quake marked a definitive split from earlier ventures into the FPS genre by giving the player a sense of fear, urgency, and panic. Dark, unrelenting, and frightening for the time, this game took everything comedic from the DOOM franchise (since the series was goofy, silly, and didn't take itself that seriously) and reversed it. It added an actual atmosphere and made a tonal shift from light-hearted goofiness to the grittiness of a biting underworld.\n\nAs with DOOM and W3D, the goal of Quake is usually to find a key to open up a passage to progress in order to find another key to open up a new area to find yet another key. Yet the enemy placement, labyrinthine level design, and brutal gameplay keeps this seemingly repetitive task from becoming stale. Every section is different and you'll often have the challenge of simply figuring out where to go, what to do, and how to deal with the enemies you're faced with without dying. Sure, DOOM presented some challenges but the enemies always stood out from the environment and had simple-to-memorize patterns, and you generally had enough space to strafe to avoid enemy projectiles. Quake changed this by making the environments more confined (or feel more confined), the level design less straightforward, and enemies don't stand out as much and behave somewhat unpredictably or in ways that can be frustrating to counter. Quake is a fantastic model for how games SHOULD be made: challenging, maintaining a consistent and clear tone, requiring players to think, and never being unfair.\n\nAfter Quake, id Software could never again recapture the intensity or ferocity of this gem. Quake II (1997) was, to me, a huge slap in the face, as it replaced the dark and serious tone of Quake with a silly, cartoonish, and completely out of place space marine story. In fact, the game itself was conceived as an entirely unrelated game, but because of the success of Quake, id decided to just make it a part of the series. To be honest, I never played Quake III until recently but since it was multiplayer-driven, I don't really include it as part of the series (if you want my opinion it just seems like a poor man's version of Unreal Tournament). Quake 4 was absolute trash and DOOM 3 was a major disappointment. I haven't tried id's most recent game, Rage, but I'm told it's incredibly buggy and just overall unpolished and derivative. It just goes to show not only that Quake was id Software's last great game, but that they truly lost something in their image of what their games should be like, instead going for bigger guns and more explosions and scripted events instead of heart-pounding dread and fast and furious gameplay.\n\nThis game contains something that id could never again recapture. Quake for me will always be about pure aggression, pure violence, pure intensity, and in its essence is the pure FPS. It may feel somewhat clunky nowadays (you will need to change things around in the settings if you've played any FPS's in the last 15 years), and the enemies aren't the most detailed (okay, they're downright ugly by today's standards) but in practice you will see that it is one of the most refined games, fusing fast and unforgiving gameplay with a dark and chilling atmosphere. In my personal list of top FPS games, it ranks at number 4 behind (1) Aliens versus Predator 99/Gold Edition, (2) Half-Life, and (3) Unreal Tournament.\n\nThe best word to me that sums up Quake is intense. It is a fantastic game that, while perhaps not the most innovative game of the 90s, is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the most important.

The controls are simple, move, strafe, shoot, jump and change weapons. It is fast paced and you can strafe avoid most everything, so if you get hit, its your own fault. Because this is such a fast paced game, gone is the use button, instead you'll walk up to a button or a door and automatically interact with it.\n\nAs a shooter, Quake features a lot of guns such as double barreled shotguns, various versions of nail guns (machine guns), grenade and rocket launchers. The weapons feel nice and have great impact, everything from making an enemy fall backward to gib explosions everywhere! There are no throwable grenades or alt fire, but the weapons feel so good to use you won't need them.\n\nYou'll need the diverse array of weapons to take on an army of enemies in every level. Everything from standard soldiers and attack dogs to grenade launching chainsaw wielders and electric shocking giant yetis. There is a diverse array of enemies, that always keeps ramping up the challenge and tactics you'll need to kill them. The enemies will fight against one another, which is fun to see, but there aren't factions that you'll see intentionally compete against each other, but Quake still boils down to you vs everything else.\n\nThe levels are expertly designed, but can be overly brown, but I guess a game named Quake makes me think inner earth and inner earth makes me think brown. Each level will have you going up, down, forward, opening doors, finding keys, falling in traps, jumping over lava, finding secrets, swimming through ugly water, dodging enemies and murdering much more. It is not straight forward, but you won't get lost, because it is well designed. There are four episodes with 8 or so levels each. Not just that, but because this game is so old and was so wildly popular, it has a million mods and levels.\n\nFor new players, there is no regenerating health, but health and ammo are abundant, this is an action game. Kill an enemy, get rewarded with ammo. There is also armor that will let you take more damage.\n\nThe music was performed or designed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and feels like a touch of ambiance amongst scratch guitars. The nail gun ammo also has NIN logos.\n\nThe Steam version of Quake offers QuakeWorld compatibility, but the big problem with that is QuakeWorld uses GameSpy servers, which were shut down. There are no achievements, but it is still a classic game that holds up today as one of the greatest old-school first person shooters.\n\nIn all this is a fantastic game that uses a game engine that spawned dozens of other engines.","August 25, 2014","true","4.6"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","68","72","0","0"

The Original Quake was THE FIRST TRUE 3D First Person Shooter ever made. And it did (then as well as now, if anyone could see past then next CoD) phenominally.\n32 is the magic number when it comes to great FPS' , as all 32 levels (and 6 underplayed 'Deathmatch' levels) were intense and enjoyable from start to finish.\n\n\nThe Original Quake may as well have been a DOOM spin-off during it's initial release, but copying a great formula isn't always a bad thing, IF you know where to go with it. Quake knew EXACTLY what it was doing, and IMPROVED upon all of DOOM's previous work. Taking DOOM 2's 32 level formula, the ability to look up and down (It was REVOLUTIONARY I TELL YOU!!!!!!!), intense gore (which, back then made the game "M for Mature" but now, with graphical updates, the gore has been downgraded too "T for Teen"), fast-paced (CoD has NOTHING on this) multiplayer, and over the top violence (A.K.A. The AXE OF EXPLOSIONS, seriously... no joke... go smash up a corpse with this thing...), that made it a 'Must have' for EVERY gamer that owned Windows 95.\n\nNOTICE (FOR CLARIFICATION ONLY, You can skip this if you want):Now, I must clarify one thing, I didn't grow up on DOOM or DOOM II or even Quake, BUT I believe Wolfenstein, Spear of Destiny, DOOM, DOOM II, Quake, and all of the other great 90's First Person Shooters are what we should all take a page from when making the next CoD. SERIOUSLY my first First Person Shooter was CALL OF DUTY 4 for God's sake! When I played DOOM for the first time I was... how shall I say this....MIND BLOWN, FLOORED, & BLOWN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR! SERIOUSLY! I play CoD 4 now and I'll ALWAYS go back to DOOM & DOOM II before the day's up.\n\nThe Original Quake is, in my opinion, better than Quake 2 & 4 (Which are basically part of a 'mini-trilogy' I call\n"The Quake Wars"), Quake 1 is entirely seperate from the rest of the series. It is closer to a fully 3D DOOM game more than Quake's 2, 4, and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (A.K.A The Quake Wars Trilogy)  Quake is the name of the final Boss in this game, though (Can this really be a spoiler? I mean, all I said was the name, right?) not a boss in The Quake Wars Trilogy, has no mention of even the name "Quake" EXCEPT when the Intro of Enemy Territory: QW has a slip-gate (pretty much a space teleporter) shaped like the logo summon invading ships.\n\nNOW, all mentions of other games aside.... Quake is an addicting, fast paced, rocket jumping (yes, we has those), barrel O' fun. In the words of a wiseman ~ "In my day, we rocket jumped to school, both ways." - Wise guy, 20XX (because I don't remember his name or the year). You would be a FOOL to pass this game up, give it a try, there's NOTHING to lose, and everything to GAIN!\n\nP.S. It is ALMOST REQUIRED to have this installed onto the game to make run properly on modern PC's:\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923\n(The ULTIMATE Quake Patch IS LITTERALLY the 'Best Thing Since Rocket Jumps')","October 25, 2014","true","12.7"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","47","53","2","3"

I would also argue that the game still holds up today.\n\nWhat I am going to draw attention to is the simple fact that the version on sale on Steam does not have its soundtrack.  This is quite unnacceptable.  While you can get it back through mods the fact that this is necessary is an horrendous oversight that plainly should not be tolerated.\n\nArguably the soundtrack is a major draw if not the major draw to this game.  Great ambient work by Trent Reznor that sets the mood  as a perfect compliment for the level design and art design.  Without it, much of the atmosphere is lost, and much of what made it a special complete experience is lost.  There simply is no excuse for leaving this out.\n\nHowever, as I said, it is a fine game.  Even with that in mind, simply put we should demand better treatment for our classics than what we have on display here.","November 26, 2013","false","17.6"," 141 of 208 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","141","208","4","1"

DOOM was considered a milestone in the history of gayming and many many people called it the grandfather of shooters (Because Wolfenstein sucks). It introduced new gameplay mechanics, which were unheard of at the time and therefore revolutionary. It stimulated many gamers to become a part of the newly founded PC Master Race, which was part of the plan. Back in the days, consoles ruled the gaming world.\n\nThen, out of sudden, 3 devils appeared. John Carmack, John Romero and Tom Hall. They became very jealous demons, because of the great reception of Back to the Future and Friday the 13th, both for the NES. They saw the potential of video games and the cash, they could bring you, so they decided to create Commander Keen, which should have topped even the best of the best games. This phenomenon caused multiple horrible events. Commander Keen, a Jump 'n' Run, was a great technical achievement, because of it's smooth-scrolling graphics game engine, specifically made by John Carmack. It actually managed to show that not only platform games, but video games in general could work on the PC. Back in the days, raster graphics were pretty hard to emulate, but thanks to his genius engine, it managed to keep the transfer of graphics from the main memory to the graphic card as low as possible, because the memory of graphic cards were pretty bad. Their plan for the perfect game was nearly fulfilled.\n\nThey published it on the operating system, MS-DOS. Because it was Microsoft's first operating system, it had too much of Bill Gate's power to just support the game, which was John Carmack's black magic. Thus, the simulated world of Commander Keen spawned several Vorticons for a brief moment, who rampaged through the epicenter at the town Rascht. This caused the Manjil-Rudbar earthquake. This earthquake killed almost the entire population of console gamers (Their consoles too!), so the remaining ones were forced to play Commander Keen, when it became more popular because of this disaster.\n\nThis event didn't get unnoticed by Bill Gates. He felt how his power, mixed with the game engine/black magic, caused the earthquake. However, Apogee Software, which published the game, confirmed his theory. He tried to blackmail them, because he knew what they had done and he also wanted the lucre of this technological monster, which they created. They had no choice, so they made the deal.\n\nTheir next choice was to create the first Ego-Shooter ever made, Wolfenstein 3D. It was their next technical achievement. Finally enabling three-dimensionality with 2D Sprites.\nHowever, their goal was not only to create money, but to secure it. Only Bill Gates, Id Software or also called "the three demons" and Apogee Software knew of this horrible method. Bill Gates was able to control or cooperate with the three, since they were just as evil as him, but he feared that Apogee would someday gain enough money with this pact in order to beat all of them and bring back balance to the console games with the greatest console game of all time, which was part of a ♥♥♥♥ing prophecy, as always. So, Bill Gates and the two Johns decided to sacrifice Tom Hall in order to manipulate this path of the prophecy.\n\nIn 1992, after Wolfenstein 3D was released, it caused, once again, an earthquake, which killed three people in California (Which is why Apogee didn't notice it). One of them was Tom Hall. Now, his fellow partners resurrected him as a new fallen angel with no knowledge of his past life. They sent him to Apogee, so they would all get amnesia from him and forget about their work with Bill Gates and Id Software. They then became 3D Realms and created Duke Nukem 3D. Later, they created Duke Nukem: Forever, which was supposed to be the greatest console game of all time, but became corrupted (Kinda like the Anakin Skywalker of video games). The hope for the console age was already demolished at this point, but the 2D Sprites from Duke Nukem: 3D, which were dark and corrupted sources, were implemented in CoD. http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ubpKUvd8NXM/0.jpg This 2D Sprite fire manipulated all the other developers in the world to create ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD clones. Only Indie Developers (because they had low power) and Valve (because Gabe Newell worked at Microsoft) were spared.\n\nThen they started to work on Doom, which should have perfected everything from Wolfenstein 3D, because they wanted to make as much money as possible, without spending too much money on creating something new.\nDoom was, as previously mentioned in the beginning, a sucess (Even though Wikipedia says that Tom Hall was one of the Designers, it was just an actor, who played him). Since Doom's Id tech 1 engine was just an improved version of the Wolfenstein one, it was a bit too much for the same platform/operating system they used before, MS-DOS (Now Win95). But instead of causing yet another earthquake, it just corrupted the new publishers, mainly Bethesda and ESPECIALLY Activision to spread the destruction to console games even further in the future (They basically became Bill Gate's Nazguls).\nThe problem for Bill Gates was that the black magic, which the 2 John-Demons used for the previous 3 games, confused too much of his own power. The first real evidence for this was when he promoted Doom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN0K58EfJSg\nI mean, he even wears a coat! Anyway, he realized that he could control the black magic, which John Carmack put into his game engines, before getting trumped by it (Microsoft was the second most installed software...second to Doom). The only problem was John Romero, who was pretty much the heart of Id Software, while Carmack was the brain...and their pawns were the muscles.  He could control the brain, and therefore it's muscles, but not the heart. So the best choice was to let them create yet another game, sadistically called Quake, for all the previous earthquakes, but most importantly, for the upcoming one. He knew that the new Quake Engine would be so extremly powerful that even months before it's release, an earthquake would emerge. He guided it's direction to Lijiang, birthplace of John Romero (I mean, he does kinda look asian: http://puu.sh/hPSMf/0c198d7239.jpg)\nThis attack weakened Romero so much that he went batshit insane and left Id Software, because of certain "disagreements". He later co-founded with Tom Hall Ion Storm and created one of the worst known games: Daikatana. This harmed the image of the PC-Gaming scene, but was soon balanced out by a hero called Warren Spector, who made Deus Ex, the best game ever made.\n\nLet's go back to the past. After Quake was finally released, Bill Gates still became corrupted, even though he had only John Carmack to control. The problem was that Doom was already a little bit too much for MS-DOS and the quake engine, with it's polygonal models and full 3D level design, a fortiori. Bill Gates knew the risk, when creating a new game with a new game engine from Carmack, but he didn't expect it to slip that much away from his hands and it was still better than creating a new game with Romero, which would have caused more horrible things. (Id Software and it's two leaders were too much of a threat to just say:"♥♥♥♥ it! I won't let you create another game!", because video games ruled all over the world, which is also why TV tries to bring back it's reputation with blaming video games for rampages.)\n\nBill Gates became completely the opposite of his past self, creating the Xbox and supporting not only Bungie or the Xbox, but the entire console age with Halo. So, at the end, the prophecy went true. The console age would return, it just wasn't directly Apogee, who caused it with their "best console game ever"\n\nOh, by the way, Quake is great.","May 16, 2015","true","11.7"," 76 of 105 people (72%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","72","76","105","59","3"

On a typical trip to best buy in 1997, at the time, I grew up with macintosh than windows, we were looking for a new Mac game to buy and play, I discovered Quake, and looking through the back cover of the box, I felt scared of the screenshots in it. When I played it, I loved it, even the clever thing one time when I put the Warcraft II CD in, it would play Warcraft music!\n\nThe game's final boss, monsters, and art style is primarily based the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, or better known as H.P. Lovecraft. And no, Cthulu isn't there, Shub-Nigath is there. Same gameplay as the other Quakes I mentioned were fun, fast-pace, and addicting.\n\nFor the story, you are Ranger, a soldier who has investigate the incidents happened with a monster known as "Quake" (AKA Shub-Nigath). You are there to kill Vores that shoots energy that follows you, Powerful Death Knights, the tough to kill Shamblers, Zombies only killed by Explosives, Possessed Soldiers and Rottweilers, And the apprentience Knights.\n\nYeah, even Quake 1 has enemy variety. It also has some iconic weapons, like the rocket launcher featured in Team Fortress 2 (AKA The Original) and Lightning gun, powerful yet consumes ammo fast! Aside from that, there is the Nailguns inspired by the band Nine Inch Nails. Yes! Trent Reznor, as a DOOM Fan, along with Nine Inch Nails, did the music and sounds for Quake.\n\nTotally get this game that revolutionizes the 3D world of gaming.\n\nP.S. I can't spell Shub's name right due to the censorship in steam reviewing, blame Valve, not me.","September 23, 2014","true","11.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","18","20","4","0"

Feeding upon the virtues and vision of Doom and Doom II, it reaches even farther confines of first-person gameplay, something it excels at, even if  compared to games of the same genre from years later. It is outstanding how well this behemoth of 1990s shooters has aged, since its frantic and well-balanced action gives way to countless reruns should the player wish to have some more of the Quake elixir. That could be explained by its advanced mechanics - quick strafing, jumping, recoil, plurality of enemies and plurality of ways to face them, among other gameplay qualities.\n\nIt could also be explained by its unparalleled level design, which may very well be the game's utmost asset. Here, names such as Tim Willits, John Romero, and American McGee spring to mind. Throughout Quake's four episodes, the player is challenged with labyrinthine keeps, gloomy catacombs, unforgettable halls... all of them filled with key areas that quickly swarm with just enough creatures to keep the protagonist busy and trigger-happy at all times. The bridges, narrow corridors, staircases, secret passages, underwater ruins, all respond to the player's arrival and can be revisited in punctual moments during the progression of the stage. Not to mention that each level has its own mechanisms of completion, often related to the acquisition of keys that open gates that give way to advanced rooms in the map. Never will a room, corridor, or any piece of game space feel redundant or undistinguished, as the game will give the player a purpose and leverage to keep progressing through the areas, using each level's singular rationale. Play maps like The Crypt of Decay (E2M3), The Vaults of Zin (E3M2), or The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), and have a wee glance at how memorable level design is here. Also multiplayer, still in its baby steps back then, provided great fun with maps like The Dark Zone (DM6). It is no Tokay's Tower, but it offers satisfactory deathmatch action.\n\nThis Steam version comes with four different applications that will behave distinctly depending on the system being used (two of them dedicated to QuakeWorld). Some resolution and colour issues hinder the experience more often than not, which is why the player should make sure to search for optimisation mods and patches online, such as the extremely efficient Ultimate Quake Patch v1.11, which works in perfect unison with the GLQuake application.\n\nI find it nearly impossible not to value the game's momentous contributions to an almost perennial genre. It is unique in its techno-Gothic aesthetics and its veer towards an all-Lovecraftian story - with references spanning even post-Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos bestiaries, such as the Chthonians - while staying simplistic and not bothering the player with plotline complexities, which is understandable, considering the forthrightness of old-time shooters when it comes to writing. It is heart-warming to notice that almost twenty years have not stained the delight of mouse-and-keyboard frenzy that Quake inspires.","February 2","true","11.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","1"

The original QUAKE is required reading for fans of the shooter genre. I won't make comparisons between this masterpiece and modern shooters. QUAKE shines the most with its fast, tough-as-nails gameplay. The enemies are scary and merciless, not to mention pretty powerful. BUT your character has all the tools they need to blow them away. There's no excuse for failure besides the gamer's own lack of skill and nerves. Thus QUAKE forces the player to become a stone cold Cthulu @$$-kicking motherf*r and when you finally waste the final boss, the feeling of accomplishment is something I rarely feel in other FPS games.\n\nI highly recommend the Ultimate Quake Patch available in the QUAKE Steam Guides.

I cannot remember their names for the life of me, but my favorite is what I like to call Electro-Yeti. The action is similar to Doom, but slightly slower paced.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2310/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Quake is a single-player and multiplayer FPS developed by id software and released 1996. It got quite infamous and is recognised today as classic. It was one of the first FPS to fully use polygons to create game enviroment and established multiplayer over Internet on PC.\n\nSo, how Steam was handled? It's pretty straight copy-paste. Copy-paste of game folder. Not of game's CD. And that means that music is not just not working, but it's not even included to begin with! You will have to find somewhere soundtrack or music files or CD to get it back. And if mounting CD will not work for you, then I would recommend getting music files and _inmm software to fix it. And even then it looped too early. Soundtrack is quite important in this game, even though I have a bad feeling that most remember this Quake without it.\n\nNow, when you launch the game you will be given the choice between running Quake or Quakeworld. You also will have to choose between Software and OpenGL versions of each.\nQuake, also known as WinQuake, is actually a Windows-compilated version of Quake. There wasn't much difference. It's for both Single-player and multiplayer.\nQuakeWorld is stricly competive multiplayer. This client was released some time after Quake and was intented to make it more playable on low-speed Internet modems back then. Different way of handling server-client relations.\nSoftware is original Quake rendering. Pixelated, gritty and dark. Lo-fi. I recommend playing game in this mode on low resolution, like in DOS release, it captures Quake feel better than most other fans Source Port. Or OpenGl.\nOpenGL mode was added some time after game's release and made use of new-by-then hardware 3D accelration. And well, it's not pretty. First, it lacks some features when it comes to lighting. There is no such thing is "brighter than grey" and there are no special textures that are always full-bright. And then the main point of this mode if to make game look more high-resolution. By making every texture look muddy and uglier, actually. I mean, you can like such thing only if you really hate pixels.\n\nAnd last thing, once you start playing, write "+mlook" command in console, that you can open with "`" keyboard key. This will enable mouselook. Why it's not part of game's options I don't know, especially seeing how demos make use of mouse in such way.\n\nPlot of single-player is once again simple: There is unknown enemy that was given codename "Quake", who teleports it's army through slipgate. And now that your base was overrun, you have to make use of slipgate to travel to other otherwordly dimension, find out who "Quake" actually is through intermission text and then kick it's butt in most gimmicky way. And then watch the oh so epic bright ending in form text where you are told "id software salutes you".\nThat pretty much means that you got 4 episodes to choose from beggining, you lose equpment in beggining of each one, the first level of each episode is base themed and actually has unique enemies and then you are off to medieval-like setting.\n\nAnd yes, when it comes to single-player, one of the best things Quake got to offer was atmosphere. Gritty. Dark. Well, ugly brown at times. you fight some kind of monsters in their low polygonal details. You get weapons like nailgun. It just has a bit of lovecraftian inspiration to it. There are even traps placed here and there. Bloody bloody traps. Soundtrack, while small, contributes a lot to it. And then there are some maps in Episode 4 which play strong on lights blinking or shadows being pitch dark, all in small rooms. Quake is at it's best in such levels. I am pretty sure that people who thought that Doom was scary back then were blown by Quake.\n\nAnd when you look at more gameplay side of it, well, on theory it should be like Doom but worse. It's slower. Physics are slightly worse, you stop completely upon encountering walls. There is less variety in weapons, even though they introduces grenade launcher, yet some weapons are just direct upgrades to others. Like, Super Shotgun isn't even good at close range, not as much as Super Nailgun. Just something when you run out of ammo on other weapons. There aren't as many enemies, nor as much of variety. You can say that half of Quake gameplay is shooting two rockets at the Ogre, who has grenade launcher and chainsaw. Or shooting 4 times with Super Shotgun at them. And it's too grey at times.\n\nBut somehow game pulls through and becomes quite fun. Even if there are less enemies on the levels, it got quite a nice combat to it. And for a game that is supposed to be rushed, level design is great. It got verticality, it is mazey but not too complex, it just has floors on top of each other, fully embracing the fact that game is fully 3D now.\nYou would think that first introduction to fully polygonal world would be quite underwhelming. That it will underuse it and later games will make it better. But no, Quake still has some good layouts, better than many later games. Should thank that talents at id software were still thinking in abstarct ways, didn't try to be as realistical as Build engine games like Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nIt still got some weak points though. Like, Vores, spiders-like demons who shoot homing missiles. Actually, their missiles track players so good, that one corner is not enough to stop them and you can't circlestrafe around them. I don't understand what is the point, what kind of tactic developers wanted to use there. That, and game underdelivers on boss departament. There are only two "proper" bosses in the whole game. And when I say "proper", I actually just mean gimmicky ones.\n\nAs for Deathmatch and duel parts, the multiplayer side, well, it's not so good. It made multiplayer over Internet more mainstream and common, yes. But the game balance, it doesn't age too well. It's only good on high-level of play, but same can be said about many games. Yes, it's not Quake-exclusive quality, don't tell me.\nYou mostly have to dominate arena by grabbing most powerful weapons and powerups. Red Armor is better than any other armor, as it not only gives more armor points, but actually is more effective too. Rocket Launcher shoot quite fast missiles which are too quick to avoid properly. It's also most powerful weapon and most used one. Aside from lighting gun, which is good alternative too. Things die fast there.\nSo, you just have to grab superior weapons and powerups and then go roflstomp everything else, including those who just spawned in.\n\nIt gets even better once you realize that players are actively exploiting glitches in physic engine, like bunnyhopping and voodoo-like strafejumping, thigns that don't make a single sense. It become a standard nowadays, thus creating an artificial barrier between high-level and low-level players, where you have to practice much more than you should have to be as good and have some fighting chances.\nSo yea, casuals should avoid. Normal players should avoid.\n\nYou will have ot use server finders on Internet. And then chances are, there will be barely anybody playing. But then, most still play Quake for duels, so it must not be big issue.\n\nStill better than Valve's Deathmatch Classic.\n\nSo yea, game's quality itself is good, but not groundbreaking. Just good game. But what made Quake so overpraised is technical side. The engine. First, it introduced console. Then it allows you to record demos, thus creating competiveness where players try their best and creating some kind of "public". Then when you combine it with glitchy physics, you will see how Speedrunning was created. And then multiplayer was more focused on Internet public. And even better, game allowed more modding abilities, much more than in original Doom. And then it allowed modding in multiplayer. Thus creating Team Fortress mod, for example. And Capture the Flag mode too.\n\nSo, yes. Technical amazement, good single-player and finey multiplayer. This is the first Quake.","June 20, 2015","true","7.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/2310/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","TL;DR: Best power-up, Quad Damage = max fun gibbing demons. Also telefrag = pro final boss fight.\n\nNot the very first first-person shooter ever made, but close to it! If you do not own this game yet... well, where the hell have you been?! Ask a random person if they know of Quake and nine times out of ten they will. Quake's infamy knows no bounds, and for good reasons.\n\nAt its core, it's a demon slaughterfest. Run around finding keys and open up more levels  so you can blow up, pump full of shells, and even gib your enemies everywhere you find them.\n\nIt survives almost all versions of Windows over the years - in many cases fans themselves find their way around compatibility problems. You are given a few choices as to how to boot up your game of Quake on Steam. Just find whatever works best for you, experiment a little. The graphics are dated but playable, even more so with new resolutions available. On the plus side framerate will never be an issue here.\n\nEnemies consist of all sorts of memorable foes: human grunts (enthralled or converted or something), vors, scrags, ogres - even yetis. Thankfully there's a nice selection of weapons and power-ups to help you wade through the carnage. Shotguns and double-barrelled shotguns, grenade and rocket launchers are all solid choices, but my favourite weapon would have to be the super nailgun. Yes, there are nailguns; a nod to Trent Reznor, who did the game's soundtrack. Why do I say this? The proof is on the ammo boxes of nails, for they bear his band's logo, NIN, better known as Nine Inch Nails.\n\nYet, for some reason or another the soundtrack is absent from the Steam version of Quake. Never fear! A quick download and patch can fix this - in the form of Ultimate Quake. Just Google it, easy fix.\n\nI've mentioned some enemies briefly. What makes them all so special, huggable, and why play this instead of, say, DOOM?\n\nThe answer is fun factor. With game elements such as a yeti's projectile lightning, vor bombs (capable of turning corners!)ogre grenades and ridiculously high and long fiend jumps, there is a far easier time of getting demons to fight each other.. So forget trying to line up cacodemon cheese-and-bacon balls with a hell knight, Quake is where you crack open the popcorn.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Everyone's favourite power-up is the Quad Damage. The name is kind of hard to misconstrue. It goes without saying that they never last long enough either - once I get one I run around at top speed trying to find and kill everything in the level. Even the toughest foes flinch at a 4x damage hit from most weapons. One double-barrelled shottie blast at point-blank is... epic.\n\nOther odds and ends: great enemy sound effects, they're all unique and specific to each enemy. Some damage flinches are golden too - the knight clutching his ear and stumbling always makes me grin. Good take on zombies too - kill them with anything other than explosions and they just keep getting back up again. Proof that explosions are f***ing awesome in everything you do. I'm pretty sure their attack is picking off a bit of their own brain and throwing it at you. Ew. But I guess they don't have any need for it!\n\nStill further is the replayability. Finished Nightmare without saving and thought it was too easy? Join the speedrun community! It's crazy stuff, but great for a laugh. Rocket jumps (think: get hit by your own rocket or grenade) for boosting speed and getting to places that may seem like cheating is almost a sport in its own right.\n\nGet this classic in your library and give it a gib. Rediscover the meaning of FPS fun.","September 29, 2015","true","20.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","2"

Whilst the original game might not stand up in some ways to modern FPS games, its focus on simple satisfying carnage, and near total lack of a story or any semblance of realism to get in ther way of said carnage makes it one of the most pure and enjoyable FPS games in existence.\n\nThe main game is fairly short, but there are so many add-on levels and mods, you could easily be playing this for hundreds of hours without running out of new content. It also supports coop play, so you can blast through the main game and various mods together, and when you get sick of coop, you play one of the first ever deathmatch FPS games. Although Doom had deathmatch, it was Quake that caused an explosion in its popularity, and through mods spawned many new deathmatch modes, such as CTF and even Team Fortress.\n\nAlthough there have been games since that have tried to bring players the classic gameplay focussed carnage of Quake and Doom, few have come anywhere near to the greatness of the originals. You'd be mad not to try this game if you've never played it before.\n\nDisclaimer: I played Quake from 1996 when it came out. I still play now from time to time. I don't play the Steam version, hence I don't have much recorded playtime (just played ep1 to get enough to write this review! Still fun as hell).\n\nAlso, although the Steam version of the game works fine, I recommend getting hold of modern engine, such as Quakespasm to play it with. Check out the website Quaddicted to get new levels, mods and engines.","January 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Each level is a medieval maze filled with monsters and creatures straight out of your worst nightmares who all want to kill you. Starting with just a shotgun, you collect your weapons as you progress until you have an arsenal good enough to take on anything you could encounter.\n\nAs older games do, Quake doesn't go easy on you. Even on the easy levels, I often found myself in dire need of either health, armor, or ammo. Learning what weapons work best, what traps to avoid, and where to look for secret health packs is vital to your survival in this nightmarish world.\n\nFor me, the best part of this game is the movement. Fast movement and the ability to bunnyhop around enemies you just can't fight at the moment really seals the deal on this excellent game.\n\nAnd let's not forget that a mod of this series led to Team Fortress 2, everyone's favorite game at some point. Also rocket jumping. GOD I love rocket jumping.\n\nAlso install the Ultimate Quake Patch. It adds the original soundtrack and a load of other fixes to make this game even more wonderful.\n","July 31, 2014","true","11.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

It has bad ♥♥♥ weapons, enemies, sound effects and music (provided by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails).\n\nIt has very interesting level design that is a lot more advanced than Doom's. Each episode starts out in a military base that has a portal to other dimensions, so there's lots of variety in each episode.\n\nThe enemies range from grunts with shotguns to giants who shoot lightning, there's a lot of things in between.\n\nWeapons are amazing, with sound effects that make them all seem very powerful. The weapons in Quake are all very useful for various situations, it is important to learn each weapons functionality.\n\nArmor is a very important item in Quake. You die much quicker in Quake without armor than you do in other games from this time period, so always be well stocked up on armor.\n\nMy only complaints are that only the first episode ends in a boss fight, the rest do not, though the other 3 episodes are much harder than the first, still a boss fight for each rune would've been nice. Another thing, Quake has aged quite a bit, in the 90s Quake was a pretty scary game, but at least for me, its fear factor is no longer present.\n\nA Steam version only complaint, Steam Quake doesn't loop the music tracks on its own, you must use a patched EXE and rip the CD audio to mp3 format to get it to work (there is a guide on Steam about how to do this). This should not be a problem, but it is, and it seems to be a problem that plagues not only Quake, but other CD audio based games such as Quake II, Hexen II, Blood, and more. There are no achievements, which doesn't bother me but it might bother others. I have yet to try online play with the Steam version so I have no real comment, but Quake multiplayer is amazing, I hope that it works on Steam.\n\nIf you like Doom, or other FPS games of the 90s, you'll love Quake.","September 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

It is an experience that takes everything you think you know about first person shooters gets thrown out the window and replaced by a new standard.\n\nQuake is the first truly 3D first person game, no longer are the enemies and objects in the world represented by mere 2D sprites but are instead rendered in full glorious 3D letting you view them from every angle. This also opens up the maps and up, down, left and right are now all equal and most all be checked to find that one pesky monster shooting at you.\n\nThe weapons are plentiful and varied from the grenade launcher which, thanks to the 3D engine, can be used to bounce grenades off walls and ceilings to hit enemies that are hiding to the iconic lightning gun and extremely entertaining nail gun. All the weapons have excellent sound effects and animations and use them efficiently leaves you feeling powerful.\n\nUsing the weapons efficiently however requires more skill than ever before, aiming in the general direction of your enemies will not suffice and only a steady mouse hand will prevail against the alien hordes.\n\nMap design is of an equally high quality with a great emphasis on atmospheric lightning and a decent about of nooks and crannies to find hidden goodies in. The multi-player maps are equally well balanced and will reward only the most skilled among you.\n\nThroughout the maps, both single- and multi-player, you will encounter power-ups that grant you various short lived bonuses such as increased damage, more health, invisibility and other good stuff. Knowledge of their locations can quickly turn defeat into victory for the observant player.\n\nGraphically there is not much to say. Quake simply sets the bar and it is up to the rest of the world to follow.\n\nAn excellent soundtrack sets the mood throughout the game and creates a dark and tense atmosphere that only increases as you progress through the levels.\n\nAll in all Quake is perhaps the greatest first person shooter every released simply because of how many firsts it can boast. Without it nothing would be the same and for that reason alone this is a game that no self respecting gamer can go without.","June 4, 2013","true","63.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game is great for what it does.  It shows where 3 dimensional first person shooters came from.  Yes, one can argue that the genre started with games such as Wolfenstein, Doom, or even Duke 3D...  But fully 3D enemies and environments started here.  Back when video cards were first starting to hit the market and everything was still being done on the CPU.\n\nThe CPU utilization of the game becomes apparent when you notice just how bad the animations truly are.  You'll first notice it with the dogs and the fact that their legs don't even have a full loop and they simply look silly when they run.  This is a very minor detail when you consider the game's mechanics.\n\nThe motion of the player is smooth and the guns shoot as you'd expect by today's standards.  This game set a standard that was long followed up until regenerative life was put into games.  I am hoping that the Doom reboot successfully brings the arena shooter genre back.  I appreciate a good story but the action in games of this caliber can make up for all that side ♥♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2310/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Quake is a first person shooter that has you traveling through four different dimensions in search of runes that will allow you to fight the main villain. That is pretty much all the story you get and it is up to you to reach the end of each level until you retrieve a ruin and must go to the next dimension. You are free to choose whichever dimension to go to first but I suggest starting from left to right since that introduces all the weapons and enemies much more smoothly. Starting off you must walk into a portal to choose which difficulty you want and to select hard you have to jump over lava which was a nice touch. Your starting weapon is a shotgun, which sounds a lot more awesome than you may think since it is pretty much as useless as the pistol from Doom, disappointingly enough.\n\nThis is a very fast paced shooter where your moving speed is swifter than that of most games sprinting speed these days, which really comes in handy when there is an enemy pouncing toward you and another is shooting grenades at you. Learning an enemy and it's weaknesses is vital to surviving as you will be under attack by several different types of enemies at once and must learn to choose which one poses the biggest threat or simply how to spot an opening. Like in Doom they will also attack each other if they accidentally hit one another, and that can be very advantageous if you have enough skill to cause the enemies to fight each other to the death, as it saves you both ammo and the risk of taking them on yourself.  It is still exhilarating gameplay after all this time and is just as fun today as it was back then.\n\nEnvironments are still rather acceptable and the atmosphere retains a strong horror vibe to it. Character models have not aged well at all and are rather laughable unfortunately. You will not have time to gawk at them though unless you want a chainsaw to the face. Enemies are pretty versatile since most have both a ranged and close quarters attack. An example is an enemy with a chainsaw attacked to it's arm that will use it when you get too close and a grenade launcher when you are at a distance. That is just one enemy, they usually through multiple types of monsters at you and adapting on the fly is the biggest part of winning a battle. All the enemies are instantly vastly different from one another and instantly recognizable which is a important thing in these type of games. Even a slime is more than capable of killing you if you are not careful.\n\nThat same level of awareness is necessary when traversing the levels. You are in their world and if something looks to good to be true it most likely is. One thing that I found strange at first is that there is no activate button and you most shoot or simply walk into to switches to activate them. I was unsure how to feel about this at first, but risking a bit of ammo to shoot something that looks out of place and suspicious to find hidden secrets did end up being much better than pressing your face against walls and mashing the activate key like in Doom. Level design is amazing in Quake and each level somehow manages to feel different than the last. The four dimensions do end up blending together in my mind though since they don't really have any real noticeable gimmicks to differentiate them from one another. There is an extra dimension to fight the bad guy but it is a tiny level and ended up being a very disappointing fight.\n\nAs mentioned before your basic weapon to fend off monsters is a underwhelming shotgun and a fire axe in case you are desperate. There is also a double barreled shotgun you come across later on but it is probably one of the most disappointing shotguns I have used in recent memory. It takes about 5-6 point blank shots to take out some of the most common enemies which makes the game feel bullet spongy  but worse still it burns through ammo which you can only carry 100 of that type. A huge disappointment after the legendary double barreled shotgun from Doom 2. Other weapons fair much better and are a lot more useful. There are two versions of guns that shoot nails and are very useful against enemies though ammo does go by quickly. Your most useful weapon will be a grenade launcher which outputs a huge amount of damage and ammo is plentiful though you will obviously not want to use it when enemies are close by.\n\nAs is typical from games of this era, there are health kits to replenish your health and armor pickups that will allow you to take more damage. There are other pickups like a hazmat suit that lets you walk on hazards, a quad damage pickup that allows you to completely dominate your foes , a protection pick up that makes you invulnerable for awhile and a golden ring that turns you invisible. Turning invisible sounds cool in theory but once you fire at an enemy they can see you perfectly and avoiding them may not be the wisest choice as you may be attacked by those same enemies if they hear a battle nearby. On the topic of sound one thing that must be mentioned is that the Steam version had all the music removed. I don't know why but if you do not want to mod it back in I wouldn't even bother playing this game.\n\nQuake is still a very playable game if you can get past the dated graphics. It is unlike any other shooter released today and is an extinct brand of FPS which is a real shame. If you are buying it expecting multiplayer do know the community is dead and there are no bots so it all falls to the single player. One heck of a campaign though and it should last you about 6 hours. There is no real reason to play it again other than for fun or wanting to try the hidden difficulty mode. It is a perfect game to pick up and play when you are bored since most levels are only 10 to 15 minutes long. If you are on the look out for some fast paced FPS action or simply want to see why the Quake series is held in such high regards by most, Quake 1 is highly recommended.","June 24, 2015","true","8.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poddster/recommended/2310/","poddster","Pod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poddster/","732 products in account","Quake, along with Doom and Doom 2, is one of the best FPS games in existence. If you liked Doom and/or have grown tired of modern military FPS games, and haven't played Quake before, then I think you really should give Quake a shot. It's a great game. (You can skip Quake 2 and not really miss much).\n\n\n\nThe game is fast and fluid, it has the best grenade "tinkle sound" in any game, the best jump/hump sound in existence, and the guns, like Doom, are in 'the middle', so the avatar feels like some kind of supernatural tank. Unlike a lot of contemporary 'Early 3D' games that look like complete ♥♥♥ due to the low level of polygons, I think Quake still manages to pull it off it's look. (Though only if you play it in non-GL mode. Bilinear filtering on tiny textures looks terrible, and is one of the main reasons early 3D games (e.g. Sin) look so bad). I really like the light/shadow of the levels and the particle effects, though the levels are a bit on the brown side, admittedly.\n\nAll of the levels are weird and abstract, and don't just look like the crate storage rooms used in Quake 2 and every game since then. The low poly, highly angular level geometry helps this as well. Some of them (e.g. episode 2?) are even weird checker-board castles and such. There's also a lot of up/down movement in those levels, with the famous concept of speed running being possible by a few well placed explosions giving the player the ability to bypass huge amounts of level if they're skilled or completely lucky. There's definitely still an 'explorable' mental-map-forming aspect to a lot of the maps, much like Doom, (though it lacks an automap) and this allows the maps to contain secrets and easter eggs, something I really miss in later games. Most of all there's no attempt at cutscenes or 'story' or anything. It's like Doom in that it's pretty much pure-play. (Actually, there might be a few camera changes in the game that kind of look a bit like cutscenes?). Quake is a very non-modal game, as everything is done in that first person view. Even the choice of difficulty and a episode is performed in-game by running through portals.\n\nI'd like to think that the reason I like Quake 1 isn't rose-tinted nostalgia, as I actually never played Quake at the time of release, but only long after I'd played Quake 2 and Half-Life. I've not played Quake as much as Doom1/2, so the initial Quake levels don't fill me with as much dread/boredom as the early Doom levels. (I've played Doom/2 practically from their time of release). Quake also isn't just a boring tech-demo, like Unreal or Quake 2 (which I also played at the contemporary time), but is fun from the first second of being in-game.\n\nIf someone liked Doom and has grown tired of modern military FPS games, and hasn't played Quake before, then I think they they really should give Quake a shot. It's a great game. (You can skip Quake 2 and not really miss much).\n\nOverall: Quake is great!","December 18, 2013","true","6.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Don't let nay-sayers talk smack about the dated graphics, this game's the real experience and after a few minutes soaking up the rich environments you won't even notice anythin but legit awesomeness. The sound design is top of its class, and this game just plain rocks. The original releases used redbook (CD audio) for the ingame soundtrack, so that is impossible to reproduce when selling a digital version of a grame, however this can be easily resolved.

Starting by introducing many to the genre with Wolfenstein 3-D, id created a shooter that had the player running through a 3-D maze gunning down Nazis and killing Hitler, and it was really all people needed in 1992. The next year, id got a little more ambitious and unleashed Doom onto the world. Allowing players more weapons and adding a vertical axis to the game, Doom took gaming by storm, with gamers all too happy to dismember the armies of Hell and play with their friends online (it got so popular many offices had to install programs onto the computers that could prevent people from playing Doom deathmatches because so many people slacked off and went online fragging each other in deathmatch.) Doom got a sequel, which got two expansions endorsed but not made by id, and a collection of levels created by fans of the games were released. It seemed like id had peaked and that there was nowhere else for id to go from here. But then Quake happened.\n\nQuake again redefined what it meant to be a FPS and shocked the gaming world by adding a truly 3-D environment that was filled with all kinds of unique and varying types of enemies. With 4 episodes and 7 levels each, the game is smaller than Doom, but the gameplay is off the hook, balls-to-the-wall, rocket-jumping, grenade-hopping, MADNESS. There's a less overt evil you see in Quake compared to Doom, as these aren't just Demons from hell, they're inspired from H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, and other classical horror works. While it's lacking in the epic-boss-encounter department, the game is more concerned with being a damn good shooter, and it certainly accomplishes that. I've been playing Doom and Wolfenstein for quite some time now, but Quake is better than both those games and I've only been playing it for about 3 hours, which is saying a lot because I've played over 500 hours of Doom (don't check the Steam hours, I use GZDoom.)\n\nIf you like first person shooters, buy Quake. You'd be doing yourself a favor.","May 28","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakiebob/recommended/2310/","Jakiebob","Cybercacoarchubus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakiebob/","233 products in account","A very important game in gaming history. It added and extra dimension when it came to FPS's and it was a landmark achievement at the time. Today, however, the third dimension is used in pretty much every game now, but Quake still holds up as a whole. It plays like a silky-smooth old-school FPS with deep/nonlinear level exploration, fast-paced projectile dodging, and a variety of differentweapons and powerups used to kill a variety of  monsters. If you like old-school FPS games, you'll love this.\n\nThere is one major flaw however, one massive issue that brings the whole game down, and it's not Quake's fault, it's Steam's. There is none of the original music. When Quake was orignally released, there were two discs: one with the game, and one with the music. When they released it onto Steam, they didn't bother putting the music in with it. Why? It takes so much away from the game's atmosphere. Oh well, the gameplay is still fantastic and that's all that matters really.\n\nAs great game if you want some creepy, old-school action. Just make sure you have your own music playlist ready before playing though.","July 2, 2012","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun, it's dark, it's immersive, and it firmly established many of the conventions of FPS gaming we now take for granted. There would be no Team Fortress 2 without Quake, and that is why I wield the Original with pride. Id Software may have moved on to bigger things with Rage, but plans for Doom 4 make me believe that a new Quake may lurk somewhere beyond the horizon. It's important to know your roots in gaming, and while I got my online start in Starsiege: Tribes, my favorite singleplayer FPS of yore was probably Quake, if not Half-Life. Quake gave me my love of shotguns and grenade launchers and if an FPS cannot deliver me satisfying examples of such, then it does not measure up to my expectations for what constitutes adequate firepower. You can keep your assault rifles, throwing knives and tactical nukes. Give me a little buckshot and a little boom, and I will give you delicious interdimensional demon gibs.","February 13, 2012","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every episode I finished had me smiling with glee, while at the same time feeling regretful that I was that much closer to finishing it. Isn't that a definitive description of a fantastic game?\n\nMake no mistake, Quake came out in 1996, and while it may not hold a candle to modern games graphics-wise, it still has aged EXTREMELY well. Once you get the graphics and keymapping set up to your liking, you'll be caught up in the dark, bloody, violent, gruesome, and AWESOME explosion that is Quake. What other game takes elements from sci-fi, fantasy, some oddball Doom-esque religion, and H.P. LOVECRAFT?\n\nIf you're looking for a game with tight controls, fast gameplay, creepy atmosphere, intense firefights, and GREAT music/ambience, then you've been looking for Quake.\n\nA note about the music:\nDue to the way the music was integrated into the original game (playing off the game CD in the drive), the Steam version does NOT include ANY music in the game. Luckily, there's a patch someone made, named "Ultimate Quake", that installs all the original music at the appropriate levels and times!","August 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I decided to buy Quake (and its sequels) after finding the shareware version on an abandonware site while looking for DOS games to try out. For its age it is simply beautiful. No matter how long you have been playing FPSes for, I think Quake is an essential addition to your collection.

Quake offers four episodes of fast-paced, exploration based, pre-2000s FPS-glory. Despite its grim, colourless visuals, Quake plays in a much more engaging way than modern products of the genre, with its medieval/lovecraftian inspired style and ambience coupled with fast-paced movement and gunplay, it can be easily classified as a 3D Doom.\nHowever, like Doom, Quake was originally meant to be run on MS-DOS, so you might require a source port for a more convenient (or let alone executable) experience. My biggest recommendation would be the darkplaces engine, you can download it for Quake 1 as well as its expansions in this link\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1756923\n\nQuake remains one of the most popular retro-FPS games for good reasons, it still holds up as a fun and challenging arena shooter for both singleplayer and multiplayer.\n\nIt's basically Deathmatch Classic if it had a singleplayer and a right to exist.\n\nAnd yes you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is where Kindergarten Fortress 2 came from.","June 27, 2015","true","42.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

I still remember those days, zipping around those moody corridors and those dank, decrepit hallways, filling everything that moved with as many rounds as my 6-year-old hands were able to pump out...\n\nBefore inevitably dying at the hands of some monstrosity, of course.\n\nSure, I wasn’t good at it by any conceivable degree, but damn, I still loved it. It was more than just a game to me, the environment, the enemy design – it all came together to create an experience that I just can’t seem to dig out of my head, not that I would ever want to. Even now, I still feel that urge to boot it up and shoot something.\n\nI can’t promise that your time with Quake will be anything similar to mine, and you may find it to be dated, uninteresting or dull (and, in my opinion NONE of those things can define Quake). But to me, Quake will always be there, flashing through the back of my mind, making me feel the same way about it as I did 12 years ago, and because of that, I have no choice but to recommend it.\n","December 8, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every weapon has its place and situation where its good at (except the weak nailgun, but since you loose all your weapons every new episode you still use it).\nI especially like how the guns feel. The shotgun for example has this deep sound with a quiet click sound after it and when you hit enemys with it they make a sound and cancel their attack. This makes the gun feel like you really shoot something and hurt the enemys. I cant really describe it.\nThe levels look similar but thats because of the age of the game, they still look interesting and dont get boring.\nThe soundtrack is extremely well and isnt some random metal music like in Quake 2 but only atmosspheric music which really fits the game and sometimes even creeped the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nATTENTION: The game doesnt come with the soundtrack, install the Ultimate Quake Patch which not only fixes the music but also improves graphics and animation quality.","June 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its very similar, but the difficulty is not that hard like Doom. But i do like the movement in the game. Highest difficulty (nightmare, which is a secret mode), will only increase enemy speed movement and reaction, life damage should be the same (i think, or it may add more damage). What i know for sure, they dont respawn after killing them, so if you are smart on tactics, you should be able to find a way to find a room to take a breather from all the pressure on killing, unlike Doom where in highest difficulty you have little chance to breathe from, and dont have much time.","January 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its very similar, but the difficulty is not that hard like Doom. But i do like the movement in the game. Highest difficulty (nightmare, which is a secret mode), will only increase enemy speed movement and reaction, life damage should be the same (i think, or it may add more damage). What i know for sure, they dont respawn after killing them, so if you are smart on tactics, you should be able to find a way to find a room to take a breather from all the pressure on killing, unlike Doom where in highest difficulty you have little chance to breathe from, and dont have much time.","January 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The trade off is that there's smaller groups of enemies (rarely more than two at a time) and they're all a bit more bullet-spongey. The weapons can also be a tad unimaginative (no BFG here, just a gun that shoots lightning and chews through it's max amount of ammo in seconds).\n\nA lot of people dislike this game's visuals for relying a lot on the color brown. Personally, I don't mind this, as I feel that the more complex lighting and architecture of the maps (compared to Doom) compensates for this. That and the crappy low-poly monster models (that are still surprisingly well animated) combine with the rusted look of the game to create a wonderful aesthetic of low-tech creepiness. (I'd compare it to Silent Hill, but no part of Quake is ever set in a foggy town in the countryside - though there is at least one user-made map set in Innsmouth.)\n\nThis game also has excellent sound design by NIN's Trent Reznor. Don't bother with that EpiQuake junk, the game's audio is perfect enough as it is ... and on that note, I have to explain exactly why I'm giving this a thumbs down, even though I've just been gushing about the game.\n\nIt's because the Steam version doesn't include Trent Reznor's ambient soundtrack that Quake played off it's CD as in-game music. Unlike Hexen, there aren't any MIDI tracks or anything for the game to fall back on if the CD is missing - just nothing. The in-game sounds of wind and flickering torches are slightly more audible, and that's as good a compromise as you get.\n\nNow, I can understand the absence if it was a rights issue with Reznor, but that supposedly wasn't the case. Apparently, it was because when id put the Steam version of the game together (which runs in DOSBox) they couldn't figure out how to simply rip the tracks off the CD in OGG format and configure DOSBox to load those files in lieu of redbook audio. Maybe John Carmack was too busy working on his new engine for whatever that game no one cared about was called.\n\nRegardless, get Quake if you can find the original CD release on the cheap - which you probably will, as it's not a particularly rare game, nor one as valued by collectors as Doom (though be careful not to buy a  shareware version by accident). Alternatively, wait and see if this ever shows up on GOG.com - as those guys will probably put more effort into a basic digital release of this game than it's own developers.\n\n------------------\n\nTL;DR, Quake is a very good game, but don't buy it here or you will get a version without music.","February 8, 2012","false",""," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/2310/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Quake is a classic FPS that, alongside Doom, helped Id Software codify the genre. How, I don't know, because Quake is an unbelievably boring game.\n\nThe game's plot is, ostensibly, about fighting the Lovecraftian Old God Shub-Niggurath as she does... things. Which are bad. Quasi-demonic invasion from beyond the veil of space. As a Lovecraft fan this would seem rather encouraging... if in practice the game had any real plot at all. In practice the game is almost gleefully self-aware in how much its plot is a thin excuse to commit mass murder.\n\nQuake's "story" is broken up into four Episodes, of which I have admittedly only played the first two. The difference between the two seems to mostly be the upgrade of a single enemy type, and a slightly different wall texture. Any actual plot developments are mostly limited to easily-missed text blurbs at the end of each Episode, which mostly just seem to foreshadow the final boss.\n\nGameplay-wise, Quake is a tedious, linear run-and-gun set in an endless parade of largely identical brown hallways against the same five brown enemies (with a few exceptions, like the odd miniboss and the very rare "Base" levels featuring soldiers and dogs, all similarly brown), in levels that offer no trace of setting, motivation, or purpose besides a playground to kill things on. The entire game could be proceedurally generated and you'd never notice.\n\nThe combat itself is rather annoying. You're equipped with three main ammo types throughout the game - shotgun shells, nails, and rockets - and have two weapons for each, the second being a straight upgrade of the first (except for the grenade launcher and rocket launcher, which have different firing methods with different situational uses). In theory this weapon selection is servicable, but in practice it's rather lacking. Shotguns are the mainstay weapons of the game, probably to minimize the need to actually aim. Nailguns are vastly more effective weapons, basically being automatic weapons that have a degree of aim-assist to them, however their ammo is considerably more sparse and is burnt through much more quickly.\n\nNone of this is really a dealbreaker, the truly annoying part is that this game is old enough to have multiple floors overlapping one another, but functionally lack the ability to look up or down. Star Wars: Dark Forces had a similar conundrum mostly solved by the fact that most weapons would aim up or down for you in a limited cone, and your enemies had similar limitations. However, in Quake the most common enemy by far is the Ogre, a stocky brute with a middling level of health and equipped with a chainsaw and a grenade launcher. Bullets shoot straight, but grenades arc with gravity and bounce around corners. Cue every single level filled to the gills with Ogres on high ledges where as often as not you can't hit them, but they will gleefully pelt an endless stream of grenades down on your head.\n\nDon't make the mistake of me blaming my dislike of this game on it's difficulty. I died plenty, but I'm describing the game's combat as "annoying," not "difficult." Quake's uncomplicated setup makes it difficult for anything to become legitimately unbalanced, but managable does not mean fun. And when you take combat that isn't particularly fun, a plot that barely exists, and repetitive, bland aesthetics, you get a game that has essentially no merits to recommend.","May 9, 2015","false","5.2"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","2","18","0","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_makron/recommended/2310/","the_makron","Chozo Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_makron/","151 products in account","What's there to say about Quake? One of the most world-renowned and memorable FPS' of all time. But why is that the case? Let's take a detailed look and see:\n\n1. Gameplay - Let's trim the fat and get right to the guts right off the bat; Quake's gameplay is that of your typical 90's old-school FPS: Fast, bloody, complex and hard as hell, and you will love it (if you're into FPS games, that is). You get a wide array of weapons from a harmless Axe to the dreaded Thunderbolt, which turns any enemy into mincemeat in seconds, including the dreaded Shambler. Also like any old-school FPS, it is rife with secret areas that are a chore to find, but well worth the rewards within! Most times, at least. Tons of pick ups like the Pentagram of Protection (Invulnerability), Ring of Shadows (Invisibility), and the all-too-memorable Quad Damage, allowing you to unleash doomsday to every enemy in sight -- and yourself, too, if you aren't careful! -- dealing a massive 400% damage with any weapon you choose! There is a wide variety of enemies you will also encounter, from the annoying Grunt to the creepy Vore. Hint: When you see a Fiend (the bipedal, ape-like thing with lacerator arms) run like hell. One leap attack, and you're near dead. No joke.\n\n2. Graphics - Usually graphics aren't one thing to take too seriously in reviews. In my philosophy, so long as you can see where you are going, and nothing looks TOO pixelated, they're perfectly tolerable. Buuuuuuuuut, that being said, download the Ultimate Quake Patch to be able to play this game in buttery-smooth 1920x1080 (if you have a full HD monitor that is). Never before has a game from the 90's looked so crisp and clear. And to think at one point I thought the 320x240 resolution of Quake on the N64 was the best thing ever. *shudders*\n\n3. Difficulty - Hoo, boy...if you are brave enough to play this game on Nightmare (which you should to get the full experience, as cliche as that may sound, I know), this game will keep you on the edge of your seat nearly at all times, especially once you start encountering the bigger, badder enemies in later levels. Also, beware the Spawns (the bouncy slime-things). Just...just trust me on this.\n\n4. Replay value - I could start this beauty up and play it any day of the week and have fun with it. It's fast-paced, bloody FPS action at its finest, and one of the true granddaddies of the FPS genre, along with Doom, Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nBottom Line: You want this game. It's usually like, $3 or something. Absolute steal and a half. As are the expansions! But I'll review those by themselves.","December 25, 2014","true","45.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also dont worry if you dont like playing with a keyboard and mouse, u can use pinnacle game profile and setup a xbox 360 controller to this game. a controller feel quite comfortable with this game.","June 16, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is actually kind of sad, really, to see that games like this one just aren;t made anymore. Quake ism prime example of a game made in a time when gameplay was put over graphics and story, which is how it should be for most FPS. One of the very first FPS rendered in true 3D graphics unlike games before it like Doom, Quake is filled with run-and-gun action, a variety of weapons and enemies, and John Romero's amazing level design. Sure, the graphics are certainly arcadie, but that is what gives the game it's charm. Unfortunately, the graphics and animations are a bit grainy on the steam version when compared to, say, the Dark Places source port. Another problem is that the music is misiing from the steam version, which isn't neccesary to enjot the game, but it would have been an nice addon. Overall, this game will give you far more action than almost any other shooter out there, and for a low price of 10 dollars, Quake is a game everyone needs to play. You are not a true FPS gamer if you haven't played Quake.","April 22, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals still looks authentic to me and original, you can get the fancy texture mod for quake but it wouldn't feel as authentic as classic visuals of quake. For me, the graphics are made for the first impression (to see the beauty of how many colourful pixels there are on the screen), but its the asthetic, the gameplay, and the little stuff that don't include the graphics, which makes the game like quake memorable that you can just revisit and appresiate what its going for compared modern shooters. But I digress, the quake visuals are still appealing to this day. It is still great that you can run this on the modern rigs on any os flawlessly which blew my mind and that is awesome (and this game runs great, no fps drops, the fan patches makes the game alot more enjoyable and the steam version is crap). I love quake, and will revisit it again when I feel like in a quake mood.\n"Shake it baby, SHAKE!

Luckily, there are workarounds, so I still recommend this purchase if you have reason to believe you'll like it.\n\nWorkaround A: You can get the free "Dark Places" source port (a sort of "engine upgrade" if you will) online, find the game soundtrack online (in .ogg format) and put it in steamapps\common\quake\Id1\sound\cdtracks. It'll need to be named "Track002.ogg" to "Track011.ogg".\n\nWorkaround B: Acquire (e.g. burn) a real physical CD of the game and put it in your drive while you play.\n\nI obviously recommend workaround A.","April 8, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the first 3D FPS that I've ever played and how amazed I was for being able to contemplate enemies that had depth instead of simply being made of some thin texture that would always stare at me (even when dead). The campaign mode is awesome, not only because of the gameplay, music, weapons etc, but also because you have the opportunity of playing it cooperatively with your friends. Talking of multiplayer, although Quake was so innovative back then, it also had to bear the weight of handling dial-up connections from most of the players (except in LANs), making the overall multiplayer conditions somewhat unfair. That's simply because some players had a better connection than others. I've played countless hours of CTF and later Team Fortress (how I miss those crafty grenades and maps). Besides that, I can't remember how many demo videos I've seen in-game, another wonderful resource that created a legacy. Oh well, if I may summarize this game in a single word, it can be only this: Epic.","March 28, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first true 3D FPS game. 13 years on, how well has it aged?\n\nSurprisingly well actually. I suppose the first thing to note is that the game played a lot like DooM, I personally like to consider it one of the 3 DooM 3's also consisting of DooM64 and the actual DooM 3. But I Digress.\n\nQuake, as the first FPS to use actual Ploygons manages to hold up quite well, you have the basic DooM style controls, using the arrow keys to turn, Ctrl to shoot and WASD to move (That is unless you're using the Ultimate Quake Patch, but I'll get to that later). and it does feel like a well-rounded experience that manages to hold up today. Of course it has graphically aged poorly with Jerky animation (this can be fixed with the UQP) but to fully enjoy the game you have to put your mindset back in 1996 where the best looking 3D was Virtua Fighter, This game puts you in a realisting looking (for the time) environments and gives frigtening enemies that have never been seen before.\n\nStory Wise the game doesn't offer much, but the game doesn't really need to, you're just a guy (Who I like to call Quakeguy) who must stop evil creatures from an Alternate Dimension. It is sweet and simple.\n\nAll weapons handle well, from the Shotgun, Nailgun, Their 'Super' Counterparts, Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, all are simplistic in their design and manage to hit their target with a bit of help from auto aim (Again, UQP). The game features a fun Fast paced game that is perfect for speedrunners and delivers on the retro feeling and boasts great level design.\n\nThe Enemies themselves are actually made creepier with an effect that would not exist if the game had more polygons, The Gothic scenery makes the mood and feel of the game and gives the game It's own unique identity.\n\nUnfortunatly the game has some problems cause by some sort of steam optimisation. The Music is Non-Existant, even though there exists OST tracks on YouTube, none are featured in this game. This is Where the Ultimate Quake Patch comes into effect. The UQP fixes a lot of the Steam problems as well as some more of the poorly aged parts: Enemies have now got fluent animation, Mouse Control is Enabled, Improved Lighting and Particle effects as well as the OST added. Personally though I thought the 1996 graphics and improved lighting and effects were too distracting and I had no idea how to get the game to look like the Original game with just the Soundtrack so I removed it.\n\nThe game still has a great Charm to it and is memorable for it's environments and enemies. The game is still fun without the UQP but may turn people off with the lack of soundtrack.\n\nI suppose the bottom line is that Quake is a Good, if not Great game the has fun retro gameplay but naturally has not aged well in many areas. This leads to 3 possiblities for interest in the consumers purchase:\n1) Buy the game on GOG where it (apparently) plays Just like the Steam release but with working OST\n2) Buy on Steam with UQP, if you aren't bothered by the clashing graphics and enjoy updated versions of old games then this should be fine for you\n3) Just buy the Steam release as it is and Play some 'Through the Fire and Flames' to the game and enjoy it for what it is.\n\nQuake is a Landmark in the FPS genre that doesn't hold up as well as it's older brothers DooM and Wolfenstein but leaves it's mark in it's creative level design and fun fast gameplay.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: RECCOMEND","December 17, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Idunnoburgers/recommended/2310/","Idunnoburgers","G-B312","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Idunnoburgers/","61 products in account","The obvious stuff-\nA great FPS, I'll say. Better than most choices these days, but IMO it doesn't beat its sequel or Unreal. Why is that, for me anyway? Because its sequel was my first game ever, I learned to love the sci-fi look on it and get used to it rather than the Lovecraftian style that I came to experience some time after. Same goes for the music, a lot of people are going to hate me for this but I dislike most of the music for this game, with the exception of its main theme and the 'base' theme of every first level of each area. I really like those two, the theme's badass and the base music is relaxing, in a way. I really hate one of the tracks, the one with the piano and then you hear a voice that's like hearing someone dragging their finger nail down a chalkboard. Seriously, that's what I hear everytime I hear the song and its headache-giving, to me anyway, don't let that affect what you might experience. Sorry if I did. :/\nThis game IS less repetitive than Doom, I'll give it that, its great for what it is, MUCH better than CoD, BF, and so on. I know I kinda already said that before but I really need to get that out there. This game's great, but only if you have bought and played others that might be better.\nThe Stuff you'd probably need to know before you buy the darn game-\nYou start out at a Hub that lets you select your difficulty, you proceed to such difficulty and you enter another hub that allows you to select the area of which will allow you to gain a rune. Such runes allow you to gain enough power to gain access to find the game's boss. You collect the runes by reaching the end of the area, that being the area's last level. The first area is the only one that has a scripted boss, the others are all walking enemies, though they can be considered bosses too, the game can get much harder depending on the area's number. You can finish the game pretty quickly, and its also easily speedrunnable if you know how to. Its overall very fun and as I said, only get it if you already played stuff that could be better. Get it on a sale if you want, I am known for being cheap like an old man so I dunno, I always tell people to buy stuff on a sale because its totally worth it. :p","June 17, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fast paced, and skillful, Quake really scratches an itch that other shooters might not be hitting. If games like Doom interest you, then this will. However it's not very similar to games like Painkiller, though it may look it at face value. Painkiller and Hard Reset for example have you fighting huge hordes at a time, whereas Quake tend to throw smaller groups are you and concentrates more on navigating a maze. Sometimes the way out of the maze isn't obvious, and you'll be sprinting around trying to find it for a while.

All of the weapons are fun to use and inventive, ranging from a most manly shotgun to the Fickle Finger of God...I mean, the Lightning Gun. The levels are well-designed deathtraps forcing you to think quick on your feet and rewarding you for exploration and skill. Quake is tough, but never made me want to rage quit during my entire playthrough of the game. All in all, this a game I can recommend on a whim to anyone who likes fast-paced old school shooters, but I should add a note to this review: If you are going to play this game (and you should, it's fantastic), you would do well to get a source port to play it on (I play Quake on a source port, hence the 1.8 hours on record). The version on Steam has no music, which is an integral part of any game's atmosphere and feel, Quake in particular. In addition, if you like eye candy (and if you have a beefy enough rig, why wouldn't you?), source ports are the way to go in that regard. You can get the necessary files right here on Steam, and for $10 USD, I don't see how you can go wrong. Quake is more than just a relic of a past era, it's an enduring classic that still manages to compel a jaded modern gamer like me to play it for hours on end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolvesbones/recommended/2310/","wolvesbones","Morgenstern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolvesbones/","105 products in account","Overview One of the oldest FPS' out there. Even to this day, the pixelated display (Which can be sorted with a retextured version named 'Quake Epsilon'), retro music, run and gun themes and level design still retain at least some of their widespread popularity. Definitely not for hipster gamers, who play their stupid little 2d pixel 'art' games, this is for real gamers who need a little trip down memory lane.\n\nSystem Quake runs as it should, anything that causes too much trouble rarely occurs. The controls aren't too hard to master, plus they aren't buggy (As I've found with some other olden games). The controls aren't dissimilar from most modern-day games, with the exception of specialised buttons like turn left 5 degrees or something. It's just point and shoot. No need to reload.\n\nMultiplayer The one thing that doesn't really work well in the original Quake is the co-op/multiplayer. It is usually pretty buggy and laggy, and controls have been known to break and/or unbind in a match. Plus, the multiplayer mechanics don't really gel with each other. Sometimes, the AI will just completely break down and enemies will just stare in the direction the editors placed them in and won't attack or move. This also means entities with any properties won't activate or do anything. The single player campaign is good enough on its own, however.\n\nConclusion This game is very good, considering the times it was made in. Newer versions have been released (The aforementioned Quake Epsilon) that make it easier to see what's actually happening. For such an old game, Quake still remains impressive and a fun experience. It may be like Destiny story-wise (It has none), but it certainly makes for a fun pick-up-and-play game when you're bored. 8/10.\n\nAlright, we're done here.","December 24, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In today's world where First Person Shooters are either corridor shooters, leading you by the nose, or open world shooters with wide open spaces and samey enemy bases, this is a real breath of fresh air. From a level design perspective, Quake feels most like a forerunner to Dark Souls. Each level is a labyrinth folding in over itself, as dense with monsters as it is with secret spaces. Even on normal difficulty, Quake can be quite unforgiving. It's dense and fast paced, with no minimap, no objective markers, and no regenerating health. The story is light, and requires you read the manual to know what's up, so that's not awesome, but where Quake really excels is atmosphere. Between Trent Reznor's minimalist soundtrack, and the gothic and occult themed art and design, you'll find yourself deeply uneasy. This goes beautifully with what little story there is, which is very Lovecraftian. So if you love Lovecraftian horror, Dark Soulsian levels, and a high variety of baddies, Quake is a must play. And if you're concerned about it running on your system, just look at the community guides, and you'll be all set.","August 14, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting and weapons were just so unique. The soundtrack is absolutly superb and was composed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Quake's story and gameplay is very similar to DOOM's except this was created in a true 3D engine. IMPORTANT: As of right now the soundtrack does not work with the Steam version so if your not willing to fiddle with a Source Port and some audio downloads your going to be out of luck as far as music is concerned. The game is very Lovecraftian themed (Cthulhu, etc). You'll encounter demonic knights with swords, strange creatures of all shapes and sizes, zombified soldiers, and THE SHAMBLER. Quake has an episode based level design so you will go through one episode tackling a whole bunch of levels and then be put back into a hub area in order to select the next episode. There are four episodes in total. This game oozes immersion and atmosphere. You may play hours of it without notice sometimes.

You can play alone, cooperatively, or play a game of deathmatch, with or without teamplay. You can also install the Team Fortress modification, which is a modification revolved around the idea of encouraging true teamplay on Quake deathmatch servers, and obviously the root of Team Fortress 2.\n\nAs a side note, if you plan on buying this game, I highly recommend the Darkplaces engine patch for this game, as this game seems to have been neglected, seeing how GLQuake cannot be launched with the error "Cannot find Steam".

However it's not very similar to games like Painkiller, though it may look it at face value. Painkiller and Hard Reset for example have you fighting huge hordes at a time, whereas Quake tend to throw smaller groups are you and concentrates more on navigating a maze. Sometimes the way out of the maze isn't obvious, and you'll be sprinting around trying to find it for a while.

The first true 3D FPS game. 13 years on, how well has it aged?\n\nSurprisingly well actually. I suppose the first thing to note is that the game played a lot like DooM, I personally like to consider it one of the 3 DooM 3's also consisting of DooM64 and the actual DooM 3. But I Digress.\n\nQuake, as the first FPS to use actual Ploygons manages to hold up quite well, you have the basic DooM style controls, using the arrow keys to turn, Ctrl to shoot and WASD to move (That is unless you're using the Ultimate Quake Patch, but I'll get to that later). and it does feel like a well-rounded experience that manages to hold up today. Of course it has graphically aged poorly with Jerky animation (this can be fixed with the UQP) but to fully enjoy the game you have to put your mindset back in 1996 where the best looking 3D was Virtua Fighter, This game puts you in a realisting looking (for the time) environments and gives frigtening enemies that have never been seen before.\n\nStory Wise the game doesn't offer much, but the game doesn't really need to, you're just a guy (Who I like to call Quakeguy) who must stop evil creatures from an Alternate Dimension. It is sweet and simple.\n\nAll weapons handle well, from the Shotgun, Nailgun, Their 'Super' Counterparts, Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, all are simplistic in their design and manage to hit their target with a bit of help from auto aim (Again, UQP). The game features a fun Fast paced game that is perfect for speedrunners and delivers on the retro feeling and boasts great level design.\n\nThe Enemies themselves are actually made creepier with an effect that would not exist if the game had more polygons, The Gothic scenery makes the mood and feel of the game and gives the game It's own unique identity.\n\nUnfortunatly the game has some problems cause by some sort of steam optimisation. The Music is Non-Existant, even though there exists OST tracks on YouTube, none are featured in this game. This is Where the Ultimate Quake Patch comes into effect. The UQP fixes a lot of the Steam problems as well as some more of the poorly aged parts: Enemies have now got fluent animation, Mouse Control is Enabled, Improved Lighting and Particle effects as well as the OST added. Personally though I thought the 1996 graphics and improved lighting and effects were too distracting and I had no idea how to get the game to look like the Original game with just the Soundtrack so I removed it.\n\nThe game still has a great Charm to it and is memorable for it's environments and enemies. The game is still fun without the UQP but may turn people off with the lack of soundtrack.\n\nI suppose the bottom line is that Quake is a Good, if not Great game the has fun retro gameplay but naturally has not aged well in many areas. This leads to 3 possiblities for interest in the consumers purchase:\n1) Buy the game on GOG where it (apparently) plays Just like the Steam release but with working OST\n2) Buy on Steam with UQP, if you aren't bothered by the clashing graphics and enjoy updated versions of old games then this should be fine for you\n3) Just buy the Steam release as it is and Play some 'Through the Fire and Flames' to the game and enjoy it for what it is.\n\nQuake is a Landmark in the FPS genre that doesn't hold up as well as it's older brothers DooM and Wolfenstein but leaves it's mark in it's creative level design and fun fast gameplay.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: RECCOMEND","December 17, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All of the weapons are fun to use and inventive, ranging from a most manly shotgun to the Fickle Finger of God...I mean, the Lightning Gun. The levels are well-designed deathtraps forcing you to think quick on your feet and rewarding you for exploration and skill. Quake is tough, but never made me want to rage quit during my entire playthrough of the game. All in all, this a game I can recommend on a whim to anyone who likes fast-paced old school shooters, but I should add a note to this review: If you are going to play this game (and you should, it's fantastic), you would do well to get a source port to play it on (I play Quake on a source port, hence the 1.8 hours on record). The version on Steam has no music, which is an integral part of any game's atmosphere and feel, Quake in particular. In addition, if you like eye candy (and if you have a beefy enough rig, why wouldn't you?), source ports are the way to go in that regard. You can get the necessary files right here on Steam, and for $10 USD, I don't see how you can go wrong. Quake is more than just a relic of a past era, it's an enduring classic that still manages to compel a jaded modern gamer like me to play it for hours on end.

All of the weapons are fun to use and inventive, ranging from a most manly shotgun to the Fickle Finger of God...I mean, the Lightning Gun. The levels are well-designed deathtraps forcing you to think quick on your feet and rewarding you for exploration and skill. Quake is tough, but never made me want to rage quit during my entire playthrough of the game. All in all, this a game I can recommend on a whim to anyone who likes fast-paced old school shooters, but I should add a note to this review: If you are going to play this game (and you should, it's fantastic), you would do well to get a source port to play it on (I play Quake on a source port, hence the 1.8 hours on record). The version on Steam has no music, which is an integral part of any game's atmosphere and feel, Quake in particular. In addition, if you like eye candy (and if you have a beefy enough rig, why wouldn't you?), source ports are the way to go in that regard. You can get the necessary files right here on Steam, and for $10 USD, I don't see how you can go wrong. Quake is more than just a relic of a past era, it's an enduring classic that still manages to compel a jaded modern gamer like me to play it for hours on end. Give it a spin, if you haven't already.","January 17, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals still looks authentic to me and original, you can get the fancy texture mod for quake but it wouldn't feel as authentic as classic visuals of quake. For me, the graphics are made for the first impression (to see the beauty of how many colourful pixels there are on the screen), but its the asthetic, the gameplay, and the little stuff that don't include the graphics, which makes the game like quake memorable that you can just revisit and appresiate what its going for compared modern shooters. But I digress, the quake visuals are still appealing to this day. It is still great that you can run this on the modern rigs on any os flawlessly which blew my mind and that is awesome (and this game runs great, no fps drops, the fan patches makes the game alot more enjoyable and the steam version is crap).

While the game is great, I liked DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D(Not an "id Software" title) much more.\n\nQuake doesn't really have much going for it in setting and monsters. I like the whole goth/demon setting but it gets boring and uninteresting after awhile, even if the levels are designed well. DOOM has the advantage over Quake because the levels are more elaborate and fun to killyour way through with more interesting demons, and Duke 3D has the advantage over Quake because of its humour, creativity and extreme interactiveness that manages to make the player much more immersed even without the early 3D technology Quake has. Here the monsters were okay at best. Nothing to write home about. Although the final boss, while a letdown did look extremely cool.\n\nThat isn't to say that this is bad, Quake still has your fun puzzle-based gameplay that Doom and Duke have to offer. If you play the game on the "Hard" difficulty you'll have a fun little challenge playing through the campaign. I'm sure if you would have played this game when it came out you would have crapped in your pants at the graphics. However, given the fact that Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior both include the game and their expansions redone for a mere 9.99, Quake only gives you the base game for 9.99 and makes you pay 4.99 for each respective expansion. I'd recommend saving this one for the old Steam Sale.\n\nOther things of note: It kind of sucks that the face of your character that gets progressively more and more bloodied from damage doesn't move or blink like that of Doomguy's from Doom and also the grunting noise your character makes when you jump will never leave your brain.","September 6, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jssrfx/recommended/2310/","jssrfx","jssrfx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jssrfx/","398 products in account","Ah, the good old Quake. I remember back in 1996 how eagerly I awaited the CD-ROM with this gem. This was truly next-gen back in the day, and although still MS-DOS based at the time, it was a huge leap forward from the so common sprite based "2D/3D" shooters. This was true 3D, polygon monsters and a dark and foreboding atmosphere.\n\nI have largely absconded plain 3D shooters these days, because, frankly, I find them boring. Ten or fifteen years ago the FPS genre was at its prime, with a constant stream of new titles, MODs, re-releases of the same engines with a different graphic set and plot, and I can honestly say I probably played most of them. Nowadays a plain and simple FPS game just doesn't feel that entertaining anymore. It's all been seen and done before. So; what's a gamer to do? Easy. Go back into the past and relive the glory days with the good old quality FPS titles from that era.\n\nWhile it's true that the music is missing from this release, and while Nine-Inch-Nails are definitely a great choice, the game itself is still the fast-paced mayhem you remember (or not). I would strongly recommend to get "Quakespasm", since that allows you to play the game as close to the original as possible, but with Keyboard and Mouse and in HD resolutions. GLQuake doesn't work all that well. If you rename "quakespasm.exe" to "winquake.exe" in Steam's game folder (making copies of both files first of course), Steam will even count your play time.\n\nThis is truly a classic. If you're looking for an 'old skool' FPS game that was pretty much paving the way for the new era of shooters, then look no further. If you like FPS games, there is no excuse for not having this in your library.","August 27, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, Its a great game. The level design is one of the best I've seen and when ever I go back to levels before I always find something new. To newer gamers in the fps genre might\nfind it difficult though. I would be lying if I said I knew where I was going 100 percent of the time. No I grew up playing Call of Duty 3 and Medal of Honor Frontline. Games that show you A to B in the simplest way possible. Quake is such a breath of fresh air, from the "modern military shooter," I wish I could easly hook on to a server but that won't happen anytime soon. In the end its a timeless classic that will stand the test of time for the next generation of gamers.(hopefully it will still\nbe played in the future).","February 21, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better than most choices these days, but IMO it doesn't beat its sequel or Unreal. Why is that, for me anyway? Because its sequel was my first game ever, I learned to love the sci-fi look on it and get used to it rather than the Lovecraftian style that I came to experience some time after. Same goes for the music, a lot of people are going to hate me for this but I dislike most of the music for this game, with the exception of its main theme and the 'base' theme of every first level of each area. I really like those two, the theme's badass and the base music is relaxing, in a way. I really hate one of the tracks, the one with the piano and then you hear a voice that's like hearing someone dragging their finger nail down a chalkboard. Seriously, that's what I hear everytime I hear the song and its headache-giving, to me anyway, don't let that affect what you might experience. Sorry if I did. :/\nThis game IS less repetitive than Doom, I'll give it that, its great for what it is, MUCH better than CoD, BF, and so on. I know I kinda already said that before but I really need to get that out there. This game's great, but only if you have bought and played others that might be better.\nThe Stuff you'd probably need to know before you buy the darn game-\nYou start out at a Hub that lets you select your difficulty, you proceed to such difficulty and you enter another hub that allows you to select the area of which will allow you to gain a rune. Such runes allow you to gain enough power to gain access to find the game's boss. You collect the runes by reaching the end of the area, that being the area's last level. The first area is the only one that has a scripted boss, the others are all walking enemies, though they can be considered bosses too, the game can get much harder depending on the area's number. You can finish the game pretty quickly, and its also easily speedrunnable if you know how to. Its overall very fun and as I said, only get it if you already played stuff that could be better. Get it on a sale if you want, I am known for being cheap like an old man so I dunno, I always tell people to buy stuff on a sale because its totally worth it. :p","June 17, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember back in 1996 how eagerly I awaited the CD-ROM with this gem. This was truly next-gen back in the day, and although still MS-DOS based at the time, it was a huge leap forward from the so common sprite based "2D/3D" shooters. This was true 3D, polygon monsters and a dark and foreboding atmosphere.\n\nI have largely absconded plain 3D shooters these days, because, frankly, I find them boring. Ten or fifteen years ago the FPS genre was at its prime, with a constant stream of new titles, MODs, re-releases of the same engines with a different graphic set and plot, and I can honestly say I probably played most of them. Nowadays a plain and simple FPS game just doesn't feel that entertaining anymore. It's all been seen and done before. So; what's a gamer to do? Easy. Go back into the past and relive the glory days with the good old quality FPS titles from that era.\n\nWhile it's true that the music is missing from this release, and while Nine-Inch-Nails are definitely a great choice, the game itself is still the fast-paced mayhem you remember (or not). I would strongly recommend to get "Quakespasm", since that allows you to play the game as close to the original as possible, but with Keyboard and Mouse and in HD resolutions. GLQuake doesn't work all that well. If you rename "quakespasm.exe" to "winquake.exe" in Steam's game folder (making copies of both files first of course), Steam will even count your play time.\n\nThis is truly a classic. If you're looking for an 'old skool' FPS game that was pretty much paving the way for the new era of shooters, then look no further. If you like FPS games, there is no excuse for not having this in your library.","August 27, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NicolasCageKrampus/recommended/2310/","NicolasCageKrampus","NicolasCageSkeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NicolasCageKrampus/","222 products in account","Quake is essentially DOOM with some way-ahead-of-its-time 3-D graphics. While the game is great, I liked DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D(Not an "id Software" title) much more.\n\nQuake doesn't really have much going for it in setting and monsters. I like the whole goth/demon setting but it gets boring and uninteresting after awhile, even if the levels are designed well. DOOM has the advantage over Quake because the levels are more elaborate and fun to killyour way through with more interesting demons, and Duke 3D has the advantage over Quake because of its humour, creativity and extreme interactiveness that manages to make the player much more immersed even without the early 3D technology Quake has. Here the monsters were okay at best. Nothing to write home about. Although the final boss, while a letdown did look extremely cool.\n\nThat isn't to say that this is bad, Quake still has your fun puzzle-based gameplay that Doom and Duke have to offer. If you play the game on the "Hard" difficulty you'll have a fun little challenge playing through the campaign. I'm sure if you would have played this game when it came out you would have crapped in your pants at the graphics. However, given the fact that Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior both include the game and their expansions redone for a mere 9.99, Quake only gives you the base game for 9.99 and makes you pay 4.99 for each respective expansion. I'd recommend saving this one for the old Steam Sale.\n\nOther things of note: It kind of sucks that the face of your character that gets progressively more and more bloodied from damage doesn't move or blink like that of Doomguy's from Doom and also the grunting noise your character makes when you jump will never leave your brain.","September 6, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FollowTheJudasGoat/recommended/2310/","FollowTheJudasGoat","Slade the Leveller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FollowTheJudasGoat/","146 products in account",""Classic" is an overused term in gaming.  Because to be classic, a game must catalyse a revolution in style at it's time of release. To be classic, a game must transcend the simplistic outcome of entertainment and  become a canonical representation of both the gaming industry and the zeitgeist. It must raise the bar inalterably. Even by this dizzying standard, QUAKE stands aloft as perhaps the game most deserving the title of "classic game" in the history of the medium.\n\nContinuing id Software's epochal hewing of the FPS out of the shapeless mass of code in the 1990s, QUAKE springboarded off of it's cousin DOOM and formulated the rules of the Shooter that remain strictly enforced today. With being the first of it's kind, QUAKE is a game of absolute purity and speed. Slick as a razors edge and twice as sharp: you can almost feel it's surgical incision as you traverse it's beautifully functional level design, weild it's mathematical precise weaponry and do battle with it's unprecdented opponents.\n\nReading this, QUAKE may come across as more of an algorithm than a game. But it's biggest feature, as well as it's best one, is it's heart. It is clear that the game is a labor of passion created by geniuses. QUAKE's aesthetic finds itself in the deepest recess of a Lovecraftian nightmare, playing host to ornate keeps haunted by demonic servants of a dark god. When pitted against overwhelming and brutal hordes of monsters clearly on their home turf, QUAKE is a game that will surely send a twang of fear up the spine and a shot of adrenaline into the heart of all gamers, regardless of their tenure.\n\nSo, as a gamer, you owe it to yourself to experience this paradigm changing piece of art. If you fancy yourself a Warrior-God of Shooters who feels that you can best any challenge that the industry has thrown at you in the proceeding 20 years, play it on hard. If you're a maniac, play it on Nightmare. Or if you just want to know what all the fuss is about, simply play it. Live it. Let it absorb you like a dark, swirling apocalyptic sky.\n\nAll hail the legend that is QUAKE.","June 23, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing wrong with the game's soundtrack, but I personally do not feel as though I'm missing anything without it there. If the lack of a soundtrack bothers you, there are ways to "fix" that problem if you do a search. The game would cost more if Steam obtained rights to the soundtrack, as neither Steam nor id Software owns the music.\n\nRegarding the game itself, it's great. Everything that can possibly be said about Quake has probably already been said. I beat the game without cheats, and still play it. Quake, like Doom, scores high in replay value. It's just fun. You can "feel" when you kill things. It's not too easy, and it's not too hard. Certain areas and enemies require "strategy," but the game is rarely tedious.\n\nMany developers today think that their idea is already a game, regardless of whether or not their concept has been truly defined or refined. Quake serves as a shining example of when an idea has been defined and refined into a game; it is a game that actually deserves to be called a "game." It isn't a half-♥♥♥ idea come alive in pixels. I cannot think of any reason why a regular PC gamer should not own it.\n\nMy recommendation is to get the Quake bundle as it goes on sale. The price for said bundle has been as low as $7.49 here on Steam. If you can't wait, you almost certainly have spent thirty dollars in a worse way on this website.\n\nJust get it!","January 9","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In quite a few ways, it feels like a step up towards Doom since there seems to be a better focus on speed and careful platforming is more rewarding here, though that might be due to the updated engine offering more like mouse look and jumping.\n\nOnly downsides? Eh, the Steam release might not be worth it. It's basically the original retail release without the CD audio, and the mission packs are sold seperatley. Also, it doesn't come with the soundtrack right out of the box, which is a shame because it's one of the most skin-crawling soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. GOG.com has the full game bundled with both mission packs for the exact same price. No clue if it offers the soundtrack out of the box, but what GOG.com gives you is a lot more than what Steam does. I also found the final boss to be a bit of a disappointment. It requires telefragging to kill, which is something the single player campaign doesn't require you to use once up until this point and the game doesn't explain it at all. Perhaps that's me, but I found it incredibly unclear what you had to do.\n\nOverall though, I recommend the game, but you should probably read up on Johnny Law's tutorials in the Guides section to get a better more modern experience out of the game, and you should probably considering buying the GOG.com release rather than the Steam one. Thankfully, I got this as a gift and still enjoyed it, but consider this review as fair warning as to what the Steam release contains (or rather lacks).","January 5","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't dismay, though. There are all kinds of guides to get the soundtrack up and running, and what a difference it makes! The memories of countless hours spent fragging came flooding back. A few graphical tweaks, and the game actually looks as good as I thought it did the first time I saw it played.\n\nIf you ever enjoyed Quake, or if you're some kind of child or mutant who's never played before, you owe it to yourself to drop the paltry sum, and experience this masterpiece of foundational game design (foundational to its genre, at any rate) again, or for the first time.","December 28, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolvesbones/recommended/2310/","wolvesbones","Morgenstern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolvesbones/","105 products in account","Overview One of the oldest FPS' out there. Even to this day, the pixelated display (Which can be sorted with a retextured version named 'Quake Epsilon'), retro music, run and gun themes and level design still retain at least some of their widespread popularity. Definitely not for hipster gamers, who play their stupid little 2d pixel 'art' games, this is for real gamers who need a little trip down memory lane.\n\nSystem Quake runs as it should, anything that causes too much trouble rarely occurs. The controls aren't too hard to master, plus they aren't buggy (As I've found with some other olden games). The controls aren't dissimilar from most modern-day games, with the exception of specialised buttons like turn left 5 degrees or something. It's just point and shoot. No need to reload.\n\nMultiplayer The one thing that doesn't really work well in the original Quake is the co-op/multiplayer. It is usually pretty buggy and laggy, and controls have been known to break and/or unbind in a match. Plus, the multiplayer mechanics don't really gel with each other. Sometimes, the AI will just completely break down and enemies will just stare in the direction the editors placed them in and won't attack or move. This also means entities with any properties won't activate or do anything. The single player campaign is good enough on its own, however.\n\nConclusion This game is very good, considering the times it was made in. Newer versions have been released (The aforementioned Quake Epsilon) that make it easier to see what's actually happening. For such an old game, Quake still remains impressive and a fun experience. It may be like Destiny story-wise (It has none), but it certainly makes for a fun pick-up-and-play game when you're bored. 8/10.\n\nAlright, we're done here.","December 24, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No storyline; just a series of demonic mazes and fast action.  I lost much of my youth caught up in the multiplayer aspect of this game.  Gameplay-wise, it's a  basic but smooth formula.  It offers a challenge that is purely skill based; not just on your aim; but your timing, prediction and almost gymnastic movement around the levels.\n\nI still think it's a technical marvel.  This was one of the first full-3D games; and the levels are deliberately vertical and abstract in their design.  Everything has long since been open sourced; as a coder it's intriguing to inspect the design from a kind of archeological perspective.\n\nWhen starting, you're given the option to choose which executable to run;  QuakeWorld (which was its brilliant online version - though surely not noob friendly), didn't work for me.   Perhaps with some technical tinkering you can get this to work.  (It was never straightforward back in the day anyway)\n\nI've tested the GLQuake option, is the hardware rendering option, this works without any issues.  I'm sure there are mods out there that improve the experience, though.\n\nGamers today will probably never feel the same sense of awe and wonder and compelling multiplayer gameplay as we did when it released.  I'm kinda glad that games have moved on though, this game has a slightly discomforting pull, like it's almost half-living, a demon demanding my return.   As a skeptical atheist, it's beyond disturbing.\n\nMy time with this game is done;  it was a strange friend that was always present, but I hardly miss.  It still quietly haunts my subconscious to this day.   Damn.","July 28, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting and weapons were just so unique. The soundtrack is absolutly superb and was composed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Quake's story and gameplay is very similar to DOOM's except this was created in a true 3D engine. IMPORTANT: As of right now the soundtrack does not work with the Steam version so if your not willing to fiddle with a Source Port and some audio downloads your going to be out of luck as far as music is concerned. The game is very Lovecraftian themed (Cthulhu, etc). You'll encounter demonic knights with swords, strange creatures of all shapes and sizes, zombified soldiers, and THE SHAMBLER. Quake has an episode based level design so you will go through one episode tackling a whole bunch of levels and then be put back into a hub area in order to select the next episode. There are four episodes in total. This game oozes immersion and atmosphere. You may play hours of it without notice sometimes. I would recommend this game to anyone into 90's FPS such as DOOM or Duke. This game is not just a game. It is an experience.","July 25, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It should be rubbish?\n\nOh no, oooo no kiddies of graphical fidelity and micro transactions. You may need a mod to play at 1920x1080 so whatever time I've spent won't be recorded.\n\nI've only played the first few levels and have already had fear, frustration and joy from this game. Joy being the primary feeling. It's simple, but the fundamentals of good level design and gameplay are there. Start playing for more than 10 minutes blasting bad guys and soon you're in another shooter. You still want them dead and your charecter alive. It doesn't matter that they're blocky and featureless. They're still evil mothers trying to stop you doing whatever the heck this game is trying to get you to do. I guess pest control from the looks of it and they're angy. But you've got low poly kick ♥♥♥ guns that sound... well they sound like a game from 97 with some being pretty decent.\n\nThe enemies are actually interesting. Some can't be defeated by certain weapons and if you've only ever played quake 2 (like I had) then it's fun to see the recycled boxes and mechanics in different monsters and it's easy to see how the developers could see strogg in these weird mutants from hell beings. Some will launch, fire grenades and be hard to kill. Levels are interesting with limited puzzle elements and the completion time at the end of each level with the number of enemies reminds me of mario. Oh, did I mention you have an axe?\n\nI'm using the ezquake mod for quake 1 that cleans up the graphics a bit and allows you to run it in 1920x1080 although I found I had to use the load command from the console with the saved files name. It saves just fine, just won't load via the menu.\n\nAnyway. I'm actually impressed. I feel like I've had my own avgn episode, but instead of playing a rubbish game I've come out playing something awesome! Even as this game ages and looses it's looks it's kinda like your grandma. She's old and haggard on the outside, but when you engage you discover the fantastic person and the awesome things she did. She was sexy in 97.\n\nQuake will never be pretty again, but it will always be awesome and for that it's worth your time. Maybe it's time to go and play the original doom too before the newest one comes out.\n\nOh right. And before you expect some fantastic single player quest and campaign. Forget it.

TIME.  YOU START THE GAME.  And the max resolution is only 1280 x 720.  Also, to enable the ability to look vertically and diagonally, you have to press ` to enter the game console and type in "+Mlook" and to get the crosshair back, you'll have to type in "Crosshair 1".  Again, you have to do this EVERY.  TIME.  YOU ENTER THE GAME.\n\nThis port also does not come with the game's soundtrack which many people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about, BUT honestly I think this is a good thing.  The atmosphere is impressive and honestly the lack of soundtrack really brings that out.  And while the soundtrack is amazing, I still say that the game is better off without it.  It just doesn't really fit in for me.\n\nAlso, there's something I have against the enemies and weapons.  Whilst there is a lot of them and they are rather entertaining, the game seems to have a strong habit of constantly throwing fat shreks with chainsaws and grenade launchers in literally every corridor, and it gets really samey and repetetive at times.\n\nWith the weapons, I can't help but feel like some of them are completely worthless.  For instance, you start out with the shotgun on level 1, and you progress onto level 2 and all of a sudden you have the Double-Barrel shotgun, which is basically Quake's faster version of DOOM 2's Super Shotgun which immediately renders the normal shotgun completely worthless.\nSome would argue that DOOM 2 did the exact same thing yet I disagree; the normal shotgun in DOOM 2 had much more range compared to the Super Shotgun and still did a decent amount of damage, but the shotgun in Quake becomes completely forgettable with it's apaulling amount of damage against most enemies in the game.\nHell, the exact same thing happens for The Nailgun and the Grenade Launcher!  They all get replaced by more powerful copies of their own self, a la the Super Nailgun and the Rocket Launcher.\n\nThis was just my thoughts on it though, you guys probably completely disagree with me.  I just feel as though they could have made some of the weapons in the game actually worth something and not have to be thrown away as completely useless later on.\n\nAnd what the ♥♥♥♥ is the story?  Am I just some dude in some weird places killing random living creatures native to the area because he's a psychopath who enjoys blood, gore and murder?  Until you lot give me the full story, that's what I'm going with.\n\nAlso, the graphics occasionally give me headaches.  Just sayin'.\n\nThe Good ♥♥♥♥Right, I like the gunplay, it feels really great.  Actually, the combat in general is really satisfying (minus the melee weapon, the axe) through and through.\n\nThe enemy design is really creative, especially for the zombies and each map, despite all having the same atmosphere, all feels unique and different.\n\nLike I said, the atmosphere is brilliant.\n\nAlso, that ♥♥♥♥ing Shambler.  The ♥♥♥♥ing shambler.  Scary af.\n\nSo overall, despite having ♥♥♥♥ loads of flaws as of today, Quake still remains to be a fun game and of moderate challenge.\n\n6/10\nStill though,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn977W9HjWM","June 22, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quake is one of the earliest First Person Shooters with a fully 3D world, items, and enemies. It hasn't aged quite as well as Doom in my opinion, but don't let that discourage you, quake knows what it is doing, and does it well. This game still stands as one of the most solid FPS experiences ever made, laying the foundation for many future games in the genre.\n\nQuake plays similar to most of the original FPS games, you run around at a fast pace killing monsters, finding secrets, and collecting keys. It features the classic arsenal of shotguns, nailguns (basically machine guns), rocket launchers and more. The enemies and locations follow a medieval/dark magic theme, with a few futuristic settings here and there. This theme is pretty unique and isn't used for any of the sequels, in fact I'd go so far as to say that this game never got a true sequel.\n\nThe game's music was originally played from the disc so you will need to get a patch somewhere if you want it (The soundtrack was made by nine inch nails, it's worth your time).\n\nThere are some notable issues with the game however. I would not recommend playing the game as is when purchased. Go find a community made source port or patch, because it's not set up well for modern systems. It also crashes on rare occasions. One big issue is a bug involving runes. Quake has four runes which you must collect to enter the final area of the game, said runes will occasionally disappear when changing levels or respawning, this causes you to need to redo an entire episode of the game to get them back. The good news is that you can avoid this by making some extra backup saves here and there.\n\nIf you are looking for a classic key collecting and monster gibbing experience, then pick this sucker up and rocket jump to victory.","May 30","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels have tons of different elements to them, constantly mixing jumping, with swimming, with playforming in some area\'s.  They really took advantage of how versatile and free your character was and makes the gameplay feel very dynamic and energetic.\n\nGreat experience through and through, with 2 expansions in case you want more.  There\'s also a semi-active modding community still around, not sure if it\'s still as active as Doom\'s, but they\'ve produced some great content.","May 31","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't played it, you should probably do this now. Else the PC gaming gods may strike you dead. Message me if you would like to modernize the game and are unsure what to do. Or just go here https://www.quaddicted.com/ and do it for yourself. I personally use the DarkPlaces engine with texture smoothing turned off. I do not use any high resolution texture packs or new models, as I prefer to play reminiscent of when I originally play, just with better lighting and high resolution. I keep this game installed on my PC as I'm always down for a game of Quake. The multiplayer community is still there. Quakeworld is fine, or go check out www.quakeone.com","April 2, 2013","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
