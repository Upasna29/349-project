Newcomers should start on Normal difficulty to learn the ropes and have fun. Playing on Suicidal and Hell On Earth requires a lot of experience, working as a team, and in-depth knowledge of game mechanics. For many people however - myself included - this is the real draw of the game. If you put in the time, playing on HoE with 5 other experienced players all working together is some of the most fun you can have online. There is also nothing more exhilarating than being the last one alive on Wave 10 knowing your entire team is watching and relying on you to stay alive.\n\nHighly recommended.","November 25, 2013","true","399.9"," 856 of 924 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","856","924","2","14"

As much as the game focuses on multiplayer  and teamwork and the game shines in those respects.. the solo side of the game is perfectly balanced to make it a great experience also.\nAs you progress in difficulty the money gets less and it becomes harder to make sure you have the weapons you need when you need them, but as you progress in level your weapons become cheaper and more powerful.  The enemy is varied and as you get in higher difficulties you need to develop the tactics to take the tough ones down safely.  Many tactical skills can  be employed beyond defending one area and who is best suited to kill what depending on choice of class.  Situational tactics like target priority and when to run and how to "kite", knowing when you come round a corner to come face to face with a crowd of enemy, just what ones you want to smack once and keep going, kill outright or just keep on keepin' on.   Add to that an active modding community with extra maps, game types, mod weapons, games and modded monsters... free for download.\nNot that you have to play it that serious either, many people just find a level they are happy with and just kill stuff for fun... that is one of the great things about the game ... you can play it at any level you desire, but the challenge is there if you seek it.\nThings I see as a big plus.\nNO PvP  - you will not get "spys" or cheaters spoiling other peoples fun.  There is one modded game type GunGame that is Player vs Player, but the normal game dose not.\nNO set enemy spawns, in games like some of the ghost recon type games, splinter cell types is that once you figure out a way it gets boring and tedious.  This game is a complete open environment and the enemy can spawn just about anyplace in relation to player position, so even a game played the same way can have different combinations of enemy at any one time.\nFor reference, other games I consider top notch FPS  -  Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 and Team Arena, BF2142   I consider Killing Floor better than them all.  2000 hours in 6 months speaks for itself.... along with 600 hrs in the free SDK making new maps.   If you like FPS and don't own it, you owe it to yourself to get it.  I have spent $1000's over the years on games that were little better than drink coasters... the money I spent on this game has been the best entertainment value of my life!!\n\nedit - as of Nov 2015 3000 hours in game and 2000 hours in the SDK with 36 workshop submissions, most of those original new maps.  An additional 1000 hours on alt accounts for map testing.   Even with KF2 out this game is still well worth getting!","April 20, 2014","true","260.2"," 832 of 905 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","832","905","0","38"

The first 5 mins I thought this is the biggest pile of crap I've ever purchased. Graphics are ugly, wave after wave in the same smallish map?!?! Why on earth are ppl still playing this game? I put it in my trash list.\n\nThe following day I had a strange urge to try it again, for whatever reason I don't know. I soon realised this game is not about arcadey run n shoot n regen health bs. This game's depth is about u as a team player and improving yr skills to take on bosses and tight situations. Reading the danger signs, when to run when to hold ground. You won't suddenly level up and get a powerful weapon, u only progress with improving yr gameplay.\n\nThe weapon mechanics are simply amazing. WARNING: after playing with no aim cursor and using only ironsights all other cursor games will suck.\n\nThen there is the community made content. More guns, maps, zeds, bosses.....I have over 1500hrs entertainment time and I only paid $5. I think I bought some dlc just to support devs but its not enough for what they've achieved. I don't usually buy newly released games, the ones I've bought I've regret. But when KF2 comes out....just take my money, take it. Please.\n\nTLDR: Buy the game. There's not many devs that care about their product.","May 26, 2014","true","861.3"," 450 of 474 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","450","474","0","13"

The game is incredibly fun and takes strategy to master, especially when attempting to play on the Hell on Earth difficulty. New weapons and free maps come out frequently which help keep the game interesting but being charged to own the latest and greatest weapon packs can be a bit of bummer.. Like all zombie based games, it tends to become repetitious. Luckily, having the option to increase the difficulty, play objective modes, and strive for seasonal achievements gives players more challenges/options to keep the interest in playing alive.  If I had to rate the game, I would rate it a 9.5/10.

It has a great fan community and is still evolving nevertheless KF2 is already been announced.\n\nThe main difference to L4D is the concept not to fight some hordes, but just a certain amount of 9 different special infected (ZEDs) each of the 10 waves on the same map. Then comes the Boss called the patriarch which is incredible stronger and send some of his children for support. Your character is improvable by long time playing measured in 7 different perks. So you will achieve mastery in many different ways after a while.\n\nThat doesn't mean your personal player skills are not needed. Instead you must begin to analyze the ZED mechanics in higher difficulties and how the perks work perfectly together.\nThere are 2 ways: Camping  or Kiting to beat the maps. Camping means holdout in a tight place and withstand all over the waves the ZEDs. Kiting means running in circles on a route and takeout one ZED after another. Kiting is more time intense but could be also more fun.\n\nThe kill animations are absolutely great (at least in the uncut version). Heads are exploding, can be decapitivated. Burning them bodies with flamethrower (firebug) let them coal.  Demolitian has pipebombs and blow up everything that comes to close. On the other side some Zeds have a rage mode where they don't stop chasing you until they killed you. It's totally challenging and depends on the whole team skills if you survive or not.\n\nThere's a high amount of 280 Achievements atm. Still raising at each seasonal event. You have to await these events to unlock them all. Each map has 4 map achievements from "normal" to "hell on earth", KFO - interesting objective maps, some kill achievements and special gimmicks, unlockable new character and Tripwire cross game supporting achievement policy. All fun.\n\nOne little negative is the complex server browser in MP which confuses in the first moment. But after a while you will get used to it.\n\nDon't miss this great game that isn't still boring after 1k hours playtime. (helping some friends with achievements). I recommend you to buy somekind of complete pack in order to get a whole bunch of the most important DLC guns and skins included. It just cost you a little more.  I know, some people swear L4D2 is even better and more atmospheric. But you can try to be the master in both games.","October 25, 2014","true","964.4"," 275 of 317 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","275","317","12","6"

Weapons are purchasable with money gathered trough each wave (by killing, healing, welding doors, assisting kills...).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherofducklings/recommended/1250/","motherofducklings","lastly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherofducklings/","843 products in account","I've been playing KF for a while, and from my observations there is a healthy playerbase, especially for a game that released in 2009. 4 years, still strong and Tripwire is still updating the game with new DLC + events. The DLC is optional ofc, usually it's like player skins/cosmetics. Not pay to win.\n\nAnyways, to get back to the point; like most multiplayer co-op games you're going to have the experts, vets, average, and the noobs/beginners. I found the community to be pretty friendly, you'll start picking up tips as you continue to play. Of course, if you have a dedicated group, teamwork will be greater as you'll walk into the game with a plan. With good teammates, things go smooth. Sometimes I get randoms that are great, sometimes not. You'll learn more about "kiting" ZEDs as you play on Suicidal/HoE (harder difficulties), but camping is much easier in lower-level games.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, if you decide to pick up this game today, please join a Beginner/Normal level server and keep playing until you level up to 2 (or 3), then proceed to a Hard difficulty server. Strongly advised NOT to play on Suicidal/Hell on Earth right off the bat. Chances are you'll cause more harm than help as your experience & perk levels are not strong enough for such difficulties (specimens also get stronger by a factor of how many players on the server).\n\nThis game is simplified down to this: kill b*tches, get money to buy guns/ammo/armour, then rinse and repeat until you get to the Final Boss Level against the Patriarch. He is one of a kind and I will let you discover more about him on your own! (it's more fun that way)\n\nNot everybody will have enough money at the trader, so sharing is vital for overall success of your team. Just simple things like throwing a few pounds at your teammate can go a long way.\n\nI remember picking up this game like 2 years ago, it's still one of the most played games I own! Didn't know too much and often died getting to the Pat, but every game I played, every wave I beat I learned how to improve. The game has a level system from 0 to 6, so character progression will obviously make KF easier the more you play! A lot of replayability (custom maps + different spawns), the game keeps itself fresh.\n\n----\n\nTL;DR - this game is still fun after 4 years of release, still getting updates from Tripwire devs. if you enjoy killing ♥♥♥♥ with friends in a 6-man environment (much more enjoyable than only the usual 4 person co-op, imo) buy this game! you won't regret it!!!","December 12, 2013","true","436.8"," 156 of 177 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","156","177","0","6"

Don't expect anything spectacular though.\n\nThis game should be able to run on most older pcs just fine if you lower the graphics a lot and your resolution. Any good pc should run this with no worries.\n\nThis game caters to both casual and hardcore players. The objective is simple, kill all the enemies. It's easy to jump in and understand that you should probably kill all the guys trying to rip you apart. for those who play the game more often, the game can get really intense on the harder difficulties, where an understanding of each zeds mechanics is required to succeed.\n\nSince this is a team based game, having friends along can make the experience much more better. Although if you're a solo player like me, the game is still a ton of fun, just a lot more fun with friends. Every enemy in this game feels unique, from the basic waddling clot to that guy with a chainsaw for an arm. Each enemy acts differently, and each have characteristics that separate them from the others.\n\nThe maps in this game are of a wide variety. Some take place in urban environments, some in factories, others in fictional lands. With the workshop, you can find countless more community maps.\n\nThe voice acting of this game is both a positive and a negative. It is humorous at first, but when you start playing a lot, it gets incredibly repetitive.\n\nThe majority of the DLC for this game is cosmetic, skins for your character or a camo for you weapon. There are a few DLCs which give you new weapons. none of them are completely overpowered but some contain useful weapons. I recommend buying these DLCs first.\n\nAt its price, killing floor is absolutely worth it. It also frequently goes on sale, so grab it during then if\nyou're unsure.\n\n// Review end //\nI rewrote this because i noticed it had become popular, I updated the horrible formatting because it was not easy to read.

Killing Floor is sickness, a wicked one at its finest. Teamworking wave by wave your way up to face the horror itself is a great fun. Although, game itself is coated in black humor, which is swirled inside small popular culture and steampunk references.

Killing floor is a few years old at this point, but the graphics are still satisfying to look at. The environments are nothing to oogle over, but the game does an overall good job of generating atmosphere.    Gameplay  7.5  A solid, fast-paced FPS. Killing floor does a great job of allowing you to feel like you are, to some extent, surviving an assualt of "zombies." The guns are satisfying to shoot, and the interface is clean. The barricade feature makes for great gameplay and intense moments, if you make use of it. The biggest problem Killing Floor faces gameplay wise is the leveling system. It is painfully slow to gain new ranks in this game. Thankfully they are addressing this in Killing Floor 2. Know this also: There are a lot of things you can buy with real money in Killing Floor, BUT, they do a good job of not putting you at a disadvantage if you don't have the DLCs. You still have what feels to be a full, solid game, with lots of maps (not to mention the community workshop), and a couple game modes!    Story  N/A  There is a story here, but it exists purely to give you a background: "Terrible experiment gone wrong."     Multiplayer  8.5  Killing Floor is at its best when you're playing with a group of friends, trying to survive against the merciless onslaught of enemies the game throws at you. You'll find yourselves rushing to a safe place to hole up and defend, each of you watching the barricaded doors as they are slowly pounded down by the terrors on the other side. Or, you'll make the mistake of seperating, and listen as each of your friends dies off, one by one. There is still a fairly active community in this game, so you'll be able to enjoy it even if you pick it up so long after release.    Replayability  7  Killing Floor has plenty of maps to play through, with tons more added by the community. Having owned the game for several years now, I've found that I do keep coming back to this one to have a solid good time with friends. That being said, despite the plethora of maps you are given, Killing Floor can end up feeling very repetitive at times. All in all, you'll keep coming back to play Killing Floor, but it won't be every day or week.    Overall  7.6/10  Killing Floor is certainly one of the best zombie shooters out there, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a solid FPS. If you're looking to capture the feeling of "surviving," Killing Floor can do the trick for you for awhile. Eventually it boils down to be an FPS with the enemies skinned as Zombies. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you see this one on sale, pick it up. They are constantly updating it with fun new maps and reskinned enemies. It's not a purchase you will regret.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","November 1, 2014","true","16.7"," 239 of 315 people (76%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","76","239","315","14","18"

It's a creative interpretation of current day America and deals with controversial issues such as immigrants, gun control and abortion. Similarly to the Bible, Killing Floor can be interpreted literally or figuratively at any time, depending on whatever point you want to prove. Putting this in the genre of Surivival/Horror is risky as one of the perks removes any sensation of danger or difficulty. This simulator accurately depicts areas like suburbs and packed metropolitan areas in a utopian society. The constant thrill was incredible - something not expected from a turn-based rpg.\n\nFrom looking at the landscape to watching people die right before your eyes, any casual player should take a swing at this team-driven, racing game.\n\nI give this real-time strategy game 10/10.","November 25, 2013","true","893.3"," 793 of 1,144 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","793","1","5","66"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitous/recommended/1250/","digitous","Taylor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitous/","1672 products in account","Killing Floor - ReviewKilling Floor is a teambased first person shooter game made by Tripwire Interactive that puts an emphasis on teamwork. The main goal of the game is to work together with a team to kill a certain amount of zeds in each wave in order to get to wave 11 and kill the patriarch. Without working together with your team and forming a plan of some kind, you will die. That's one of the best things about Killing Floor, and one of the reasons why I love it so much. However this doesnt mean it's without its flaws.\n\nThere are 7 perks aka classes to choose from and they each play a specific role in your team. You'll level up after doing enough damage, getting headshots or killing a certain number of zeds. The higher you level up, the more benefits you recieve such as lower weapon costs and a starting weapon. However this isn't necessarily a good thing since it puts a big gap between newer players and the long time players. The perks themselves seperate Killing Floor from a bunch of other games since each one plays differently.\n\nGuns are a plenty in Killing Floor with around 7 or so weapons per perk (more with dlc). Each perk weapon is special with the amount of damage it does, how fast it shoots, and the reload speed. Each weapon also has a different sound effect which really gives each weapon a unique feeling to them as well as making some weapons really statisfying to kill zeds with. This doesn't mean that all weapons are good though, some are unbalanced and are either too costly for it's own good, or not being better than some of the higher end guns. The berzerker perk however doesn't feel as fleshed out as the others since you're basically slapping the zeds while trying not to get hit.\n\nAlong with the many different guns, maps, and perks this game offers, there's also many different zed types. In total there are 10 different zed types including the patriarch and each of them behaves differently. Because of this, some perks and the weapons they use work well against certain zeds, another thing that makes Killing Floor one of my favorites. However, this requires you to memorize different strategies to use for each of the zeds resulting in a slightly difficult learning curve for newer players. Although memorizing the paterns comes naturally to some people since the behaviors correlate with the sound cues they give, so it isn't too big an issue.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging fps game, you should definitely give this game a try. While Killing Floor 2 is already out and similar, the original Killing Floor feels like a different game entirely with different strategies than the second game. If you know anyone who plays Killing Floor, you should play with them as playing with friends makes this game much more enjoyable. You can usually find this game for $5 during sales, or you can get it in the Digital Deluxe version of Killing Floor 2, but it suffers from a ton of bugs that ruin Killing Floor 2 (Microtransaction drops are bugged despite already being  such a controversial feature, gg tripwire).\n\nPros:► 7 perks / class to choose from\n► Tons of weapons and maps\n► Weapons sound great and each kill is satisfying\n► Difficulty and zed count ramps up as more people join (teamwork is essential)\n► A nice and fitting soundtrack\n► Multiple types of zeds that behave differently\n► Hilarious british accents\n\nCons:► Unbalanced Weapons\n► Melee isn't fleshed out as it could've been (fitting pun)\n► There is an objective mode, but it only includes 3 official maps (you can however find some on the workshop)\n\nHit / Miss:► Learning curve requires you to memorized what works against each zed, which might ward off newer players\n► Somewhat slow start\n\nPersonal Rating:Avoid at all costs\nPick up during a sale\nWorth Playing\nMust Play\n\nEdit: Removed my previous edit, placing it here. Edit basically said to get kf2 digital deluxe, however the game is currently bugged out more so than i've seen in any early access game.","September 20, 2015","true","834.5"," 80 of 98 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","80","98","4","0"

This game however has graphics that are a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ with repeatitive gameplay as well and with voice acting so bad that it's almost so ♥♥♥♥ing good. Though Killing Floor does have list of flaws consideribly longer than David Cameron's ♥♥♥♥♥ and completely irrelivant speeches, this game has achieved such a massive fanbase just enough to keep it flooded with screenshots, mods, artwork, friendly fans and videos.\n\nSo how did Killing Floor become so successful you ask? It's a really good question but simple to answer, this game is possibly one of the most clever games ever created due to the fact it's not one of the games where you try to get the other side of the level and re-stock on supplies then trying to get to the other side of that level or trying to gather supplies and making gangs and being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ruining other people's experience with that game. On the FLIPSID3, there are games which grind a new game nearly every year which shoves loads of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in your face than there are fanboys on majorly popular games such as Team Fortress 2.\n\nNow I'll be on about the gameplay of Killing Floor, for obvious reasons you can see how this series can get really repeatitive quickly but it seems to draw you in each time when you load it up even after it's gone past to the extent of being new and different. There is loads of hope and joy in the game when you finally destroy the Patriarch on a Hell on Earth 6 Man match to the time when you find yourself trying to clutch the last actual non-boss wave as a Medic with 3 Fleshpounds attempting to slap your sexy ♥♥♥ is still absolutely fun I suppose it goes towards to this mystical sense of spirits or something congratulating you making you want to play more long after most games which would surpass their enjoyment points. Killing Floor's true achievement gameplay wise goes towards to the creative minds of the community, you can play on maps made entirely of cakes and sweets to using custom weapons such as RPGs to ♥♥♥♥ up Fleshpounds and trash zeds in anyday of the week.\n\nOne thing I'd love to say before I close this fustercluck of a ♥♥♥♥♥ review is that what really makes Killing Floor stand out in the Zombie/Survival games arena has just got to go to the community. I've got to say this again, the amount of custom maps,weapons,skins,community made zeds is absolutely brilliant and big props go towards Tripwire Interactive taking in feedback and developing Killing Floor where it is today is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nBut the distinctive lack of foxes makes me mad so I'll give this game a 1/10.\n\nActually Killing Floor is a phenomenal series so I'll give it 9/10.","April 23, 2015","true","792.9"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","76","64","84","20","6"

I don't know a thing about it. I wouldn't be able to advise you on expert tips, like the Crossbow has a 7.8x multiplier for headshots, or the Scrake is resistant to explosives, but vulnerable to the Katana. I don't even know what a Scrake is, or that he has a chainsaw for an arm. All I can tell you, is that anyone who has played this for 700+ hours, must be a psychopath, who obviously enjoys killing zombies way too much. I would be wary of such people, unless of course you have a penchant for similiar activities. If that is the case, you will enjoy this game......or at least, that is what I have been told, because I wouldn't know?\n\n\nNovember 2015 Supplement:\nNow that I have reached 9999.9 hours, what label could be used to describe me, if a "psychopath" is only 700+ hours?\n\nMalcolm Gladwell has eminently suggested, 10,000 hours of practice is necessary to become a 'master'. Throughout the 6 years of playing Killing Floor, I have observed my performance improve steadily.  When I reached the 4k hour mark, I felt I was becoming one of the better players in the game.  At 6k hours, I expected my performance to plateau, but every 1000 hours thereafter, I still noted refinement in my style and I was surprised by this. After 9k hours, I was completing tasks that I couldn't imagine possible, even after completing it.  Players were questioning if I could die.\n\nWith 6 more minutes of gameplay, I should acknowledge Mr Gladwell's theory, with a quote from another Darth and say "the circle is now complete....now I am the master"!  A noble mentor, such as Obi Wan Kenobi, would ponder the effect of Killing Floor and comeback with "only a master of evil, Darth".  Perhaps that is what someone should be called, if they have 10,000 hours of Killing Floor gameplay; a "master of evil"!  I'm going to go with Obi's wisdom and save my soul.   I will NOT play that final six minutes!  The circle will not be complete! You have failed Tripwire Interactive, I (still) am a 'noob-i'!\n\nP.S.  Although my Steam Profile states 10,000 hours, it's actually 9999.9 hours (i.e. 6 minutes less) – the Profile rounds the value up.  My Killing Floor Review reports the result to a more accurate 0.1 hours instead.  I hope noone notices, that I have two other accounts, with additional hours of gametime.  Of course, I will deny all knowledge that it was actually me!","November 30, 2010","true","999.9"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","74","45","61","14","26"

Seven years after its release and this game is still going strong. The gameplay is solid and well-balanced; every class and every weapon has a place in the game. Leveling up can be a pain but it's ultimately worth it.\n\nThe people in KF tend to be a bit smarter than the typical co-op player; I've hardly seen any trolls in-game and most people at least make an attempt to play well. My only warning is to be careful of what servers you play on. I've been immediately banned from games for poor or nonexistent reasons. Laughably, the admins of KF servers tend to be worse-tempered than the players. Don't be suprised if you get booted from a game.

It's good, but unfortunately far from perfect. A nice addition to the survival-horror genre though, and it has an attractively cheap price tag.Once a mod now a game on its own, Killing Floor confronts the player with hordes of undead minions threatening his character’s life. While being independent enough of zombie-shooter-king Left 4 Dead with features like sealing doors, character perks and weapon stores, the game itself offers little variety and a flawed AI.It's not the sort of game that future generations will gather to celebrate, linking hands and singing sad songs of fond remembrance. It is, however, clever, boisterous, faintly silly and relatively cheap.Hectic coop multiplayer game offers no story but straight–forward nonstop mayhem in stylish locations. Rich and balanced equipment makes the multiplayer clashes all the fun.Ultimately though, the sort of plotless killing gets old, or at least it did for me.A decent little title, and a testament to just how far you can take your hobby if you but try.","June 28, 2014","true","16.4"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

Old game engine, no story really to care of, good gun mechanics, hard learning curve relative to modern FPS's (COD MW, Battlefield); balanced game play, rewards skill over earned perks/guns.\n\nThe Long:\nIt's kind of weird to have a game with really a rubbish, tissue thin premise and graphics from a decade ealier to have anything really to offer in this COD MW era of FPS.  On a whim and a steam sale, I bought KF just for kicks.\nBy the looks of it I have the guns, the companions and a dumb AI to deal with, this should be a cake walk for an hour or so, and then I'm back to Far Cry 3/BD...well, Far Cry is crying in its lonely corner with Michael Biehn for a while now.... What KF lacks in graphic polish and writing, it has in game balance, this is  where the classes are complimentary towards each other, every shot counts when things get thick and there are no gun/bomb/airstrike/gunship to save you. If you're not playing to the strengths of your class, your team mates will and do yell viciously at you. The real satisfaction is when you play with a good team and beating up the baddies :3\nEven if you find that it's getting easy to survive then just crank up to Hell on Earth, and you'll find out how old school FPS Killing Floor will drag down your ego. There also is a huge modding community given KF's relative small player pool against the likes of COD and Battlefield.

You cannot play the game for the first time and jump to a higher difficulty and expect to do good. You won't. The game has quite a bit of a learning curve. Even for people who have been playing awhile, taking jumps to higher difficulty is tough.\nThe game is very in depth with multiplayer. Each of the 7 perks has their pros and cons, and each has a "role" for the team. One of the most fun things is getting a team of friends, working together and owning the Patty. ;) When it really comes down to it, the most important thing about playing CO-OP KF, is knowing your role. What to do, and not to do, and when playing with a team, not knowing what to do can kill you all.\nThere are 7 different perks, or specialists. Each perk has specific weapons for their class. There's also a leveling system for the perks. With each level you gain your perk gets better.\nThe weapon mechanics are great. The wide range of weapons and weapon types is even better. There's everything from swords, to snipers, to flamethrowers, multiple kinds of pistols, ETC. There really is something for everyone.\nNow, I've read some reviews and some people have said that the game is "pay to win" and that you need the DLC weapons. Wrong. You most certainly do not need them to win, and half of them are kinda sucky anyway.\nThe maps are all different and cool, plus there's hundreds of workshop maps to play.\nAnd if you find yourself headbanging to the games soundtrack... you are not the only one. It's sweet.\n\nI recommend this game 100%. I feel the developers truly care about their product and I have never anticipated a sequel as much as I am KF2.","September 27, 2014","true","797.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

While there are normal solo and objective mode along with mods, the real value comes from multiplayers as this game's main value is through co-op.\n\nThis game have 5 difficulties:\nBeginner (Every zeds drop like flies if you hit them enough)\nNormal (A bit more challenge, needs slightly more coordination between teams, but spam and pray method still works)\nHard (A more difficult challenge, needs better coordination between teams, spam and pray method is not so effective anymore, even level 6s can die pretty quick in hard)\n\nWhy do I stop here? Because the last two difficulties will be discussed later. Now... for first-timers...\n\nYou start out knowing nothing, level 0 perks, killing zeds is your priority, getting powerful guns are a chore, people (in pub games) don't give you money when you need that last $20 for an aa12 or m32 grenade launcher, you spam and pray hoping that those big monsters will die. How come my nade didn't work when the siren screams?\n\nYou went on to play in normal, zeds are harder, that big glowy guy along with that chainsaw dude eat you alive, the patriach kills you like you are nothing. At this point, majority of first-timers went back to beginner, stayed in normal or hard difficulty and very rarely went up to the last two difficulties. Now, this is the point where most players do not continue playing. I have to say that because:\n\n- It takes a lot of commitment to be good in this game, a lot of grinding perks (getting those medic heals, headshots, stalker kills), repetitive maps, even the old status of the game does play a part (as it is 5+ years old which in gaming industry it can be considered a bit out-dated) along with KF2 coming out in full release soon.\n\nFor those that actually stayed and grind those perks, you might finally reach a level 6 which is the highest perk level for one of the perks, finding out you can kill zeds more efficiently, less money to buy guns and ammo at trader, and killing that big glowy guy and chainsaw guy (which now you might know as fleshpounds and scrakes respectively). Nonetheless, the last two difficulties on Killing Floor can and mostly be considered as a 'filter' to see if one does actually have the will and skill it takes to survive. I myself, was a part of these players, spamming aa12 shotguns at scrakes and fleshpounds hoping they will die. But a player and a small number of other players mentioned the ineffectiveness of such methods. At this point as well, some will listen, some won't. Those who don't, will just stay in normal and hard difficulty forever, but will be hard-pressed to survive in higher difficulty.\n\nThen, one day, after you actually meet a player who you considered as very good (or an expert or can even be considered legends) and listens, a whole new world opens up filled with even more stuff and knowledge. This factor along with a solid teamwork (which are paramount) for the last two difficulties:\n\n- Suicidal (Even more difficult, as zed's HP and their damage goes up along with other limitations such as you can't flinch lock sc with katana, pray and spray method are detrimental. Most level 6 'hard-dwellers' would wipe a lot here. The level of teamwork is a step or two up compared to hard and specific perk roles are a must)\n\nAnd once you spend hours learning from the 'expert/pro/legendary' players on multiple ways to kill sc or fp with different perks, you feel ready to take on the highest difficulty:\n\n- Hell on Earth (The highest difficulty, perks with specific roles along with solid communication and teamwork are paramount. Patriach fight is very challenging and damages that the zeds give out along with HP are more painful. One mistake on a critical point could mean an instant wipe even when you have those expert/pro/legendary players)\n\nAt this point, you learn even more ways and tactics to survive Hell on Earth and beat the patriach. Then you realised... when you went down to normal and hard, it becomes almost too easy and people start to notice you killing fp in seconds before it even reaches the team. Before you know it, you are that 'expert' player.\n\nIt needs to be noted that the learning curve goes up exponentially from Hard to Suicidal because the multitude of skills, abilities, and knowledge learned to survive there. If you managed to read and keep on going till this point, congratulations because you are part of the top 5% of Killing Floor players.\n\nThen.. does it end there? When you finally got all the achievements (looking at you, Schneidzekk kill while falling and the one for FP in the back with dwarf axe) ? No, actually. Because there are lots of methods to kill the big zeds (sc, fp and patriach). When you rejoice at the fact that you are finally able to properly lock the patriach with the katana/machete/knife/welder/syringe and dance around it as it tried to chain guns you, you find out there is actually a tournament... with teams all over the world trying to beat each other with the fastest time!\n\nYou took the initiative and form a team with your other expert/pro/legendary friends from different countries, you practice, find faster camp spots, certain tactics as you improved your individual and teamwork skills even more. You also find that your teammate's skills as a whole have developed significantly as well, so much that it would not be possible in a normal setting. Strategies are formed, discussions, insults, banters are made. And then tournament comes, as you play in the opening rounds which are recorded for anyone around the world to watch, you wonder to the first time you decided to actually start playing this game, the moment you actually listens to advices and how it lead you from a spam-and-pray player to a solid Hell on Earth player to actually play in a very solid team against the best teams in the world.\n\nThe training, discussions, friendships made, skills learned, I think in the end, it was worth it.\nIf you actually played the game till this point, then congrats... as you are probably a very solid Hell on Earth player.\n\nFor the others that might not have the same 'eagerness', it is a fun game to play with friends, and hey, burning zeds to death is fun too :P\n\nI r8 8/8 m8.","March 1","true","592.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","7"

I spent roughly 25 hours with it which is nothing as you need at least 50 to 60 hours of gametime to be able to experience the true challenge this game has to offer.\n\nYou play with your friends and the 4 of you keep eliminating hordes of zombies. After each wave you can spend your hard-earned cash by purchasing better equipment and, of course, ammunition to the available weapons. You can only visit these vendors for a short period of time. This is what you do and, basically, you keep repeating this process till the 11th wave which is the boss battle.\n\nNow, the game has perks (skills) which refer to each weapon category. There aren't that many levels but levelling-up takes quite the time so you should keep killing these infected. Once you have levelled up decently you and your pals can go to a higher difficulty.\n\nIt is similar to Left 4 Dead in certain ways, however, Killing Floor is not as fast paced. Also, I like how the vendor is placed always somewhere else (on higher difficulties you have less time to do the shopping). In addition to this, the game encourages you to work together. The best example for that is the fact that healing others than yourself works better.\n\nAlthough Killing Floor is outdated in term of graphics, its gameplay can easily compensate you for that. The sequel should be on your wishlist already if you are a KF fan!","September 23, 2014","true","22.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","6"

(I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a bad thing or not)\n\nSo, the zeds are scary and strong, perks are useful, but what about the guns?\nTripwire is known for realistic and great sounding and animated guns, so each shotgun feels powerful as you blast something to bits, each rifle has a high-recoil but also a high potentional damage output, but since this is a game with zombies, we have some some fictional guns as well, such as a fireball-cannon, a laser which can also slow down zeds, SMGs that can also shoot medic-darts at allies and much more. (There are 3 dlc weapon packs which unlock 4 weapons each, it's not pay-to-win DLC as the weapons are side-grades, not upgrades.)\n\nOh! almost forgot to mention that there are a lot of melee-weapons too!\n\nThe game was released in 2009, but Tripwire is still supporting it with seasonal events (Summer, Halloween and Xmas) which give the zeds themed-reskins, new maps (or Objective mode missions), new achievements and sometimes new weapons, most of it for free, but with Killing Floor 2 on it's way, I cannot guarantee that this will happen again in the coming years.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a fun and challenging survival-horror co-op game that offers you plenty of content and hours of fun, look no further, there is a wave of mutants waiting to be eradicted.. or eradicate you.","June 11, 2014","true","554.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","3"

Данную игру воплотили на свет чудотворцы из компании Tripwire Interactive и выпустили 14 мая 2009 года. Адриналиновый экшен, в котором шестёрке выживших предстоит отбиваться от кровожадных и голодных мутантов. Более 16 видов оружия, расчлененка и ураганный игровой процесс прилагаются.\n\nПричиной тотального апокалипсиса стала корпорация Horzine Biotech, которая получила от государства заказ на создание идеальных солдат, и профессор  Кевин Кламели, сделавший прорыв в области регенерации (востоновлени), научился клонировать людей и управлять их разумом. Вскоре учёный создаёт огромную и безграничную армию зомби и с ней решает завоевать Великобританию.\n\nВ игре есте два режима гемплея:\n\n1. Выживание: массовое уничтожение мутантов-зомби, несколько волн с сотней монстров, которые нужно пережить вам и вашим напарникам, а также мощнейший финальный босс Патриарх (это и есть учёный Кевин Кламели) для каждой карты. Впаги лезут изовсех щелей и нужно быть внимательным, держаться вместе и по ходу игры выробатывать тактику боя против монстров.\n\n2. Прохождение: в игре к сожалению выбор карт данного режима пока что не велик - всего 3. Суть будет в том что вам с вашими пропагандистами нужно пройти карту, выполняя ряд заданий для дальнейшего продвижения группы вперёд и в итоге одалеть Патриарха.\n\nВ игре есть ещё 9 противников:\n\nЗомби — самый часто встречаемый враг, может «хватать» игрока, не давая возможности ходить.\n\nТолстяк — толстый мутант. Может как изрыгать желчь на игроков с небольшого расстояния, так и бить ножом мясника, подойдя в упор. (другие твари получают тоже урон от её желочи, наступая на неё).\n\nПолзун — интересный эксперемент со скрещиванием гибридов человека и паука. Быстрый, малозаметный, и довольно опасный в больших количествах. (меня всегда бесят).\n\nБерсеркер — обладает вживлённым мечом вместо правой руки, передвигается с большой скоростью, но большую часть времени существования он безопасен на расстоянии.\n\nСталкер —  невидимый мутант, но во время атаки становится видимой. (и в принципе её увидеть, когда она невидимая, не составляет друда).\n\nОбодранный — противник со встроенной в руку ракетницой, довольно опасен в группах. Атакует огненной смесью на дальнее расстояние, и, подойдя вплотную, атакует врукопашную.\n\nСирена — медленная женщина-мутант, клонированная жена Патриарха, криком снижает здоровье и уничтожает гранаты/взрывчатку/ракеты. (броник не ломает)\n\nМясник — сильный мутант, чрезвычайно опасный в ярости, атакует вживлённой в руку бензопилой. (совет: в ближнем бою (тока не ножём) бейте его на небольшём растоянии и не бойтесь его бить; ваши удары немного его "контузят" и в скоре вы его даже одни вальнёте).\n\nОтбивальщик — очень сильный мутант, чрезвычайно опасный в ярости в которую он приходит от атак игроков, набрасываясь на них и перемалывая своими похожими на камнедробилки руками (убивайте его сразу же всей группой, иначе потерь не миновать).\n\nУ вас есть возможность выбрать вам подходящий перк из 7 возможных:\n\nМедик — получает бонусы в обращении с MP7M и МР5M. Имеет бонусы к скорости перемещения, эффективности лечения, устойчивости к желчи Толстяка и к получаемому урону в целом. Броня данного перка защищает лучше и стоит меньше.\n\nТехник — получает бонусы в обращении с дробовиками, быстрее заваривает двери, не позволяя противникам пройти, может нести больше единиц оружия, большее количество гранат, урон которых также увеличен.\n\nСнайпер — получает бонусы в обращении со снайперским оружием, неавтоматическим оружием и пистолетами, урон в голову от его оружия больше.\n\nКоммандос — видит невидимых Сталкеров и Патриарха с более дальнего расстояния, нежели другие классы, также видит здоровье противников, получает бонусы в обращении с автоматами.\n\nБерсеркер — получает бонусы в обращении с оружием ближнего боя, бонусы к скорости ударов и перемещения, устойчив к желчи Толстяка и к получаемому урону в целом. Не может быть схвачен Зомбами.\n\nПоджигатель — получает бонусы в обращении с зажигательным оружием, иммунен к огню. Начиная с третьего уровня его гранаты заменяются на поджигающие.\n\nПодрывник — получает бонусы в обращении со взрывчаткой и гранатомётами, устойчив к взрывам.\n\nНа этом у меня всё. Надеюсь данный обзор окажеться весьма и весьма полезным. Играете тока в ХОРОШИЕ игры.","November 4, 2014","true","120.6"," 94 of 161 people (58%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","58","94","161","18","13"

The zeds include clots, bloats, gorefasts, stalkers, sirens, crawlers, husks, Scrakes (SC), and Fleshpounds (FP). You have to stay alive for 10 waves of these horrible creatures that slowly gets progressively worse with/ as a bunch of psychopaths. Until the end of each round where you trade with a... horny? perverted? trader who will take dosh you earn from killing zeds (bounty) to give you more guns. HOWEVER! You can only carry 15kg of equipment (it increases if you're a support). There are 7 balanced classes in the game as follows: Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug, and Demolitions. Finally, surviving all 10 waves you then have to fight the patriarch an evil clone of Horzine's CEO along with some lower class zeds. Killing Floor features 5 difficulties (Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, [HoE] Hell on Earth). These difficulties are built for higher leveled perks in correlation.\n\nMy personal thoughts about KF:\nSo I've just clocked in over 300 hours and have started to get comfortable on suicidal difficulty. So i figured it was time to rewrite my cheesy review and do a serious review for, what is now one of my favorite PC titles, Killing Floor. I got this game around a year ago after i got a steam account for ~$5 and immediately fell in love with the charm this game has.  Between the cheap one liners, slow motion decapitation, and heavy metal rifts.  Also the leveling is very addicting at first, even when you're grinding for stalkers as a commando.  However, i was just scratching the surface of this game.  Although it has a great controls for a zombie co-op game, addicting leveling, and loads of teamwork on harder difficulties. The one thing not a lot of reviews talk about is the learning curve to this game, and how well situated it feels as you level up your perks you slowly learn more and more tricks and tactics in the game that help you survive until you finally get up to Suicidal/ HoE servers with 6 man teams.  Killing Floor is so well-built compared to most games that start out as mods and has such depth to it that allows you to have fun even after you've played West London 100+ times and you're still not done with it. Not to mention how no matter how many times you successfully 1v1 a fleshpound as a bezerker, uppercut a scrake as a support, etc. you still feel like a bonafide badass.  All in all, this game is worth every penny even if it isn't on sale, or was $60 dollars currently. Why? Because this game grows on you and will give you hours and hours of entertainment as you go from dying on normal due to 1 or 2 sirens to taking down the patriarch on HoE.\n\nSummary?: This game is great, no matter if you only want to put 10 hours into it, or hundreds upon thousands of hours into it.","December 14, 2014","true","469.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

You go through different maps with hordes of zombies charging at you from all sides where you have to watch your back or else you could be instantly dead.  It is fun to play with four to six people including you.\n\nGameplay: Aiming is lackluster some with the variety of weapons you get to buy after each wave ends and another begins. Once a wave ends the trading shop is open where you spend money that you just got from fighting through hordes of zombies each wave. Your money stacks up once you kill more and more enemies and you lose money when you die before a wave ends. There is a red-line that helps guide you along your way to find the shop; though your usually given only thirty seconds of time to make it there , purchase your new weapon or weapons and buy ammo.\n\nGraphics: Graphics are on par with the first Left 4 Dead graphics. Everything is crisp and it is well optimized for various different machines.\n\nCommunity: When I look at steam charts this game is usually high up there still just like the Left 4 Dead series with how many lobbies are open and how many players play at any given time. They also have the community workshop implemented in this game where others can create some cool things.\n\nOverall: The game feels more simplistic with its shooting mechanics then does Left 4 Dead which I like. It is fun, addictive like some other shooters like Left 4 Dead series of course and Call of Duty. You can hear zombies moaning, groaning and hear loud noises of a female zombie called a siren that let's out a large squeal before she is attacked.\n\n10/10 Time well spent and enjoyed it better than what I have played and seen from Left 4 Dead 2.","March 22, 2015","true","62.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I use that word not to describe the game itself but the describe the experience you have with other players. It's the community that makes this game fun. The majority of the people on my friends list are people I have met through Killing Floor. There are a few who I have never spoken to outside of the game, there are a few that I speak to on a daily basis and there are a few who I have actually met in person.\n\nWould I recommend this game?

You can pick between 6(?) specializations (or classes) that improve your efficiency with specific weapons and skills.\n\nThere is no crosshair in this game, meaning you will have to center your aim by yourself or use the iron sights properly. Weapons are quite cool and feel nice, everything around shooting feels nice in this game.\n\nThe DLC this game has is a little *too* much, and mostly it's just skins that don't affect gameplay, except for the Community Weapon Packs which include new, different and mostly fun weapons (that probably could be a bit overpowered sometimes, depending on the user).\n\nThere is one downside about this game though, and that is the community. Teamwork is rare for this game, and most of the time people decide to be a Berserker (melee specialized class) carelessly or be a Medic and not make use of their healing kit. If you do manage to find friends to play this with, it all might be better then.\n\nOverral, as much as the community can be bad, it's a great game by itself.

The game has a wide variety of guns to choose from as well, and each map is highly detailed and can contain secrets/mini easter eggs for you to find.\n\nAlso with the end of each wave you have to venture out to wherever the trader will be this time around, thats right, no camping until the final wave comes.. My only complaint however is how DLC is advertised and there is so much bloody DLC. DLC for gun variations? No thanks..\n(You can actually replace the DLC advertisement video with mods.)\n\nOverall though, a fun co-op game with a decent soundtrack to fight the hordes alongside. Map design is amazing too.\n8/10 for it's purpose.","July 10, 2014","true","18.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Even though the objective is always the same (survival). The addition of the killing floor Objective Mode just added to the charm of the game, giving us tasks and objectives to complete as per the modes description. What i like about the game is it never gets boring, the DLC is great, and the demands on the PC are low which is useful to those with lower end PC's who struggle to keep up with modern games, i honestly think this is one of the best FPS games to date, and for those of you don't like peer to peer competitive, then this is the game for you! All the fun of FPS, without the competitive nature of the game, just pure Co-Op, team orientated survival.

British People vs Zombies: The game. Complete with Dosh, Heavy Metal, more stereotypical Brits than a Monty Python sketch, and over 32 of some of the beefiest, most satisfying Zed-killing weapons you'll encounter in a video game. There's even 'Loadsamoney' himself, Mr Harry Einfeld, present and accounted for to wreck the Zed menace.\n\nThis is a game where you need to play on a difficulty higher than 'beginner' to experience. The fun of this game comes from it's challenge, and while I can understand people liking their games as easy, simple fun, the real 'survival horror' elements of this game come out when you're up against tougher enemies. I personally don't find this game scary due to the undertone silliness from all the characters models and event Zeds, but I still have a lot of fun with this game.\n\nDespite coming out back in 2009, Tripwire Interactive have been supporting this game for the last 4 years, and with each update, event and DLC pack they've added, the game's got better and better!\n\nSo go ahead and pick up a copy of this now! Hell, get the 'bundle' copy which contains 90% of the game's DLC for only slightly more (trust me, most of it may be character models, but by god are they worth it).\nIf you ever wanted a video game equivalent of Shaun of the Dead, you need to play this.","January 20, 2014","true","201.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

A 4 pack of reskins that for years sold for €1,99 now costs €7. The weapons DLC ranges from useless to under powered and OP, and in most cases players use the OP weopons only.\n\nGame no longer has any balance or any real challenge whatsoever as most every class other than the Commando and Demo are OP.\nSome of it is due to changes TWI made to the core game mechanics, others are due to OP DLC weapons.\n\nThe higher difficulty servers are all but empty. On a good night I can find maybe 5 populated Hell on Earth servers.\nSeems most players these days use power leveling maps to get to level 6, and then play on "hard", which as a level 6 is so easy it is almost like playing with cheats, that and some of them join Hell on Earth games late on, wave 7 and up, and then proceed to get everyone killed due to not having the slightest clue of how to play the game.\n\nPricing increases are now the standard way of balancing weapons.\nThe M99 was very OP when it was added, so TWI changed the price of the ammo to £250 per single round, and this is now the current system for dealing with OP weapons, at least some of them, other OP wepons are just left as is.\n\nSeveral age old bugs and glitches such as hit box bugs are still not, and will probably never be fixed.\n\n\nCan still be fun if you can find a good team, (which btw, has become more and more difficult), but wait for a sale as the game is no longer worth €17,99","February 26, 2014","false","171.2"," 184 of 334 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","184","334","7","10"

Your objective is simple; survive. Between each wave, a shop will open up somewhere on the map and an arrow will guide your path to find it. The trader has several weapons you can purchase and you can restore your armor and ammunition for a price.\n\nThe game calls itself cooperative survival horror and while the objective in every game is survival, this is straight up in your face action horror. The monsters just come at you. There are still times where you can turn around to find half a dozen monsters trailing you. It keeps piling on the mutants and raises the intensity wave after wave.\n\nThe game plays smooth, the controls are what you’d expect from a first person shooter using a mouse and keyboard. There are buttons for firing, iron sights, alternate firing, jumping, crouching, throwing grenades, reloading, running and changing your weapon. While the game lets you chose controller input, there are no native controls for it. You need to set everything yourself.\n\nWhile the game excels in being just a horde-style game with waves of enemies, it is just that. The maps might be different, but you will run through the same enemies depending what wave you get to. The game is devoid of objectives outside of your own survival. The maps are large, so they do offer a variety of spaces, but you can fight in the same area of a map over and over again, even if the shops opening across the map encourage you to find a different place to do battle.\n\nFor anyone that chose to play offline, Killing Floor does offer a single player experience where you select a difficulty and face your foes alone. Your inventory consists of primary weapons, secondary pistols, melee weapons, a med kit and a welding torch. The torch is to seal doors shut to make it tough for enemies to get in. It also might keep you from getting out if a room fills with enemies, but leaving one door open and guarding it is a good enough tactic. Enemies will still drop in from the ceiling or jump off rooftops. You have health and body armor, both deplete when taking damage, but your health can be restored with some self stimulus while the armor needs to be purchased in from the trader.\n\nTo reward you your play style there are perks that you can select between waves or games. These seven perks work like classes to benefit certain styles. Each perk starts you off with a different set of weapons. These benefits are things like faster welding speed, more damage, more health, discounts on combat armor and so on.\n\nThe support specialist is good with shotguns. The sharpshooter is geared for crossbows and sniper rifles.The commando uses assault rifles and grenades. The field medic will heal others. Berserkers prefer melee weapons. Demolitions make things go boom with big weapons and firebugs make fires. The game still allows you to purchase any weapon from the store and you can get experience for any perk just by killing enemies with weapons from that class.\n\nThe graphics are great and they really add a beauty to the macabre ugliness of the gore and gruesome monsters. You’ll be exploding heads with every head shot and throwing the game into slow motion for improved accuracy. The maps have a lot of lighting effects, dreary lights, blue hues in rainstorms and a whole series of cheerful lights turned haunting by a creepy atmosphere.\n\nThe maps offer a vast variety of horrific playgrounds. Dark, sleek nightmarish landscapes. The game started with five maps, but it continues to grow. Abandon shools, hell, a creepy amusement park, ice caves, moon bases, even santa’s workshop was brought out for Christmas. New enemy skins have been produced in the game’s long existence. Its a real testament to how the developer has supported Killing Floor for this long.\n\nThe maps are free, because they need you to come back in order to purchase optional downloadable content. Everything from weapon packs and character skins. While it is a way to keep the game going to produce new content and keep you engaged, a lot of people might see it as a cash grab. Since you’re all fighting cooperatively against monsters, no one will ever be better than you, but they will just look different than you.\n\nWith that being said, there are a lot of free mods that you can download from the Steam Workshop to make your game look different and offer interesting ways to change the game. So for everything that you can purchase, there are still free things made by fans. Usually content taken from other games and franchises such as Doom 3’s monsters and Xenomorphs from the Aliens cinemas.\n\nIn terms of character customization, there are several character skins to chose from. They do nothing other than change the look of your character to other players. There are no mirrors to admire yourself in game when you’re grenading monsters to death.\n\nKilling Floor is still a fun game and its been dirt cheap in the past. It still has a booming community, but there are other games that offer horde mode and so much more.","April 4, 2013","true","5.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

For beginners, it has a lot of replayability value (since obtaining level six perks takes quite a while) which can take from 100-200 hours. After that, due to the Steam Workshop, there are a lot of options of playing with modded content. There are also dedicated custom servers with custom skins, perks, levels, weapons and more! (I recommend International Gaming Community btw ;) ) The gameplay isn't something to write home about, but there is something about that hooks you on. It's not as team intensive as L4D2, (as in, when there's only one person left, they're basically dead) but it does get close to that point. It's harder to understand the mechanics than L4D2 (since different weapons at different levels for different perks do different thigs to different enemies on different difficulties at different.. see what I'm getting at here?) BUT, once you get the hang of it, the game is tons of fun to play! Get a friend or two, (or three, or four, or five!) and get into a server and go spend hours and hours leveling up! :D\n\nIn conclusion, want to shoot zombies with your friends while having a level up game mechanic with different kinds of enemies and perks? Go buy this game! You won't regret it ESPECIALLY since it goes on sale all the time for as low as 5 dollars!","February 12, 2011","true","831.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RageVG/recommended/1250/","RageVG","RageVG 🍆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RageVG/","144 products in account","Now that the sequel has been announced I figured I'd write a review for what is perhaps my most favorite game of the past few years.\n\nKilling Floor is a brilliant FPS survival horror, and perhaps the best (At least in my opinion) wave-based game out there. The game has a balance of gritty and serious environments and witty and morbid humor. The idea that you are working your way through a horde of genetically engineered monsters to finally go toe-to-toe with the final boss gives you that sense of achievement. And going toe-to-toe with the final boss is an achievement in itself; with traits from all other specimen combined and then some, you'll need a lot of bullets.\n\nA key aspect of Killing Floor is co-op. with seven different perks to play as that fill different roles in a team, you're gonna have a hard time doing it alone. Synergy with other players is key; you could just as easily doom another player as opposed to helping them. There is a lot more to the game than it seems at first glance. All of the specimen have different nuances and behavioral quirks that you will need to learn to survive. Fortunately the Beginner mode is very forgiving so you have plenty of opportunity to get some practice in. However, the difficulty curve is like a brick wall; it's not uncommon for even veteran players to fall to the horde on even the lower difficulties.\n\nThe game is very community-driven. There are a lot of custom content for the game which is fully supported, and even some of the DLC and updates are filled with community-created content. You can expect new maps, weapons, enemies, characters, game modes and mutators.\n\nDespite being an old game it still looks beautiful and has an incredible soundtrack. There is plenty of content for this game and the only people I wouldn't suggest this game to are the squeamish.","May 9, 2014","true","761.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FSUBoo/recommended/1250/","FSUBoo","Kami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FSUBoo/","339 products in account","I had done a short/quick review on this a while back, but now with the introduction of the steam reviews system, I figured I might as well take the time and do a proper review for this game.\n\nKilling Floor is by far my most played steam game, and was the entire reasoning for me getting a steam account in the first place.  A friend sent me the "guest pass" for Killing Floor and had me try it out, and then ended up gifting me it for $5 when I enjoyed it.  I first got Killing Floor in August of 2009, so 4 years later and I still play this game daily pretty much.  The replay value is through the roof, not to mention if you buy it on one of the frequent sales (I've seen Killing Floor more than 50% off at least TEN times in the year 2013 so far) will put it under $10 USD.  DLCs might have become a little pricey over the past few years, but the fact that Tripwire Interactive still does free content updates for this game nearly FIVE YEARS post release is simple mind blowing.  I don't know of any other company that continues support for it's product that long into the future.  The few companies that continually support releases that I can think of have all produced sequels to those games.\n\nNow to get down to gameplay.  Killing Floor first and foremost is a FPS game.  There are a variety of different types of guns, spread around in 7 different perks or classes.  These perks have a "progression system" that allows a player to get more "profficient" with the weapons of their classes and earn more "bonuses" such as being able to carry more ammo, do more damage, and other things of that nature.  Each perk has a different role which helps a team in it's own unique way.  Like making things blow up, then Demolitions is the perk for you with it's LAW, M32 multiple grenade launcher, m79, and others..  Like setting things on fire and feeding the inner pyromaniac in yourself?  Then firebug is the perk for you with it's flamethrower, flare revolvers, Husk fireball launcher, and other guns with incendiary ammo.  Enjoy the satisfying feeling of blowing an enemies head off?  Then pick the sharpshooter perk, with it's assortment of pistols, sniper rifle, compound crossbow, or various rifles.  Killing Floor has the most satisfying gun play of any game I've ever played.  Excellent feel to the weapons, and they look and sound great.\n\nWhen it comes to enemies, there are 10 different types of enemies to deal with.  Each one of the "zeds" are similar in some ways, but different in most.  There are the basic enemies, such as the clot, which can grab any perk aside from the beserkser.  Clots don't do all that much damage, but they can make you not able to move and allow the other, more dangerous enemies to get to you and do more damage.  Then you get to the more specialised enemies such as stalkers, which can go invisible, bloats, which puke "bile" on you which can hurt you and ruin your body armor, to sirens, whose screams can shatter glass, destroy rockets, grenades and explosives, break down the welds of doors, and eventually make your head explode, to the husk, resistant to fire attacks (for the most part) who can melee you when up close but is much more dangerous at distance where they can shoot fireballs at you. The more advanced of the enemies are the Scrake, which is a high health enemy with a chainsaw that if it gets close to you, it will start to saw away at your health.  If you are getting attacked by a scrake, don't run, because their full swings and charging attacks do exponentially more damage to you.  Scrakes are best left to sharpshooters which can stun it, berserkers which can do the same thing, or support specialists that know advanced "Techniques" to deal iwth them,Next you have the Fleshpound, which is a big, hulking enemy with high health and hard to kill.  High head damage resistance make it so it shrugs off weaker weapons.  Sharpshooters with good aim and fast reflexes can take them out in a number of ways, but can really only do so one at a time.  Support specialists get explosives bonuses, which make it a good choice to take out fleshpounds (unless there is a siren nearby).  Demolotions is the most polished perk to take down Fleshpounds, as they have a weakness to explosives.\n\nAfter you finish the "waves" of enemies, you then have to prepare to fight the boss of Killing Floor, the Patriarch.  The patriarch has some vicious melee attacks, and also has an arm with a rocketlauncher/chain gun combination that can and will kill you quick. Defeating the patrairch requires good teamwork and communication generally.\n\nLastly, but not least, is the fact that Killing Floor comes with a free to download SDK system that allows for modding of the game and creation of custom content.  This also comes with a community workshop area dedicated solely to Killing Floor.  So check out the steam workshop and try out some of the amazing modded content there is to offer.","July 3, 2011","true","354.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

I couldn't decide, but it was 75% discounted and I thought it is enough cheap for I can't act badly.\nI told you that little story because I want to know you how I felt before I have bought that game. If you feel so what I have felt, I suggest go and buy the 'Killing Floor'. Give it a chance.\n\nAbout the game.\nThe 'Killing Floor' is almost perfect game it own category.\nGood things:\n-Very optimized. It is good running on low computers.\n-Generate random waves (in specified limits), so all plays isn't same.\n-In higher difficult levels (if you can bear) most of players are a great team member.\n\nBad things:\n-Rarely when I have joined a server, I am moving strangely slow. Only need to do reconnect.\n-Some perks experience progress is very slow. Almost annoying. But, if you have a good friend, their can help to you make it easier get next perk level with 'Poundamonium' mutator. That is legal.\n-In weaker difficult levels have a few not good or bad players. They close the doors before you in, and they go so-called 'lonewolf'.\n\nOverall I recommend buy 'Killing Floor'.","November 11, 2013","true","021.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamn75/recommended/1250/","Gamn75","[N☼J] Rhinosaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamn75/","89 products in account","\nKilling Floor is a fantastic family game, which combines aspects of team building, puzzle solving, and perception. It will surely give you hours, or maybe even days of fun. When you start the game, you have the option to play by yourself or cooperative. Since this is a family game, playing solo is not recommended as it will not give you the full experience of Killing Floor. The co-op games can have up to 6 players, that means you, your brother or sister, your parents, maybe your favorite grandparents and your pet warthog. The goal is simple: Have as much fun as possible! You and your teammates will be put in classic maps like kf_abusementpark and kf_hellride. Before you can play, you will have to select a so called ''perk''. It is recommended that all players play field medic, because their special funbombs have a lovely green glow when thrown, but I'll come to that later. After everyone clicked on 'ready up' you will spawn in the chosen map. Take a moment to look around in these beautiful places, because there are many things to be seen. I myself have found a sleeping horse, a dancing robot, a man with a television head, and a mini caravan. Soon you will realize that you are in fact, holding a gun. This is a glitch that should be fixed by the developers, because people might get a wrong idea from what this game is about. It is recommended that you press "5" to switch to your love dispenser. Soon you will hear the joyful cheers of the npcs in this game. There is the Clot, a little elf that will hug you *with force*, the delicious Gingerbreadman, the beautifully constructed snowman called ''Husk'', the Siren (who will sing for you) , Rudolph the crawling reindeer, the Scrake (I think he's made out of ice cream :3), the Bloat (Santa Claus), the Patriarch (Bigger Santa) When these npcs hug your or give you colorful flying thingies, your screen will get red from ketchup, it is really fun! Oh and.. ahem.. the Stalker.  I'd like the developers to delete this npc, as it is inappropriately clothed. It does NOT belong in a family game like Killing Floor. I hope it is just a bug like the guns and other weapons in this game.\n\nOverall this game is fun, and you (or a family member) should defenitly get it, but the developers should really fix the various bugs in this game.\n\npi/5 would play again.\n\n","December 29, 2013","true","50.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","1"

Hell yeah!\nStarting out in KF was daunting for me, since i rarely play FPS games and my only previous experience was in Counter strike.\nTo top it off, i found that i didn't have on-screen crosshairs!\n\nNeedless to say, the first couple hours of playing this game usually resulted in me dying rather quickly to simple enemies like clots and gorefasts. Damn those buggers are fast..\n\nAs i continued playing the game, i learned about ammo conservation, and how to make shots count.\nOn lower difficulties you don't really need to worry about ammo too much - unless you're demolitions and shoot off a grenade at anything that moves.\nOn harder difficulties though, you really need to make your shots count, since there are more enemies, they take more shots to kill and you get less reward money for killing stuff.\n\nI have bought this game as a gift for several friends and had a absolute blast playing it.\n\nGrab it on sale or something, its really cheap and there's really no excuse why you can't afford it.\n\nOne of the best purchases i made on steam.","December 9, 2013","true","324.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Besides having a solid arsenal, there are some fearsome and gruesome enemies to be fought.\n\nKilling Floor takes place in England. Some scientists were toying with human tissue and ended up by mistake making zombie specimens. There are two types of modes in Killing floor : Killing Floor and Objective. Killing Floor mode is a horde defense type game. After every successful round, the player is allowed to upgrade buy more ammo for their arsenal. Every kill will equal more money for disposable income. Every new level becomes more difficult until the final boss appears. In objective mode, there are specific challenges that players need to pass against certain zombies. To win a round, at least one player needs to remain alive to win.\n\nThere are a lot of categories of weapons (or perks) to choose from as well as specific weapons. The categories are melee, pistols, support, commando, sharpshooter, firebug, demolition, field medic, berserker, perk neutral, and non-damaging. Melee weapons range from knives (almost spelt knifs), machetes, fire axes, katanas, chainsaws, claymores, sytches and a dwarves axe. Pistols range from regular 9mm to dual handcannons. Support comes in the form of shotguns, impalers, a "zed" thrower and a AA12. Commando weapons include bullpup, AK-47, M4 carbine, tommy gun, MKb and SCAR's. Sharpshooter weapons include lever-action rifle, single piston long musket, compound crossbow, M14 EBR and M99 AMR. Firebug guns include Mac-10, trenchgun, flare revolver and flamethrower. Demolition weapons include L.A.W, grenade launcher, seeker six, M4 203 with grenade attachment, Harpoon Bomber, m79 grenade launcher, orca bomb propeller, pipe bomb and grenade. Field medic weapons include Mp7, Mp5, M7A, Schneidzekk and the blower thrower bile launcher. There is a single berserker weapon which includes a buzzsaw bolt. Neutral perks include a zed eradication device as well as a MKII version and finally, non damaging weapons include medical syringes and a welder. You're probably wondering what the heck is a welder doing in the game? The welder can sort of "lock" or weld doors shut in the game. The AI is smart though and will take a different route in a certain door is locked. To un-weld a door, simply press alt+fire. Each perk is selected at the beginning of the round and can level up.\n\nGraphically, the engine is nice and the dismemberment of the hordes is awesome. Sounds are pretty decent and provide for a nice ambience. Some of the screams that come from the infected specimens is quite chilling.\n\nOverall, a pretty good game if you're hardcore into FPS, zombie and horde type genre. I have quite a few friends that do not like the game due to it's type but the mods can keep you coming back for more.\n\n\nRATING :  7.0/10","January 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

With the different perks, different 'classes' of ZEDs and countless amounts of (custom) maps (in either mindlessly-slay-'em-all or Objective modes) - Killing Floor never really gets boring, and sometimes even though you think, oh I played so much this week, I might not want to anymore ... hahaha, well, YOU'RE WRONG.\nLeveling up is quite easy in the beginning and later on takes a lot of determination (it takes quite some time to collect all the required kills/headshot/damage points etc) - but it still is fun and gives you even more purpose than just freeing a district, abandoned warehouse, or farming area one ZED at a time. The added advantages you gain with each level up are also great (and another incentive)!\n\nThe whole thing of earning money to buy your weapons is really cool. It's especially nice to see  when people really play as a team and help each other out when cash is short, or when they pick up an expensive weapon, after you tragically died defending your squad's core existence, to faithfully hand it back into your respawned hands.\nOf course, playing experience always depends on your co-players, and maybe the difficulty too (Normal is actually quite challenging already), and depending on the moon phase and the godesses' benevolent minds it can be quite a frustrating experience or the most fun you've had in a long, long time - so long ago, it's such a distant memory it doesn't quite come washing to the surface but just tickles your metaphorical gamer-nose with a satisfying, nostalgic odour.\n\nPersonally I've made some great gaming friends just by excessively indulging in playing Killing Floor. With some I talk and laugh a lot, and I adore them, and others, well ... we might not talk much, but when we're facing the ZEDs side by side, wave after wave, you can just feel the bonding experience hanging thick in the air between us. We do not need to talk. We just wordlessly decapitate together. It's great!\n\nI am very much in favour of this game and I am already anxiously looking forward to the successor - hoping that they are going to surprise me delightfully with more female playable characters. Because in Killing Floor there is the Traders, a people of monovular sisters ... clones, even? Who are in ownership of all the weapons available in these godforsaken places. No matter where you go, the ZEDs are there, the Traders are there (coincidence? I think not).\nIn terms of female playable characters, they are two that I am aware of.\nTwo.\nTwo?\nReally?\nTWO?\n(And you have to buy them. You do not even get to play a default female soldier or ANYone like that).\nBiggest booing!","June 21, 2014","true","238.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I would've recommended it quite some time ago, but TWI has been bogging the down with DLC for for too long.\n\nWhen it was kept to cosmetic-only DLCs, I didn't mind. It's just characters, so who cares? Then there was the IJC DLC weapons. Pay money to get overpowered weapons. It became a pay-to-win game. People WILL try to dismiss this with something like "Oh, it's co-op, who cares? It's helping you!"\n\nYeah, that doesn't change that I paid to play the game, not to watch someone else play it. Why pay $20 so you can watch the melee class with one of the most powerful ranged weapons clear out entire enemy waves in seconds?\n\nEver since, they've just been pumping out more of this as to try to pull as much money as they can from the game. From what I hear, they've done this with previous games as well.\n\nTruly unfortunate that such a good game was ruined like this.

Its addictive perk leveling system will keep me playing for days and days. This game is often compared to the Left For Dead series and while it is similar, the gameplay is very different. L4D is going from point A to B while KF is to try to survive each wave until you meet the boss. You have 7 perks/classes to choose from. Each perk has a role to play during the game and it's here that teamwork is needed to survive as the higher you go in difficulty the harder the game becomes for the entire team. You have a number of weapons to choose from depending on your chosen perk too. The game is quite easy to learn, survive each wave of specimens and go to the trader to buy weapons, armour, etc.  You'll then face the end of game boss, the Patriarch and he will take some skill to take down. He is heavily armed, and also very fast. Furthermore he can cloack making him even more of a threat as you'l often find him appearing in the middle of the team without any warning. The maps are very big and well designed too. A great team based game and i highly recommend it!","July 12, 2014","true","0.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murphyslawyer87/recommended/1250/","murphyslawyer87","Murphy's Lawyer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murphyslawyer87/","875 products in account","AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)\n\nGame Name: Killing Floor\nOriginal Release: 2009\nGenre Tags: FPS; Coop; Round-Based; Progressive\nMy Overall Grade: A+\nEstimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A\nMultiplayer Aspect: Primary\nRecommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Multiplayer gamers\nREVIEWKilling Floor is one of the most fun cooperative FPS games in existence. Team up with up to 5 other players to fight off waves of zombies mutants. Not necessarily groundbreaking, but somehow the concept has been reimagined in a unique and exciting way.  If you like cooperative FPS games, this should be a definite pick-up for you.\n\nThere are various types of mutants. Some are essentially “trash mobs,” but play a role in getting in the way. Then there are mid-tier and high-tier "specials" that all have unique attacks. These spawn less frequently, but can wind up overwhelming you if you don’t take them down quickly. And if you make it through all the waves in a match, there is a boss fight. If you play on the highest difficulty and with a full team, then these boss fights are easily the most fun and adrenaline-pumping boss fights in any cooperative shooter game like this.\n\nThere are 7 classes to play as.  You can play as all classes on your account, but only one at a time; and you will permanently level-up each class by playing.  Having higher levels is a must if you want to take on the higher difficulties.  On those high difficulties the true brilliance of the gameplay really shines. You’ll have to play smart and as a team if you want a chance to beat the maps on Hell on Earth. It can be incredibly challenging, and you may go a while without winning a single match. But when you finally do, it can be incredibly satisfying.\n\nHaving said that, it should be noted that the game also scales with the size of your team, and you can play solo which lowers the amount of enemies per wave and lowers their stats. Because of this, playing solo is actually easier for some, although if you make a single mistake its game over because there is no one to pick up the slack. I personally feel the game is way more fun with full teams (and thus full enemy spawns with max stats).\n\nAlso, there is a lot of DLC, but don't let that turn you off.  I have not bought a single DLC for this game, and have over 300 hours of fun and have nearly every achievement (except for two that I’m not worthy of).  That said, a couple of the DLCs are worth getting as they grant you access to some great weapons that are very effective and fun to use. And anyone who owns any DLC can drop the unlocked weapons in game for someone else to pick up for that match.\n\nSo if you like games like Left 4 Dead or Payday, this is very much in the same vein. However, it also has a great unique identity. It is a sure bet for anyone who likes cooperative shooters and challenging gameplay.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","321.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Yea but if you really hate the grind, you can easily DL a perk leveler map and train your stats if it bothers you that much.\n\nIs this game repetitive? Sure but that's also a key factor which makes it great. You know what is going to happen but on the harder levels, the antsy feeling of running away and shooting or barricading yourself in somewhere never goes away and that's awesome.\n\nReally just a big sandbox game. A lot of fun without friends but if you have friends, it is way more fun. The teamwork you get on some servers to stick together and watch everyone's backs is awesome and hilarious.\n\nI put this game down sometimes because of how repetitive it is but I always come back for more. Hopefully Killing Floor 2 will just learn from the few mistakes this game had and make a better version.\n\n\nIf i were to recommend a game that's wave-based, shoot-em-up with twenty-five or more guns that you use efficiently against armies of failed experiments that give you bounty cash when you kill them, so you can kill that in horrifically more brutal ways with better guns, as they slowly upgrade their army with bigger baddies until you fight an all-mighty boss that could rekt you without blinking, I'd recommend Killing Floor.\n\nSeriously, this game is my TOP FAVORITE, just because of how enjoyable it is. Yes, it may be old, and yes, it's not graphically impressive, but it's a damn good game. It has me STILL playing, even after hitting rank six with every class and gaining every annoying ♥♥♥♥ing achievement.\n\n\nWhy do i keep playing? Because it's fun, and because my friends have/love it. Playing by yourself on Hell on Earth, doesn't compare to the simple mayhem of playing with 6, or 64 other players (depending on what player-based mods are installed.) And, if you don't like the original ZEDS, you can re-mold them with extremely well-done mods like the Killing Floor: Dead Space mod, or the Aliens mod, to fight more horrific creatures. Hell, they even have mods to make the game ALMOST like DOOM.\n\nThere is weapon mods, character re-skins, maps, VEHICLES, and so many other amazing things. This game gets a 10/10, no matter how people string the BS. It's a great game, and has some amazing re-play value when you're trying new things out. Multiplayer is fun, single player is fun, and PLEASE don't say that popping a ZED's head of with a M99 ISN'T satisfying.\n\n10/10 best zombie shooter genre game of 2009-2015 (KF 2 EA in april of 2015)","May 3, 2015","true","036.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/1250/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Killing Floor is a co-op game, where you can play alone, about experiments gone wrong and invading London (and the world too as seen in KF2 and as seen on some KF maps). Your goal is to survive 4,7 or 10 waves of enemies, while earning money by killing them (or by healing your teammates) so that you can buy powerful weapons during the minute of calm at the trader between the waves. After, you'll have to defeat the Patriarch, who is the sole responsible for the chaos. You can choose different difficulties: Easy (which is really to learn the game), Normal, Hard, Suicidal and Hell on Earth.\n\nEnemies are thougher depending on the difficulty but you too can evolve and acquire advantages like spawning with a better weapon than a pistol or armor thanks to the level system. You have 6 of them and it takes time. However, you have different classes: medic (no powerful weapon but more resistance  and better health), commando (rifles and can see stalkers from apart), support (big guns and better welder), demo (everything that is explosive), berserker (melee and also can't be grabbed), sharpshooter (sniper and headshots more efficient) and firebug (flame everywhere).\n\nEnemies are varied: from the simple Zed to the infamous Fleshpound that can kill you quickly, without forgetting the Scrake and the chainsaw, the Gorefast that cuts you in pieces, the Crawler that loves your feet, the Stalker who is hidden, the Husk that launches fireballs, the Siren that is hurting your ears (and your health)....\n\nAnyway, the game in its actual state contains many maps (some are official, others done by modders) and mutators with Christmas-themed or Halloween-Themed or Circus-Themed enemies (because they were parts of special events). The maps are very varied: fair, tunnel of love, Santa's workshop or cave, asylum, Horzine labs, urban town, mountain, hospital, etc..\n\nBut you'll ask me: what about the DLC? Well, all the DLC are cosmetic. True, you have new weapons in them and they can be used for achievements. However, you can do them with the standard weapons, that are enough like the AA12 for example. And you can unlock avatars by playing with themed mutators for example or owning other games. And that's how you own two Mr Foster (the normal and the steampunk).\n\nKilling Floor in solo holds interest if you want to level without having a team to check or to win map achievements in Normal/Hard. An higher difficulty is better with a team, however, keep in mind that some of the players aren't using the perks for the team but for themselves. I've seen many medics choosing this perk for the advantages it's giving in terms of resistance or health but not healing at all the team for example. It's annoying as hell and if I seems to be upset by this kind of behavior, it's because I'm a medic first in this game, because I feel more useful by healing my teammates than beginning to put pipe bombs, welding the right doors or being a specialist of the crossbow. Healing is important in that game and if a medic is there, he's more powerful for the heal than the rest of the team. Not using of that fact can result in premature death on high difficulty.\n\nAnyway, with Killing Floor 2, I don't know if there are still a lot of players there. I still need to win Suicidal and Hell on Earth achievements, as I've all Hard and Normal and that all my perks are lvl5+. But it's still worthy to play. As long as there are servers and as long as the solo mode is there, Killing Floor is really a very strong co-op game. However, make sure that you're not discouraged when level 0. By patience, by learning and by leveling, you'll find more and more pleasure to survive these waves.","April 17, 2011","true","470.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellux/recommended/1250/","Hellux","Hellux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellux/","363 products in account","Killing Floor is an incredible co-operative survival shooter. You can play solo, or join up with up to 5 other players to face waves of specimen trying to kill you. The specimen are enemies with big variety. Some are weak but can be tough in groups. Some are tough and can kill your whole squad single-handedly if you're poorly prepared.\n\nAfter each wave the game will progressively become harder, and tougher specimen will spawn. Between each wave the trader will open up her shop and you will be able to purchase a variety of weapons. You all have a perk that gives you bonuses and makes you more effective with certain weapons and levels up as you play. For example Support specialist are good with shotguns, commandos with assault rifles, berserkers with melee weapons and so on. After all rounds are complete you will face the final boss, the patriarch, and your teamwork will be put to the test.\n\nThe game can get rather difficult. One big part about this game is the progression and the long learning curve. You won't be able to beat every map on the first try. You will learn about the enemies, the maps, the perks and the weapons as you play. And after mastering a difficulty you can move on to a higher difficulty and the rules will change. You will need new spots to defend at, new weapons to use and new tactics. This might be a drawback to some, but to somebody who likes long learning curves, it's perfect.\n\nThe graphics are very good but not the latest. The game is from 2009 but still has impressive graphics. It's well optimized and can run well on decent hardware. The maps varies in quality but some are very well made and makes for a very good atmosphere. The game has quite some gore. It is well made and can be enjoyed during the Zed time. Zed time is when the whole server goes slow motion for a few seconds. Watching a Fleshpund blow to pieces right before you just as he about to shred you to pieces in slow motion is nothing short of awesome.\n\nThe audio is also very good. The sound effects and the music are well made. The music changes from map to map and really adds to the atmosphere. It's fast-paced during the waves and makes shooting specimen a lot more fun.\n\nKilling Floor also has season events, three times a year. Every summer, halloween and winter all skins of the specimen change  during the event. New maps, weapons and achievements are also introduced. It keeps the game constantly fresh and always fun to come back to.\n\nKilling Floor is a really great game. It has improved a lot since it was released and still does wth constant updates. I highly recommend it.","December 23, 2013","true","507.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The gameplay feels slightly choppy like everything else tripwire has to offer, but the atmosphere and variety of weapons/scenarios makes up for it.  As far as horror games go, it's fairly enjoyable, with the monsters being visceral and haunting.  One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of an intuitive menu system, one which also makes quickly selecting a weapon in the heat of the moment difficult.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoamRifle/recommended/1250/","FoamRifle","Foamy the Fearsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoamRifle/","77 products in account","Experimentin' stuff has gone bad. Crazy experiments are on the loose. Whole cities are abandoned (or all inhabitants are exterminated, but hey, no one had time to inform you about that!). No one knows where you are, but as a cold comfort: most people don't even care whether or not you survive, so even if they could, they wouldn't help you. You and your squad are on your own, surrounded by experiments and weird humanoid-looking-ish fusions that are basically your worst nightmare, and theyre out there to eat you. Exterminate them all or they will have you grilled medium rare for dinner.\nAND AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH YET, once you destroyed enough experiments, the creator and 'father' of them will appear, and he wont be happy! But who could blame him? You'd be mad too if a random squad of 6 weirdos would come and kill hundreds and hundreds of your children!\nThis is the premise of Killing Floor, a first person shooter that brings you to a (maybe not so original, but who cares, as long as you can shoot things) scenario in which you're the last men standing against monstrous opponents. With a good variety of enemies and five difficulty levels, this game is gamer-friendly for the newbiest of newbies and challenging for the experienced exterminator, whereas every different enemy will require a different strategy to get rid of when you play on the highest difficulty level. You will level up your classes on the go to match your characters abilities with the level you'll be playing on. With the 7 different playable classes (or Perks) you can play your preferred role in a team, so you'll have your favourite way of destroying evil: Fightin' (or kitin') like a MAN? play Berzerker. Steady aim, ready to take out the big threats? play Sharpshooter. Do you like to watch the world burn? play Firebug. Like gibs flyin' around and explosions? play Demolitions. Assault rifles 'n kalashnikovs 'n stuff? play Commando. Wanna be that guy that carries a million different (and heavy) guns? play Supports specialist. Do you love ze healing, not ze hurting? play Field medic!\n\nThis all comes with a sh*tload of different maps in completely different settings (woods, buildings, cities, north pole, on a ship, on the moon, EVERYWHERE), able to keep your interest for quite a while. Also contains objective modes to keep the diversity in the game.\n\nSTILL haven't had enough? There's an incredible amount of custom content with EVEN MORE perks to level up to even greater heights, additional objective modes with a wide range of different goals to achieve.\n\nTo top this off, your squad consists of whiny, cocky british people with a strong accent, so insults, directions and calls for help will sound hilarious! Despite many negative remarks on the 'crappy' voice acting, I actually think the lack of seriousness these squad members show with their snarky voice commands adds nicely to the game's attractiveness.\n\nPros:\n- A million different guns\n- Dont like guns? It has explosives too\n- AND fire\n- AND melee weapons\n- Playable at all skill levels\n- A lot of variety in the maps\n- Challenging and interesting action on higher levels (especially as berzerker in my opinion)\n- Enemies with chainsaws\n- A boss with a machine gun for an arm\n- ^I forgot to mention his OTHER arm is a FRIGGIN' ROCKET LAUNCHER\n- Has nice skin overrides with christmas, halloween and in the summer.\n- "Help me or I'll be pushin' up the bloody daisies!"\n\nCons\n- By far not the best graphics (Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible!)\n- Camping to survive waves on high difficulty can get stale easily (but there's kiting to make up for that)\n- Not the most serious and realistic shooter (I personally don't mind, but I know many will see this as a downside)\n\n"YOU MURDERED MY CHILDREN": prepare to fight, stock up on the biggest, baddest guns and bombs and sht and take the challenge! A great gore-spattered shooter that will be guaranteed entertainment for a long time!\n\nRating: 9/10","December 21, 2014","true","747.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The different perks(classes) provide a great variety in the way you play this game, and an RPG like upgrade path. Different environments require different strategies as well. If you just try and blast everything, you will probably fail, so learning the different abilities and weaknesses of the Zeds is important. The different game difficulties require you to master new tactics and tricks in order to be successful. The achievements make you want to keep playing and the social aspect of working with friends is very satisfying. Single player also requires different tactics to multiplayer coop. I have been playing this for a long time now, and still get surprised at how unique each game can be. One of the all time best coop games ever.

It never gets old or boring for me no matter how many times i play it. It's difficult and the igher rounds can become a real challenege if you don't prepair in the right way early on. I still have issues with the game itself at times. It's pretty frequent the issues i run into this game. The weapon dlcs are also a great buy as well, i normally don't pay for dlc on steam but KF i've bought almost all of the weapons ones. Playing by yourself is a great way to kill time, but plaing online is a real challenege and defianatly a blast to do if you have the right teammates. You have a set of about 6 different classes all of which you level up by using weapons and sometimes equipment in their field. The higher the level of the class the cheaper you can buy the guns for it and the more powerful they become, faster you can reload, and also different perks depending on the class. The enemys are pretty well balanced with a good mixture of powerful enemys and weaker ones. You can also use different enemies for your advantage and get them to kill the zeds for you(Fleshpoun and Bloater).\nThe workshop for this game is also really good. You can find all sorts of things in there to enhance the gameplay. Adding new guns to the game(LMG, Snipers, Assault Rifles etc) you can add maps made by the community that are well done and balnced out, and also get different game modes and also some pretty cool mods to change the whole game up and give it a different field (Aliens mod)\nAs much as i hate dealing with a game that has issues i still love Killing Floor becasue it's iconic to me and one of the best PC games i've played. It's a game that sticks out there from all the rest and it's one that's fun and challenging all at the same time.\n(os being used is Mac)","February 3, 2014","true","129.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I played it nearly 500 hours and sometimes still coming back just to have a good hour. I'm a hardcore singleplayer guy, avoid MP as pest and guess what, this is the only multiplayer game i played continously in the recent years. I actually tried L4D but there was so much hate towards me as a newby i quit it. So Killing Floor. At first it looked like a trash. Then dunno how it sucked me in. Few enemies, all the maps has the same goal to kill everything (objective mode was came much later, still only applies to a very few levels), the weapons looks good though. So that's all? Yes! Try it! Not once but try it 10 times and you will start to feel the same thing, a fonding, a calling word 'Come back to mommy and pappy and kill us . . .if you can!"\nNo matter how experienced i am after 500 hours if i'm not carefull enough even the singlest Clot can kill me. This everyday challenge, the weird-scary enemies and level design, the parodical amount of gore, the unbelievable good weapon system and the actual weapons and the teamwork is what makes this game one of the best games ever, and for me, the absolutely king of the multiplayer FPS genre.","July 14, 2014","true","504.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Is it really? Definitely. Since the game was debut in 2009, Killing Floor evolved with many seasonal events, free weapons and maps, and small cosmetic downloadable content to support Tripwire Interactive's longevity to Killing Floor. One would ask: What is Killing Floor? Well, Killing Floor is a six player multiplayer cooperative survival game that takes on against various "zeds", ranging from the clots to the rage-meter Fleshpound that will grind your body into giblets. There are seven perks that you can select that varies from the Support Specialist with its ultimate shotgun barrage to the fast running Berserker that you will probably become the "ultimate ninja" if you play long enough (Berserker is my favorite perk to use; it's really fun). The game may become a bit repetitious, but the maps, playing with your friends, or meeting (and making friends) with other players in the Killing Floor community will make you come back and enjoy killing those zeds.\n\nDid I mention zed time (or slow motion)? There is and seeing zeds being decimated is an appeal to the eyes. The last question remains: Do you have this game in your Steam library? If not, go get this game..now!

It's not your typical zombie type game each zombie has a unique ablitiy and doesn't rely on melee alone. There are tons of maps to play on and custom maps making the game almsot endless fun. For $20 this game is fun enough but for $50 you will get all the dlc getting, most of the characters and majority of the weapons which are boss. The game is a game that goes on sale often and you can always buy it then with all it's DLC.

It's one of those Gears of War horde mode/Call of Duty zombies mode type games where you stay in one area and fight off the enemies while trying to survive. Killing enemies gives you money, and here is where the game does something very smart, you can share the money. You can even share guns. Also the health system is so that you can heal teamates faster than you can heal yourself. These mechanics actually promote teamwork.\n\nIt's not an incredibly polished game like some AAA titles, but it is good where it counts and is worth your time if you enjoy co-op shooters and don't mind the graphics being a little rough around the edges.

Got the bundle for a pretty good deal and it came with over 15 maps. This is a game you want friends to play with because I find that solo play gets boring. The game also gets easier as you level up your perks so grind them out one at a time. The settings are limited but that can be expected from a 5 year old game. The game has much community involvement and the community is still active. I recommend this over any call of duty zombie game and would reccomend it to anyone deciding to get it.","May 27, 2014","true","25.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarTheOwl/recommended/1250/","StarTheOwl","Midnight Star","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarTheOwl/","53 products in account","Ah, Killing Floor. That Game with wierd events (Hill Billy Horror) and Brilliant Cameos (Portal 2). Let's break this one down shall we? Let's start off with the thing I love the most. Gore = Detailed. However, your not gonna be puking your heart out by looking at it. It gives you your classic exploding heads. Blasting off arms and having specimens run off with the left leg in their hand. It's detailed and statisfying.\nNow we should start with waves. Waves are large since these specimens come in numbers. You can expect 90+ specimens on a large map at wave 3 out of 10. Yes, there are 10 waves. At the end of these ten waves, the end game boss, The Patriarch, will appear to hunt you down. But we'll get to that later.\nNow, Weapons. Weapons are by far the most important thing you will grasp in your hands. But weapons are weapons and I am pretty sure everyone knows how to use a gun. So we'll cover the welder and the syringe. First, Welder. A unique abillity in this game is to weld doors to give you time to prepare for the horde behind those doors. The Welder, while it has an infinite usage, you need to give it a break when it reaches about 60% through to welding the door. It runs on power and will need a quick recharge. Second, the syringe. This pretty little red syringe will be your angel. Infact, your teams angel. Everyone carrys one and it allows a team to stay alive for longer periods of time. I can not stress the amount of times this has saved my life, and my teams life. You use M1 to heal others with it and M3 (Middle mouse) to heal yourself. Healing yourself isn't as effective as someone healing you but it will save your life.\nLastly, Specimens. Clots,Gorefasts,Bloats,Stalkers,Sirens and so much more. I am going to cover the specimens abillitys and what they look like so then you can easily indentify them.\nClots, the weakest specimens. They do have a nasty habit of grabbing you and not letting go. You will know them when you see them. Just zombies basiclly.\nGorefasts are clots who charge at you with a big nasty machete stuck into his arm. Again, You'll know it when you see it.\nBloats, the boomers of Killing floor. He didn't enjoy his KFC and now he is going on a puking rampage. He is so fat, he is the slowest specimen in the game. He carrys a butcher cleaver. And his vomit is corrosive.\nStalkers are basicly partially visbile clots that like to utter ''Give us a kiss....'' You can see their skeletal structure in bright maps when thier invisible.\nSirens. SHOOT THE *****, SHE'S DOING MY HEAD IN. She loves to also utter give us a kill. Deny her with that gun up her throat and your in for a toddler tantrum. She loves to scream. Infact, her screams are so loud, it will destroy frags and rockets. She looks like she had a bad hair day.\nSkrakes, Yes that is a chainsaw he is carrying. Nothing Subtle about him. Anger him too much and he'll run up for the kill. The Skrake that is, not you.\nHusks are rocket shooting skrakes basiclly, and he isn't very good at melee combat. Looks like a zombie megaman.\nFleshPounds. Besides the Patriarch, these guys are rock tough. They are the Unsunken Titanic. And they have came to rip you to shreds. and JESUS CHRIST WHATS THAT HE'S GOT ON HIS ARMS?! I'll tell you what it is. It's a spinning metal spiked gauntlet. If this guy either stays out of combat too long or takes too much damage at the same time, He'll go on a bloodthirsty rampage and attempt to destroy the scums he calls your team. Looks like he got surgery by Richard Trager. (I will love you if you get the reference)\nLast but not least, The Patriarch. The end game boss. HE is the strongest thing alive in the game. Your team must prepare for him. Buy your armour and bombs. He is capable of 1 hit killing you if you stand to close. Attack from a distance. And watch out for the nasty guns he has. Rocket Launchers and Chain Guns. He will be the one to wipe you off the face of the planet. He is also Capable of running off and healing himself. Don't let him do that.\n\n\nThanks for reading my review of Killing Floor!","May 26, 2014","true","36.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

This is one of the best games EVER!. It is a game where if you don't have a good team you will most certainly die. It is a very fun too play game, what has the best dialogue in any game I have ever played, Even though some people may find it "scary" I say it's more funny as of the characters dialogue. Yes it can be annoying having to run to the trader from half way across the map resulting in not getting there in time and getting screwed over by having no ammo, yet it is fun to see if you can survive with limited resources.

Not enough games emphasize team-play like this one does. There are 7 perks you can play as, and all serve a specific purpose. On the lower difficulties it's not that important, but on the higher ones you really need a balanced team to make it through. Each of these perks can be levelled up, giving you several bonuses which make the game generally easier. It's also an addicting mechanic that more survival/horde games should have. The soundtrack kicks so much ♥♥♥ too. I also really like the developers because they do something special every holiday, like releasing a new map and adding a new unlockable character. But there are also thousands of custom maps and other mods made by the community to use. The game goes on sale with a huge discount so often, and you get so much value and content for your money.\n\nIf I have one complaint about this game the way it is now, then it's that it doesn't look as dark and scary as the original mod did. The maps looked a lot darker and really seemed like how places would look during a scenario like this. It had a better atmosphere, in my opinion. The new maps just look too clean, but they are designed better in the sense of enemy spawn points and being able to survive on them.","May 8, 2014","true","722.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

In fact, it may be the best Co-op ever made. It's certainly the best one I've ever played.\n\nIf you've ever read any of my other reviews, you know that something special is coming if I start like that...\n\nSo. Yes, it's an older game (2011 I believe). I'm glad we've got that out of the way. The graphics do feel a tiny bit dated, but they are clean, and you soon forget about it.\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't played it for a while, so I'm a little bit rusty, as some of the small things I love about the game probably won't be posted here, but I just realised I haven't written a review for it, and it really needs one. So in one sentence, what makes this a great game is\n\n"Truly co-operative gameplay"\n\nThat's it, right there, in just 3 words.\n\nThere's lots of other little mechanics that make it interesting, and sometimes slightly difficult to get into (in other words there's a little bit of a learning curve), and what it truly gets right is team-based gameplay. Allow me to explain;\nI think I better begin with what this game actually is.\n\nThe Basics;Basically, it's a Player Vs Environment 1st person shooter for 1 to 6 players to work in a team. In this case, the environment happens to be waves of Zeds (clones that strangely seem to resemble zombies). Those waves begin with weaker creature types, and build up in a variety, difficulty, and number of enemies in each wave. Between waves you make your way to a shop to upgrade your weapons. Anyone who died during the wave, respawn's at this point, as long as one person from the team is still alive. The final wave has a "big Boss" who can heal himself a couple of times and throws small waves at you while he is healing. If you do enough damage to him, you can kill him before he can run off to heal. That's the basics. There's a huge variety of the maps, with more being released often, in the developers are still working on making this a better game even though they're about to release the new version. That says a lot for the developer.\n\nA little bit about the mechanics of the game;So, 1st person shooter. We've got that much sorted. You choose a "Perk", (otherwise known as a Class) including Medic, sniper, support, Pyro, berserker, assault. Each class has its strengths and weaknesses, each class can choose any type of weapon, but you get additional bonuses for using weapons that your class is designed for, for example snipers get extra head shot damage while using rifles, berserker's get a 30% speed boost while using a melee weapon (axes/swords etc).\n\nMore Mechanics;You start with a pistol (and a completely useless knife), and that the end of each wave you go to a trading floor where you can buy bigger and better weapons. You do have a weight restriction so you can only purchase so many weapons, and the more weight you have, the more your movement speed is slowed down (this is only very minor).\n\nThe more you play a perk, the better your perks get… Basically an unlock system, there are 6 levels to unlock for each perk, and the higher the level of your perk the cheaper your weapons get to purchase in the game, and the better bonuses you get on your weapons. At level 6 perk, you spawn with another weapon besides just a pistol.\n\nThe most important aspects of this game, are voice communication and teamwork. And that, right there, is why I love this game so much. Everyone that plays this game, wants to be part of the team. There are very few 12 year olds screaming "n00b scrub”(a.k.a. none), and very few "Rambo hero's".\n\n\n\nTeamwork; People call when they need to swap positions, when they're low on ammunition, or when a Z that needs a different class to deal with it turns up.\nIf you die, you lose everything but;\nYour friends can pick the stuff up off your dead body and give it back to you.\nYour friends can drop money for you, see you can buy more weapons.\nThere are different classes, each with definite strengths and weaknesses, and you need a combination of them in order to be successful. For example, snipers are good at picking off big strong guys at a distance, and supports (with the many shotguns) are much better suited to wave clearing the smaller guys. A sniper plus support combo will do a lot better than 2 snipers.\nAnyone can heal anyone, including themselves, but healing yourself does 50%, healing a teammate does 100%.\nHeadset microphone are a must for this game.\n\nMap design;There is a huge amount of variety in the maps, including some community-based built ones. One of the most interesting aspects of the map design, is that maps tend to be largely "circular", it's very difficult to find a corner that you can hide in a shoot everything from one direction, there's almost always more than one way for them to get in, and one of those ways is directly behind you at any time -thus, teamwork. This particular mechanic of the game actually does something to make it something special.\n\nThe Trader;Also known as the shop. This is another interesting mechanic, which while making the game easier (read: the guns) also makes it harder. How? Because there are several spawn points for the Trader on the map, often on opposite sides of the map. This makes it more difficult, because if you do happen to have a good little spot, you have to run to the other side of the map so you can buy more ammunition, supplies, and guns. Once you are familiar with how the Trader works, it's actually a very easy system to choosing the weapons and classes that you want. It's very well implemented. And the mechanic of the Trader moving, really makes it feel like you're on the run from the Zeds. There is a time limit on getting to the shop and purchasing items, this time limit is triggered on the last Zeds’ death. Keep the last one alive until everyone gets to the shop.\n\nDifficulty levels;The more people in the team, the more Zeds you have to face together. For example, one person would face 10 Zeds, 2 people would face 25 Zeds. Difficulty levels are set by the server, so you can tell what difficulty level is before you log in. Difficulty is ramped up in a few ways, the Zeds get more health, they get faster, there are more of them in a wave, and they can do more damage. Also, you have less time to get to the shop and buy. The hardest difficulties are called "suicide" and "hell on earth" for a reason.\n\nStoryline;Some random scientist was experimenting on humans and made clones, which got out of control went on a rampage and killed lots of people. You and your team get paid to go in and clear out these infestations. The big boss happens to be That Scientist. That's the whole storyline, right there. Now go shoot some Zeds.\n\n\nNew players;I highly and thoroughly recommend that new players spend a significant amount of time in "solo" mode, which is the single player mode of the game. I'd suggest getting each class to level II before you jump online, but at the very least you need to get each class to level I.\n\nKey bindings;These are the changes that I made, I feel that they make the game more intuitive. I disable weapons selection of via middle mouse button, and I use the numbers 1 through 4 keys for that purpose.\nI use mouse scroll to throw money. It is much easier to roll the mouse, than trying to spam a button.\nI set voice communication to my thumb (back button) on the mouse.\nI did a re-bind of my right mouse button, and changed it from toggle weapons to zoom, to Quick Iron Sights.\nWow. I ran out of room. I had m...","August 30, 2014","true","214.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

That said it does have issues from time to time, balancing that can be well just out there, and I really don't care for the weapon packs they sell but I just don't buy them, sorted :D I really haven't played in quite some time seriously I'll jump on and play during the special events but even those don't really draw me in like they used to but with 1k+ hours in a game how can I not recommend it, plus it's on sale more than it's not so pick it up next sale and have some fun with it.\n\n\n\nThe Action\n\nThe simple version is you pick a class, the class has perks that give you bonuses to weps or game mechanics, you fight in between 4 and 10 waves of specimen (manufactured zombies), then have a final boss battle,   you kill the specimen  or engage in activities to earn points toward leveling up your perk and earning money,  your perks are persistent so each session you play you continually build on them but you must earn money fighting through the waves to buy the gear you need to beat the final boss.  Each wave is progressively more difficult but more rewarding so hopefully you are able to fully kit out your toon by the time the last wave is over, in between the waves you get to go shopping at the trader (you will love her taunts) and buy new gear, sell gear you find, or gear you no longer need.   Sounds pretty simple?, it is but it is so very addictive :D\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\nCoop- Sure you can beast this game and run rambo but the game really shines when everyone quits worrying about maxing kills, perking up, or being a super noob and you get a good set of team mates that rely on a mix of classes.  You will often hear people cry how hard this game is or can be and not playing coop is typically at the heart of that cry :D If you do get ahead on the leaderboards support your team with your extra dosh or buy and drop weps BOOM thats coop! Oh, and pubs aren't all that scary don't be afraid to play outside your circle of friends or clans.\n\nCommunity- It has its good and bad, if you are new it can be a little unforgiving at times because just being a "good gamer" doesn't necessarily help when experience, time, and rank are needed.  Be patient there are plenty of white knights in this game's community, take the time to read the forums or discussions lots of helpful people there for sure.\n\nClasses- There is a class for everyone and every play style, there isn't really (for long usually) a super class that can do it all and they each have strengths and weaknesses to you know encourage you to coop.  Some classes are pretty situational and might not be as strong as others but all have their role, it mostly comes down to how you like to play, and I'll admit there may be a class or two that I find pretty useless but that's more of an opinion and a reflection of how I like to play.\n\nWeapons- The arsenal now is absolutely massive but people still want MORE GUNS.  Thankfully they reorganized the shop so it’s easier to find what you are looking for since there is a time limit on when you can buy guns and the scrolly list of all at the same time could be a little chaotic especially for new players.\n\nEvents- Tripwire has usually two to three events each year and adds new maps, modes, and achievements all for free, they've been doing this for quite awhile and as I understand it will always be free.  I give them props on this, they've kept this game going way past the shelf life of any AAA game you can think of oh and it's free.\n\nPurchasable DLC- Aside from the free maps and events they add new character skins and weapon packs I used to buy these when they were like 4 skins for a couple bucks but they've gotten ridiculously priced in my opinion so I just don't buy them.  The weapon packs I tend to frown at while they are technically supposed to just be cosmetic variations of the stock weps they often have slight advantages but just not enough to make me pony up for them.  I know they are in the business to make money and by George they are good at it and people buy this stuff so more power to them :D\n\nAchievements-  Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s will love this game as you can grind for days on end for achievements alone, there is a huge mixed bag of easy, hard, and some just evil but all satisfying to collect.  There were achievements locked to events that repeated annually but I think they have removed most of the time restrictions and you can earn them all the time now.\n\nMods & Custom Servers- When you get bored with what Tripwire offers hop onto the Workshop (glad they added this) and find all kinds of custom content and if that even gets boring find the custom servers, massive team sizes, higher perk levels, server persistence, insane specimen counts and variations.\n\n\n\nThe Sorta Bad... but mostly tolerable stuff\n\nRemoved the whitelist- What is this you ask? In the beginning to be able to level your character you needed to play on approved maps, some of these were community maps as well but they were whitelisted to allow your perk progression and use, along the way this was removed I don't want to debate the whys but it created an army of power leveled characters that didn't know how the maps or even more basically how to play the game.  This isn't an elitist issue its a coop game and having a power leveled toon drop into a highest difficulty lobby can be problematic.\n\nServer Browser-  It's pretty slow, archaic, and prone to not find games for you especially after patches are released, waiting for servers to update is usually a day or two process\n\nBuggy- sometimes it just needs to sit in time out, while typically not game breaking it does have its moments and needs a firm restarting or the occasional verify steam cache to get it back on even keel","November 26, 2013","true","003.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But even with its lack of plot, I find Killing Floor to be a fun and challenging game.\n\nIn Killing Floor you play in first person, possibly with friends, fighting nine different kinds of specimens that roam the map looking for people to kill, becoming more numerous and releasing different specimens as the waves go by until waves 10 (if you are playing a full game) you encounter the boss, the Patriarch, who has the combined abilities of all the other specimens. Most of the regular specimen are easy to kill, with either a head shot or a shot close up with a shot gun blast to one shot them, but if someone yells Flesh Pound (FP), get some ground and prepare for a grinder.\n\nThere are seven different classes (called Perks), Field medic, Support specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition which all specialize in different weapons and abilities. Also, The game has a leveling system, which varies between the different perks, mostly based off the weapons use. Such as the Sharpshooter building levels on head shots with pistols, rifles and crossbows. Having a higher level brings down the cost of weapons and increase their efficiency, which makes you start at the lower difficulties to work your way through the level to beat the harder difficulties.\n\nOver all I love playing Killing Floor with friends and will keep playing for years to come.","June 15, 2014","true","407.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That said it does have issues from time to time, balancing that can be well just out there, and I really don't care for the weapon packs they sell but I just don't buy them, sorted :D I really haven't played in quite some time seriously I'll jump on and play during the special events but even those don't really draw me in like they used to but with 1k+ hours in a game how can I not recommend it, plus it's on sale more than it's not so pick it up next sale and have some fun with it.\n\n\n\nThe Action\n\nThe simple version is you pick a class, the class has perks that give you bonuses to weps or game mechanics, you fight in between 4 and 10 waves of specimen (manufactured zombies), then have a final boss battle,   you kill the specimen  or engage in activities to earn points toward leveling up your perk and earning money,  your perks are persistent so each session you play you continually build on them but you must earn money fighting through the waves to buy the gear you need to beat the final boss.  Each wave is progressively more difficult but more rewarding so hopefully you are able to fully kit out your toon by the time the last wave is over, in between the waves you get to go shopping at the trader (you will love her taunts) and buy new gear, sell gear you find, or gear you no longer need.   Sounds pretty simple?, it is but it is so very addictive :D\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\nCoop- Sure you can beast this game and run rambo but the game really shines when everyone quits worrying about maxing kills, perking up, or being a super noob and you get a good set of team mates that rely on a mix of classes.  You will often hear people cry how hard this game is or can be and not playing coop is typically at the heart of that cry :D If you do get ahead on the leaderboards support your team with your extra dosh or buy and drop weps BOOM thats coop! Oh, and pubs aren't all that scary don't be afraid to play outside your circle of friends or clans.\n\nCommunity- It has its good and bad, if you are new it can be a little unforgiving at times because just being a "good gamer" doesn't necessarily help when experience, time, and rank are needed.  Be patient there are plenty of white knights in this game's community, take the time to read the forums or discussions lots of helpful people there for sure.\n\nClasses- There is a class for everyone and every play style, there isn't really (for long usually) a super class that can do it all and they each have strengths and weaknesses to you know encourage you to coop.  Some classes are pretty situational and might not be as strong as others but all have their role, it mostly comes down to how you like to play, and I'll admit there may be a class or two that I find pretty useless but that's more of an opinion and a reflection of how I like to play.\n\nWeapons- The arsenal now is absolutely massive but people still want MORE GUNS.  Thankfully they reorganized the shop so it’s easier to find what you are looking for since there is a time limit on when you can buy guns and the scrolly list of all at the same time could be a little chaotic especially for new players.\n\nEvents- Tripwire has usually two to three events each year and adds new maps, modes, and achievements all for free, they've been doing this for quite awhile and as I understand it will always be free.  I give them props on this, they've kept this game going way past the shelf life of any AAA game you can think of oh and it's free.\n\nPurchasable DLC- Aside from the free maps and events they add new character skins and weapon packs I used to buy these when they were like 4 skins for a couple bucks but they've gotten ridiculously priced in my opinion so I just don't buy them.  The weapon packs I tend to frown at while they are technically supposed to just be cosmetic variations of the stock weps they often have slight advantages but just not enough to make me pony up for them.  I know they are in the business to make money and by George they are good at it and people buy this stuff so more power to them :D\n\nAchievements-  Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s will love this game as you can grind for days on end for achievements alone, there is a huge mixed bag of easy, hard, and some just evil but all satisfying to collect.  There were achievements locked to events that repeated annually but I think they have removed most of the time restrictions and you can earn them all the time now.\n\nMods & Custom Servers- When you get bored with what Tripwire offers hop onto the Workshop (glad they added this) and find all kinds of custom content and if that even gets boring find the custom servers, massive team sizes, higher perk levels, server persistence, insane specimen counts and variations.\n\n\n\nThe Sorta Bad... but mostly tolerable stuff\n\nRemoved the whitelist- What is this you ask? In the beginning to be able to level your character you needed to play on approved maps, some of these were community maps as well but they were whitelisted to allow your perk progression and use, along the way this was removed I don't want to debate the whys but it created an army of power leveled characters that didn't know how the maps or even more basically how to play the game.  This isn't an elitist issue its a coop game and having a power leveled toon drop into a highest difficulty lobby can be problematic.\n\nServer Browser-  It's pretty slow, archaic, and prone to not find games for you especially after patches are released, waiting for servers to update is usually a day or two process\n\nBuggy- sometimes it just needs to sit in time out, while typically not game breaking it does have its moments and needs a firm restarting or the occasional verify steam cache to get it back on even keel","November 26, 2013","true","003.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is basically that game. It's a frantic skill-based grenade fest with terrible production values.\n\nRather than trying to look pretty, Tripwire did their best to make Killing Floor as good as possible for the money.  None of this 'vertical foregrip adds to stability on fully automatic but lol it's not the DLC edition and removes accuracy.' Nope. KF rewards you for investing inane amounts of time with awesome abilities and free weapons.\n\nYou know how some class based games just give you different abilities? Killing Floor actually makes some of the enemies fatally weak to certain classes and highly resistant to others. A good example is the 'Scrake,' some ♥♥♥♥er with a chainsaw that the 'Sharpshooter' can insta-kill with the crossbow, while being resistant to explosives lobbed by the demolitions guy. One of the really smart mechanics is they discount your class's weapons to make it easier to get into your given role. Eventually you get basic weapons for free!\n\nRather than try to limit you to a certain playstyle, Killing Floor is basically designed to reward you for playing like a skilled maniac. You think guns suck and fire is the only way? Well, maybe you'll change your mind if we give you a MAC-10 that fires flaming bullets! There's a flamethrower anyway in case you don't buy it.\n\nThey also try to release a free DLC with every purchaseable DLC you can also get, and to their credit, there are numerous new voiced characters available. They even saw a community-made weapons pack got super popular and made it an official community pack. That alone is enough for me to support the game, but it does help it's insanely fun and difficult - but not quite impossible, either.","August 11, 2014","true","84.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Boy, was I wrong or what!? :D Now, I have played it almost half a year, not quite, but almost and I must admit that when I first played it, I was so incredibly surprised about the fact that I was actually enjoying this game as much as I did and still do. I can't say that I've completely grasped every aspect of this game yet but I sure am having fun shooting those zombies heads off hahahaaa... Anyway in all and all I think that this game is so successful for the simple fact that it can be such a stress reliever. Don't get me wrong, in many cases(and levels) it can be the opposite-stress creator-but without a little scare it wouldn't push you to improve yourself and it's more than likely that next time you will do a lot better. I recommend that game to everyone, honestly. You can't go wrong with this one. I also like how there's so many achievments you could get during playing this game. And what's most important, when you get a good team together, you will gain many great friends from that game as well. 10 out of 10 from me :D Thumbs Up!","April 21, 2014","true","120.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Really, what else is there to say than, it's fun! Not just the game is good but so it it's community, in most cases.\n\nI recalled plenty of moments where after a wave I was short on cash, only to feel a smile tugging at my lips when a random person ran up to me and started throwing dosh at my face while yelling the game's characteristic “Loadsa moneh!”\n\nThere's beginner mode which is easy and can help any starting player learn the ropes, getting their first perk levels while chopping off specimen heads left and right, is there's one thing bad about it, is that from beginner to normal is such a huge jump, making the game suddenly feel rather, difficult for new players. It does however do well at making the players work together. Two people working as a team can wreak havoc in hard mode whereas six people that don't will only end up failing in normal. I like that.\n\nEvery match can last anywhere from 3 minutes (If you die early) to 45 minutes (On long games) and whether you win or not, you'll still most often know that you made some progress levelling towards your next perk level.\n\nIt will probably go on sale again this winter, and the monsters will all look their christmassy best again (They already do!) so if you have a bit of dosh.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_SNS_/recommended/1250/","_SNS_","SNS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_SNS_/","359 products in account","Killing floor is a wave based zombie shooter with 8 different types of zombies/mutants and a player limit of 6 or so (many more on modded servers though). Game play is basic you pick a perk (Demolitions (grenade launchers and my fav), Support (shotgun and welder), Sharpshooter (pistols and rifles), Berserker (Melee weapons), Pyro (flame based weapons), Medic (Obvious), Commando (Assault rifles). You can purchase weapons of any class at the end of a wave at a trader which is open for a variable amount of time based on settings. In addition to your weapons every class has a medic gun and a welder (both work only at melee range) but their effectiveness is based on your perk. You can weld certain doors and gates closed letting you hold off the horde that little while longer. Guns sound awesome, a decent variety for each class. You are limited by a weight limit for how many weapons you can carry though (not by slots). The base game has quite a few maps including a couple of objective maps as well as a few sandbox settings and difficulty levels.\n\nThe base game is quite fun for the first few weeks but starts to get samey/grindy which is why i HIGHLY recommend to play on a modded server. There is also a lot of things on the workshop page (especially modded maps) which i also recommend checking out too. The workshop is why i kept playing from 30 hours onward. The game also has holiday orientated events (Halloween redneck zombies, evil Santa)\n\nGraphics are okay (game is a couple of years old) and it is very gory with no geo block :D. Which is why the demo class is so fun XD. Sounds are pretty good, guns feel nice (especially the 9mm). Maps vary from open, outdoors, corridors, small e.c.t so there is a lot of variety there. That about sums up KF, its simple but fun. I would recommend it (especially on sale), it also is still receiving updates. (Don't think i forgot anything).","February 17, 2014","true","701.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Boy, was I wrong or what!? :D Now, I have played it almost half a year, not quite, but almost and I must admit that when I first played it, I was so incredibly surprised about the fact that I was actually enjoying this game as much as I did and still do. I can't say that I've completely grasped every aspect of this game yet but I sure am having fun shooting those zombies heads off hahahaaa... Anyway in all and all I think that this game is so successful for the simple fact that it can be such a stress reliever. Don't get me wrong, in many cases(and levels) it can be the opposite-stress creator-but without a little scare it wouldn't push you to improve yourself and it's more than likely that next time you will do a lot better. I recommend that game to everyone, honestly. You can't go wrong with this one. I also like how there's so many achievments you could get during playing this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exe132/recommended/1250/","exe132","SimeoN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exe132/","159 products in account","About Game:\nKilling Floor (abbreviated as KF) is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed and published by Tripwire Interactive. It was originally released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod in 2005\n\nGameplay:\nKilling Floor is a first person shooter, allowing each player to move through a 3D environment. Gameplay consists of two game types, in which the player fights waves of zombie-like specimens, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes with a battle against a "boss" specimen, called the Patriarch. Players earn in-game money for each kill, as well as for surviving to the end of a wave. In the time between each waves, players can visit a trader to buy and sell ammo, armor, and additional weapons, such as katanas, pipe bombs, flamethrowers, shotguns, and so forth; the Trader's location on the level varies at the end of each wave, discouraging players from camping in one location. Weapons may also be found randomly across the level. Players are encouraged to work together; they can trade items and drop money, healing is more effective on other players than on oneself, and the team can strategically weld doors shut to provide a temporary barrier from the oncoming horde while funneling the other creatures to specific areas.\n\nPlayers select one of seven perks at the start of a match and between rounds. The perk, similar to the idea of a character class, provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors. Players can level up each perk to increase the benefits it offers. For example, the "Sharpshooter" perk, which provides accuracy benefits when using scoped rifles, can be raised in level by completing a number of headshots with specific weapons. The player does not need to play with that perk to raise its level; for example, the Field Medic perk requires the player to heal a number of points to level up, but this can also be done while playing any of the other perks.\n\nPlayers that die during a wave will drop their current weapon and re-enter the game at the start of the next wave, as long as at least one squad member survives. If the entire squad is wiped out, they will have to restart the game from the first round.\n\nEach game can be configured to alter the length and difficulty of the various waves. The number of creatures in the enemy waves are based on the number of players in the game, increasing in numbers if more players join the game in progress. All but the weakest enemies have some special attack that can inflict significant damage on a player. A feature called "zed time" awards particularly gory kills, such as headshots, with slow-motion, even in multiplayer mode.\n\nPlot:\nThe game takes place in London, England. Horzine Biotech, a biotechnology company, is contracted to conduct experiments of a military nature involving mass cloning and genetic manipulation. Something goes horribly wrong during the process of the experimentations, and human subjects begin to exhibit grotesque mutations and disfigurement. They become increasingly hostile, and eventually overrun the internal security forces of the corporation.\n\nHours later, the first waves of the specimens break out onto the surface, disrupting a peace protest outside the well-known military contractor. Despite the best efforts of local police, the civilians are quickly overwhelmed and consumed by the seemingly endless supply of clones now streaming from the gaping maw of Horzine Biotech's headquarter. Having escaped their sterile prison, the creatures began to fan out to neighboring areas, devouring the helpless citizens of London while the Metropolitan Police bravely but fruitlessly attempt to stem the tide of mutated flesh now spreading across their city.\n\nDesperate to contain the outbreak from reaching overseas as planned by the now mutated and cybernetic-enhanced scientist Dr. Kevin Clamely (which is now the Patriarch), the British government quickly begins to organize ragtag teams of surviving British Army soldiers and Special Branch police officers to fight back against the hordes of mutated "specimens" now running amok throughout the capital and its outskirts. The player takes the role of a member of one of these teams as they partake in a variety of missions in and around the city of London.\n\nMy favorite and one of the best coop based multiplayer game ever! Make sure that you play with friends, fun is guaranteed!. Tripwire Interactive has done a great job with this game.Few events in year which include free maps is something that is rarely seen and a developer that is loyal to his fans!\n\nLoadsamoney!\nMoney, money, money!\nTake some dosh!\nMoney simulator 11/10\n\nCant wait for Killing Floor 2 ^^","March 29, 2015","true","505.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

It's an unlikely combination of headshot percentage, situational awareness, and an appropriate hold over one's sense of self-preservation.  A Berzerker can charge fearlessly,  but will likely succumb to friendly fire if too psyched up.  A Firebug will too often find his friends as flammable as the ZEDs.  Most Assaults can't hit the broadside of a barn.  A Support might find the confidence of a shotgun is falsely assured, and weld shut his only chance of escape.  A cool-headed Sharpshooter might find he didn't panic enough, stuck in a corner.  A Medic will learn too late he let too many friends die.  Damn you, Horizine.  You've condemned us all to hell.. well, not me.  I could stare down the gates of Hell with a bolt action rifle, and thanks to Killing Floor, laugh at all other minor cataclysms.  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY! The other survivors will look and dress exactly like me, a ninja in riot gear. Learn to love the endless loops of generic death metal. Insult specimens. Run faster with the knife. Aim for the head.

The goal is to survive the waves by killing ♥♥♥♥. Killing ♥♥♥♥ earns money which then can be spent at the trader in-between waves for guns, ammo and armour.\n\nThe game revolves around a perk system, players can pick a perk that can be helpful (or detrimental) to the team. Each perk usually has positives and negatives to using them. For example, Beserkers get up close and personal to hack and slash specimen and can soak up bits of damage. The Field Medic keeps the team alive by healing them via syringe injections and have very durable armour so can soak up damage if needed. Firebugs are great at crowd control by setting groups of specimen on fire to deal damage overtime and to slow them down and so on. However the perk you choose is not set in stone, you can switch in-between waves during trader time and also it sometimes helps to have off-perk weapons in some cases.\n\nThe game is greatly optimized, it can play on most toasters with ease and comes with so many graphical options that even puts Twinnings teabag varieties to shame. The learning curve can be steep, I would advise playing on easy or normal difficulty to start with to get used to the mechanics. Most harder difficulty games (Suicidal and Hell On Earth) often require higher perk levels, practice makes perfect.\n\nPerhaps the main thing that keeps me coming back to this game is the modders. Modded servers are a whole new ball game with the inclusion of content such as maps, perks, specimen and weapons. The amount of new content on some of them are so extreme that you may not want to ever go back to stock. You have been warned!!!!\n\nWith over 2.5k hours invested in the game so far, this is easily the game that I play the most and for a good reason.","September 23, 2014","true","660.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No-one can predict this before it is actualy happening in the present.\n\nDOSH! Also take note, if you like such games about zombie apocalypse, (co-op) survival horror or a mix of both (Ex. Left 4 Dead (2), Resident Evil (3,4,5,6), Contagion...) this is your next game to play. Oh yeah, they differ a lot from COD BO Zombies. Frankly, in Killing Floor these creatures are NOT zombies (they are specimen) but still considered as zombies.\n\nTitle is a little confusing. Killing Floor... You don't walk up to somewhere and get killed by a trap laid on the floor or below nor you don't kill somebody by laying or triggering traps on the floor (except mines).

Yes, it is indeed a few years old now but it still holds up VERY well today, despite there being numerous offerings in the wave-based FPS shooter (such as Left 4 Dead).\n\nThis was one of my first purchases on Steam 3 years ago, and it was a gamble for me as it was on offer. It's also ended up being one of my most played games. It certainly has surprised me.\n\nIt previously won the annual award for best Unreal Engine mod, and you can quickly see why when you get into it. At first, you might be surprised that it's so simplistic in it's offering - you fight of a series of progressively harder waves of "specimens" (don't say the "z" word!), culminating in a boss battle. There's a fair choice of pretty well-designed maps too.\n\nHowever, this game is much more than the mere sum of it's parts. There's a good choice of weapons - in many games, this wouldn't really mean a lot, but here they are not just clearly individual and well-balanced (so you can comfortably work with which ones suit your style), they have real heft, looking, sounding and feeling excellent. I'd go as far as to say these are probably one of the best examples of guns in a game - they are the real stars here.\n\nThe game's real unique point lies in it's class system - each option will give you bonuses to the applicable weapons for that class (example: a Firebug will do extra damage with flamethrowers). This variety really lends itself well when in co-operative multiplayer; get the right balance on your squad of teammates and you can be a unit of near-invincible mince-making machines, especially when those classes can earn experience to level up, strengthening you further!\n\nCash is earned for kills, which can be spent between waves on better guns. You have an inventory limit based on weight, so some juggling will be required. Thankfully, any cash you earn can be dropped for teammates to pick up, so late additions to your party won't be compromised. All this adds up to some quite excellent co-operation both in play and tactics.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I bought this game some 3 years ago, and it was great value then. However, Tripwire have excelled in their support for this game. Every time there's a major Steam sale on, there's an event with a new map (and even new gameplay) all completely gratis! This has resulted in the content more than doubling in those 3 years, and the events still continue now.\n\nSo, if you're an FPS fan, a co-operative multiplayer fan, or just a gun nut, it's absolutely recommended. There are a number of games of this ilk, but this one of the very finest examples. With the continued free content on offer, it makes this an essential purchase.","November 27, 2013","true","123.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As soon as you've done with this first wave, you will be given the way to go to the Trader, which will sell you many more and way stronger weapons that you can use, instead of your standard cookies and milk.\nBased on what "Perk" are you going to use, which is the skill level with a certain category of weapons that you can decide to specialize into, such as being better at using shotguns, assault rifles, or being better at healing or at using melee weapons, you will be given a wide variety of weapons that you should be supposed to use, but you can anytime change the kind of weapons you want to use, or completely change the Perk you're playing with. Each of these Perks will also give you a particular role in the game that you will easily find out just by playing it, which is also the way to improve said skills.\n\nThere are a total of 9 kind of monsters you can encounter during a full game, each with many skills and characteristics meant to pose the players a certain kind of threat based on how dangerous these enemies are, with one last final one that is meant to be the "boss" of the game, the stronger of them all and your final goal to beat the game.\n\nIn a summary this is the game, which can sound pretty simple and easy, but by playing in harder difficulties you will find out that it requires much strategy depending on the perks you and any of your teammates are playing, by the kind of enemies you have around and the situation you're in.\n\nIt may be a pretty old game and may have lots of DLCs, which are almost all cosmetic characters or weapons while just 2-3 are actually different weapons, but these aren't that great and is usually better to stick with the ones present for everyone in the game.\nIt's as of today a pretty fun game where many people are still playing on the servers, even with the new KF2 out.\n\nIf you like a decent good old game that has also a workshop for some game modding that adds some variety to the game, and also runs smoothly even on the oldest computers, you've come to the right page.","April 23","true","214.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now, I could go on and on with some boring review, but why do that when I can just be straight to the point?\n\nThis here is Killing Floor. This is a game where you, to great surprise, kill things. In fact, you kill a lot of things. To be honest, I hope you like killing things, because that's this game's primary feature!\n\nNot entirely 100% positive what the things are? Don't worry, because we aren't either! Before you know it, you too, will be mindlessly firing the portable killing machine of your choice beside others who share your newly obtained urge to fire weapons at mutants without questioning the logic of why you're a military operative sent against mutants with nothing but a Beretta M9, a knife, a welding tool, and a healing injector that magically recharges over time!\n\nWhat do you do? Simple! You kill things. Once you're done killing things, you get weapons from the money you got from killing things so you can kill more things and earn MORE money to get BETTER weapons to kill more things with, until you finally kill enough things to get to the big thing called the patriarch. By then, hopefully your squad of originally highly unprepared, lighthearted, talkative british soldiers will have killed enough things to get powerful enough weapons to stand a chance against this final mutant! What happens when you win, you ask? You do it all over again! Astonishing, correct?\n\nHow do you get weapons? Like any fully-unprepared squad of six brits would in an apocalypse! You trust a completely legitimate travelling mercenary who has no affiliation with the army, that conveniently manages to travel from shop to shop for absolutely no reason since it's all within the same small area, without ever having to fight any of the mutants you're facing! We should also note that she is the only living person in the game aside from your squad, so it's your job to make sure that you clean out these completely decimated areas so the people that don't live anymore can be free!\n\nBut killing things with portable killing machines is just not enough! The game uses a class system. Now, I could use the actual names, but who needs names to confuse people, when we're already throwing logic out the window?! Lets just use fancy, informative descriptions!\n\nOur fabulous classes include:\n\nBrits who shoot things with automatic weapons and can see invisible women.\n\nBrits who heal people with the same automatic weapons they kill things with, while tanking damage like no one else ever could.\n\nBrits who burn things.\n\nBrits who blow things up.\n\nBrits who blast things with shotguns and carry more than anyone else.\n\nBrits who snipe enemies from afar and fail to realize pistols are actually powerful in this game.\n\nAnd lastly, Brits who run really fast and use melee weapons to attack the enemies that are also primarily limited to melee attacks!\n\n\nShould you play long enough to level a class up really far, the queen will smile upon your efforts and no longer send you in with just a Beretta M9 and a knife to fight with on the first wave - instead, she will provide you with a weapon for your class that is significantly more useful! In addition, levelling up causes the goddess of guns to bless your firearms that match your class with improved firepower! No, she doesn't give you new kinds of bullets, or modifications to the guns, they just magically obtain greater potential! It makes perfect sense if you don't think about it, and why would you?! Your thoughts should be focused on killing mutants, you bloody fool!\n\n\nBut make no mistake - this is NOT a first person shooter! No, this is in fact a killing simulator. That's right, a killing simulator! You aren't just shooting these mutants, it's up to you whether or not you take limbs off their torsos, blast their heads off, decapitate them, burn them alive, or blast them to little bits! Be creative with how you kill mutants, just don't give them the opportunity to be creative as well!\n\nNeed more guns? Of course you do! That's why there's three weapon pack DLCs! Don't like DLCs? No problem! Turn to modding, and make Killing Floor's battles into an even bigger massacre than they already are!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Throw away your logic, bring your friends, lose your social life, and get to slaughtering mutants over and over, because who needs reasons anyway?!","September 22, 2014","true","206.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/recommended/1250/","preludebot","PreludeBot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/","197 products in account","It's challenging and rewarding and loads more fun than KF2.\n\nThere is a wide range of weapons to use on all perks which allows for various strategies and playstyles. And after you've become tired of the base game weapons, you can purchase more weapons via dlc packs. And the dlc weapons are either reskins or whole new weapons, so it adds even more variety. I've been playing with just the base game weapons, if I want to use the dlc weapons, I can trade them off someone and paying them dosh for it (in-game currency). So, no real money is really needed to use dlc weapons as long as you play with someone who has them!\n\nZeds are interesting and challenging, it will take practice to understand various strategies on killing them. It's not always as simple as shooting them, some bigger zeds might require specific strategies to kill effectively. And if you get bored of base game zeds, you can play against 3 reskinned themes including halloween, hillbilly, and christmas zeds. If that's not enough, there are custom mod servers out there with brand new zeds and weapons. You need only join these custom servers and the game will do the rest for you (downloading them and such).\n\nThe music is metal and it's nice to listen to. Personally, I turn the music off when I play because it's easier to hear zeds behind you without screaming metal blasting in the background.\n\nPros:Lots of weapons\nChallenging enemies\nFun teamplay elements\nMoney management\nChat commands are often funny or informative (i.e. Insult Players)\nYou can get dlc weapons off other players (no purchase of dlc required)\nNo sprint (some people say this is a con but I think it's a pro because it adds desperation and challenge to a given situation. I think sprint in KF2 ruined the experience.)\nHigh recoil on weapons\nCons:Metal music can be distracting if you're not watching your back\nLobby ads can get really annoying (there are mods to change/disable them)\nMenu buttons are sometimes a little wonky (requiring a second or third click)\nNeutral:Dark filter makes colours seem dull but it increases the gritty atmosphere\nTrader dialogue gets on my nerves sometimes (personal preference so not a con)\nModding sounds or music will change it for singleplayer but not online\nOnly one boss but his diologue is funny\nSome strategies are kind of cheesy but fun to do yourself (i.e. blowing up boss with a few dozen demo charges)\nI can't think of anything else to add but it's definately a golden title of a game, I highly recommend it. 10/10","April 9","true","968.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notafraidx/recommended/1250/","notafraidx","[HG] ♥Miss Abby♥ [M]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notafraidx/","425 products in account","Zombies are enjoying a bit of a renaissance lately (which is somewhat ironic considering their undead nature). The shambling hordes can be found in everything from action titles such as Dead Rising to tower defense games such as Plants Vs. Zombies, and the undisputed current king of zombie titles, Left 4 Dead. Capitalizing on this recent trend, Tripwire Interactive has released Killing Floor, a downloadable title over Steam that initially was released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod four years ago. While it's still held down by a number of bugs, Killing Floor is an enjoyable alternative for those players that have exhausted their time with Left 4 Dead and are looking for something new.\n\nThe story behind Killing Floor takes place in London, where the metropolitan city has been devastated by a large outbreak of the undead eating and maiming everyone in sight. In reality, these creatures aren't zombies at all; instead, they are specimens cloned by a biotech firm. Naturally, they managed to escape and decimate the population. Thanks to the brutality of the attack, very few people are left within London or its surrounding area. You happen to be one of them. As one of up to six survivors (two policemen and four soldiers), it's up to you to put an end to the threat by destroying all of the creatures that you come across. The characters themselves have their own individual bios, including a constable with a knack for police brutality and a soldier who collects fingers of the creatures he kills. The individual details aren't really important since they don't help provide any additional skills or abilities to the character; they just give a mild insight to who these people were before hell broke loose.\n\nRegardless of which character you choose, players are also tasked with selecting one of six specific character perks. Akin to establishing a class system within the game, the perks give you a number of effects that are imparted to your character to help them survive each battle. For example, Field Medics are better at healing characters and defending themselves, Support Specialists can carry more weaponry and do significant damage with shotguns, and Sharpshooters do extra damage with headshots while experiencing limited recoil. Initially, character perks start at level 0, and all have specific requirements that have to be fulfilled before a bonus can be imparted to the character. So if you want to improve your Firebug skills to do extra damage with a Flamethrower, you're going to have to cause 25,000 points of damage with the weapon.\n\nYou can improve any perk whether you've selected it or not by simply choosing to use a particular weapon, which is useful because you don't have to constantly switch back and forth between perks. For instance, you can be a Commando (which focuses on using the Bullpup machine gun) and still improve your Berserker rating by pulling out a knife and stabbing opponents. Since the requirements to reach each levels quickly starts to grow until you get to the level 5 max, you'll be able to play for quite a long time before you max out the advantages, which will earn you a specific weapon when spawning into a round. The only downside is that you might not choose to explore all of the perks once you find a role that you particularly like thanks to this system, so you may never care to master the perks.\n\nOnce you've chosen, you're sent into the middle of a map with a basic assortment of weapons and gear. You begin with a knife, a 9 millimeter pistol with about eight clips of ammo and three grenades to help you defend yourself. Equipment wise, you're packing a flashlight with a regenerating battery as well as a hypodermic syringe which can be used to heal any damage that you or your friends may take. You'll need to wait a few seconds before you can use it again, but considering that you won't find any health packs or bandages anywhere during your battles, you'll come to rely on this item over and over again. The last bit of gear is the welding torch, which can be used to seal doors to help funnel enemies where you want them to go so you're not completely surrounded. It can also be used to break seals in case you've attempted to create a safe room and your plans fall apart.\n\nThis will happen frequently under the onslaught of hordes of creatures that assault you and your teammates in a series of intensifying waves. Initially, you might face off against a set of mindless creatures known as Clots, who grab onto you and attempt to bite you to death. Shortly afterwards, you'll run into a larger variety of beasts, including freaks with large scythes or chainsaws on their arms, spider-like monsters, and large muscular beasts that smash through anything in their path. Every monster that you kill provides you with cash; between rounds you have a minute to track down a trader that sets up shop to sell you weapons and gear. You're not able to pick up every weapon you want, of course, your character is restricted by a set weight limit that forces you to pick and choose what gear you'll take with you in the next round.","July 13, 2012","true","718.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiz_bricker/recommended/1250/","shiz_bricker","B Dawg Ⓢ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiz_bricker/","41 products in account","Time for a re-review, since I never gave it a proper one.\n\n*Sees Patriarch*\n*Insult Specimen*\n\nKilling Floor is a HARDCORE Post Apocalyptic Co-op Survival game, or in other words, Post Apocalyptic life simulator in Great Britain where you have to kill zeds to earn Do$h which you use to buy weapons to kill even more zeds.\n\nEmphasis on 'HARDCORE'. It is easily one of the most difficult, hardcore games I've ever played. It makes Payday: The Heist (another co-op game at which I'm really good at) look easy in comparison. Hell I like playing games on the hardest difficulties, but on this game, even Hard difficulty on certain maps (which is below Suicidal and Hell On Earth) can be pretty hard. Or maybe I'm just not good enough.\n\nFeatures 2 different game modes, standard wave-based Survival mode and Objective mode, 7 different classes, a large variety of enemy zeds, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses, a ton of weapons, Instrumental Industrial Heavy Metal, along with some Electronic music, which are both pretty damn nice.\n\nWeapons are all really fun to use. Impactful, great sounds, manual recoil control, all make for terrific gunplay.\n\nThe game can be described as somewhat boring, yet fun at the same time (at least on the standard Survival mode). One 10 wave game can last up to 50 minutes or more. On most maps you either spend the entire match camping one certain spot, or kiting around the map with a certain strategy. To add to the tension, after killing everything in a wave, you only have 60 seconds to get to the trader, resupply, and regroup. If you kill all the specimens while being far away from the trader, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Killing everything as fast as possible while kiting can trigger far too many enemy spawns to spawn in the direction you're going, which can cause the death of your team (or yourself while playing Solo!)\n\nNow let's get to the bad parts. The game suffers from a half broken server browser, in the sense that it is REALLY REALLY slow. The solution to that is to Alt-Tab into the desktop for several seconds and then Alt-Tab back into the game to get the complete server list. There's arguably somewhat better weapons behind community weapon pack DLCs. Then there's the wonky head hitboxes, which can make going for headshots with certain projectile based weapons very unreliable, preventing them from reaching their maximum potential.\n\nFor any aspiring Firebug player such as myself, I give you this important piece of advice. Do not aim for the head with the Husk Fireball Launcher! The flaming missiles will either register as body shots, or simply light the specimen on fire without dealing any impact damage. It is simply not worth it. No amount of practice will help you with the hitbox issues. Aim for center mass or the neck area and hope you get lucky. It will still deal a massive amount of damage.\n\nUnless you're level 5 or 6 on a class (you spawn with a class weapon at level 5), joining games that are past wave 2, 3 or so is not recommended, and even then, I wouldn't do it on higher difficulties. You won't have the gear to face the extra specimens, or money to upgrade. You might end up hurting the team you join. This is where the leveling system works against the player. Also, the Commando has the worst requirements for leveling up of all the classes. For this class alone, I suggest using leveling maps for killing Stalkers.\n\nAnd, trying to play on the more difficult, less played maps can be difficult. The server list is either populated by overplayed easy maps, or custom ones. BioticsLab (which is a base game map) is ♥♥♥♥ing boring and easy as hell, and trying to get a game on Clandestine or Hell can be difficult. If you do find a server playing on a specific map, it might be already past wave 3 or more, and joining it then is just suicidal.\n\nDespite all these issues, I guess I still recommend the game.","May 27","true","57.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

This game brought me together with many friends and introduced me to many other awesome gamers who like to kill zombies. Games can range from short - long, lasting 4 waves - 10 waves, with a Patriarch boss getting his own wave at the end. Similar to L4D, except gameplay is wave based not objective based. However there is an objective play mode with a few maps that are fun as well.\n\nFrom your basic zombie (referred to as ZEDs in this game) to the intimidating Fleshpound and Scrake, there are many different special zombie types who will all try to eat you in different ways.\n\nThere are 7 perk types to play as, from the melee Berserker, to the Medic, to the Sharpshooter, there is likely a class you will really enjoy playing.\n\nPlay solo or with a group up to 6, and on custom servers upwards of 30 players on one server.\n\nMany players have created custom maps or objective modes that are unique and fun to play, aside from the 30~ish regular maps, if you like killing zombies, this game can get addicting.\n\nThere are 5 difficulty levels, and starting out you really should play on 1/5 - Beginner, because as you level your perks (which level to 6 ((higher on custom servers))) you will become stronger with those weapon types and gain necessary benefits to damage and survival that you need to have for higher difficulties.\n\nAfter 700~ hours, I've completed all but a handful of maps on 4/5 diff - Suicidal. It's extremely challenging and 5/5 diff is even more ridiculous. If you're good at FPS you will get the hang of it, but like any game, this one in particular takes time and practice.\n\nA great game to play with friends as well, the more perk types your team can cover the better chances you have of surviving, although it is possible to solo most difficulties with any perk, some are more challenging than others. Each perk has a role that they perform and zombies they should focus on taking out, teamwork is key and if you are a lone wolf you can stick with solo.\n\nStill fun after years of playing it.

There are challenging maps to choose from whether you pick objective mode or not. Nice soundtrack, although I prefer to play with it off. The weapons available are good but some could be better.

On a side note, if you're a girl and you want a female character you're going to have some problems there, since there's only 3 to choose from.

There are challenging maps to choose from whether you pick objective mode or not. Nice soundtrack, although I prefer to play with it off. The weapons available are good but some could be better. There's also several DLC's regarding choice of weapons but keep in mind that quite a few of them are just skins, such as camo, golden, etc so unless you care a great deal about asthetics I don't recommend wasting money on them, just the original weapon. On a side note, if you're a girl and you want a female character you're going to have some problems there, since there's only 3 to choose from. Apart from that, it's a very nice game and you can download more maps and other content from its workshop to keep things interesting and exciting!","November 12, 2013","true","297.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game fundamentals are solid even with the lack of continuity by chasing down a trader for gun and ammo purchases between hordes of zombies. For casual players, the RPG elements are much too serious a grind to reach maximum level. The developers continue to put time and effort into keeping the game popular and fun with sales events and new DLC. It's not all that fun to play by yourself, but certainly plenty of entertainment for you and your mates together.","January 6, 2011","true","239.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mission-Incredible/recommended/1250/","Mission-Incredible","( MI ) Mission Incredible","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mission-Incredible/","21 products in account","Killing Floor is a decent Zombie style game with a wide variety of character perks, or professions to choose fro. It also has a LOT of different maps to play as well as different difficulty levels to choose from. Killing Floor has well over 250 achievements to get, with about half of them being map based. So if your playing a map say, called Forgotten, you can play that Forgotten map on Normal for an achievement, then, on Hard for an achievement as well as Suicidal and Hell of Earth diffculties for achievements. Alot of achievements in the game ! The Character perks can be slow going, but its up to you to find a map that is easy to master and spam that map over and over to get your Characters up as fast as you want. Some are easy to do, others are slow and painful. You can set up a listening server and have up to 5 friends join your server. This will increase the amount of enemies that come at you, and having a strategy to ensure everyone lives all 10 waves, plus the last wave, the Boss wave. Killing Floor goes on Sale A LOT and you can get the Killing Floor Bundle for 1/2 to 3/4 off.\n\nI bought the Killing Floor bundle on sale for $24.99 and its worth the price. It has just enough DLC and maps in there to make it worth the purchase. I used to play just MW3, and this game gives me a break from the long hours of MW3. The typical Killing floor game lasts from 30 minutes up to maybe 1.5 hours if you choose 10 waves and depends on the difficulty level you choose.\n\nDo yourself a favor after purchasing this game and play it on beginner, solo. You can customize your settings making it easier to remember them all. There are a TON of settings. Set the important ones (especially quick heal) and leave the rest alone.\n\nOverall, I am near/over 120 hours on this game, and its still pretty fun. I have maxxed out a few of the seven perks/characters to level 6 (level 6 is max) and it was a challenge for sure. Some level 6 characters will allow you to spwan in with a weapon and/or carry lot more weight so your weapon selection can do you wonders. The level 6 Medic, Support Specialist and the Firebug on level 6 spawn in with decent stuff. The others I am still working on.\n\nOverall, not too bad a game. The only quirks I have about the gane is that the Listening server doesnt allow you to set a MAX PING, or easily kick problem players. They should allow for IP tracking, latency, and IP blocking for seurity and fair gameplay.\n\nIf your looking for a Classic style old-school game that requires a lot of heads up, keep moving action, and has strategies like running to the TRADER to sell weapons that U have found/picked up before the last zombie dies, and then run to cover and come up with a plan of defense for 160+ zombies of different sizes versus 4-5 players, its a hoot, especially on hard, suicidal and hell on earth settings. I enjoy the game, and the duration of each game is just about right. I think you will enjoy Killing Floor as well !","January 5, 2014","true","630.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game brought me together with many friends and introduced me to many other awesome gamers who like to kill zombies. Games can range from short - long, lasting 4 waves - 10 waves, with a Patriarch boss getting his own wave at the end. Similar to L4D, except gameplay is wave based not objective based. However there is an objective play mode with a few maps that are fun as well.\n\nFrom your basic zombie (referred to as ZEDs in this game) to the intimidating Fleshpound and Scrake, there are many different special zombie types who will all try to eat you in different ways.\n\nThere are 7 perk types to play as, from the melee Berserker, to the Medic, to the Sharpshooter, there is likely a class you will really enjoy playing.\n\nPlay solo or with a group up to 6, and on custom servers upwards of 30 players on one server.\n\nMany players have created custom maps or objective modes that are unique and fun to play, aside from the 30~ish regular maps, if you like killing zombies, this game can get addicting.\n\nThere are 5 difficulty levels, and starting out you really should play on 1/5 - Beginner, because as you level your perks (which level to 6 ((higher on custom servers))) you will become stronger with those weapon types and gain necessary benefits to damage and survival that you need to have for higher difficulties.\n\nAfter 700~ hours, I've completed all but a handful of maps on 4/5 diff - Suicidal. It's extremely challenging and 5/5 diff is even more ridiculous. If you're good at FPS you will get the hang of it, but like any game, this one in particular takes time and practice.\n\nA great game to play with friends as well, the more perk types your team can cover the better chances you have of surviving, although it is possible to solo most difficulties with any perk, some are more challenging than others. Each perk has a role that they perform and zombies they should focus on taking out, teamwork is key and if you are a lone wolf you can stick with solo.\n\nStill fun after years of playing it.

If that concept appeals to you then the rest should even more, there are a variety of enemies to keep you aware from the simple clot to the irritating Sirens as well as the Flesh Pounds. The multiple classes(which are levelable by the way) give you many different approaches to combat zombies, I find the demolition class to be particularily up to my speed. Explosives+zombies= a fun combination. The adjustable difficulty levels add a lot to Killing Floor's replay value, even if you've just started, the beginning difficulty proved entertaining and easygoing as I learned the basic ins and outs of the game.I recommend this game for anyone who's seeking a fun co-op experience and likes killing zombies.","December 19, 2013","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On any harder difficulty, it's an excersize in computer-smashing frustration and shouting matches between teammates while idiots abound trying to tell you exactly how to play their way. On easy mode it's mostly calm and relaxed (relatively, this is a not-zombie game after all) and the most heated it gets is when you get mobbed by fifty things at once (in which case you either a. shoot or stab your way out or b. throw all your grenades at your feet and take all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with you.) On harder modes it's simply a hopeless fight against you with a dinky peashooter (and a lever-action rifle, IF YOU'RE LUCKY...) against bullet-sponge enemies who move at twice your speed and can all but insta-kill you.

I don't care if you are from a predigious background or not it is just rude to wave your money in someones face just because you can afford more guns and bullets. There was a man who threw his money in the air but he caught it before i could and then had the nerve to ask what i was doing. we were then rudely interrupted by a man with no flesh who killed the first man. overall it is a great tool but i think there could have been more emphasis on textures (there are only like three) rather than having lots of dead policemen with no skin killing rude people with money. I know a lot about this because I was in #occupy 2012 and it was really cold but i perversered because i am trying to make the world a better place and make all the rich people give me some because i have worked so hard and my eight year old son can't even design the layout of my new kitchen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Visceral/recommended/1250/","Visceral","Visceral","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Visceral/","170 products in account","Killing Floor, to me, is one of the best co-op designed games I've played to date. The game brings out all the classic, well-known weapons of shooters into the mix. Killing Floor revolves and works around how many players are in the game (1-6) and each wave of enemies increases in numbers the further you get. The more people that are in the server, the harder the final Patriarch boss is to kill.\n\nThe game has many classes and plenty of characters to choose from and you can level them up from 0-6 as you play them more frequently. If you're looking for a game that has all sorts of classes that master in almost any type of weapon out there, Killing Floor is the game for you. Perfect for when your only objective is to just kill things with your friends!","June 1, 2011","true","530.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"
