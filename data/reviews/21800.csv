The moment a retaliatory WMD is alerted to you and you're wondering where the heck it's going to come crashing down. The moment you ambush some enemy combat engineers with your concealed Riflemen. So many cool and tense moments I've experienced in this game. Having a good result in a match requires having both sharp reflexes and an indepth understanding of how the game works past the understanding of the combat triangle spoon-fed to you in the tutorials.\n\n• Theatre of War - You could choose a loyalty to one faction and you fight for its glory + the team/community spirit in the online ToW (now dead, unfortunately).\n\n• Music - I still listen to it when I want to get the adrenaline up. Major thanks to the composers (Matt Ragan + Alistair Hirst).\n\n• Factions - To this day, I still think that the European Federation Enforcers Corps is probably one of the coolest near-futuristic factions ever created.\n\n• Voice Acting - The amount of variety in voice acting was great, and the general's dialogue (in the briefings) were really cool and all of them had a great sense of personality even if they were just an image that talked.\n\nWhat I Hated• Bugs - Anyone remember the transport-freeze glitch? There were lots of little things that bugged the original EndWar which still sometimes goes on in my single-player matches today randomly.\n\n• Upgrade Stacking - Every upgrade you purchased stacks on top of the other, so if you have a fully upgraded battalion you won't have much trouble trampling over any other player who had less than half the amount of upgrades you have. That, when the original ToW was still happening, was just totally unfair in my opinion, and was what contributed to the multiplayer's downfall; most newcomers got disheartened facing overwhelming odds at the veterans and gave up. You could not dodge or negate the effect of sequential bombardments of secondary powers on your units if you were a new player, which gave a grossly unfair advantage to the veteran.\n\n• Air Support - I do not mind having a type of off-map support which assists in destroying your enemy, but the way that it was implemented in the original game was just poor. Point-Click-AoEDamage, which you could hardly avoid (yes, I am aware of EMP stopping it, but you have to launch it almost the second the strike is sent, which makes it very hard to counter). Another game of the same type of genre, "World in Conflict", made by former "Massive Entertainment" (now "Ubisoft Massive", the ones developing another Tom Clancy game called "The Division"), did a much better job with off-map supports with their timed, skill/strategic/luck-based air support as it rewarded those who could exploit their enemy's weakness when they were off-guard, or try to get the player to predict how their enemy would play and exploit that predictability.\n\n• Combat Tree - While combat was satisfying, it did feel way too simple. This was a major criticism of the game after it came out - everyone was requesting more depth to the game or to a potential sequel.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, besides all that, this is what is constantly on my mind whenever I think about this game...\n\nPotential Not Realised (Cut Content)I searched through the game files (audio, subtitle, code etc) and found a lot of cut content that never made it into the game. This cut content includes the following:\n\n- Wave Mode: The devs almost provided a gamemode for less-experienced players / people who did not like competitive matches against real people in the persistent online ToW. This mode had you fight against masses of regular army units, controlled by the AI, in which you had to defend your position. Winning a battle this way wouldn't have provided as many points as a player vs player outcome would have reached, but it would have contributed to the battleboard on a contested territory. It was also meant to be featured in the single-player campaign a few times as an extra gamemode. If you decided to play with an extra person, this could have been a pretty decent co-op mode that you could potentially play with friends to kill some time.\n\n- Terrorist Raids: The terrorist faction which you encounter in the Prelude to War story were not made solely for the single-player story - they were meant to provide yet another Player vs AI option for the online ToW to fight against if they did not wish to fight against real opponents to rank up their battalions, just like the wave mode. These terrorist raids would, obviously, attempt to raid army/air bases. Again, you could join up with a friend which would lead to another type of co-operative Player vs AI experience.\n\n- LAN ToW: The developers originally intended for players to be able to play their own ToW with or against friends if they did not wish to compete over the persistent online ToW. This is THE most annoying since the persistent online ToW is now dead - it could have kept a bit of that ToW spirit alive.\n\n- Cut Story Content: The main purpose of EndWar's original narrative was meant to serve as a conclusion to Ubisoft's first Tom Clancy saga. It meant to join up all TC media up until that point (Rainbow Six, HAWX, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell etc) into one game in an effort to end it all to make way for a reboot of the TC series to start fresh (which they're sort of doing now, what with Ghost Recon: Wildlands and Rainbow Six: Siege). Judging from the unused subtitles in the game's files, the overall background narrative of the entire game was meant to be set around a futuristic museum piece named "EndWar", which retold the course of events of World War III using painstakingly pieced-together recordings from the "Overlord Battle Interface", which commanders of all three contesting superpowers of the war used (the name of this interface is mentioned when the player has to go through the voice recognition tutorial at the start of the game). All of this information was meant to be told to the player by the narrator - the same narrator who spoke over the Prelude to War's introduction video. This narrator would provide more background commentary of the plot to the game and, depending on your actions, imply that the world in which the player is living in is under the control of one of these superpowers which has evolved into a New World Order (e.g. if the United States won the war, he was meant to say during the outro to the game "With the emergence of three superpowers... with only one world to share... this concludes the story of the war to end all wars...  remember those who gave their lives to fight for our freedoms. Thank you, and god bless the United States of Mankind." On the otherhand, if the European Federation won the war, the last bit is replaced with "remember those who gave their lives to fight for unity. Discipline always, Citizens of the Federation". For the Russian Federation, it was "remember those who gave their lives to fight for state. Glory to the Motherlands! Return to your duties." Check the files yourself if you don't believe me, it makes the original story concept seem way better in my opinion).\n\nAnd do you know what the most annoying thing about all this is? Literally all of the things I didn't like about this game were going to be fixed in their sequel - EndWar 2! They were going to update the story, the combat tree and finish the stuff that they didn't manage to fully implement for release which they had to cut. Such a shame. Hopefully Ubisoft come back to it one day, but I doubt it.","February 5","true","87.2"," 69 of 72 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","69","72","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakemanwhoelse/recommended/21800/","Jakemanwhoelse","Jakeman, Noble Citizen of London","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakemanwhoelse/","399 products in account","Right.\nSo.\nWhere do I start?\n\nTom Clancy's EndWar is a real-time strategy/real-time tactics game, unfortunately neglected by its developers, released in 2008 and featuring a World War 3 where your decisions decide the course of the war. It involves three factions - the USA, the European Federation (A unified EU) and the Russian Federation (Which has again expanded into Eastern Europe. Including, to nobody's big surprise, Sevastopol). The interesting thing about EndWar is that it is not like other RTS or RTTs - you do not decide where each army strikes, or what to research, or even if you want to make nice with China so it invades Russia - you are a mere colonel in a special operations branch of your faction's army, and the only control you have over the world is where you deploy. Whether you win or lose the battle as a result of said deployment changes whether your faction grows or shrinks. Other world events, such as typhoons or the U.S.S. George Bush being sunk by your nation's WMD and airstrikes are communicated through the world map's news service.\n\nThe campaign is split into two parts - a Prelude to War, in which the game explains the backstory and the game mechanics, as well as how and why World War III erupted and to give you a feel for each faction, and the Third World War itself. The AI is competent depending on difficulty level (On normal, for example, it is fairly competent, while on the hardest difficulty it is very competent), and the graphics are good for a game released in 2008.\n\nAll-in-all, I would very much recommend this game to everyone. Unfortunately, the Theatre of War servers (WW3 multiplayer) have been shut down and as a result players are restricted to games with friends or offline games. There are groups that still play EndWar matches, however I am not sure exactly of their URLs - they are, however, active on the Community Hub.","July 22, 2014","true","44.2"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","64","70","4","1"

You are a colonel, your rank is only below the generals, although you really have more combat power than they do. As a commander of the Joint Strike Force (USA), the Enforcer Corps (Europe), or the Spetsnaz (Ruskies), you get your very own battle advisor, in other words, a war secretary, a whole battalion of your nations finest, and access to WMD's (Weapon of Mass Destruction). One of those weapons being a big sattalite dropping kinetic rods with enough firepower to take out Time's Square. The combat is simple. click on a unit, and tell it: Attack enemy, Secure Uplink (Major Part Of Game), Send Nuke Here, or even evacuate to ensure its survival. However, the game was engineered for one purpose,,,,VOICE COMMANDS. Yes ladies and gentlmen, even though this was made in 2008 it still surpasses even Googles voice search. Using a simple way of speaking to units such as, "Unit 3, attack hostile 4." Why use a mouse when you can just say "SEND THE NUKE!" Before I get excited, i'm gonna stop myself and just finish with this.

It's got good gameplay, combined with good strategy. Also it's got an awesome feature. In Endwar you can control your units by talking. It's got voice-commanding, which i find awesome to use when i'm playing campaign. For exampel, i can say: "Unit 3 attack hostile 7", and unit 1 would move to engage hostile 7.\n\nIt's good strategy is amazing. Once i were up against 5 russian tank squads, i had 1 european tank squad, a gunship squad and an artillery squad. They had to move over a bridge to get to uplink Lima, so it got really dense at that bridge. By using my artillery, and gunships effectively, i destroyed all 5 russian tank squads. In Endwar, strength doesn't always come in numbers.\n\nPros:\nAmazing strategy usage.\nVoice-commanding (I absolutely LOVE it! Makes me feel like a real commander xD)\nGood balanced gameplay\n\nCons:\nMultiplayer is dead, so if you're buying it in 2015 and up, you can only play singleplayer\nThe Theater of War online scenario ended in 2009, and no new ones have been hosted.\nIn skirmish, the 3 factions roughly have the same units, with minor differences.\n\nMy Rating:\n4 Out Of 5 Stars","December 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"

Unfortunately it doesn't always work as promised, so occasionally you have to shout your commands a couple of times more than planned. Eventually you'll just go back to the way you usually give commands; by using menus. It was a good idea but it was too early to implement it just yet. The technology wasn't entirely ready for this kind of gameplay back then.\n\nAnd yet despite this flaw I had a good time with it, because it does give you the idea that you're the commander in charge and there's an actual war going on. Now, there's not a lot of tactics involved when we're talking about the battles here, because the idea is based on the real life rock paper scissors game. So if you use the right unit against the other you'll most likely win (depending on the amount of units, of course). It's simple, but it works and it doesn't make the game tediously boring, like many other strategy games. It's by no means perfect, but it's definitely fun. Just avoid the voice control feature.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","November 25, 2013","true","0.1"," 46 of 72 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","46","72","0","0"

Beacuse of the games voice control option which I find very effecient and fun. Also you get to cusomize your own battalion in one of the three factions (JSF,EUEC, or SPEZNAZ Guard). Each faction has unique upgrades. It also has a skermish mode where you can play against someone or the A.I. But The multiplayer isn't the best in the world and the campaign can get a bit repetitve some times. There is a lot of story and characters from other games like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. I recomend this game to Tom Clancy fans or people that love a really long campaign.","February 15, 2014","true","24.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

In Tom Clancy's ENDWAR you play as Tom Clancy, and are on a mission to end all of the wars by fighting a war.  A "War to end all war" as it were.  Tom Clancy's game features an interesting play mechanic, in that you quote Call of Duty man's phrases into the microphone, and Tom Clancy preforms various tricks according to what key words were spoken.  Animal lovers may want to avoid this title, as about half way through the game Tom Clancy runs into the ghosts that he busted way back in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon.  The two factions decide to settle their differences by seeing who can explode the most pidgeons from the top of the eifel tower (level is pictured in the games title card).  This is an excellent title for the Tom Clancy fan in your family, or as an entry to Tom Clancy's "Tom Clancy's" series.","June 17, 2012","true","0.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","60","12","20","19","3"

It's just something I usually ignore or forget. Although this game made me want to write a review because... Well it's awesome!\nThe game is amazing, it has effective and simplistic mechanics that make matches complex and tactical. Don't be deceived by how "easy" or "simple" it is at first, when you start to really get deep into it, it gets harder and harder and more challenging, providing loads of fun for hours if needed.\nI'm not really a strategy type of player but this game was an exception and it was a huge surprise to me since it was better than what I initially thought. I haven't played fully much yet but so far, from the moment I got in until the moment I decided to stop and play later, it kept me fully entertained and immersed on what was happening.\nThe only thing that din't please me and I might consider it as a con it's the fact that I could only put the resolution at 1280x720.\nSo basicly, I totally recommend people to try this game. Both strategy and non-strategy type of players.\n\nTL;DR\nPros\nSimplistic mechanics but that can make the game very complex in it's own away (Trust me, when you have more than 9 units on the battlefield it can become a real mess);\nAmazing gameplay that comes both from the mechanics (previously mentioned) and the A.I;\nAddictive and immersive.Cons\nCouldn't put the resolution to native, had to use 1280x720 (but it's not that big of a deal, it's awesome anyway);\nUnfortunatly from what I understood multiplayer is dead. You can still play with friends and such but online would be better. (Still great game believe me and worth the money I spent).","May 26","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Instead you are left struggling with both keyboard, mouse, and voice. Why use voice when you can just click? It seems to me for this idea to work, you have to either be able to do everything by voice or there would be no point.\n\n1) You can't take cover using voice, you have to click\n2) You can't control the camera using voice, not even with something as simple as "camera left left left", so you have to keep your hand on the mouse if only to rotate the view\n3) To move something or attack something, you have to know the number of the unit. What if you have 4 helicopters on the field and you want to attack a tank with the closest one? you can't, because you can't see the number of units on the map. So you have to keep guessing or switching between units looking for the right one. A better solution would be to have a bigger map, with numbers clearly shown above the unit icons.\n4) In time sensitive situations where you have to react quick, it is a real mess to attack the enemies because once again, it can be difficult to know the number of the unit you want to attack. Enemy tanks flanking on the left? Your helicopters are ready, but even if the tanks are on your screen often their number won't be displayed (it seems to depend on distance or visibility) so you can't efficiently react, and since you can't even send your units to a location by voice you'r back to right clicking.\n5) Mission command actually talks to you as you play, and if you are issuing commands at the same time you won't hear what is being said.\n\nSo to make it short, even if the available voice commands work well, voice recognition is reliable, the game relies too much on keyboard / mouse for the "voice commanding" thing to really fly. But i can see how if they make aonther game in the series and address all these issues, this concept of "hands free strategy" could be really fun.","February 22, 2014","true","1.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I went to using the mouse and keyboard because repeating myself did not feel great.\n\nUnits don't feel balanced. Am I to believe that 1 Riflemen unit out in the open with no cover can over power two groups of my Gunships? Once enemy infantry do take cover, you pretty much have to take them out with artillery or overpower them with 4-5 units. I don't understand why Riflemen function like superheroes. My Engineers can take cover and be destroyed by a single unit of tanks, but when the enemy does it, I have to bring everyone or make it rain brimstone.\n\nArtillery > Riflemen > all other units. (Gunships are pretty fantastic at taking out Artillery unless they're protected by Riflemen.)\n\nUpgrades in the singleplayer campaign don't feel like they do anything. They always felt underpowered against the enemy's equivalent and would lose in one-on-one's with me having an advantage. Some of the unit abilities are fun.\n\nCamera angles are annoying and restrict you from making good calls. Having to switch between units to see what they see is tedious.\n\nNo online (pretty much).\n\nGame looks nice.\n\nMissions are samey.\n\nSuperweapons really hamper my ability to enjoy the game. I went out of my way to avoid the conditions that cause superweapons to trigger in matches. Did you have a couple units protecting a base? Boom, they're gone (as is the base/uplink). Oh, you spread them out and think they're safe. Boom, gone. Units can't move fast enough as the missile drops very quickly. It encourages spreading units out. Really out. Annoying at best.","September 11, 2014","false","7.9"," 19 of 41 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","19","41","0","0"

This "RTS" features a very clunky voice-activated command interface.  I could not properly callibrate the thing to understand me.  It kept saying it was too loud, even at a whisper.  I could not get any microphone attunuation to make any difference.\n\nYou can still use the backup, which is a horride mouse interace where you go through several menus to say "Unit 1 attack hostile 3" and that is about all there is to your command interface.  You have some 3d follow camera which gives a very limited view of the battle field.  I do not know who thought this concept was a good idea.\n\nI suggest that you just stay away from this title.  I just uninstalled it even though I love RTS games and have only played a few missions.  It is that bad.  All I can think of is that someone tried to create a console-friendly RTS and this is what they ended up with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpes/recommended/21800/","derpes","Matthypaspist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpes/","208 products in account","I heartily recommend EndWar. Its twist compared to other RTS games is that you can use voice commands to order your troops or off-battlefield assets, and it suprisingly works incredibly well. However, don't push aside that mouse and keyboard yet as your voice commands are mostly simple commands. Move point A-Z, this unit attack that hostile, bomb this target, etc. Finer movements like better positioning or finding cover cannot be done with voice commands alone. Like I said before the combat mechanics make the game seem like a complicated rock-paper-scissors game, which it is in the prologue campaign, which you should still go through to learn all the commands or simple strategies to the game, but once you finish that campaign the game opens up into a much more complex RTS. Not WarGame levels of depth, but it is manageable for newer players. If there is one issue I find with the game is it's camera system. Your overhead camera  is always locked in on one unit and its immediate vicinity, which must be on purpose as there is a binoculars button that lets you zoom in on farther off objects that you can't see very well, because your cmaera is locked on your own unit. The way around this is by using your command vehicle unit which also allows you to use a birds eye view of the entire battlefield. However, even with this view you miss out on the action, and it doesn;t account for varying terrain height which can block line of sight. But overall I'm absolutely loving this game.","June 22, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a large amount of customization and tactical options for your army, not to mention the ability to command your troops through voice commands!\n\nThere is however a major downside: EA has pulled the plug on the 'Theater of War' (the entire Online/Multiplayer component) and rendered a large chunk of the game inert. Unless you take to the Bungle jungle or Hamachi Haven there is no way to even play online with your friends or others. And even then, you will never be able to participate in an all-out World War III conflict as you were able to in the past. You will be doomed to roundabout skirmish games.\n\nThis has also damaged the community severely. There are still a few lost souls that roam the forums looking for fresh meat but their numbers are ever dwindling.\n\nIn the end, is this game really worth buying if a major component 'doesn't work?' Well, that's up to you! The game itself is great and you can still play the entire war out in single player, alone. Hell, you could even try to revive the game base and create a regular group on Hamachi. But honestly, wait for a sale if you are still unsure. If you can grab it for 5 bucks you will not be disappointed!\n\n~Playing this game is like walking in the dark: you may think you have no one else beside you because you cannot see them, but they are there, you just need to reach out and grasp them.","May 25, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OverlordRagnarok/recommended/21800/","OverlordRagnarok","Hibiki~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OverlordRagnarok/","264 products in account","Certainly not the best in genre, but pretty entertaining nonetheless. Not a bad price at $10, although I would still wait to buy it on sale. $10 is worth it IMO....but still pushing it. I tend to have a higher tolerance for mediocre games than most, so others will probably only want to spend $5, at the most.\n\nThe story isn't real fantastic...or really even there at all after the short prolouge. You do get news casts after every mission for the first 20 turns or so....but they don't really add anything at all to the experience. Most of it doesn't even pertain to what you are doing in any way. (a major disaster in America, for instance, won't actually affect any missions you do in that same exact area) The parts that DO pertain to what you are actually doing....still don't affect the missions at all whatsoever. Basically just mentioning how well/poorly you're doing in the war. Not really sure why they even added this in the game, especially considering they eventually stop appearing.\n\nThe gameplay itself is where the game really shines (albeit, not very brightly. Especially not when compared to other games in the same genre). At the start of the main campaign, you choose to play as one of the three world powers (Russia, USA, or Europe) and then select a battalion to control (each with differing bonuses and unit preferences). Each mission consists of you deploying units and then using them to either capture uplinks, destroy "critical buildings", or destroy all hostile forces. Uplink missions can also be completed if you destroy all the hostiles, which ends up happening more often than capturing enough uplinks (especially towards the end of the game and/or when playing defense). After each success (or failure), you'll gain CR (credits) that can then be used to upgrade your troops for future battles. Units that survive the battle (even if they're defeated but successfully evacuate) will also gain ranks, which is mostly used to access the upgrades you purchase for that specific unit type.\n\nThere's not a lot of resource collecting in this game. The only "resources" you have are CP (command points) with only two ways to collect them. The first is the capture/upgrade uplinks, and the other method....is just to wait until they recharge by themselves. CP is used for deploying troops, and also for using your supports. Supports include Air Support (bombing), Electronic Warfare (disables enemy vehicles) and Force Recon (deploys troops on the battlefield that can't actually be controlled, but can still be useful for defending).\n\nDuring most (not all) missions, you'll also gain a 4th support after the mission enters "defcon" phase (towards the end). The support is a WMD, and you can use it without spending any CP whatsoever! The bad news? You can only use it once before a long recharge time, which typically takes longer than finishing the mission. Another bad thing (or good, depending on the situation) is that the losing side gets dibs on using theirs first (although there are rare occasions when they actually won't). Another thing to keep in mind when using this WMD....is that you can hit your own troops with it as well.\n\nWhen it comes to missions, the game is very open-ended. There will usually be 3 or more missions to choose from, and it's entirely up to the player which mission is undertaken that turn. Often after completing a mission, your country will win/lose OTHER missions as well. This can result in one mission's victory turning into 3 or 4 new territories! It can also result in gaining one territory in exchange for losing another....\n\nWhile the voice commands are a great idea on paper, in practice they are absolutely HORRIBLE. The system is waaaaaaay too finicky to be of any use if you can't talk 100% perfectly in the way the game wants you to. You're better off just sticking to using the keyboard and mouse for everything.\n\nOverall the game is a pretty enjoyable experience, but nowhere near the best option. I would really only recommend buying it if you're looking for a cheap RTS and don't mind the outdated graphics (the game is from 2009, after all. Wasn't really top-of-the-line back then, either). If you've got money to burn....spend it on the latest Sid Meier or Age of Empires game instead.","June 23, 2014","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe skirmishes still work so you can play with your friends (Note this based on discussions in the comments from 2014). I'm no good strategy player but I find this game to be enjoyable and well worth the 10$ it cost to buy. The single players good and I find the ai to be mostly fair. Later you go the ai can get a bit harsh. (3 wmds I had yet to use mine). The graphics still hold up today and all the units seem to have a good place.\n\nRiflemen: Seem to be the worst but there stealth ability and there aint engineer ability covers that. The can only with high casualty take down transports and Attack Helicopters.\n\nEngineers: are probably the most powerful unit in the game because they have only 2 normal weaknesses. Riflemen and slow speed.\n\nTransports: Anit helicopter, fast, and can transport troops. It cant take on tanks. Lowest hp vehicle (feels like riflemen have more hp)\n\nTanks: Anit ground units except Engineers and helicopters\n\nArty: Will kill everything in range but must know where it is and cant hit helicopters. Also has a minimum range. Anything close will kill them and helicopters are arty's nightmare.\n\nHelicopters: Fastest Unit in the game, Good firepower against everything except transports. Weaknesses Engineers and transports. (I've had 3 helicopter taken down by 1 transport unit.)\n\nCommand Vehicle: Just keep it away from action and you'll be able to use the map instead of unit to unit. You can use its UAV or drones.\n\nThe specials are better explained in game than what i can do. But 1 thing. All WMD's do the same thing. They 1 hit KO every thing in the blast radius. I believe the European lazer is the fastest "probably be .5 seconds" and the Russian Chemical nuke thing is the slowest by 1 second.\n\nLast thing the problems. The Ai can get stuck not too often. The Enemy Ai usually starts off easy then its like getting hit by a semi truck. SOME maps are unbalanced. The camera is very strange and breaks sometimes usually on ground troops.","June 25, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The vocal system is a little strange though, for instance I would say "Move tanks to Alpha" and it would respond with "Calling Mary."","April 29, 2013","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember being completely blown away by the voice command. (although while revisiting this title, I haven't used it much lol)\n\nI still regard this as a superior RTS when compared to many other titles. The struggle of siezing tactical advantages over your opponent is similar to rock paper scissors, each unit has a specific strength and a specific weakness. Making you have to think VERY carefully when issuing an order to move. You will have to try your best to plan ahead of any military disaster that you may experience and be ready for the worst case scenario at all times.\n\nThe out of battle experience is also a great part of the game. Before starting you are given the option of choosing your faction (USA/EU/RU) and then you choose your brigade type such as Mechanized/Armored/Airborne and so on. You get a tactical overview of the globe and are able to observe the ever changing battlefield, giving you the opportunity to decide on where it is important to have your brigade fight its next battle. Earning monies based on your brigades performance gives you the option to upgrade certain aspects of your brigade such as upgrades of equipment/technology, training that increases performance, off map supports and so on.\n\nMy faction overview:\n\nAmerica: Has the most accurate units and the best robotics technology, giving them a superior edge when using support units to either recon or defend a target area.\n\nEurope: Has the fastest moving units and the best Anti-Air, giving them the advantage of out manuevering the oppenent with ease.\n\nRussia: Has the most heavilly armored vehicles and many different weapon systems (cheap and available early game) that are able to be intergrated into single units that give them the ability to quickly suppress targets. They are also the best faction for engaging infantry targets while boasting the strongest infantry for themselves.\n\nI rate 9/10 as I am still playing this title that was released in 2008, -1 in score for all the times I raged at an airstrike or a WMD attack that completely rekt my plans.","August 29, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it first on my Xbox 360 with a headset and gamepad. Both platforms run it equally well.\n\nThe game has no story to speak of, and once you figure out the mechanics you have to switch to expert mode (which is the second of three difficulty settings), otherwise it will be too easy. Don't be fooled, however - one mistake can cost you grately.\n\nThe units have a staggering number of upgrades and abilities that you buy for credits. The more successful your operations are, the more money you earn. Depending on your style, you can prioritize your upgrades.\n\nThe voice command feature is the meat of the game. On Xbox 360 I used it almost exclusively. On PC I combine it with mouse/keyboard to be in a few places at the same time. As an avid RTS player, with a few thousand ladder games completed in Starcraft, Warcraft III, and Starcraft II, I still think that thanks to the voice system EndWar offers an unparalleld level of immersion. That said, the game does not require such a high skill level to master as the aforementioned titles.\n\nUnreal Engine 3 makes it still look awesome in 2016. It runs great on a dual core laptop with an intel 2.1 Ghz, 4GB Ram and a GT540m at 1280x720 maxed out details.\n\nNot sure if it keeps you busy for a long time, but the campaign shouldn't take you more than 10-15 hours if you do not repeat too often. Due to its randomness and three playable factions, you might wanna repeat it.\n\nI haven't checked the multiplayer mode on PC but it was fun playing it on Xbox 360. Not sure if the PC community is still there, though.\n\nI strongly recommend the title as it is something truly unique with its voice command feature","May 27","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
