"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/413420/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, developed by Spike Chunsoft and published by Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd. themselves. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair sequel to Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is not your typical visual novel where you will find romance and everything goes smoothly. Characters will die whether you hate them or love them. It has the touch of mystery, horror, point and click and detective work all in the mix of this visual novel not to mention the story is very interesting with and filled with unexpected twists around.\n\nThe StoryThe story is definitely one of the most interesting mystery and crazy story I have read. It has many plot twists and it is very confusing in a sense that it manages to conceal the truth until the very end of every case. I always end up suspecting the wrong character as the murderer, which surprises me and the cases are very detailed . [Especially for the final case]\n\nThe story takes place after the events of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. You will be placed into the shoes of Hajime Hinata. Who appears to be in front of Hope’s Peak Academy a government funded school for the privileged elite of society. A door then suddenly appears in front Hajime Hinata which leads to a classrooms where he meets his classmates that has also ended up in the same situation as him of not knowing how they ended up in the class room. After some verbal exchanges in between them, their teacher named Usami revealed to them that they are on a school trip on Jabberwock Island a paradise-like island. Usami then tells them they are on a school trip and they are to befriend each other to gain hope fragments and make their hope grow. What could go wrong here? Right?:) Of course not!! What are you thinking? Upupupupu Monokuma suddenly appears and takes control of the island, announcing that the students must participate in his murderous game if they wish to escape. Leaving them in despair, being placed in a game where they are being pressured subconsciously to kill their friend or not to kill in order to escape. But if they do not kill they may become the next target with all these pressure building up around them it is bound that someone will give in to it and it starts to turn ugly for them.\n\nCharacters are very memorable, each of them are unique and have some special traits about them. Personally my favorite character in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is Nanami Chiaki 七海 千秋 The Ultimate Gamer, she has that warm and cute side to her and is always there for Hajime Hinata [You in this case]. She is also highly knowledgeable about all genres of video games. She has a tendency to collect her thoughts before she starts speaking, so when she meets someone for the first time, the conversation is rather slow.\nThough she’s very passionate about video games, if Nanami Chiaki gets too comfortable she falls asleep, when she is standing up or midway through a conversation or even in a tense situation where killings are occurring.\n\nAudio and Visual ElementsVisual Elements – Many things to note here is that the backgrounds, CGs and character sprites used in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair are very consistent with each other in turn made the whole visual novel as whole looks smoother. This is really a huge thing for me overall I absolutely adore the artstyle used in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. I have played many visual novels where the character sprites are not consistent with the backgrounds at all and then in turn they do not blend in nicely causing them to not look nice or“smooth” at all. The sprites used are pretty much being used all the time in game except for the CGs.\n\nAudio Elements - Music is a very important factor to consider in a visual novel because music has a great ability to set the mood and make things flow from then on. Though Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair reused many of the first game’s music but added a few new additions. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair definitely has this executed perfectly. Each time the “phase” of the story chances, the BGM would change with it to set the mood and tension around the characters. Lets take for example in “logic dive” it uses this song called “Drive Drive”it is a new game mode that has been added into, I absolutely love the BGM as it is so fast paced and fits in with all the action that is going on.\n\nTo sum upWill I recommend this? Simple answer is yes. I would definitely recommend this awesome visual novel if you are the type of person who looks for gameplay in a visual novel as this definitely has loads of gameplay to offer and for people who loves detective work with dark mysteries waiting to be uncovered and solved go for it. Honestly I am not a fan of having gameplay in my visual novel I am more of the type of person that prefers to just click on my mouse all day long, but Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair has so much to offer, as it manages to rope me into with its rich story and great music with good gameplay. Though there are some things to point out on “hangman’s gambit” in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair compared to  Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc hangman gambit in Danganronpa 2 has quite a difficulty spike as it requires more attention to get the letters right and has a higher chance of failing. [I failed 2 – 3 times for the final case]\n\nI have been provided a review copy for Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair but it has no impact on this review in any way.\n\nP.S Enoshima Junko is best girl well.. I like Nanami but kind of prefer Enoshima Junko\n\nClick here for the full review with more details and images[azusantiara.com]","April 18","true","49.3"," 125 of 138 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","125","138","11","8"

Danganronpa is a mystery series, so you'd want to play the games in release order for maximum effect. That said, DR1 and DR2 pair together very nicely so you should try to get both of them if you can afford it.\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is an excellent followup to DR1 that excels the original in almost every respect. Memorable characters, a soundtrack worth shelling money for, a unique/bizarre gameworld and story, and to top it all off, the PC port is pretty great. I can't think of any reason *not* to recommend DR2 if you even remotely enjoyed the first game.","April 23","true","53.2"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","59","60","0","2"

That won't affect the criticism in the end, but you should know that because of FTC guidelines, as well as the whole morals thing you know?\n\nVideo Review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexUi8csBho\n\nTarget Audience:    Anyone who wants a mystery or an interesting story. Hell, for everyone.\n\nSummary:\nThe Danganronpa series is the Phoenix Wright series on steroids. And it's one of the best experiences that I've had in the past 10 years. Danganronpa 2 received the highest score of games I've formally reviewed on the Youtube channel: and that's for good reason: it's fantastic from all sides of the spectrum. A good murder mystery needs to have a couple of basic elements to be successful, and Danganronpa 2 knocks each of them out of the park. An interesting set of characters with great backstories that make you connect with them almost immediately: which makes the pain of possibly losing/being betrayed by them that much better. The game does misdirection better then any other murder mystery out there, in particular with those who played the first game. This game knows how to get into your head, and knows how to play off what you may be thinking to twist it around on you. The game hooks you and doesn't let you go, and any minor problems I had with the game were knocked out by its sheer strengths of writing and drama.\n\nIf you're looking for traditional gameplay, Danganronpa isn't that, but it's able to keep you interested with drama. If you haven't played the first, I'd recommend playing that first. It's great. Then play Danganronpa 2. Not only would you be glad that you did, but you'll remember the experience for a long, long time.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nIntrigue, Intrigue, Intrigue. This is a murder mystery, it lives off the mystery and shines throughout. You'll want to complete this all in one go, just because you'll be hooked. But you can't because....\nA fantastic set of characters that you'll connect to. There's a good variety here, and you'll want to complete each of their arcs to get a true understanding of their complex nature.\nWriting is great. Messing with your head and expectations is what the game does best, and it does it in an interesting and compelling way.\nMisdirection. If you think you know what to expect....you're probably in for some surprises.\nLength. 24-30 hour campaign that doesn't slow down. And that's only for the main story. There's a bang for buck here, even if it's a Visual Novel.\nDoes a great job of continuing from the first game and connecting the universe to it. It also understands how to do a sequel in the murder mystery genre.\nLittle refinements on existing mini games was appreciated, helped to add a little more challenge.\nDifficulty settings were appropriate for the different levels so that wider audience could be reached.\nLike the end-game content so that you can go back and complete all the character paths.\nHave I mentioned the writing is amazing?\nFantastic set of music to complement the action, but in particular, music that keeps the same base in several cases, but alters it for the trial/action in question. Very good job of complementing the emotion of the game.\nNegatives:\nA problem with Alt tabbing, where changing context leaves you unable to get back into the game. Annoying.\nSome wrong control descriptions at one point.\nUm......There's not much else that's wrong with it. All the other “problems” get fixed along the way in terms of plot, so you got to be in it for the long haul.\nThat Danganronpa 3 won't be out in America in 2016. Because I'm a crack addict, and I need my fix.","April 18","true","28.5"," 57 of 81 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","57","81","8","0"

It's bigger, better, and more wacky, twisted and extreme than its predecessor.\n\nA good sequel uses the original as a jumping off point to explore new ideas, and that's what DR2 achieves. Granted, in many aspects, it is a rerun of the first game, only on a much bigger scale, but it adds just enough lore, mystery and creative kills to make it all worth it.\n\nMuch like the first game, DR2 starts off slow so you can get to know the distinct characters before the killings begin; but perhaps it's a bit *too* slow. I'd say it takes about two chapters before the plot really starts to kick in and the more interesting events begin to unfold. During that time you'll click through a lot of redundant dialogue and descriptions, which is quite a shame.\n\nBut what's a DR game without murders and trials? And boy oh boy does DR2 excel in that regard. The motives Monokuma gives this time are much more interesting and original than the first game's, the murders are extremely creative and brutal, and the trials are more difficult, intense, and filled with twists and turns. One killing in particular was so devilishly brilliant and well-executed, it genuinely surprised me the first time I experienced it.\nThere are some moments where the game expects you to make massive jumps in logic and it is quite overwhelming once it gets going, but thankfully the game is quite forgiving when it comes to mistakes.\n\nThe overarching plot this time around is significantly bigger and wilder than the first, spanning not only the mysteries of Hope's Peak Academy and its past, but of the island and many of its inhabitants. The game constantly throws more and more questions at you, and while it manages to tie every thread neatly, it does so in a pretty messy way.\n\nSo overall, if you liked DR1, or watched the anime version and have any interest in the sequel, I say buy it. It took me about 27 hours to beat back-to-back and like the original there are some neat extras to keep you going.","April 22","true","29.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","2"

I obsessively played the first, totally enthralled by the intricate story, the fantastic writing, and the neon-edged psychopunk visuals... then nearly bought a Vita just so I could play the sequel.  I had to know what happened next!\n\nPositives:\n\n-  The writing.  Oh God, the writing is totally spot on.  Full of strangely translated Japanese-isms, chock full of memorable characters, and truly intricate mysteries, what else do you really need?\n-  The art style is insane.  Anime/Manga stylings crossbred with 80s retrowave neon, topped off with a heady froth of island beauty.  Never has such an idyllic setting been host to such nefarious deeds.\n-  Voice Acting.  Not all of the dialogue is spoken, but the stuff that is is brilliant.  Even the random punctuating exclamations are pretty funny in their own right.\n-  Nekomaru.  Big muscle dude wearing his coach's whistle on a big ♥♥♥ chain around his neck, willing to give anyone deep tissue massages?  Pinch me.\n-  The adult-oriented nature of it all.  Going from Phoenix Wright to this was like jumping in the deep end of a freezing swimming pool.  Here's to hoping there's more Nekomaru oriented fanservice.  }:D\n\nNegatives:\n\n-  If you minimize the game for any length of time, it freezes up.\n-  No autosave, so you have to remember to make periodic save stops... lest a minimized freeze-up eats up 2 hours of gameplay.  (Speaking from personal experience, in both games.)\n-  The next Danganronpa game isn't due out in the US for quite some time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jirocho/recommended/413420/","jirocho","Umi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jirocho/","35 products in account","TL;DR - If this game is on sale and you've played and enjoyed the first Danganronpa (Trigger Happy Havoc), this game is 100% worth the money.  An instant buy if on sale, and still completely worth it at full price.\n\nLong version below.\n\n-----<< Non-Spoiler Review >>-----\n\nFor those interested in buying, I'm going to try to keep this as SPOILER FREE as possible.\n\nFirst of all, this game can be played without any prior Danganronpa knowledge but it is HIGHLY recommended you play the first Danganronpa entry before purchasing/playing DR2.\n\n\n--<< WHAT IS IT >>--\n\nThe gameplay and premise in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the similar it it's predecessor, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.  If this is the first Danganronpa entry that you're going to play, then Danganronpa plays like a regular visual novel, but with mini-games and collectibles.  If you don't know what a visual novel is well it's technically like a book.\n\nWhat makes Dangonronpa 2: Goodbye Despair different than any other visual novel?  Well it's not about finding your favourite waifu and giving them presents (okay there is some of it, but it's not the main point!) but rather it is a darker toned, muder-mystery type visual novel.  Sort of like a weird, zany, mix of Phoenix Wright and Zero Escape.\n\n--<< PREMISE >>--\n\nAs I said above the premise is similar to the first game.  You play as a rather normal looking male highschooler hoping to attend one of the worlds most prestigious school, the inspiring and incredible Hope Peak Academy.  But before you long, you realize you've actually been thrown into some sick, battle royale-esque, life or death game with other extremely talented and goofy students.\n\nThe only way to escape this terrifying game is to MURDER another student and get away with it.  After a certain amount of time after a bodies discovery, a class trial will be held.  At this point you and the other students must discover the 'Blackened' (in other words the killer) and vote him/her as the culprit.  If you're wrong, well then.. everyone get's executed and the Blackened will escape the game!\n\nP.S - There is a lot of death in this game.\n\n--<< GAMEPLAY >>--\n\nNow that you get a gist of the premise and what type of game it is, now let's go over the general gameplay.\n\nFor the most part, the game is a regular visual novel.  There are lots of text and lots to read.  The game is usually broken into segments of:\n\nFree Time\nInvestigations\nClass Trials\n\nFree Time is when you're allowed to do, well, whatever you want.  You can travel around and speak with the other students and learn more about them and you know, give your waifus presents and good stuff like that.\n\nInvestigations are moments in the story where you are given an amount of time to go around investigate and gather clues before the Class Trials begin.\n\nLast but not least, the Class Trials are where your wits will be put to the test.  A lot of the minigames require you to logically point out/agree with mistakes in your classmates testimonies, and this part of the game is rather intense.   There are a lot of mini-games and they're rather difficult to explain so I'm not going to, but they vary from intense jeopardy type games to slicing words across the screen with a blade and then countering to rythmn mini-games.\n\nThere are also up to 3 different difficulty settings if you just want to casually enjoy the game or want to challenge yourself (and the game is challenging).\n\nThere is a sort of world map like hub where you get to walk around and travel to where you want to go.  After entering you can move a first-person camera around to click and investigate on certain objects.  There are also some first person dungeon-like maps where you can physically walk around and look at stuff but these are a bit more rare.\n\nIf we compare the game to Danganronpa 1, it improves on this point in almost every aspect (I'm looking at you Hangman's Gambit mini-game.. -shudders-).\n\n--<< MUSIC >>--\n\nIt's good.  Certain themes are quite memorable.\n\nDUAL AUDIO ! (Yayy!  JP VOICES!)\n\n--<< CHARACTERS >>--\n\nIf not for the f**king insane story and cases you're going to have to solve, pick it up for the incredible and lovable cast of characters.\n\nDanganronpa is a type of game where, well, you're never going to be sure who's going to survive to the end.  But because of the Dating Sim-like Free Time segments, there are some characters that you're going to really grow attached to.  Which is a good thing in most games.  But in this game, where you're never sure who's going to get the axe next.. It's a pretty scary feeling.\n\nIt's also what makes Danganronpa games so fun in general.  There's something about picking out your favourite characters at the very beginning, getting to know them, and praying to god that they make it through this ordeal with you.\n\nIt's nothing like watching the cast of characters dwindle down, only to see a handful remain, growing to trust them, only to tragically realize another body has been found.\n\nIt's rather heartbreaking.\n\nI also enjoyed these characters more than the ones in the first game, but that's probably preference.  By the end of the first game I was probably only attached to 2 of the suvivors, but by the end of DR2 I was heartbroken, and attached to everyone that made it through.\n\n--<< STORY >>--\n\nDon't want to go into detail here.  There are a huge amount of references to the first game which make this game much better to play.  But you can definitely jump into DR2 without playing the first one.\n\nBut to sum it up, the story is amazing.\n\n\n--<< CONCLUSION >>--\n\nIf you're a fan of Phoenix Wright, Zero Escape, or Visual Novels and are looking for something new, buy DR1 THEN buy this game.   It's challenging, decently long from 20-30 hours depending on how you pace yourself, with an INCREDIBLE story that only builds upon everything that was great from DR1 and makes it even better in DR2.\n\nIt's completely worth the cash.  Every cent of it.  Easilly one of the best games I've played in the last few years and I cannot wait for Danganronpa V3 to come out on the PS4/VITA.","May 4","true","35.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

In fact if I were asked to play a visual novel, I probably would have said 'no' or 'what's that supppose to be some kind of picture book?' Luckily a friend of mine gave me a brief overview of the story and I figured I'd give it a shot - before I had any idea what life changing ridiculousness I was in for.\nI purposely omitted reviewing the first Danganronpa after finishing it as I wanted to get a better sense of visual novels by continuing with the sequel; Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. Although It would make sense to start by reviewing the story, it is too easy to accidentally give away plot points, so I will keep my comments about the story to a minimum and instead just give some generic comments.\n\n**No spoilers**\n\nCharacters:\nIf you have played Danganronpa 1 its very easy to wonder how the 'unique' bordering on insane characters could be topped, but honestly the characters in Danganronpa 2 go leaps and bounds above the first game. The characters in the second game make the characters in first seem comparatively... ordinary. None of the characters come across as unoriginal or uninspired. In fact, I often wondered what kind of insane being would have come up with some of the characters. I'm tempted to reveal names, but its worth finding out for yourself - I loved Chiaki and Hiyoko\nFortunately Monokuma returns and brings so much more humour to the game. He has definitely been improved upon and it was great to see a new character to complement Monokuma too!\nThe voice acting is incredible. The level of skill in the actors performances is insane. That includes every character (...Terteru).\n\nGameplay:\nThis is the only part of the review where I actually have some criticism (although it is minimal).\nGameplay can be split up into 3 main categories: exploration, class trials, and extras.\n\nExploring the island was incentivised by the amazing variety in scenary. It must have took some extremely creative thinking to shift the games themes and mechanics from a school to an island. Nevertheless the island setting had so much promise and it certainly delivered. Controlling the main protoganist operates very similar to the first game, however the camera perspective and controls change depending on your location. Whilst the first person perspective from Danganronpa 1 is maintained, the second game introduces a new 2D perspective which was quite nice to see in terms of freshening up the gameplay. The choice of setting the game on an island certainly allowed the creators to play with different ideas from holiday resorts to an industrial environment.\n\nThe class trials were developed from the first game. I'm not sure if the developers intended to merely improve upon the trials from the first game, or bring in new ideas entirely  - probably a mix of both.\nThe majority of the class trials remained largely the same with new mechanics being added to every task within a class trial. Hangman's Gambit changed almost entirely which is my main criticism for this game (but lets face it, this is a petty criticism. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel for something bad to say). No matter how quickly you have worked out what the missing words are, you have to be lucky enough for the required letters to appear in pairs on the screen whilst simulateneously trying to prevent other letters from crashing into each other... Its less about logic and more about how fast you can move your mouse across the screen.\n\nTwo new components have been added to the class trials. The first is the Rebuttal Showdown which, as the name suggests, is a pretty rapid and intense 1 v 1 debate against another character. The music alone gets you fired up!\nThe second is Logic Drive which is a snowboarding minigame with questions about the particular murder case within it. I really liked it, although it may not be for everyone. I thought it was a nice change in gameplay.\n\nThere are numerous other extra elements of gameplay which cannot be found in the Danganronpa 1 such as an arcade game. But again, it would be better not to divulge into the details in a review.\n\nStory:\nThere's not a lot which can be said without revealing any sort of plot points implicitly, however what I can say is that not only is the story engaging throughout, but the ending is surprisingly satisfying (although there are a lot of questions left unanswered - or maybe I just have too many questions).\nAs expected, the story is filled with many twists and turns which naturally led me to write the first two sentences of this review with ease. Even if you think you know the answer, you never really know the answer. I took out a pen and paper just to draw diagrams and take notes to help me solve class trials. Although I didn't need to do this, the story was so engaging that I wanted to make sure I understood everything that was happening... NO GAME has made me do this before. Some of the class trials really help you learn creative ways of murdering people in real life too... Yeah the games great. Real inspiration.\n\nMusic:\nAs a self-declared video game music junkie, an amazng soundtrack instantly makes me fall in love with a game... I fell in love agan!\nFirstly, I'm glad quite a number of music pieces in the first Danganronpa retrurned (or were modified slightly) for the sequel. The majority of the music in the class trials remained the same as the first game and a few other pieces (such as Monokuma's theme) remain unchanged. This was not a problem for me at all! It did not feel as though any piece of music was overused or underused. As for the new pieces, they were true masterpieces; they even had me dancing from time to time. I can't dance, but who cares.\n\nConclusion:\nI didn't write this review in the hope of convicing people to buy the game, ironically. If you loved Danganronpa 1 then its more likely than not that you have already bought this game. In which case I'm preaching to the choir. If for some reason you hated Danganronpa 1, then the chances are you wouldn't even contemplate buying the second. I'm writing this review because this game damn well deserves reviews to be written for it. This is one of those rare games which needs to be talked about so much more than it already is. I never would have touched Danganronpa had it not been for ONE friend who just happened to have watched a Youtube lets play covering it. Both games in the series have opened up my eyes to a whole new genre... My friend must be the... Ultimate Hope!\n\n9.5/10 - Would lose my mind again","May 6","true","32.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupremeExplosion/recommended/413420/","SupremeExplosion","ZXNova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupremeExplosion/","14 products in account","So I completed Dangan Ronpa 2 a few days ago. I also played through Island Mode as well. I have a lot I wanna say, but it'll take some time to gather my thoughts.\n\n==WARNING FULL GAME SPOILERS==\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDangan Ronpa 2 is a good game. I liked it a lot. I really got into the story, the characters among other things. Though I think I'll start off with some issues I had with the games.\n\nCase 3 - The murder weapon that was used to kill Saionji was never found or even searched for. Having played Ace Attorney before, I know that in the (not exactly) words of Phoenix Wright "Evidence like that would never be overlooked". Apparently the reason why this was the case (according to the DR Wiki) is because the developers had originally intended for Kuzuryu to be killed during Case 3 rather than Saionji, however they decided to repeal this decision because "Peko's sacrifice would have been for nothing"... Honestly, wouldn't her sacrifice being all for nothing have been the more despairing? It ended up causing an issue with Case 3 that bothered me a lot besides Mikan being the killer :/ A friend of mine were discussing Case 3, and he believed that Case 3 would have been better if it was just Ibuki getting killed.\n\nThe Island Mode... I wish there was more attention to detail in it. Their only excuse was "it's an extra mode anyway", comon now, you could have the extra mode have more... extra in it. At least the endings in Island Mode were very satisfying for me. Island Mode is a fun mode at first, but I can see it getting a bit boring after you gained everyone's hope fragments and are just trying to get everyone's ending. After getting everyone's ending in Island, I can say confidently that I felt very happy.\n\nMonomi mode is pretty interesting. The keyboard controls suck, and I'm only able to use my controller by using JoytoKey.\n\nEvery murder in this game was very tragic. Either because of the murdered or the murderer. Teruteru was trying to kill Nagito to protect (Faker) Byakuya, but ended up killing him instead. Peko was trying her best to protect Kuzuryu and ended up being sacrificed in the end and with her loved one nearly dying too. Mikan is the one person you would have ever expected to commit murder. However, some stupid despair disease made her do it... I'll speak on this later. Nekomaru and Gundham fought it out, a "mutual killing" for the sake of their friends. Nagito, as twisted as he was, was trying to get rid of all despair, and he was inadvertently helping AI Junko.\n\nSpeaking of which, finding out that every classmate in DR2 was an Ultimate Despair was really surprising... Can you really imagine Nekomaru being an ultimate despair? I know I sure can't.\n\nThis ending isn't "as" despairing as DR1 in a way, but thinking about DR1 makes it more despairing. It makes you realize that everyone who died in DR1, is actually dead. No hope of ever coming back. This wasn't a dream. Celes, Ogami, Chihiro, Ishimaru, Mondo, Yamada, and everyone else is just dead. At least DR2 is kind of a dream. At least your friends are comatose. However, you could also say that's worse than death. Also, according to the wiki, because Mikan and Nagito had died knowing that the world they were in was all just a game, they have a higher chance of waking up than everyone else. DR2's ending really left me in between hope and despair.\n\nPicking up where I left off about Case 3, I really felt cheated about that one. Despair Disease? Really? Why didn't AI Junko ever use that again huh? Had everyone killed off. Despair Disease just felt like a crappy plot point to get an unlikely character to be a murderer. (My favorite DR character from each game just so happened to be the murderer in CASE 3). However, thinking on it I can also see its purpose. To give you a taste of how everyone once was. Everyone in this class except Chiaki was an ultimate despair. Even the most unlikely like Mikan had an evil and despicable personality in their past. This is why they're using the Neo World Program to restore hope. So they could change.\n\nHowever, after some thinking on it, I realize that the despair disease itself wasn't bad, it was how it was executed. Using despair disease to "force" a motive on someone is just really bad. It was nice with Akane, Ibuki, and Nagito just having the despair disease. If the Case 3 murder were just left off with Ibuki being killed, it would have been an even more interesting case, but no, they needed an extra person to die to parallel to DR1 case 3.\n\nAs for characters, I don't feel like going into it. My favorites were Mikan, Chiaki, Nekomaru, and Gundham. I will admit that Nagito is very well written, but he's a golden turd, ya know. Kuzuryu was also pretty good, and knowing that Kuzuryu was originally intended to die in Case 3 makes me kinda wish, or well, want to see how things would have went if it went the way it was originally intended to be. With Saionji being a survivor instead of Kuzuryu. (Pick your Loli Shota). Saionji is an annoying foulmouthed brat but... she grew on me. I kinda like her. Frankly, I don't feel any guilt in it.\n\nOther than that, the story was fantastic. I had many feels. "The Day Before the Future" made me cry. Soundtrack in general is pretty good. Kill Command was a great track during case 5.\n\nBut yeah, good game.","May 3","true","74.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/413420/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the official sequel to 2010's hit release of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, available at long last on PC. Its premise is the same as the first - a large group of quirky characters find themselves robbed of their memories and stranded in a closed environment, with the only possibility of escape coming as a reward should they manage to commit a murder and escape identification as the culprit by their peers in the subsequent class trial. When this happens, they are allowed to go free while everyone else is executed, while if they fail, they themselves will be executed while everyone else gets to keep on living.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that I absolutely adore nearly everything about this game. The story is composed of (as you'd expect) a series of murder mysteries that take place within a greater overarching narrative wherein the protagonists try to plumb the mysteries of why they're being confined and forced to murder each other, as well as the events that lead them to their current circumstances. The characters are a good mix of anime tropes and actual development, and for the most part come off as very sympathetic and believable in their motivations, given the context and genre. Unlike other VNs, there's no branching routes or choices to be made in the main game, for the most part, and the story is entirely linear. There's a few parts that I felt were a bit too fanservicey (and I don't mean the ones where the resident whimpering dojikko keeps tripping herself into ever more compromising and risque positions) but overall, the writing is excellent, hitting all the emotional beats and following a logical progression even when it appears to be devolving into complete and utter nonsense. Unfortunately, DangitRonpaul 2 continues the tradition started by 1, in that the best girl dies far too early on, but thankfully so does the worst, so I guess I can't really complain in the long run.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of two parts - exploration, which consists of a looping side-scrolling section you use to navigate the game's islands, static scenes that resemble pop-up books where you interact with things and people using your cursor, and first person sections that you use to explore certain specific environments. The other major part is the investigation and trial section, where all of the actual meat of the gameplay is - you examine locations and talk to people in order to gather clues, and then deploy these clues in a trial setting in order to determine the culprit. Sometimes this takes the form of straight-up questions, sometimes you're asked to pick a relevant piece of evidence for a particular problem from your entire big list, and sometimes you have to play an infuriating minigame in order to accomplish the same thing as the latter two options, but most often you'll be going around a circle listening to everyone make propositions about what happened, and either calling out inconsistencies by shooting their words with the damning piece of evidence or backing them up using the same process. At other times, your peers will call you out themselves, prompting a verbal duel where you use the analog stick to slice apart their arguments in preparation for a final devastating rejoinder. I played on mean difficulty for both logic and action for all but the final chapter (where I set the action difficulty down a notch to kind) and I found the trials fair and for the most part fun. The order of events makes sense, and there's only a few instances which required significant leaps of logic in order to figure out the proper way to proceed, but there's enough twists and surprises in the mysteries to keep you guessing and doubting yourself even when you're pretty sure you've solved it.\n\nYou can't actually fail in either the evidence collection or the trials, of course - trying to leave a scene before you've got all the pertinent clues results in your character refusing to do so, and running out of influence (which is like HP) during a trial only reduces the reward you get at the end, and so should be entirely appropriate for products of the modern Western education system. My biggest complaint against the gameplay would be two minigames that seem entirely out of step with the theme of the game and completely unfun, and whose removal would have only served to make the game much better. The hangman's gambit game is just a very slow and often frustrating way of spelling out an obvious thing, and the snowboarding minigame is out-of-place and tacked-on, where its only relation to the events it's representing is that you sometimes answer multiple-choice questions. I honestly would have preferred just getting the multiple-choice questions alone without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t snowboarding.\n\nIn terms of presentation - which is to say art, music and voice acting, I have nothing but good things to say. I played with Japanese voices, and you can tell that they really shelled out for an A-list cast. My only complaint in that regard is that when you get KanaHana to voice your character I only hear KanaHana and not the character. The art, meanwhile, is characteristically great, and even the lo-fi lo-res pop-up book look of the game's various environments has a distinct charm to it. Some of the CGs are a little spotty in parts, great in others, but are somewhat rare overall, and, most importantly, the character sprites you'll be looking at for most of the game look great.\n\nOne aspect which I felt could definitely be improved was in the localization - some of the translations felt more than a little awkward, and the script is riddled with minor but noticeable grammatical errors. Not enough to ruin the experience by any stretch of the imagination, but nonetheless enough to bug you if you're the same sort of friendless pedant as me.\n\nBeyond that, I'd say that the game is absolutely exceptional. Not only that, but it comes with a good amount of goodies, including a whole alternate route where the killing never started, which plays a bit more like a conventional school life VN, and a bonus LN by Narita Ryougo of Baccano and Durarara fame. If you were a fan of the first game, I would absolutely recommend you check this out. If you like VNs, anime, murder mysteries or good stories, I highly suggest you check out the first installment if you think it'd interest you even the slightest little bit. You're highly unlikely to be disappointed.","May 1","true","33.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

My fear was severely misplaced. Even if you know the answers or the final outcome, the mysteries in this game are more than complex enough to be perplexed by them a second time around. What surprised me the most though, was the emotion this game had to offer. Dangan Ronpa 1 was fantastic in a lot of ways, but I feel like this one was more emotional overall. In the first game, there are 2 trials in particular that are execptionally emotional to me. In this game, there are 3. It may just be one more, but as this game's 2nd, 4th, and 5th trial all made me cry like a baby...well, I think that speaks for itself. In short, buy this game. Buy it right now, or wait for a sale. It doesn't matter. Just make sure you buy it. It provides more than enough hours of play just by going through the main story once. Beyond that, there's also extra game modes to be played (like island mode, which can sometimes take just as long as the actual main story to complete 100%), achievements to be aquired, in game items to get, etc. You'll get your money's worth no matter what you pay. It's an emotional rollercoaster with some incredibly tense moments and complex mysteries. I would reccommend playing Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc first, as multiple references are made to it in the story, but that's also not required if you really don't want to. The one problem I have with this game is that some of the characters can fade into the background if you don't spend your free time with them, and there's never enough free time in the main story. Then again, that's the whole reason they have island mode and let you replay chapters once you've beaten them. Great game from a great series, can't wait for Dangan Ronpa 3.","May 13","true","49.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In short, it's a linear story-heavy visual novel with grotesque and adult theme and "puzzle" elements in the form of Phoenix Wright style trials. If that's your thing, then go play, or read about the first game. If it's not, then at the very least do the latter, because the series is quite unique in nearly every aspect and may convince you anyway.\n\nWhen it comes to Danganronpa 2 I can safely say it's a really good sequel. The story features new characters and setting, the gameplay has been improved, new features have been added, and the music and visuals are just as good and unique as last time. It's a great game that surely all fans of the previous one will appreciate.\n\nBUT... that said, it is difficult to avoid comparisons to the previous game, and as such my opinion will probably sound a bit negative. I hear many people consider the sequel to be better. Sadly, I don't agree. Story-wise, it's kind of a similar killing-game with a deeper mystery, just in a different setting. As much as I was engaged and surprised by numerous "twists", there were a lot of really silly, or just idioitc moments, especially by the end. Same goes for characters, which I don't consider as charismatic as the ones from the previous game. Most of them are just irritating and rarely there's anything redeeming about them. They feature one or two personality traits for the entire game (unless they die, that is) and that's it, which is sad, especially when a single joke is being run into the ground repeatedly for hours. Of course there are exceptions, but that's what they are. Personally, I didn't really care for the majority of characters, while the overall story didn't leave as much of an impression as the first game. But as I've said - that's in comparison, because as a whole it's still quite good and engaging, with a lot of nice twists.\n\nAs for the gameplay, one should appreciate how the developers tried to improve on the existing features and add some new ones. Some of these changes work, others not so much. I really enjoyed the fact that you can agree with a character's statement, instead of just pointing out holes and mistakes constantly. At the same time I hated the new Rebuttal Showdown mechanic, which is just a button masher. And being time-limited it makes it hard to focus on what the character is saying. I also didn't really see the point of Logic Drive. Although answering questions in such way is quite clever, it also tends to drag on unnecessarily later on.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game I think is the fact that many answers or statements you have to shoot at are very arbitrary and not always logical. With more than six Truth Bullets available during Non-Stop Debates picking the right combination often comes down to luck or trial and error. I didn't have such issues with the previous game, while this time even though I knew what the issue was, finding the right way for the character to point it out was problematic more often than not.\n\nYou could say I'm nitpicking, but I just think the game could have been much better in some areas. As it stands, it's still great, but just not as great as the first one. At least in my opinion. That said, if you enjoyed the first game, there's really not much reason in not playing the second one.","June 1","true","36.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am very emotionally invested in this fictional universe.\n\nSo far, I'm blown away by a good 90% of the (notable) changes made. Class trail minigames are better, in my opinion, and the addition of agreements/consents to the nonstop-debate game adds a whole other dynamic- pursuing what others say, instead of shutting them down. Of course, this all has to be done in linear fashion, there's still only one way to do any given trial.\nAs for the main story, it's pretty different from DR1, but not in a bad way at all- the 'player' character (In this case, Hajime Hinata) is more relatable, in my opinion, and the cast is as colourful and diverse as ever. Even the characters I wasn't too keen on grew on me over time. The location is drastically different, and so are your methods of travel, but it's mostly improvement in my eyes.\n\nI won't say too much because you should REALLY just buy it and check it out, but I'll say one tiny complaint:\nWhen a character spoke in DR1, their name used to run along the top of the dialogue box at the bottom of the screen- now, it's on the side of the screen, sideways. It'd not that big a deal, because you know who's talking by their sprites (usually), but it's harder for some to recall names when they're so out of the way.","April 20","true","114.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So, if my opinion has changed too much I may update the review.\n\nAlso note: Majority of this review is going to be me comparing the first and second game. :P\n\nStoryYou play as a high school student named Hajime Hinata. You get invited to enroll in a high school named Hope's Peak Academy- a school for "Ultimate" students. After you arrive there, you and the other students immediately go on a school trip to a tropical island to have some fun.  Well, that fun is quickly ruined when a stuffed-animal-like bear named Monokuma shows up and tells everyone that you must kill each other in order to leave the island.\n\nIs this better than the first game?I'll admit, before this game was released I kept searching online to see if people thought this game was better than the first. Most people I came accross said this game was indeed better. Now after playing it, I agree. Danganronpa 1 was better at setting a tense, creepy atmosphere since you were trapped in a school building with no way of viewing the outside world. But in DR2, you're trapped on a beautiful island instead. Being stuck on an island doesn't have the same creepy feel as being stuck in a school. But other than that, Danganronpa 2 is pretty much better in every other way.\n\nClass TrialsJust like the first game, you have to complete Class Trials everytime someone is murderered. After someone is killed, you have to investigate for clues/evidence then you begin the "Class Trials" where everybody debates and tries to figure out who the killer is. Class Trials are my favorite part of the game. They are made up of different "mini-games" that you have to complete to find the killer.\n\nIn my opinion, Class Trials in this game are a lot more difficult than the ones in DR1. The class trial "mini-games" from DR1 are in here as well, except the developers changed or added to them to make them more difficult. They also added a couple of new mini-games to the class trials. (They may have added more, but like I said, I've only beaten chapters 1 & 2).\n\nNot only are the mini-games harder, but I believe that the cases require more thinking to solve than the ones from DR1. In DR1, I played on Mean (hard) difficutly. Yeah, I would fail every now and then during a class trial but I never got really stuck on one. In DR2, I failed the FIRST class trial 4 times. It was sooo much harder than any case I'd solved in DR1. Also, each trial in Danganronpa 1 took me usually an hour or hour and a half to complete but the first trial in DR2 took me nearly 3 hours. So either the trials are more difficult or I just need to get good.\n\nAlthough the trials are more difficult, they're still a lot of fun! I'm really glad they changed the class trials a bit so they weren't exactly like the ones from DR1. The only mini-game I wish they kept the same was "Hangman's Gambit". The Hangman's Gambit in DR2 is honestly just annoying and not fun. My favorite addition in the class trials is probably the new mini-game "Logic Dive". It's really fun.\n\nCharactersSo, in Danganronpa 2, we're introduced to a new cast of characters! I honestly like this cast more than the cast from DR1. I love their character designs and personalities! In DR1, I only had one character I REALLY liked (Kyoko), but in DR2 I have at least a few I REALLY like (Komaeda, Hajime, Chiaki). Nagito Komaeda is now my favorite character in the whole DR series.\n\nAlso, I like Hajime Hinata (main character of DR2) a LOT more than Makoto Naegi (main character of DR1). Don't get me wrong, I still liked Naegi, but I like Hajime a lot more. Hajime is probably my 2nd favorite character in the Danganronpa series.\n\nA few minor thingsThese are just some minor features I noticed that I thought I'd point out. For one, I enjoy walking around a lot more in this game. In DR1, every time you had to travel to a different aera, you'd walk around in first-person. However, in DR2, whenever you travel to a new area, the game turns into a side-scroller and you walk around that way (I suck at explaining things). An example can be seen here[i.kinja-img.com]. It's really pleasing to watch Hajime walk/run around on the beautiful island.\n\nAnother thing is that I like how the devs encourage you to not fast-travel in this game. This game adds a "Pets" feature. When you access your e-handbook, you'll see a "Pets" option and when you click it, you'll basically just see a digital pet. But, the pet grows the more steps you take in the game. Once your pet is grown up, a new pet will be born.\n\nAlso, early on in the game, Monokuma tells you that his monokuma prototypes are scattered around the island and he wants us (the player) to find them. So, it's just a fun little side challenge trying to find his prototypes in the different areas of the game.\n\nLastly, I like this game's interface more than the first game's.\n\nOverallGreat murder mystery game! I love it a lot more than the first. It has great music, great voice acting, great story, great characters, and I just LOVE the art style. Now, I haven't beaten the game yet like I have previously mentioned, but it doens't seem like you would need to play DR1 in order to play this game. I've only noticed a few DR1 references here and there but nothing major. So, if you had to choose between getting DR1 or DR2, I highly recommend this one.","April 20","true","76.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

With many new gameplay elements and an all new cast of characters, this game just hooks you in the first 15 minutes or so. On the porting side, everything works like a dream and there are no issues with running the game either.

In my opinion this game is 100 times better than the first. Great story, a plot that makes you think, and well rounded characters. Each character has a noticable personaility and is portrayed perfectly through this story. My only complaint is that it ended so soon, if you are on the fence on if you wanted to buy this game in the fear that it wouldn't be as good, or it would be the same thing, buy it. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is very diffrent from the first game, yet keeps that familiar feeling to it, a perfect balance. I can not stress enough how much you need to buy this game, it has to be my all time favorite story game.

It is much better than the first one (not saying that was bad, not by a long shot) in every way. The characters are amazing, the story is a great expansion of what we learned in the first game, and the mysteries are fun to solve. The gameplay itself is almost the same as the first game, but with 2 more minigames. The first minigame is called logic dive, and you go on a mind snowboard (yes it's weird) and go down the right logic paths. The second one, rebuttal showdown, is where you slice other people's statements as fast as you can and is very similar to normal rebuttals. Overall, this game is a must buy if you are a fan of the series, but you definitely have to have played the first game already.

Without giving away too much, the entire game is full of murder mysterys and court segments where you must discover who the killer was. Mixed in between all of this is a lot of visual novel content, running around and what feels like the Persona 4 social link system that I love so much. You have free time where you can befriend whatever characters you want and form bonds with them. The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are amazing, the voice acting is amazing, and I love everything about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/50calbr/recommended/413420/","50calbr","Riki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/50calbr/","177 products in account","Very good game, played the Vita version as well, however the PC port is a big step back from the first. The plot and story is alot more twisted than the first which I love alot, and the players of this killing game are just as memorable, almost better than the first group. I really do love this game, however, the controls in this one when using keyboard is ultimately confusing, mapping is all wrong and the release was plauged with screen tearing, frame rate issues.\n\nThe first game was flawless and the control scheme was perfect, everything was perfect that made the game flow well. For example in this version, during the Trials, selecting the final blow, it explains that WASD is chosen to make the correct words, however on inspection, it was mapped to other keys, ZXCV. I would have to change the mapping in settings and another few annoyances as well. Also during the game, even though I chose to have "keyboard and mouse" buttons to show up on tutorials, it would show the control buttons instead, which was very confusing.\n\nThe next main thing was the exploration of the Hotel grounds and walking from place to place. which was very akward to do as well. When walking left and right during the island exploration, in addition to pressing the buttons, I had to wiggle the mouse to move as well, or I would just use Q or E to skip to the next spot (which made it easier). When navigating the hotel grounds it was the same way, because in the first game the navigation was in 3d, in ways it was simlar, but I had to wiggle the mouse to even move. Dashing worked, but I still had to wiggle the mouse.\n\nOther from that, the story is too good to turn down just like the first one, so I have to recommend this 100%, even though there are a few minor/major issue depending on the issue to someone else, this game is perfect in all ways. I recommend using a controller with this game, ultimately because it feels better to play, and it is not the Vita port, it lacks the touch screen.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\n\n-- Briliant storytelling.\n-- Great soundtrack, something that you want to listen to again and again.\n-- Fun trial based combat, you have to think and gather information, piece it all together in a rushed situation.\n-- UI is great, improvment to the first PC port.\n-- Characters are awesome, even harder to read than the first game.\n\nCons:\n\n-- Alot of black bars in "window mode", a sense of poor screen optimization.\n-- Contol scheme for keyboard is wrong, even when explained in the tutorials.\n-- Navigation in some scenes were subpar, hard to move without wiggling mouse.\n-- Screen tearing (Had to tweak v-sync in settings) - very minor\n-- Audio queues are sometimes slow, making it hard to perform some of the mini-games during trial.","April 19","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot and story is alot more twisted than the first which I love alot, and the players of this killing game are just as memorable, almost better than the first group. I really do love this game, however, the controls in this one when using keyboard is ultimately confusing, mapping is all wrong and the release was plauged with screen tearing, frame rate issues.\n\nThe first game was flawless and the control scheme was perfect, everything was perfect that made the game flow well. For example in this version, during the Trials, selecting the final blow, it explains that WASD is chosen to make the correct words, however on inspection, it was mapped to other keys, ZXCV. I would have to change the mapping in settings and another few annoyances as well. Also during the game, even though I chose to have "keyboard and mouse" buttons to show up on tutorials, it would show the control buttons instead, which was very confusing.\n\nThe next main thing was the exploration of the Hotel grounds and walking from place to place. which was very akward to do as well. When walking left and right during the island exploration, in addition to pressing the buttons, I had to wiggle the mouse to move as well, or I would just use Q or E to skip to the next spot (which made it easier). When navigating the hotel grounds it was the same way, because in the first game the navigation was in 3d, in ways it was simlar, but I had to wiggle the mouse to even move. Dashing worked, but I still had to wiggle the mouse.\n\nOther from that, the story is too good to turn down just like the first one, so I have to recommend this 100%, even though there are a few minor/major issue depending on the issue to someone else, this game is perfect in all ways. I recommend using a controller with this game, ultimately because it feels better to play, and it is not the Vita port, it lacks the touch screen.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\n\n-- Briliant storytelling.\n-- Great soundtrack, something that you want to listen to again and again.\n-- Fun trial based combat, you have to think and gather information, piece it all together in a rushed situation.\n-- UI is great, improvment to the first PC port.\n-- Characters are awesome, even harder to read than the first game.\n\nCons:\n\n-- Alot of black bars in "window mode", a sense of poor screen optimization.\n-- Contol scheme for keyboard is wrong, even when explained in the tutorials.\n-- Navigation in some scenes were subpar, hard to move without wiggling mouse.\n-- Screen tearing (Had to tweak v-sync in settings) - very minor\n-- Audio queues are sometimes slow, making it hard to perform some of the mini-games during trial.","April 19","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The second game is much much better than the first, storywise. I've already read the contents of this game online but have always wanted to play it. If you haven't played danganronpa 1, do your best to avoid all spoilers if you plan to get into the series!\n\nThe game feels very inspired by Phoenix Wright. Lots of comedic moments, and a handful of despair inducing ones. The gratuitous amount of "peptol bismol" blood, language, and setting give it a somewhat more mature feeling intended for an older young-adult audience.\n\nYou've got a murder happening, an investigation, and then a class trial. In the class trial, characters will discuss ideas like the murder weapon, setting, how it was done, etc. When a contradiction occurs, you fire evidence in the form of "truth bullets" and break them down in order to progress/unravel the story. One prominent feature added is the ability to consent, or agree with someone. Instead of firing truth bullets to break a contradiction, you can actually support someone's idea.\n\nIt's all very linear, keep that in mind. But it's set up very well that the entire trial feels tense and revelations feel rewarding. Game difficulty isn't terribly hard. There are three difficulties in game but they don't really impact the gameplay. Just like in Phoenix Wright, if you run out of "health", you start over from a checkpoint and resume the trial.\n\nPros:\nVisually great\nGood story\nCharacter cast is significantly better IMO, more relatable than DR1\nOST is prettttttty good.\nOption of either English or Japanese audio\n\nCons?:\n\n1. Some characters have like a pink-magenta outline that wasn't cropped out correctly. It's especially noticeable when you zoom in on them during class trials. Not a big deal as it does not affect gameplay, but it looks odd.\n\n2. Game may lag during cutscenes. Even though it's a visual novel, a high end computer may experience stuttering during cutscenes due to v-sync and antialiasing, both of which are adjustable before the game is booted up.  Again, not a big deal since it can be fixed with relatively no hassle.\n\nPS: Chiaki best girl\nPPS: Acquired Truth Bullet: Embarassing Pose","April 19","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even on Intel HD5500 graphics (which, admittedly, are capable enough for MGSV and Tales of Zestiria at 720p/30fps on Windows) work without major hiccups at 1080p.\n\nFrom a plot and gameplay standpoint, Danganronpa 2 is also an improvement, perhaps because it has such a solid base with the first game. The twists are satisfying even when the major ones are telegraphed practically from the start, and while it may not be enough to satisfy super-sleuths, many of the murder scenes have more depth than the first game's. If you weren't a fan of the rhythm-game stylings of the trials, you probably won't enjoy this a whole lot better, although some of the minigames have been improved upon.\n\nThe game's not flawless - by design or otherwise, Monomi is still one of the most annoying characters of the last half-decade, and the handbook's virtual pet system serves only as an annoyance - a necessary one to get 100% completion, unfortunately. Some of the new students are certainly less endearing or memorable than those of the first game, but there's never going to be a writer who nails every new character they create.\n\nOverall it's certainly a good game and an improvement on the original in many ways, and if you're on the fence I'd recommend buying just to show support for Spike Chunsoft (and the larger Japanese gaming industry) bringing their games to an accessible platform overseas.","April 19","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be careful if you want to go into this game completely blind.>\nINTRO:\nDanganronpa 2:Goodbye Despair is the first game but majorly improved and polished. I'm sure that much is obvious since it's a sequel. The game is about some highschool students attending this amazing school called Hope's Peak Academy. Only the best of the best can attend it and those who do go are called "Ultimates". 2 is about these Ultimates going on a trip to a lovely island called Jabberwock Island. But... then some bad stuff happens with some talking teddy bears.\n\nThe game features a great soundtrack and the visuals are quite nice too. It's practically a visual novel but with a lot of action in the way of "Class Trials". If you're a big anime fan then this game is also for you. It features jokes and cliches from manga/anime.\n\nMUSIC: The soundtrack is really nice. It can make you feel tense, happy, excited, pumped and a bunch of other positive/negative emotions. I really enjoy the fact the music can instill the right emotions at the right times. Though... some of the tracks are memorable some just get left in the dust. The tracks are usually displayed at the top right with the name.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe characters are all unique so you can't confuse them with each holding an ultimate talent and filling in some type of trope. Not all of them are likeable in my opinion but I didn't mind going through there conversations and jokes. There's a lot of humour in this game and no matter your sense of humour, you'll probably get a chuckle out of it at some point. Oh yeah, there's a mechanic called "Free Time". When the story isn't advancing you can spend time with the people on the island. This stregthens your bonds and results in some funny/pleasant/weird/deep conversations. You can also gift them a present to make the bond even stronger. You gain hope shards from doing this and then you can use those to buy skills. You gain a small little thing added to the person you interacted with's report card. Each person can have there report card filled in 6 times. After this interacting with them doesn't do much. If you're a completionist you can try to max everyone's report card. Thought this will take beating the game and doing Island mode OR doing multiple playthroughs of the regular game.\n\nCRAP I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO CATEGORIZE:\nDanganronpa 2 revolves around hope and despair. You can feel these two emotions through out with other emotions mixed in too. I have yet to get bored of a mechanic BUT I can see some which may annoy/get boring. You can level up with a cap of 99. You gain xp by walking around, examining and talking to people. Walking around can be insanely slow so there's a sprint button but while sprinting you take less steps and therefore get less exp. There's a weird pet mechanic which is like a Tomogatchi and as you walk it grows. You can give it presents and it will gain hope or you can leave it and it'll gain despair. If it reaches max despair it dies. It has a little pop-up in the bottom left when you should really check-up on your pet. Island mode is unlocked after beating the game and is a little sim which allows you to date all the characters. It'll take at least.. 4 playthroughs to get every characters ending. Though I haven't beaten the game I have read about how Island mode exists and I'm guessing it's 2's version of School mode. It's probably improved. Not sure.\n\n\ntl;dr:\nBuy this game, it's great. :^)","April 19","true","57.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bullet-Time Battles, and the Closing Argument have been partially to totally reworked from the original and I would say it is a bit disorienting so far to see all of the changes (but that may be because I'm playing on the hardest difficulty) but there is nothing I found to be so different that I didn't understand what was going on.\n\nHangman's Gambit and BTB (now called Panic Talk Attack, or PTA) are both significantly harder and are more proper challenges than the jokes they were in DR1.\n\ntl;dr Play DR1 first.

The game starts some time after the events in D:THH. However, despite being a sequel, there's really not much difference or improvements in terms of gameplay in D2:GD. This might be good for some but personally I think this is a really lazy attempt at making a sequel. This doesn't mean the game's bad, though. It's just a bit too similar for me to actually call it a sequel. Like in the previous game, D2:GD main attraction is the visual novel aspect, the murder mystery and of course, the varied and colourful cast of characters.\n\nLike I said before, there's very little improvements in terms of gameplay. It still played the same as in D:THH. There are a few mini-games added in the class trial but I find them to be tedious to go through. The (Improved) Hangman's Gambit in particular is one of my least favourite mini-game, followed by Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive.\n\nAbout 75% of the game consist of clicking and reading through massive amount of text, a standard aspect of a visual novel game. If you're not into that kind of gameplay, please don't pick this game up. While you can't actually date any of the girls, it's highly recommended to spend some time with them and give them gifts to strengthen your bond with them. Not only they give out special ability to use in the Class Trial after fully bonding with them, you also get some back story and other hidden personality they don't normally show. Just don't get too attached, as you never know when they might die.\n\nThe murder mysteries, unfortunately, is on the same level like in D:THH. It's a bit too easy to deduce. Compared to the Ace Attorney series, the mysteries in D2:GD is clearly the inferior. Also like in D:THH, the Class Trial is also either too straightforward or too vague. Not having the ability to read the summary of your Truth Bullets without opening up the menu is annoying as hell.\n\nWhile the new characters are interesting in their own right, those who played D:THH will find most of these characters a bit too similar to the characters from D:THH. Despite this, player will still find a favourite character to get attach with (though mine died early on). Also a really, REALLY, annoying one too (f**king hate that guy).\n\nAnother thing before purchasing this game. This game will make you feel depressed at key moments. One is particularly heart wrenching. So if you're the type that gets upset quickly, it's best not to finish playing this game in one sitting.\n\nRECOMMENDED: For those who played D:THH and enjoyed it.\nNOT RECOMMENDED: For those who didn't play D:THH","May 6","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In order to solve each case, you must pay large amount of attention to every detail, and that gives the game so much potential without it becoming boring. While playing, I felt as though the story was incredibly rich and suspenseful and it was progressed so perfectly so that no amount of knowledge about the first game mattered. In conclusion, the story is far from a rehash of the first game, the music is sub-par, the artwork/graphics are great in my opinion, the characters are somewhat complex, and the gameplay is immersive.\n\ncons- However, the PC porting was fairly lazy at some parts, of which there was barely any way to determine a difference from the PS Vita version (Such as the controls not explained, or the cropping being done poorly)","April 19","true","58.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitaldeity/recommended/413420/","digitaldeity","Deity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitaldeity/","1570 products in account","Sixteen highschool students, trapped in a tropical paradise, are forced to kill each other. The only way to make it off the island is to murder a fellow classmate and not get caught by the remaining students. If they manage to deduce the killer, the murderer is executed. If they fail to deduce the killer, they are executed. This is Danganronpa 2.\n\nFirst of all I recommend you play Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc if you haven't. While this sequel doesn't require you to have played the first game to understand the story, certain characters, events, and the backdrop for the story are more thoroughly explained in Danganronpa 1.\n\nDanganronpa 2 puts you in the shoes of Hajime Hinata, an extraordinary highschool student known as an "Ultimate". Ultimates are simply put, the best possible high school student in a specific field. "Ultimate" baseball player, "Ultimate" martial artist, etc. However, Hajime is the Ultimate cliché has amnesia, and can't actually remember his Ultimate ability. Hajime and 15 other "Ultimates" are taken on a field trip to a peaceful and relaxing island with a giant bomb at the center of it planted by a stuffed bear and the only way to get off the island before it explodes is to get away with murder. Wait. What?\n\nDanganronpa 2 can be best described as absurd yet logical. Taking itself just the right amount of seriously, it combines the two concepts into one majestic game that is just as likely to confuse you with its quirks as it is to confuse you with its complex logic problems. Once the inevitable murder of one of your classmates happens, the game splits into two parts: the murder investigation, and the class trial. During the investigation, you're left to explore the island in 2D adventure game style, finding evidence and speaking with witnesses. After an arbitrary amount of time passes that the game dictates, the class trial starts. Found in the form of you deducing the murderer behind your classmates death, the puzzles are outrageously unique. Contrary to the first Danganronpa, murders are less predictable. The events are complex, and much more detailed than in the first game, and while they are off the wall and require metaphorical backflips to deduce, the answers are always logical.\n\nOn the other hand, the trial part of the game is more annoying than logical. Playing out like Phoenix Wright, you present your evidence that you collected after the murder happened, and present your theories. Unfortunately, much like Phoenix Wright, you don't actually get punished for guessing incorrectly. Selecting the wrong answer will cause the game to immediately point out that it's incorrect, and if you get too many incorrect, you have to start the entire trial over again. In addition, your many other classmates in the trial don't actually solve anything. Their only reason for existence is to challenge your deductions, and to make you play worthless minigames that don't actually add anything to the story, but are rather put in place to ensure that the player is truly understanding the storyline. Unfortunately many of these minigames require exact input of the answer that the game wants you to input. You could have a thorough understanding of the murder and events, and yet fail due to phrasing or the exact word isn't what the game was looking for. Multiple trials take place during the game.\n\nIn addition to the murders, gameplay also involves a simple social simulator. You can become friends with the other students, giving them their preferred gifts and them giving you information about themselves in return. It's all rather shallow, but nothing that detracts from the overall story.\n\nThe storyline is fantastic. It all comes together at the end in the most magnificent way possible, and compared to the complete predictability of the first game, is entirely unpredictable until the very end. The characters are all interesting, the dialogue is genius in the most absurd way possible, the voice acting is top notch, the puzzles are superb, the mystery is complex, the soundtrack is decent, and the graphics are unique. Much like a storybook, your environments seem to be made of paper, and "pop up" into existence, and the beautiful island can be fully explored without all the bloodstains after you complete the main storyline and unlock "Island Mode", an alternate reality where the murders never take place and you spend your days levelling up your students and performing activities. Not the deepest of game modes, but it's a nice addition for those concerned with longevity.\n\nThe only true downside are the minigames. Longer and more annoying than in Danganronpa 1, but just as finicky and arbitrary, these only serve to frustrate. However, the storyline more than makes up for it. If you like complex puzzles, unpredictable yet intelligent storylines, absurd humor, or you simply want to play something unique, unlike any game you've played before, then give Danganronpa 2 a try. I wholeheartedly recommend it.","April 18","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I forgot.\n\nMikan Tsumiki:\nShe is a hot nurse that likes Hajime. She's got a huge ♥♥♥. She helps people like Nagito feel better. She always trips over and lands in some weird ♥♥♥ position. She kills my waifu.\n\nNekomaru Nidai:\nSome big muscle guy that gives a massage to Akane.\n\nGundham Tanaka:\nThe ultimate level of darkness. The most vicious man from the depths of Hell. Watch as his four dark devas of destruction\ncast a horrible curse on you. He likes to play with hamsters.\n\nNagito Komaeda:\nHe likes hope. A lot. He wants to kill himself for hope. He ends up playing Russian Roulette with 5 bullets in the cylinder. And he wins. Damn son.\n\nChiaki Nanami:\nNobody wanted her to die. We all loved her. But then she got killed. She wasn't even real. She had the longest skirt, I think. I hated her stupid references, but you know what? Behind those dumbass forced references, there's a kawaii waifu that died.\n\nHajime Hinata:\nHe wears a tie. Likes Nagito's ♥♥♥. LIkes Chiaki's boobs. Can't decide on them. Falls into despair when they both die.\n\nAkane Owari:\nBig boobs. Basically a copy of Aoi from the first game. She's boring.\n\nFuyuhiko Kuzuryu:\nYakuza guy that has an eyepatch. He swears a lot. He's the only survivor I cared about. And it wasn't much.\n\nKazuichi Soda:\nIt's Souda in Japanese, so why the hell is it Soda here? Can we not take time out of our busy day to lengthen a simple vowel? He's ♥♥♥♥. He was okay in chapters 1, 2, and 3. But he became more ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSonia Nevermind:\nShe's a princess. Fluent in 30 languages. No one cares about her. Except Kazuichi.\n\nUsami/Monomi:\nShe is pretty annoying. She's a bunny. So yeah.\n\nAlso old characters\n\nMakoto Naegi:\nNot as good as Hajime.\n\nKyoko Kirigiri:\nTemporarily takes place of my waifu in chapter 6, until Chiaki comes back, and then she continues to be my waifu.\n\nByakuya Togami:\nThis one's real. He's rich.\n\nBasically, the survivors in this game suck. The bad ones survive. The last trial is boring and uninteresting without the good characters from the first game. That's the only reason the trial was decent.\n\nBuy this game though. It's pretty good.","April 26","true","61.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/j_ariyadi/recommended/413420/","j_ariyadi","ariyadi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/j_ariyadi/","48 products in account","Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (DR2) menjadi sekuel game Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (DR1) di mana sama seperti prekuelnya, DR2 bercerita tentang 16 siswa yang dipaksa untuk saling membunuh oleh robot beruang misterius yang dikendalikan oleh mastermind. Namun berbeda dengan DR1 yang memakai sekolah sebagai setting tempatnya, kali ini DR2 menjadikan sebuah kepulauan beriklim tropis sebagai lokasinya. Lebih gila, lebih konyol & lebih banyak fanservice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).\n\nMeskipun bertindak sebagai sekuel, namun kita tidak akan mendapatkan lanjutan kisah DR1 secara langsung di awal game, kita justru dihadapkan dengan cerita hampir sama dengan awal cerita DR1 dengan karakter yang berbeda. Membuatnya jadi makin penasaran untuk dimainkan.\n\nCerita (10/10)Jangan mencari info tentang satupun karakter game ini di situs seperti wikia sebelum menamatkan ceritanya. Setiap karakter mempunyai spoiler berat bahkan pada biodata mereka.\n\nDR2 jadi game dengan cerita terbaik yang pernah saya mainkan. Tidak se-horror DR1 (mungkin karena terbiasa dengan death surprise di DR1) namun DR2 memberikan setidaknya 3 plot twist yang sangat gila. Menggambarkan sebuah despair yang yang harus dijalani, namun mampu memberikan ending yang luar biasa tentang kepercayaan kepada masa depan kita.\n\nGameplay (8/10)Serius, DR2 jauh lebih susah daripada DR1, bahkan pada level gentle (easy) sekalipun. Berikut ini pengembangan class trial dibandingkan dengan DR1 :\n\nPada nonstop debate, bila pada level gentle DR1 kita maksimal diberi 3 peluru (truth bullet) untuk 3-4 weak argument, maka pada DR2 kita diberi 3-5 peluru dan weak argument yang ada memposisikan kita untuk setuju (agree) atau menolak (refute).\n\nImproved hangman gambit, berbeda dengan DR1 yang cukup meminta kita untuk menembak huruf yang sesuai, kita sekarang diminta memasangkan 2 huruf yang sama, yang tengah berjalan horizontal dan vertikal. Bila 2 berbeda bertemu maka keduanya akan meledak & membuat damage untuk kita. Bila 2 huruf sama bertemu maka huruf akan bergabung dan berhenti bergerak, kita bisa menghilangkannya atau memasukkan huruf itu dalam kalimat jawaban. Bila huruf tidak sesuai dengan jawaban maka akan menjadi damage untuk kita. Ini adalah bagian tersulit di game ini bagi saya. T_T\n\nRebuttal Showdown, dimana kita berdebat 1 lawan 1 dengan seseorang. Kita diminta memotong semua kalimat yang dia katakan dan memotong weak argument dengan truth blade yang berasal dari truth bullet. Sama seperti nonstop debate, kita harus menyesuaikan weak argument dengan truth blade yang disediakan, ini berarti kita harus membaca kalimatnya terlebih dahulu sebelum memotongnya. What a pain!\n\nLogic dive, bermain ski sambil menggunakan logika berpikir kita, tidak terlalu susah.\n\nPanic talk action hampir sama seperti bullet time battle.\n\nClosing argument, berbeda dengan DR1, kita tidak langsung diberi semua potongan adegan, namun cuma muncul 4 potongan dan 4 potongan berikutnya muncul setelah 4 potongan pertama selesai, selain itu setiap salah menempelkan potongan berati damage untuk kita. OMG!\n\nJadi jangan malu kalo retry berkali2, class trial-nya memang susah di level gentle sekalipun.","May 10","true","72.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you didn't play Danganronpa 1, stop whatever you are doing and go play that instead as this is a direct sequel to it. If you have played Danganronpa 1 then you are merely wondering if you should buy the sequel. The short answer is yes.\n\nSome of things I liked about Danganronpa 2:\n+ One Class Trial which I really liked and really hit the despair. Although all of the Class Trials were enjoyable.\n+ An interesting climax and reveal to the game. Although it does get a little too Meta.\n+ The additional option of agree statements in the Class Trials was a good addition.\n+ The Rebuttal Showdowns were pretty cool as well. Although there was one showdown I had trouble with due to not realizing I can do more damage with a diagonal strike.\n+ How even some of the more “Silly” truth bullets end up playing a pivotal role in the trial's outcome.\n\nI only have a few complaints about Danganronpa 2. Notably the following:\n- I feel like Monokuma goes a bit too far with some of his motive delivery this time as some of motives interfere with Free Will more. But I guess that is part of his master plan this time around.\n- Some of the characters are way over the top (I'm looking at you Supreme Warlock Overlord Gundham with his Four Dark Devas [read: hamsters] of Destruction!), but I suppose that is to be expected from this series.\n- While the Logic Drive addition has an interesting series of questions, I am more meh on the entire mechanic. Also feel like there were too many of these and they were too long.\n- The “Escape Room” puzzle was annoying because the puzzle mechanics were not obvious, although the game would let you skip it.\n- The game is WAY more Fan Servicey than the previous one was.\n\nAnd the following fake complaints:\n- 5 hours out of the 33 it took to beat this game resulted in lost sleep. Thats like nearly 20%  :(\n- This game is not Sakuras' Revenge :D\n\nAll I can say is despite these few complaints I really enjoyed this game. I can't wait for Danganronpa 3!","May 30","true","34.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a step in the wrong direction.\n\nFirst, it's a big shift in tone from the last game. There are far more jokes, almost feeling slapstick at times. The fan-service has gone far beyond the innuendo and subtext of the first game. The characters are more silly and less realistic, with a few being totally out of place.\n\nThere are some good points. Monokuma is still adorably evil and the new bear is a nice addition. There is a new batch of minigames. They have added a few new features I woun't spoil and improved on the slots/store.\n\nWith the goofy and upbeat tone, I'm having a hard time rooting for the students like I did before. It feels like they made a deliberate change to a new style of game. I'm not done, so maybe there are big mixups or payoffs, but so far it's lost the magic. It feels almost like a comedy spin-off of a dramatic TV show.\n\nAll toogeather, I'm really missing the despair of the origional. It feels like the biggest strength of the first game was the writing and characters, but now the focus is on the other parts.","May 3","false","9.9"," 7 of 58 people (12%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","12","7","58","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Originalyeti82/recommended/413420/","Originalyeti82","Originalyeti82","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Originalyeti82/","172 products in account","*glances at the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.*\nOkay, so this will be a tough one for me to write.\n\nNo. I do not like this game. I'd give this game around a 5/10 (if we were doing numbers). It functions, quite well actually. But it's aggravatingly so much weaker than its predecessor. If you'll permit me, I'd like to explain why.\n\nTo PrefaceI've gone through about 35 hours of the first game. I thought it was a great game, despite its flaws. I disliked the ending and it ultimately left me at a low point. but I preordered this one midway through the first game and figured "what the hell. I'll give this a fair shot." and try it out.I'll be mostly trying to use comparisons from Trigger Happy Havoc, as that's really the best point to bounce off of. I've gone through the prologue and all of chapter one, ensuring I didn't miss anything in conversations.\n\nA Summary for Those GlancingPros\nThe Main Character is a MASSIVE improvement from the old one.\nMore likable characters in this game than the first.\nSome new gameplay elements are refreshing.\nGameplay encourages exploration but doesn't make it required.\nCons\nStupidity is rampant compared to the first game.\nNearly every problematic gameplay element is made worse.\nTutorials are pitiful and awkward, and the game seems aware of this for some reason.\nThe unlikable characters are insufferable.\nJumps in logic and lack of understanding pad the game's length.\nGameplay                 For those of you looking at the meat of this, thank you!  To summarize for those who have never played these kinds of games before: You will play what seems like a dating sim for a good potion of the game. you get to know these students, develop a rapport, and generally A student will be murdered and you have to investigate a crime scene. collect enough evidence and a trial starts. This is where the game picks up. You'll go through rapid discussions about the case, and find contradictions that you shoot with 'truth bullets'. It's exciting, and a lot of it is left generally intact from the first game.  Now, for the sake of fairness. There are new ideas here I absolutely love. The game has this new feature where, during trials, students will contradict you, and you have to go toe to toe with them, literally cutting through their statements with (sigh) "truth swords" until you guide them to the statement you can contradict. It's a refreshing take on the whole idea and adds a dynamic that makes characters more present and gives that 'debate' feel to the whole experience. Not only that, but there are moments where you can consent with another student. Agreeing with their statement in an easy to understand mechanic. The sequel even added to the challenge of the game by always having six bullets available to use regardless of difficulty (something I wanted to see more of in the first game). These are great additions that add more complexity to the entire game.\nUnfortunately, every other gameplay element in the debates has been made worse. Spike acknowledges these problem areas during the tutorials and promises you they've fixed them. I assure, all they've done is taken weak, but ignore-able issues and made them intolerable. I'll explain.\nHangman's Gambit\nHangman's Gambit in the first game was a way of filling in a word (usually a singular, partially completed word) by shooting letters flying at the player. It was.... an admirable attempt, but nothing special. Now, the Hangman's Gambit has you floundering as letters attempt to crash into each other at a snails pace, letting you guess a larger, easier to mess up, completely blank phrase. The letters all fly at different speeds, which often leads to them colliding before they even reach the screen. you then shoot these letters to combine them for some reason, and then/ add them to the phrase. If you're terrible at this, you'll run into a game over without even guessing wrong. If you're good at this, you'll spend way too much time waiting for letters to populate the screen. Neither scenario is appealing.\n\nClosing Argument\nHere, you piece together the entire crime manga style. Filling in missing segments of the story with images you have in your collection. in the first game, It was... admittedly awkward. Often times so many images looked similar, and had no descriptors, so it was hard to piece together what you were trying to do unless you were extremely careful. In this game, the problem is addressed, only to replaced by an entirely different issue. While they take the time to describe what each of the images represent, the phrases are extremely vague. and they only give you five at a time. forcing you to piece together the scene based on what little selection they gave you. I found myself struggling to appease the game's logic in whatever order this was asking for, something I almost never had to do in the first game. And if the player is  struggling to find the answer in a game that revolves around a clear and sensible logic, you are not accomplishing what you set out to do.  Imagine if Monkey Island or Sam and Max had a health bar that drained every time you tried to rub two unrelated objects together. That's an accurate summation of what this mode has become.\n\nStory                    I'm going to say a phrase here that defines a great deal of games, so bear with me: Stupidity = Plot Convenience. What I mean by this is that characters will go out of their way to do something ridiculous or nonsensical for the sake of adding drama, or making a story work.. A good mystery has all the pieces presented to you and still it is a challenge on how to piece it all together. If you leave out critical pieces of evidence for the sake of adding dramatic tension, it weakens the mystery. There's a lot of trials in both games where a character says ."I found this thing that wasn't important." halfway through the trial that, in fact, is utterly vital. It doesn't help that character motivations are all the more ludicrious this time around. I'm honestly convinced they have no idea what hope and despair is, because they throw it around like a child discovering a curse word. Possibly the most inexcusable thing is how unlikable several characters are. The first game had plenty of them (oh my god, byakuya) but some of these people are somehow worse. What is aggravating most of all is that if you remove a great deal of the padding, There's not a great deal of story to be had.\n\nConclusion I think what angers me the most about this game is how the game is aware of how terrible some of its writing and gameplay is. It often makes jokes like. "haha, aren't amnesia plots stupid?" and then just keeps using it! If you point out a trope and just continue unashamedly, it's just a way of saying. "I could have done better." So why didn't you?\n\nIf a game doesn't care enough to write a better story in a story based game, you could honestly go with better. I really wanted to like this. If you can stomach a weak story, go for it. If not, this game isn't really worth the aggravation.","April 27","false","9.8"," 15 of 92 people (16%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","16","15","92","2","10"

One minigame is a snowboarding "Logic Dive" which feels completely shoehorned in as it doesn't fit any aspect of the game and seems to have been added simply because they thought it was kinda cool.  They've added an "Improved" Hangmans Gambit which requires you to guess the answer to a question given no hints on the specific word they want even if you know the answer already.  This is made worse by the fact that as you are trying to determine what the exact word they are looking for is there are multiple letters filling the screen that will crash into each other if you do not actively micromanage them.  Waiting for the correct letter to appear can take 15 seconds or more EACH, multiply that by a 20+ letter answer and you've gone from an interesting back and forth between the characters to managing slowly moving letters for 5+ minutes.   These two games are particularly bad, but the others still add very little to the game.  I got to one case where I was presented with three of these hangmans gambits almost back to back, and decided the story wasn't interesting enough to be worth the frutration.","April 27","false","30.9"," 8 of 75 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","8","75","2","5"

My words can not convey the feelings I have for this despair.\n\nAll the characters are all well written in personality, and also well designed in apperarance. The more you get to know them, the more depth they have, and that is one good aspect of this game, to befriend these ultimates! They all contain deep thought about there talents, also how they connect it to their lives.\nThe art and the style is enchanting! I love it, it feels perfect in my eyes. The shadding, colouring.. mezmerizing ..\n\nStory goes in a good pace, and was also mindblowing. It was great!!! One thing is predictable .. and that is which of them that survive till the end. But that is a minor thing compared to the whole game!\n\nBut the best part was how the music took part in the dialogues! It was perfectly switching mood as an event take on diffrerent changes. From happy to sad, from serious to funny. Also all of the soundtracks are great! It feelt so nice to listen them in any situation,  especially in class trails. It really does add a lot of excitment with change of music track at the right places, its awesome to follow, as it play with ones emotions. The feeling is incredible! The action!\nThe class trail is damn interesting as you puzzle up the whole scene and face the truth. Although it can be difficult to solve, but its very well done! To see evidence, to find the culprit, it feels satisfying to find the outcome of the trail!\n(And then get sad when they die .. )\n\nThe japanese voiceacting is really good!\nThe text is well written! Never got tired of reading it.\nBut one thing that is damn annoying  .. is that in the text, they use their given names ... but they actually say their family name in the voice-acting! Why does the english text need to change that? D: Oh well.\n\nI really recommend this game! The art, the music, the story, the characters.

There are few changes to some of the existing class trial battles, which for the most part made it harder (or arguably more annoying). The mini-game that used to be like DDR felt like it was off-sync so that one might just be a port problem.\n\nYou know that feeling of regret when you wished you got to know a character more before they died? GET USED TO IT.\nSoundtrack was almost identical to the original, and the story was enjoyable as well.\n\nBonus features include Island Mode, which is pretty much the same as the School Mode in the original where you can catch up with your classmates without having to worry about them dying. There's also a short novel, which is an alternate telling of the original Danganronpa. A short, but interesting read nonetheless.","May 12","true","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is worth full price. I got it thinking that it would be more of the Danganronpa theme we had in the first game, but it turns out that this game went above and beyond. Personally, I loved all the minigames, but I know that there are a lot of people who don't like them. The class trial is where the game really shines. The story allows for some great trials and will pull you though some big twists with great characters.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not all good. There are some issues with the game. There will be some audio slowdowns if your audio isn't setup right outside the game. Also, there are a few issues with the text like saying the wrong button for something, typos and text being too large for the text box. The text feels sloppier compared to DR1.\n\nIf you're going to get this, you gotta play DR1 first.\n\nTL;DR\nYou will like characters, they will die and you will feel despair...............

It's going to feel like a chore, but only if you compare it to the first game.\n\nMy advice is to avoid comparing anything.

In different ways.\n\nWhat is good about Danganronpa 2: Everything good about Danganronpa one and it is a lot darker and emotional (I teared up and some points).\n\nWhat is bad about Danganronpa 2: The gameplay is basically the same as Danganronpa (as in awful), since it's a bit longer, the pacing suffers and some bits are really boring and most inportantly, most of the characters aren't as good.

I beat the game on the hardest difficulty within 26-30 hours, with some bonus time sprinkled in.\n+ Character development, music, and art are still fantastic. They also put a lot more effort into this title, with cutscenes and environments having a bit more "oomph" to them.\n+ The story is very interesting despite being seemingly "obvious" from the beginning. A lot of twists and turns that, just like the last game, have you on the edge of your seat. It also resolves a LOT of the issues the first game left unfinished, and without a cliffhanger!\n\nCons:\n- PTA is... confusing. Not only does the timing feel off, they changed the system to where you have to hold it and let go according to the beat, which I admittedly must have missed completely in the explanation. What's funny about this is there is no system to correct this misunderstanding: you can freely spam the buttons without consequence, so that's what I ended up doing. A punishment system (especially on the hardest difficulty) to correct this mistake would have helped teach the mechanic.\n- The usage of a certain element as one of the motives felt like a cop-out. Some of the motives in this game in particular were pretty weak compared to the first one.\n- Even on hard mode, the experience was pretty easy to overcome, despite some ridiculous minigame sections.\n\nOverall:\nDanganronpa 2 is a solid follow-up to the first game.

So when I saw that the second game was released for pc, I was stoked. But I thought $30.00 was a lot of money for a visual novel port. But I have never been so wrong in my life. Most story driven games don't take much time to complete, the longest I've played was about 12 hours, so I tought I would probably get about 12 hours of gameplay. But after 2 days of playing non-stop, I finished it. It took 40 hours to beat the main storyline. 40 HOURS. And there's even more stuff to do afterwards. This game is hands down a masterpiece. I would talk more in depth, but that would ruin the story. Just remember, if you think you know what's going on, you don't.

This was a story that needed to be told. I enjoyed figuring out the murders and thought each character was unique and different. I always hate endings, but this one wasn't too bad. There's still tons left in the lore to explore but hopefully the upcoming anime will help! I seriously recommend this game, your life needs it and I've sold my soul to this fandom. I cannot being to tell you how much and how long I was invested  in this game. Feels Central. But seriously play the first game or most of this won't make sense\n\n10/10 You'll hear the words, "Hope, Despair, and Future" enough to last you 11037 life times\n\nNagito X Hajime For Life\n\nTHE MEAT ON BONE\nBONE ON THE MEAT\nMEAT ON THE BONE\nTHE BONE ON MEAT","June 5","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After finishing the first game, I bought #2 immediately because it was THAT good, and it certainly did live up to the hype. For the prologue I was worried that the characters weren't as good or as lovable as the first games, which thankfully wasn't the case. I can't say I care for the english dubs voices, but who cares since I usually play japanese games in the native language anyways, where the voices are near perfect to the characters (except for hajime, what happened there?). Only thing that was inferior to the first game was the minigame Panic Talk Attack, which is the first games guitar hero-esque minigame, since the display for the button to hit was very awkward and I felt like it was offbeat from the song too so I usually just abused concentration mode.\n\ntl;dr I love DR1 and DR2 as much as I love Steins;Gate, which is another fantastic visual novel. Danganronpa 2 is a true sequel by all means, enhancing the first games formula.\n\nIf you guys are reading reviews after finishing both games, there are 2 anime storylines wrapping up the "Hope's Peak Academy" story that'll no doubt be an exhilarating watch.","June 5","true","38.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
