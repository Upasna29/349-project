I mean if you're broke and looking for about an hour of gaming (maybe you're waiting for a ride or something, IDK), then give it a whirl. Run around, fight a bunch of dudes, and eventually a boss and The End. No plot (minuscule backstory), no English (so far), just running and attacking a total of three (apparently, this qualifies for the term 'loads of enemies') enemy types. Graphics are alright, performance is meh, but breast jiggle physics is present thus all is forgiven. Also, fun to watch her skirt majestically flip-up whenever she croaks regardless of Newton's laws. It accomplishes why I set out to play it: Waste some time messing around while waiting for a friend so I could go out.\n\nUPDATE: There is now English for interface items, but everything else is still in Chinese.","February 1","true","0.9"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","82","54","66","26","0"

Play this and you can do both.\n\nSo this game is more of a tech demo than an actual full title but what’s here is great and for free to boot, who can complain? The combat is simple but I can see it being much more complex and in depth with some work. The attack effects, lighting effects and bomb blasts are very pretty and really add to the visual splendour.\n\nThe world looks interesting, showing some good depth and I loved the details, there’s even an Easter egg in there as well. The main character’s designed really well; I loved her clothes even if they are somewhat impractical. Boob and butt physics are also a win in my book and this game has them in spades. The enemies are pretty cool too; the heavy bomb blasting grunts in huge golden armour are my favourite. There was even an epic and tense boss battle at the end to wrap things up nicely.\n\nAll in all a beautiful if flawed “game” that is well worth your time, and as mentioned it’s free as well. Several large problems though are that it’s currently only in Chinese (a problem they are patching I hear), its length is pretty short and it has a bunch of glitches. But as mentioned for a free demo that comes with an easy 100% achievement have a go and you won’t regret it.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","January 28","true","1.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","29","36","3","0"

I have no complaints on the actions either, since the controls were responsive and the combos were satisfying.\n\nThe only real problem is the lack of translations on the plot, even though the game only lasts twenty minutes, I would have appreciated it more if I knew what was going on. It is a shame this title wasn’t expanded to a full game because of resource constricts on the developer’s part, but I’ll look forward to any releases they make from now on.","April 4","true","1.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","2"

For example the beautiful weapon animation color.\n★Sound 7|10\nThe background sound change every time when you entering a new part of the ingame world. But the walk sound is a bit strange.\n★Story 2|10\nThe only one story part what i saw was in the description on the store game from this game.\n★Control 8|10\nThe game control and also the fighting system/control is one part of this game was i also really like. But was i hope in the future of this game is that the skills have more effectiveness.\n\nSo this was my short review for the game The Lost Mythologies. And i have one or two things to say before i end with this review.\n\nThis game was launch at 28.01.2016 and it is not a completet game or full game more like a demo at the moment.\nBut  what also the game developer said.\n\nAnd please don't hate the game it's just a demo without a english sub at the moment.\n\n(Richard Tang [developer] 23 Jan @ 6:09am)\n\nJust to clarify, this game is kind of a 15 to 30 minutes long single player demo. It's not a pay to win grinding game and it may be very buggy. Just like we said in the description, "this game's main focus is to show how much we're capable to do at a short period of time, but since we thought the result wasn't actually sellable, we decided to release this game for free. " This is a student project, in our current situation it is impossible to make this into a full game(money, man power, military service, etc... ). This game will stay as it is, but in the future when we finally have the resource we will make something new(hopefully a full game), but no timeline guarantees.\n\n\nSo i think this game or demo is worth to test it out, it just take 15 or 30 minutes i mean if your really good maybe it take less than 15 minutes ツ.\n\nI hope everyone who read this review have a nice Day ツ\nbest regards Sh4ne√","January 28","true","1.0"," 82 of 139 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","82","139","9","1"

Well you got it for free and if you dont like it you didnt lose anything but a couple of minutes in the first place.\n\nIs there another reason for thumbs up? Yes the game is fluent and it has some sweet graphics.\nThe environment so far is themed very very simple, few dark chambers, some Chinese styled roofs, mountains and trees, snow and a starlight sky. Very simple to plain enemies. Nice snow and lightning effects. So far the job is done. Read about some spawning bugs yet but I couldnt find any problems so far. Animations are cool but currently not too much in variation of course.\n\nSince its not a full game there is not much to review yet but if the developers give this out on Steam and ask me do you want more like this and would you pay for a game like this my answer will be yes.\n\nTry it out, you dont really need to understand Chinese to play it since there is not much of a story you will miss out on.\nIf you like an anime styled heroine swinging her sword at some terracotta soldier like enemies, there you go.\n\nIn my opinion there should be more games available on Steam by Taiwanese game developers. You guys should make a solid start and I wish you a good one.\n\nI hope we will see more from the devs in future!

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198114547725/recommended/372540/","76561198114547725","Grablin","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198114547725/","118 products in account","Please keep in mind that these are my opinions and constructive criticisms towards the game and that they should in no way shape or form be taken as a means of offense to the developers of this game.\n\nFor a free game this has quite a few high points. But as a game in general it has many more low points. The game itself has a great idea and visual style and impliments alot of its points fairly well. The visuals are decent though you can tell most of the work was put into the main character, main boss, and large enemy models, where the smaller enemies were very lack luster in their design and could really use a bit of touching up. Thats not to say that the level designs werent good or looked bad but you could definitely tell that majority of the terrain was copy/pasted with a staircase or stack of unbreakable boxes to hide easily distinguishable features that would give it away.\nNow, lets talk about combat. The combat of the game absolutely needs a few tweaks to improve the overall gameplay. The combos are very appealing, well animated and pretty but dont have much in the way of having some kind of feeling of impact when attacking enemies. By that i mean when striking an enemy they continue their own attacks and do constant damage where one would usually think they would stagger or be slightly stunned from the attacks the player delivers. The damage dealt by enemies also needs to be tweaked, when the player has to constantly break away from combat to hunt down healing items just to have their health slapped back down by what few enemies decided to persue them it really makes the game hard to enjoy as well as breaking the flow of the game. No im not saying the game is too hard , im saying that it has an artificial layer of difficulty with the enemies damage amounts, constant attacks and their ability to not be stunned. This can be easily fixed by either adding a block ability, a better escape ability, or by lowering the enemies damage, and a MUST is to add stagger for when the enemies are hit so that the player doesnt have to stop fighting just to search for the rather scarce healing objects.\nThe level design isnt bad for an indie game. Though the game is obviously linear by nature the areas are wide enough for you to move rather freely during combat while being narrow enough to keep the player from getting lost while trying to find health items in between fights, or sometimes in the middle of them, and has a very nice variation of styles in the areas you go. You are rarely going to find yourself in a room that looks EXACTLY the same as a previous one which is a big high note for an indie game in and of itself.\nEnemy AI leaves a bit to be desired in a rather surprising way. The smaller enemies meander around and will 'try' to find a way to reach the player when they get close enough but dont really follow you if you move too far too fast, this isnt a bad thing as the smaller enemies are the main bulk of what you find but pairing this with the larger enemies who hunt you down to the ends of the earth and sport a ranged attack that can hit you twice and momentarily stun you, it doesnt make alot of sense in my honest opinion. the only thing that helps you when theyre after you is how slow they are so you at least have some breathing room when youre looking for health items, which you WILL be looking for when fighting the larger enemies no matter how hard you try.\nThe movement and overall speed of the player character is great, not too fast and not too slow but paced just enough to allow the player to take in the visual style and scenery of the level designs. The dash however may need a few tweaks to make sure it can be used in combat more effectively without leaving the player open to an enormous amount of attacks.\nUnfortunately i cannot recommend this game in its current build if you are looking for a fully fleshed out indie game. my hope is that the devs will continue working on this game and really make it into something as awesome and fun as it feels like they were trying to accomplish. the game itself shows an enormous amount of promise and i look forward to seeing how it progresses if the devs continue working on it, which i genuinely hope they do.\nRLDR; game shows great promise, but still needs A LOT of work","April 21","false","0.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seeker227/recommended/372540/","seeker227","Seeker227","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seeker227/","409 products in account","This game gets a thumbs up because the developer was smart enough to realize no one would pay for this mess.\n\n-Gameplay\nAs fancy and flashy the game may look, it does little to keep it interesting. With a total of 2 attacks, 1 aerial attack, and 2 power attacks, you find yourself mashing X and Y in random order hoping to dish out some damage. There are only 3 types of enemies, and one boss. The first enemy introduced are slow shadow guys, that have one attack. They are the obvious grunts of the game, and provide no challenge unless they group up on you in a party of over 10 at once. Even then it just takes a simple dash away, and half of them forget you ever existed.\n\nThe next enemy looks much like the first, only with a gun and no brain. For being the long distance foe, they seem to have very short-sighted vision, as they don't seem to notice you until you are brushing arms together. Their run is exactly as fast as yours, and when they see you, that is exactly what they do. Your only option is to dash after them, which usually puts you ahead of them, and they run the other way.   Oh, did I mention they only fire about once every 5 minutes? Yea, so there is that. You corner the non-hostile snipers against a wall, mash your two buttons, until they die and fall through the wall, with their feet sticking out.\n\nThe third enemy is introduced like the others were, randomly. They are (pretty cool looking) giants with a cannon that shoots exploding projectiles. Normally by the third enemy type in a game, they introduce an enemy that requires thinking and logic to overcome. Not this guy. You dash through his chest (apparently you are ethereal) and wack a few times. Repeat until dead.\n\nThe boss comes after a room so full of enemies you think "I could use a health pot" but the pot does not come until the boss room, and they spawn behind the titan. This large guy appears to have fewer attacks than you, which is to say less than 4. You wack at his feet, and slowly chip away at his ridiculous health bar. You defeat him the same way you do the last guys; dash, wack, dash, wack...\n\nYou ever play a Zelda game, and destroy pots for the rupies? Well apperntly in this universe they store green healing magic in their pots rather than money. No big deal.\n\n-Graphics\nThe game simply looks amazing, and is probably what drags most people into it. However, after just a few minutes you notice how blocky the animations are, lacking any fluidity. The second enemy obviously takes assets from the first, and the boss obviously takes assets from the third enemy.\n\n\n-Controls\nControls are simple, but use of power attacks took a little experimenting (due to there being no tutorial). The camera acts like a strung out toddler swatting flies. The left stick (which moves you) also moves your camera, rather harshly. While the right stick has little control at all. You find yourself letting the camera do its own thing, and using the right stick to correct its errors.\n\n\n-Overall\nThe lack of any tutorial or the effort to copy and past into Google Translate not only seems lazy, but drags down the 20 minute game. You are thrown into a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of flailing husks with arms, and asked to mash two buttons in an attempt to knock the husks through the walls.\n\nI suggest trying the game for yourself, laugh at how easy it is, then die to the overpowered boss.\n\nFailing that, at least you get to see some ♥♥♥♥.","February 5","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It does seem to be pretty short, like 20 minutes is probably all it would take for someone who is better than I am at the game to beat it, but it is a free game and feels like it could possibly be a demo for a much bigger game. It does have a few bugs and could use some music. Overall, I enjoyed playing the game, even if the experience was short lived.\n\nCheck out my video for the game if you would like to see some gameplay so you can decide if you would enjoy it like I did!     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXHztIbV29M","January 28","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are coming to this game thinking that you are going to have hours on end in a diverse world with different characters, a plot of some sorts, and other variables that make a game; you'd be wrong. I'm not knocking this game down but part of me wishes that there was more to it because this game would make for a quite a good free-to-play or even a standalone product if much more time was put into it. On average, this game is about 20 minutes long so if anything as countless others have said: this is more so a tech demo demonstrating what these individual(s) are capable of. For what it's worth, the graphics aren't too bad but during my entire playthrough, I started to notice moderate slow-down here and there on a machine that is more than capable of running modern games. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else or if it was just my end alone but it was a minor annoyance. Focusing on the AI, there really isn't much to say as sometimes they will attack and run while others will stare into the distance with the thousand yard stare. Did I mention some also tend to float in mid-air over cliffs? Yeah, they do that too. One other thing that felt slightly distracting was the animations; I understand that this is a student project but different character animations just felt slightly off when it came to jumping or even using what we will call the "Q Rings". Combat does feel solid albeit the choice of keys that are mapped for various attacks; my only complaint is the lack of variety in attacks. Sure, you can chain your attacks to make an interesting looking combo but there really isn't much there and I wish it were to demonstrate even more of these individuals' skill-set. As a demo, the game does suffer from quite a few glitches but the thing is.. glitches have almost become commonplace in video games nowadays so it really shouldn't surprise me. On one end of the spectrum, I had died due to not slowing my playing pace down but I took notice to when I respawned that I could no longer use my 1-2-and-3 specials but instead I could teleport myself to different areas of the game map which included the Final Boss Room (which I died on due to laughing hysterically which it then fixed itself).\n\nSo what are my final thoughts on The Lost Mythologies? Honestly, it's hard to say. For a student project it is good albeit the short length. I'd like to see more expanded in the game in terms of a plot, enemy varieties, new attacks and skills because if enough time and effort is poured into this game; it can definitely turn itself around as being a great indie hack-and-slash. For all you achievement completionists out there: there is only one achievement which takes 5 seconds to earn so why would you not download this game?","January 28","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's kinda barebones hack and slash combat. Which is alright. I had fun for the 15 minutes I played of the game.\n\nThat being said, the game is very short. This seems like more of a tech demo. There isn't too much too the enviroments and the design of the areas are simple. But they work.\n\nIf this is merely a demo, this game has something going for it.

I'ts also free to play so I have basically nothing bad to say about it even though there are many minuses. The Lost Mythologies reminds me a lot of Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae, since it is a very similar game by combat. The graphics are unbeleavably great considering it is a student project and also the combat system works, even though I think there should be more features such as weapon and skill upgrades, that would be really great. The enemy units might be a little sluggish and buggy, but its really not a big deal as in general, everything else seems to work perfectly One of my only problems with the game was that there really is a limited amount of options to customise the game, which I personally found a little troubling. I read a few reviews of this game earlier, claiming the game to be laggy, etc but honestly I didn't experience this problem at all. That only means the lags are because of ones computer being uncapable of running the game and that those who have these problems should not make a review of the game in the first place because their PC simply cannot run the game all too well. With all things concidered, I applause the developers for their effort and for the great success on most parts of the game. I also recommend anyone who likes martial fighting/hack n slash kind of whacking type of games with advanced moves and combos and all that kind of stuff, to try out this impressive school project, maybe it will catch your interest in the developers in case they start producing the real deal next time :)","May 15","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a prologue, but after that, there doesn't seem to be anything.\n\nGameplay:\nHack and slash with very linear levels.\nSeveral enemies at one time.\nSpam attack.\n\nCombat:\nUnpolished. When you hit an enemy, they flinch a little, but this has no effect on their actual ability to attack you. The combat controls are presented to you in the beginning, these consist of left click, right click, 1, 2, 3, and F.\n1, 2, and 3 are magic abilities, but using WASD to move and trying to reach 1-3 is awkward. Being that there are only 3 magics, I see no reason that the combat could not be mapped to any combination of Q, E, Z, X, or C.\n\nGraphics:\nVery beautiful graphics with terrible animations.\nToo focused on sex appeal. The protagonist is busty and barely clothed. If you press R to reset the camera, it's positioned with an upward angle toward her butt.\n\nMusic:\nWas there any? I didn't notice.\n\nAchievements:\nThere is 1 achievement for running the game.\n100% for just trying the game.","January 29","false","0.2"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","0"

And you can see that under the skirt because of the camera that, for some reason, overshoots itself.\n\nBeyond that, animations are not smooth.  I swear the game runs at 30 FPS, or at least the controls respond like they do.  The gameplay is boring.  I had times where the character was standing on air.  And the enemies and death were not that interesting.\n\nOh, and gaining an achievement for opening the game is not an achievement.\n\nIt's worth a look-at for the curious or Chinese people that are absolutely broke.

There's pretty much no story, the combat is repetitive but good enough to keep you interested for a bit. The enemy AI is bare bones and the sound quality is mediocre.\n\nSomeone else stated that the graphics are 9/10 - I highly wonder what he/she compares that to, and what a 10 is in his/her book.\n\nI'd say it's a solid 6, and a 7 if I want to be generous. But that's comparing it to other recently new games within the genre.\n\nI did hear this ''game'' is just a demo at the time, however it is not officially classified as such and therefor will not be reviewed as such. It does sorta get a free pass for being free though.\nLike I said for me, there isn't much to like here, the combat isn't good enough to make up for a lack of depth/story. There is basically nothing but the combat and some decent graphics to look at right now.\n\nHowever, who knows.

Then you have my situation were i had to skype call me chinese friend and screen share to know what was being said on the little scrolls that appear, and finally figuring out how to beat the first area, go to options, set lock mode to hold, hold shift for the rest of the game while pressing f near enemies and spaming mouse buttons.\n\nOverall it is a good game, but needs a little more attention than a english translation.","February 23","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But with what few hours  I have on record I do want to review this game based off what I've seen of it's gameplay vs its story since I wasn't able to actually read it. My first biggest conundrum came when I first started the game as I couldn't find a settings menu to switch this game from windowed mode to full screen. But after getting through the prologue to the game I went straight to the settings and changed the settings to what I could, mid resolution and full screen, going back expecting the controls on the bottom of the screen to have remained there only to fall victim to the absence of said controls. So I ended up pressing every key on my keyboard to figure out the controls.\n\nSo I then got thinking to myself that "I got this, a bad beginning can't ruin this game for me. After all it is a game I got for free." I was proven wrong, so I get going and start fighting the baddies in front of me and I get to the last one in the beginning room and I'm killed off.\n\n"What the ♥♥♥♥," I said to myself, "I didn't even get hit by anything until that guy."\n\nI respawn, and turns out that there's no indicator that you're getting hit outside of just constantly monitoring your health bar. I get over my previous statement and I go on moving from area to area figuring out that the pots contain big health ups and the enemies drop almost insignificant ones. Until I get to a large area with cliffs and ranged enemies in addition to the normal cronies running about. And turns out there's no edge protection in this area where you have to use the special action key to move between platforms, making me fall to my death.\n\n"No biggie," I say, "I surely got past a checkpoint on my way to this area." Yeah, no. I start right back at the beginning. And that brought me here to the review page. But hey, it's a fun game until it frustrates you, so give it a try. It's free.\nAnd in other news I think this game would look a lot better with a constant third person over the shoulder camera with a toggleable free camera as well as a few more video setting (i.e. V-Sync).","March 11","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for a free game, it's actually pretty awesome!\n\nThis is not a very difficult game.  I mean, if I could potentially finish it (it crashed during the final boss fight on me ... I think it was the final boss fight, anyway) some people might consider it "too easy."  I don't mind the "lack of difficulty," however, as this is actually a selling point of the game.\n\nThe graphics are all right.  Your character is fixed and, as far as I can tell, completely uncustomizable.  Even so, she's certainly pretty to look at.  You can move the camera all around her if you like.  I suppose some where out there is a patch to make this more interesting, but I'm not terribly interested in looking.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up pretty smoothly.  That's a pretty unique feature for a modern game of any stripe.  Most games I play lure you in with a good and easy cruise for about four hours, than ramp up the difficulty to "off the charts" all of a sudden, but only after you've played too long to get a refund.\n\nThere are some complaints about the lack of options in the game, such as graphics and the like.  I don't mind this at all and it really doesn't bother me.  As I understand this was essentially a student project, I see nothing wrong with it's appearance or lack of options at all.\n\nWhile I see reports that you can not configure the controls of the game, this isn't a bother for me, either.  It uses standard mouse and keyboard FPS controls.  If you're unfamiliar with those controls, or prefer to use a different control device, I don't know what to tell you.  In my opinion, they stopped making decent control devices for PC over ten years ago. O.O\n\nAll and all, it's a great game for the price!  Much better than anything you'll find in a mobile game, it has no microtransactions, and it's quite a fun little ditty to play when you just want to pass a littel time here and there.\n\nDon't expect much replay, of course.  I suspect you'd just keep replaying it only to see if you can do it better, since the game is fairly short and nothing changes between game plays as far as I can tell.\n\nBut the game is free.  If it works for you, you'll probably like it for what it offers.  Especially if you read all my boring dull pointless ramblings about it. =p","March 13","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All in all it is a very nice looking game that needs a fair bit of work on gameplay mechanics,Being a bit longer might help too (but only if you fix the camera/motion blur).","March 23","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I doubt this review is helpful but I have one last thing to tell you, this thing takes up space on anybodys hardrive once you install it, and it's a waste of time to even wait for it to finish downloading (based on your internet download speed) and yet fails to have a good story that yet just copys any other game that has gods in it. I strongly suggest you talk to your doctor before playing this game. 0/10 wouldn't play this game ever again, unless then again it had a better story, more graphics support, and some more modesty, lots of gamers disagree on this fact because the most obvious reason most people have even downloaded this game was for the main character, the main (poorly clothed) and poorly back-rounded character could be better. Tbh this game could be more awesome if it had shurikens and ninjas, but honestly just doesn't have it. this is a long review, and if anyone's gotten this far, good for you, you've finally reached the point where I tell you that to truly like this game, you'd have to have a cat attached to your back while listening to let it go and justin beibers boyfriend to like it more, of course this is just my honest opinion, and of course I've only spent 20 minutes to\ndecide and after watching youtube videos to truly understand that this game isn't worth some of your hardrive space that you used up, and deleting it was so easy. I even wasted some of my life writing this review, but it was worth it, however much time I have left. Oh and if you could turn off motion blur, the preformance would increase a little too, and don't forget about paged pool memory levels and anti-aliasing, and anisotropic filtering, and texture quality and decal quantity, and fxaa. this review may be a little to concrete but it's my honest opinion.

It also has all the necessary sound effects required for some immersion, the only odd thing was that my own footsteps could only be heard on the right ear but they are so quiet that they didn't distract me anyway.\n\nGameplay: You have two different ways to attack enemies (fast attack & strong attack) plus three special abilities (one with long range, one which is good vs several enemies and a strong one which is just good vs one enemy (or two if they're directly next to each other)). The enemies seem to have basic intelligence (can't be lured super easily + ranged enemies try to maintain distance). The attack animations + projectile graphics leave you a bit of time to react but nevertheless it can be quite challenging (especially before you realise that you can destroy pots to regain health).\n\nIt's fast, it's fun and i'll definitely keep an eye on what the developers are doing in the future.","February 14","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But with what few hours  I have on record I do want to review this game based off what I've seen of it's gameplay vs its story since I wasn't able to actually read it. My first biggest conundrum came when I first started the game as I couldn't find a settings menu to switch this game from windowed mode to full screen. But after getting through the prologue to the game I went straight to the settings and changed the settings to what I could, mid resolution and full screen, going back expecting the controls on the bottom of the screen to have remained there only to fall victim to the absence of said controls. So I ended up pressing every key on my keyboard to figure out the controls.\n\nSo I then got thinking to myself that "I got this, a bad beginning can't ruin this game for me. After all it is a game I got for free." I was proven wrong, so I get going and start fighting the baddies in front of me and I get to the last one in the beginning room and I'm killed off.\n\n"What the ♥♥♥♥," I said to myself, "I didn't even get hit by anything until that guy."\n\nI respawn, and turns out that there's no indicator that you're getting hit outside of just constantly monitoring your health bar. I get over my previous statement and I go on moving from area to area figuring out that the pots contain big health ups and the enemies drop almost insignificant ones. Until I get to a large area with cliffs and ranged enemies in addition to the normal cronies running about. And turns out there's no edge protection in this area where you have to use the special action key to move between platforms, making me fall to my death.\n\n"No biggie," I say, "I surely got past a checkpoint on my way to this area." Yeah, no. I start right back at the beginning. And that brought me here to the review page. But hey, it's a fun game until it frustrates you, so give it a try. It's free.\nAnd in other news I think this game would look a lot better with a constant third person over the shoulder camera with a toggleable free camera as well as a few more video setting (i.e. V-Sync).","March 11","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animations are pretty clunky for both the player and the enemies. The entire game is too easy as you can dash and attack at the same time and take no damage. This makes the final boss a complete joke. With polishing I would give the game another try in the future but for now I am going to say do not waste your time on this. This needs some serious tweeking. I am not trying to bash this game but once it gets some upgrades/updates/tweeks/fixes/is reborn as something better that this mess I will then update my review. The base is somewhat solid and the graphics are pretty good overall.

It wasn't until I was in the actual game that I hit escape and saw the settings. I was then able to fullscreen the game.\n\nI'm using a PS3 controller and it works great. Funny enough, the instructions didn't show up until I plugged in my controller (for attacks an specials, etc.)\n\nSome parts don't even give you instructions (floating islands with teleporters) but the key with controllers is the left trigger to teleport to the next island.\n\nNo checkpoints. You die, you go back to the beginning.\n\nA bug I've encountered is where I've died in the first room and ended up respawning at the one right before the floating islands.\n\nVisuals are great, but animations and mechanics could use some works. Things like jumping look awkward. I will say though that the attack animations are fluid.\n\nAchievements broken. The first achievement you are supposed to get was broken when they updated the English UI.\n\nCan't read the little text boxes in the corner because they are in Chinese (grrr, 4 years of studying Chinese and I still can't read it. Although even if I could, it doesn't stay up long enough for you to read it. Literally disappears in seconds and is only initiated by combat). Translation is needed... would also be nice to keep it up for a tad bit longer.\n\nLimited instructions and gets boring fast because this should be an early access game if the developpers intend on improving it any further.\n\nThe negative reviews are little too critical... for a free game of this magnitude, it is like an art showcase. Sure, it doesn't feel like a full game, but it is a good demo. Because of the lack of checkpoints, I probably won't continue playing much longer (I keep dashing myself off the cliffsides) but the best part is that it is FREE and as you don't waste too much time trying to beat the game, you can't really complain.\n\nAlso, I didn't even need to try to get an upshirt shot. When the character died, her skirt fluttered up graciously.","February 9","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I doubt this review is helpful but I have one last thing to tell you, this thing takes up space on anybodys hardrive once you install it, and it's a waste of time to even wait for it to finish downloading (based on your internet download speed) and yet fails to have a good story that yet just copys any other game that has gods in it. I strongly suggest you talk to your doctor before playing this game. 0/10 wouldn't play this game ever again, unless then again it had a better story, more graphics support, and some more modesty, lots of gamers disagree on this fact because the most obvious reason most people have even downloaded this game was for the main character, the main (poorly clothed) and poorly back-rounded character could be better.

The enviroment's appearance reminds me of the Force Unleashed which is pretty awesome again, I seriously wonder how much time they had to make this project.  Not much more I can say about it cause I couldn't well read out the story, but it was good, and if you're worried about the Chinese Language, don't be, just use google translate to locate the words your looking for on the menu, like "Start" "Options" "Graphics"/"Quality" "High" "Medium" "Low", you know.  I don't quite agree with the character's outfit, but it's kind of like indulging on a cookie..you do it every once in a while :3","January 31","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the best way I can really sum up this game. Actually, this is less a game and more a very, VERY early tech demo. Don't expect to jump in and start wailing enemies all stylish and cool, like Dante or Bayonetta. All you're really given are 3 types of attacks. One button for sword swinging, one button for kicking, and holding down the Right Trigger and pressing any of the other 2 previous attack buttons will activate a special type of attack. Even with mixing up all 3 of these attacks, there's very little combo you can do in this game, and with the animation of the game being pretty stilted, even trying to exploit something here is out of the question. You also have a dash which lets you shoot straight across for a sudden burst of speed. This is only really helpful for getting out of enemy attacks but it also serves to let you cancel any attack you're doing (Dash cancelling basically).\n\nEnemies are as typical as it gets. Ninja mooks, gorilla-like mooks, a big dude that shoots rocket, and one big boss that's a combination of all other enemies you've encountered. Enemies don't seem to flinch when you attack them, so the entire combat experience just gets really dull, especially with how huge the environment is and how slow you run. On the plus side, I can say that the game does look really wonderful. The obvious Chinese inspired locations and theme while under the night sky looks very beautiful, which is saying something for what is pretty much a tech demo.\n\nThe only real reason I'm giving this a pass is because it's a free game, so I really can't complain. As a dude who loves action beat-em-ups like Wonderful 101 and Bayonetta, I want to look at the plus side of things, and there's definitely a lot of room for improvements with this game. I envision a lot of cool things that this game can be capable of pulling off, but that's up to the developers themselves to work on.\n\nGive this demo a shot if you truly have nothing better to do though.","January 30","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, for some reason, even the steam acheivement wont register that i've played this game. Considering it should give the acheivement just for opening the game the first time, and i've played for 1.5 hours, i can't see any reason why it hasn't.\n\nThe game itself is a decent and fun hack and slash action game. It's graphically decent, gameplay mechanics are decent, overall its a decent game. not perfect, not the best of its genre, but its a very good game considering its free aswell.\n\nJust wish it was a bit lass power hungry a game. (and that i could have my acheivement haha)\n\nOverall, i'd likely give this a 6/10, with potential to be improved.","June 2","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
