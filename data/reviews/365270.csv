It's essentially fantasy minesweeper. I never really finished the tutorial since there wasn't really any fun factor that motivated me to continue. As others have said, your success will likely boil down to guessing correctly which isn't very satisfying. Sometimes it takes multiple guesses to proceed which wastes your precious resources. I need something fun to hook me, at the moment the game is mostly frustrating. Maybe a story of some sort could add to the fun factor.\n\nAt the moment I don't recommend, but it may improve.","April 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

And there were two types of mines, each with their own disarming item.  And walls restricted your movement.  And there were lockpicking puzzles and memory-based combat.  And a food counter that decreased with movement.\n\nShadow Hunter's primary flaw is that boards repeatedly put you into situations where your next move is random chance.  Walls restrict your movement, with rooms entered from corridors that are a single space wide.  If one of those spaces is safe, then you have to guess to progress.  You can start, or be teleported into similar situations.  You can clear shadows and still end up in such situations.\n\nWhile mistakes do not mean instant failure, they do drain resources.  Stepping into a trap drains health, limiting how often you can take such chances.  Using the wrong disarming item costs you that item, which requires camping to restock.  Card spaces have no item that disarms them, but also deal no direct damage, instead triggering some effect.\n\nYou are rewarded with bonuses for disarming multiple spaces without taking damage.  This works okay.  You are rewarded with bonus food for clearing multiple spaces within a single move.  This does not work okay.  When you move multiple spaces in a turn, you can only move in a straight line.  The board layout restricts how many places even have the potential to let you move enough to trigger the food bonus.  When you do attempt such a move, you are almost guaranteed to be moving into spaces for which you hold no information, and thus it is random chance whether or not you actually have a clear path or will instead hit a trap (which will reset the counter.)\n\nThere is a lockpicking minigame for opening locked doors.  You have five chances to find the correct order of the five pins.  Failure only means that you gain no bonus gold, while the fewer the tries required means the greater the bonus you receive.  While logic and memory can greatly increase your odds of clearing this puzzle, it is still random chance as to how fast you will clear it, and thus how large your reward will be.\n\nCombat (as combat can be triggered by stepping into card spaces, or seemingly just by chance when moving) is a memory game.  At the start of combat you are shown, in order, the attacks that the opponent will make.  You have to perform the same attacks in the same order, while the enemy sequence is removed from view after you start.  Feedback for this combat is poor.\n\nIn theory, minesweeper where you move through the board sounds interesting.  In practice, it just doesn't work that well.  Setting it in a fantasy world gives it some meaning, but seems to have also lead to the game implementing several awkward or ill-fitting mechanics together.\n\nThe game is a free game, so it costs nothing but time to try.  But mechanically, it just doesn't hold up.","May 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

When starting this game, you are given very little information about the actual gameplay. The "tutorial" assumes you already know how character movement is accomplished, what the icons on your screen mean, and what gameplay jargon means. For example, the game continues to warn you about "courage" but never tells you which of the 12 meters/bars/counts on the overly complicated UI represents courage.\n\nThe other major problem with this game is the amount of guessing required. In minesweeper, you have enough clues to figure out the location of the mines. This is like minesweeper in a tunnel with two different types of mines and no way to mark any of the mines.","February 16","false","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Shadow Hunter expands upon the simple challenge of minesweeper, and takes it in a player-centered direction, also adding some elements from mastermind.\n\nUnfortunately, I've yet to get far, as luck plays a larger role than most (myself included) are comfortable with, and neither strategy nor skill can fully mitigate chance in this game. For example, on the first two levels, the player does not have enough food to clear the whole level. in order to earn more food, the player must either take a leap of faith, or spend large amounts of food slowly clearing a room and setting up combos. So far, every game I've played has ended due to bad luck, or lack of food forcing me to take a chance and run into more bad luck.\n\nI like this game, and I see the potential. I hope that it grows into a fully-fledged strategy game one day, but for now, it seems like a 20 minute experience that will only frustrate the player.","May 25, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It got me motivated for a couple of minutes...\nHowever it still leaves much to consider.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad, it makes you think, it makes you follow your intuition and leaves you to wonder where to go or what to do next. It's mysterious theme is very cool too. But... it lacks a story.\n\nYou are a  Shadow Hunter, whose mission is to vanquish evil from the land... So what? What else is there to it? I don't know because YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW ANYTHING.\n\nAnother bad aspect is that it wastes a little bit of food every two steps. Which makes me ask: Am I a Shadow Hunter or someone with a black hole for a stomach that needs to eat every two seconds? The indicators for when you are in the shadows could use more work too. They shouldn't just tell what's up they should give you a more specific location that still leaves you to wonder where something is like "Shadow two steps to the left" or something like that. Also the visuals are nice but the character seems a little off. He looks sort of pixelized, and there is this little square thing that shows up on his hand when he walks upwards.\n\nThis game would be so much better if these little things could be fixed, and perhaps add something more into it. A more interesting objective rather than cleaning dark fog and going down some stairs. The Side quests aren't that much of a big deal either. You find shadow scrolls. Which is pretty much doing what you already have to. Cleaning darkness and OH there's the scroll.\n\nI got interested in the game for a few minutes and then left. Specially because of the food aspect. Why does it use food when we camp too? Supposedly, you recover stones and torches by doing so. But it wastes food. So you are pretty much continuing the game and sabotaging yourself at the same time!\n\nMy verdict?\n\n4/10\n\nThere needs to be MAJOR improvements if this game is ever to become known, or just something to make people want to play.","May 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's entirely possible that further releases will add new content, or change the pros and/or remedy the cons addressed below. While I will try to update my review as needed, keep in mind the review could be outdated by any future patches.\n\nShadow Hunter is an isometric dungeon delver that should be a catch for anyone who's a fan of Minesweeper, but it's a work in progress.\n\nYou play as an eponymous Shadow Hunter, who seeks to purge the encroaching darkness. Unfortunately, there's not much more in the way of story just yet. Side missions, or “Tasks,” are few and repeat rather quickly. The satisfaction of completing the game is to see your final gold count, as there isn't a real end.\n\nThe key player in the game's system is Courage. It's a consumable stat that can be recovered and drained by various actions. Lose too much of it, and you'll have to camp, thereby triggering a fight and potentially getting Courage in return. Fights are so trivial, and Courage is so abundant, that you'll likely never find this an issue no matter how things turn out, however.\n\nThere are a couple mini-games on display. The encounters, engaged either randomly or through events, are Simon Says/Memory style affairs. The Shadow Hunter intuits the enemy's moves, but only briefly. It's then up to you to copy the pattern displayed. Success grants a flawless battle, whereas missing a “Match” allows the enemy to get a hit in, simultaneously jogging the Shadow Hunter's memory and allowing you to try again.\n\nThe other game manifests in the locked doors throughout the levels. Each game's take on lock picking is a little bit different; here, it plays out like Mastermind. You have a number of tries to get the order of the tumblers right, with each wrong position highlighted in red, and each correct assignment in blue. Failing to decipher the sequence, or deliberately pulling the spring, will trigger an encounter automatically. At present, however, the threat of failure is mitigated entirely by the fact that you can just click the door again or walk away and come back with no penalty or remembered actions.\n\nThe graphics aren't going to wow you. The tileset is an odd hodgepodge of mismatched pieces, without artistic consistency. The interface is a clash between retro sensibilities and newly-minted 3D art. What few NPCs exist appear as portraits of decently made 3D models. Encounters all have the same icon to indicate “enemy” during battles.\n\nWhile the tutorial is stashed away for easy reference, it's a tad front-loaded.\n\nBugs, while not game-breaking, do mar the experience, such as when a roving enemy skips all of its turns to get to you upon completing a random encounter. Balancing issues still exist from the changes that have been made already. Perhaps the greatest example: the score board. You can, theoretically, play through the levels repeatedly, amassing obscene amounts of untold wealth. Thus, the fact that the score board uses your gold as a marker of how well you do is a bit moot. There are some convenience/design features not quite implemented, such as a notification for the player that they never retrieved all of the shards.\n\nThe game has a way to go yet, and you may not be keen on joining the ride. So why, then, might this game still have merit for some?\n\nSimply put, it's intriguing when basic gameplay gets a practical spin, becoming a part of a larger whole. In Shadow Hunter, the MC “repels the darkness” through Minesweeper-like game play. The Hunter's pulse pounds, and “intuition” shows when danger is nearby: traps, shadow creatures, or events. The “flags” from Minesweeper appear automatically, but it is possible for you to “guess” where traps or shadows are, or rather to dispel them from a spot that they're likely to be. Adding a layer of depth to the game is the manner in which tiles are cleared. Simply stepping into the darkness isn't enough, as squares cleared in that way become “fear tiles,” and thus remove your Courage even after being cleared. In order to avoid creating fear tiles, you have to teleport, and either keep the combo of teleportation going, or walk out of the square you've teleported to. The greater the combo, the better the rewards, but also the greater risk of “missing” and creating a field of fear tiles. Very few other games take advantage of this mechanic, and Shadow Hunter's clever implementation of it makes for an interesting Minesweeper variant, if nothing else.\n\nAs it stands, I can't recommend Shadow Hunter but to those looking for a little variation on the standard Minesweeper formula.","October 19, 2015","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not ask for anything more in a relaxing brain teaser, pulling at all your strings in your head yet doing it casually. This perfectly blends the artstyle, qeusts, and overall gameplay into the best F2P game i played in a long time.\n\n10/10 WOULD DIE FROM TELEPORTATION AGAIN!","January 16","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea is same trough the whole game. I am not sure if there is any way to purchase or get more stones etc because they run out if playing long enough. And there should also be an other way to mark shadows when you can be 100 % sure that there is one.","January 21","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
