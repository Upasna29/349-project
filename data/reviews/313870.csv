Despite the main character being from Paris and talking in a German accent, the game is a suitably silly vampire story about an opera singer (who doesn't really believe she's a vampire) trying to escape a castle in Draxsylvania and get back to Paris. Her comedy sidekick bat sits on her shoulder and supplies plenty of sarcasm. There are some memorable characters, the voice acting is pretty good, and there's lots of jokes on just about every clickable object.\nThe controls are decent, a few of the puzzles are illogical, but otherwise bearable, and the story gets better and better as the characters grow.\nBe warned that it ends sort of abruptly and was supposed to have been a two-parter, but the second game was never made. Some sort of information about that would have been nice up front, but it doesn't actually matter much. It's not too much of a cliffhanger, and the game is enjoyable enough that you can't really feel mad about it. If anything, you're sad you can't spend more time with the characters, but a prequel is in the works, so here's hoping.\nI couldn't get the game running when launching from steam, but running the exe file in the game folder worked.","December 31, 2014","true","0.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

The story itself is nothing new with the female seeing an out of a bad relationship that was forced upon her.  She's trapped and looking for a way out of it and to get to Paris.     In some ways\nthe puzzles and gameplay reminded me of the first Broken Sword game.     And the atmosphere.    The voice acting was rather good and the sense of humor in the game was funny and enjoyable.    At times I felt the puzzles didn't seem to flow well with the story and found myself aimlessly exploring trying to find the next clue which led me into mystery.  The story began to lose some cohesion as I went on so I felt some of this was clumbsy with respect to delivery of the story and puzzles in the game.   The puzzles themselves weren't overly hard but, enjoyable.   At times I would get bored and save the game to find myself coming back to it in 30 minutes time enjoying it some more.    With that said\nI found it to be a cutsie , entertaining , get away from the standard hack and slash and shoot em up games I enjoy as well.    Recommended to get it when on sale as a 20 dollar price tag is far too high for this game.\n\nNOTE: I am running Windows 8.1 and have experiencd no problems running the game.  My system is up to date with an AMD 8350, 16 gig of ram, Radeon R285 and all windows updates (including optional) installed.  I recommend optional updates as they do typically have game compatibility fixes in them.  But I've run into zero issues with playing this game on a modern computer.","December 31, 2014","true","6.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The story is very colorful and the location scenery is relatively easy to navigate except, anywhere that the character is allowed to navigate to, it just show a big red arrow! it won't say: "Kitchen" or "Dungeon".  As far as getting it to work, I had to go to where the game was installed, in "game" folder, I changed the "libpandadx9.dll" to "libpandadx9.dll2", clicked on "main.exe", and on the starting screen, turned the anti-alising down to "0", exit to windows, THEN I could start the game like normal.\n\nAside from that, and the fact that this is only "part 1" (no one told me, I had to finish the game to find that out) I enjoyed it.  I did cheat a little, I used a walk-through, I HAD TO! some puzzles were like, "How the heck could I have POSSIBLY figured THAT out!?"  All in all a good game, I mean COME ON! it's 5 bucks!","May 25, 2015","true","9.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/313870/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","A Vampyre Story is a 2008 horror comedy graphic adventure set in Europe during the 1890s, and follows a young female opera singer, recently turned vampire named Mona with her trusty sidekick bat companion Froderick as they attempt to make the journey back home to Paris.\n\nAs with any graphic adventure games, puzzles feature heavily. Most puzzles are creative and challenging and have a logical solution. I didn't however like a particular "Mix Potions into Different Potions" type of puzzle as it seems too over-used in graphic adventure games. It shouldn't be too hard for seasoned adventurers, although for me, I have to refer to the walkthrough more then once. Overall it took me around 15 hours to complete the game. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThis game introduces the concept of an "idea icon" in the inventory. Lets say if you attempt to have Mona take a sword, a sword-specific icon, not the actual sword will be added to the inventory. If necessary, Mona will teleport back to the sword, grab it, and teleport back to use it where she's supposed to. While unique, I thought it to be unnecessary. Nevertheless this is one of the game's unique way of distinguishing itself from other titles.\n\nThe voice acting for all the characters were pretty well done, but I especially enjoyed the playful and witty interactions between Mona and Froderick. Fantastic chemistry between these 2 characters and I really enjoyed the work done by their voice actors. The game also has a very beautiful orchestral and very professionally done soundtrack.\n\nThat said, there are also some serious shortcomings to this game.\nFirstly, I understand that due to the age of this game, there are some people who are complaining that it doesn't even run on their computers. I am lucky that I am one of the few who have no such issues running it on Windows 10.\n\nSecondly, there is no way to play this game in widescreen mode. The whole game is permanently stuck in a 1024x768 resolution with a 4:3 aspect ratio which means you will never be able to get it to play in fullscreen and will always have 2 thick ugly black bars at the side. In-game video resolutions are even lower then 1024x768 making the whole game look extremely dated in 2015.\n\nThen there is the cliff-hanger ending. This entire game is only Chapter One and I understand that it was originally intended to be the first of a 4 part series. Sadly it seems that while a sequel was announced back in 2009, nothing was ever heard of it ever again due to some budget or legal issues with the publisher. As of 2015, it has already been 6 years since the initial 2009 announcement of the sequel. I highly doubt that it will ever be released.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nDespite its low resolution, aspect ratio and other technical issues, I actually enjoyed the game very much. The cartoony 3D art style, wonderful soundtrack and whimsical story really brought back many fond memories of the good ole days of point-and-click graphic adventures.\n\nIf you can look past the technical issues that I mentioned and don't mind that the game ends at a cliff-hanger and is unlikely to ever release any sequel, I'd actually recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a good funny story with moderately challenging puzzles.","October 17, 2015","true","15.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I was thrilled that it showed up on Steam and I'm very happy my memories of the game weren't just nostalgia, it's very fun and polished. The tone and puzzles are reminiscent of classic LucasArts games and the art is top notch, even by today's cartoon game standards.\n\nSome have not liked the voice of Mona, the main protagonist. It is high pitched and I can see how it could annoy folks but I thought it fit and didn't mind.\n\nYes, the game ends on a cliffhanger and a sequel hasn't been made - yet, but don't let that put you off, the game that's here is still great. Plus, the creator, William Tiller, has been looking at creating a prequel and possibly a sequel though the initial Kickstarter campaign didn't pan out.\n\nI personally didn't have any problem running the game on Windows 8.1 64-bit. I also tried it on Windows 10 and in that case had to launch the game by clicking on the executable instead of through Steam.\n\nI think if you are a fan of classic point-and-click you'll like A Vampyre Story.\n\n","January 20, 2015","true","18.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The game has many bugs that make it a headache. Whoever tries to, please install it under C: directory. Don't know if you have Steam under C: but the Steam client accepts to install a game in whatever drive you want. Feel free to give administrator permissions and I hope it plays because it may NOT...\n\nThe graphics are good for an adventure game but I would like a widescreen but NO, there isn't. It has video cutscenes that make it good. It's all 3D and good looking.\n\nThe story is black. The game is attractive but after a while playing it you'll feel that you think black,too. After all the game is for late teens and adults. It has many things in the dialogues and in view that newer eyes would be sensitive. The game is full of black humor but ... it has really many dialogues and so many black jokes that in many cases it will be tiresome. You're supposed to be a female vampire that NEVER accepted her later nature and tries to free herself from her master and his castle. The game was written by some makers of Monkey Island series but no way,it's not like them, One more thing you have to consider is that the second part of the game NEVER been made. So, don't search why the game ends this way, leaving many question marks behind.\n\nThe sounds are pretty good. Black music and very good voices make the game excellent at this point.\n\nThe riddles. You will be SO TIRED of them. Even the hardcore Adventurer will want to see a walkthrough. The game never stops having riddles. Riddles everywhere. And the possibilities are many. Because you have always to compare the new and the OLD and try them too. And it has many things in the environment that you will NEVER use. I was really tired of this game. And if it wasn't an OLD quality game I would place a negative review. I place a positive one for the game. As much for the controls, keep "Tab","Space", left and right click in mind.\n\nIf you want to buy at your own risk and the game is playable under your system,if you can handle so many riddles in a very short space, if you like so many lines of dialogues and black humor then this game is for you.\n\nI would say that this is a Hardcore Adventure game with many bugs!\n","May 26, 2015","true","16.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It also looks good, but the animations can sometimes 'stick' shall we say, although this is not a big issue.\n\nAny fans of P&C's will not be diasapointed in what this has to offer, although not the most challenging game out there, the puzzles aren't ludicrously obscure as they can be in some other titles and range from simple to medium difficulty.\n\nA couple of notes the game might need tweaking a little to run on newer systems but a quick search and you can find the simple information needed. Also I would add that you should try to 'Pick up', 'Talk to', etc every object as mentioned above the dialoug was for me the best part of the game. Lastly use the right click button when changing screens or rooms as Mona, your character, does walk slowly and using RC will skip the walking.\n\nOverall a enjoyable experience - 3.5 (bordering on 4 at times) out 5.","September 27, 2015","true","46.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Being able to fast-forward scenes, dialogue and player movement via keyboard would have definitely won me over but my impatience got the better of me.

It doesn't work! It's rip off, there is no patch or anything and there won't be probably. So if you have win 7 and above, you can't play it. It's looks like a great point & click game, but...\n\n*This is what I found and it worked, but without cutscenes etc. However, for me it didn't worked fully.\n\nfrom Momo1991:\n1) Navigate to Program Filesx86\n2) Select "Steam" folder\n3) Select "SteamApps" folder\n4) Select "Common" folder\n5) Select "A Vampyre Story" folder\n6) Select "Game" folder\n7) Scroll down to "Main"\n8) Right click "Main"\n9) On the Compatibility tab - click "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select "Windows XP (ServicePack 3)" from the drop-down\n10) Also under Settings: check "Disable display scaling oh high DPI settings"\n11) Also under Privilege Level: check "Run this program as administrator"\n12) Click the "Apply" button and close the pop-up\n13) Back in the "Game" folder, locate the file named " libpandadx9.dll "- click the file name and add a 2 - libpandadx9.dll2\n14) Click "Main" and start the game\n15) Set Anti-Aliasing to zero\n16) Exit game, go back to the Game folder, remove the "2" from libpandadx9.dll2 so that it reads libpandadx.dll (ignore the pop-up warning)\n17) Click "Main" again and the game will run perfectly with all the cutscenes","May 26","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
