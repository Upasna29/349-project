I would suggest it to any point and click adventure game fan. I've played a ton of this genre and this one has great humor, great voice acting, it's beautiful, interesting, it's challenging, but not too challenging. Really cool what they did with the ghosts in the inventory. Before buying I saw reviews about it not working, so I was hesitant, but I havent had any problems with the game functioning. I'm loving it!","October 21, 2014","true","24.6"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

It is a little flawed but enjoyable. I would give it a 6.5/10 and say it is worth its price for about 6 hours of light hearted gameplay.\n\nYou should play this game if you are a point and click fan who is looking for a light hearted story with lots of object based puzzles and amusing dialogue. The production is excellent. The visuals and voice acting are really high quality. The puzzle design is good at first: it is logically sound and the basic interface means you won't get stuck for long.\n\nHowever the puzzle quality diminishes through the game. You still are not likely to get very stuck but by the last two chapters you'll find yourself resorting to trial and error.\n\nYou should avoid if you are expecting a difficult puzzle game or any kind of involved plot. It is a children's cartoon made into an adventure game and does well as that. It will keep grown ups amused with the amusing dialogue and mostly well designed puzzles but its really best for kids.","November 30, 2014","true","30.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

In conjunction with the fairly long story, an interesting stable of characters, and classy British voice acting, you get a solid point ‘n’ click title that is equally entertaining for kids and adults alike.\n\nLong version:Haunted is a charming little tale set in 19th century London about a girl searching for the ghost of her sister, only to stumble upon a devilish plot that she needs to foil with the help of a few eccentric otherworldly spirits. Naturally the voice cast is all-British, and they do an excellent job– although they tend to use the same monotone even in emotionally intense scenes.\n\nThe OGRE engine is responsible for the Tim Burton-esque visuals, all presented in lush, but not too intrusive colours and great details. Due to the engine’s limitations clipping and floating bugs are somewhat common, and facial animations are also very limited.\n\nThe puzzles are not particularly difficult. They use a simple system where you need to combine items and/or ghosts with certain hotspots to progress. Even if you get stuck, the brute force method will eventually let you pass.\n\nSo, in essence, Haunted may not be the most memorable point ‘n’ click title out there, but it is certainly unique and entertaining enough to earn its place on the virtual shelf of all adventure game enthusiast.","December 13, 2014","true","8.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It had such potential.\n\nThe puzzles are unintuitive, the voice acting is strained and/or amateurish, and the writing needs work. The only pleasing character is the shopkeeper in the Chinese shop, but he's only got a few lines, unfortunately.\n\nThe plot is okay, but the way the characters bicker stopped being entertaining after about the first hour of play. For some reason there is mutual animosity between nearly every character you come across, as if the game's author can't write any emotion other than irritation. The worst offenders are a part of your party and cannot be avoided.\n\nI kept playing it because I wanted to get my money's worth, but at this point I'm actively not enjoying myself, so I'm quitting. I already figured out what the villains are most likely up to, anyway, and that was the only interesting thing in the whole mess.","May 31, 2015","false","6.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/recommended/260550/","tekanji","Miss Andri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/","186 products in account","Summary: 5/10If you are a fan of adventure games, you should pick Haunted up when it's on sale. It's a straightforward linear adventure game with an interesting (if somewhat predictable) story, though it suffers from the "combine random objects to solve random puzzles" style of puzzle solving that is common to older adventure games.\n\nDetailed review:Haunted is a light-hearted and fun adventure game, good for a casual day of playing. It was originally released in 2012, so the graphics and gameplay are somewhat dated but I think the art style has aged well. However, while the idea of using ghosts with particular talents to help solve puzzles is an interesting one, the puzzles themselves are generally best solved not through critical thinking, but rather gathering up everything in the area, seeing what can be combined, then trying everything until it works. The "puzzle hints" were supposed to help with this, but the few times I tried them they were so basic ("you need to use what's around you"; "you need to use the window as a ladder" type of things) that I ended up turing them off because I kept accidentally clicking them when trying to move around.\n\nSpeaking of accidental clicking, the camera angles are fixed and so movement is incredibly frustrating in some areas. I was surpised that movement was forced through the mouse instead of being able to be manually controlled through the keyboard, as static 3D camera games don't really lend themselves to click-based movement. If the devs are going to add any future patches (I believe someone else wanted controller support, which I think would work well with the game), I really do think they should add keyboard movement.\n\nI was also disappointed that a game that featured a female protagonist trying to save her sister and a female villain lacked any other female characters in significant supporting roles. ALL of the ghosts, except for one you meet at the very end, were men and only two out of the about seven supporting human cast were women. I was also disappointed, though not surprised, that while the male ghosts got a bunch of different body shapes the one female ghost was a Jessica Rabbit-style exaggerated sexy cartoon character. It felt to me like a huge missed opportunity, to be honest.\n\nIn any case, overall I think that Haunted is a game worth playing for people who enjoy adventure games. My general rule for games is that $1 (or, in my case, 100 yen) should be around 1 hour of gameplay, so I found the non-sale pricetag to be a bit steep for a game that--from start to finish, including the bonus chapter at the end--is not going to yield more than 7 hours of gameplay. However, I would definitely recommend picking this up when it's on sale.","August 1, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I enjoyed some parts of it, some puzzels and I had two or three laughs, but thats all. I was bitterly disappointed in the end of the game - twice (there is one "end" if you finish the main story and  a second/"real" end if you finish both bonus quests). I don't want to spoil anything, but the end (or both ends) is/were really emotionless and coldhearted. It felt like the developers of the game had no motivation to think about a proper or exciting end at all and they just stopped there. It's a pitty, because it really had potential and I was really looking forward to playing that game.","February 7","false","11.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The voice acting is bad, but the sentences that leave the characters are sometimes incoherrent gibberish! It is as if each character had their own private monolouge written beforehand and then the devs just tried to "slap" it all togheder into a story.\n\nOftentimes the dialouge between characters will confuse you and you will stare in disbelief as you cannot understand what they are trying to say or just dumfounded.\n\n*Rant over*\n\nBut most likely the broken dialouge is most likely due to the fact that several important parts of the script was cut due to poor budget and the dialouge were not changed, even with the previous parts removed. Resulting in strange sentences that make little sense.\n\nAll in all, 6/10 it is worth it if you get it cheap or just have money and time to kill as you wait for A Vampyre story 2 to be released (If ever...).","February 16","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
