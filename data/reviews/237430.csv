I could have turned away. I could have done differently. I didn't have to do it.\n\nAs I ordered my men to shoot down fleeing civilians, shaking in terror, I began to appreciate the magnitude of my own awfulness. A sense of guilt settled over me. Certain choices became harder to make. I did not, in the end, descend fully into brutality. I remembered mercy. I acted as kindly as I could manage.\n\nAnd yet it was too late. The bodies of the fallen littered the streets. The blood of the Aztec dyed the earth of Mexico. Upon my return to Spain, I was hailed as a hero.\n\nYet even now, I cannot help but feel that in the end I was the villain.\n\nTruly a marvellous game.

It's like a combination of X-COM combat, Oregan trail challenges and exploration, with the writing and personaltiy of earlier RPGs like Fallout. This makes for a unique mix.\n\nOne of the core features of this game is selecting your party not just for their abilities but for their personality. The various personalities will adjust encounters and inform your game play. You can feel the difference when two other wise identical hunters are seen from the lens of which is more annoyingly pious.\n\nThe game also includes an Iron Man mode to keep you honest from save scumming. Which isn't necessary any ways because the designers actually plan for failure. They know you might lose an important or trivial battle and it isn't always lights out or game over like in many other games. For example I actually failed to finish one of the major plot points for the 1st half of the game and things just kept on rolling. Success and deafeat are in equal measures here.\n\nI have three negative points for the game. First while exploring is fun the camera is just too close and so constantly using the map and it's way points is a must for quick travel. My second complaint concerns a small aspect of the combat. Melee combat is much stronger than ranged combat and the guns you brought from Spain have weak damage and a chance to miss. The random encounters on the trail can be very harsh and given enough time you'll get a nasty surprise- also some times the consequences of a choice are not even remotely made clear and so there can be some crazy sticker shock (like instagibs).\n\nEven still this is a good game. I actually think it's worth the $19.99 at full retail and it's very impressive they put this much depth in to a game that pulled in only $77,000 on kickstarter. I finished my first play around 25 - 28 hours doing most of the content in the game. This game has replayability in many of the events and even multiple endings that acknowledge the things that you did during the game and not just at the very end.","October 1, 2013","true","32.2"," 124 of 131 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","124","131","0","5"

You play as a Spanish "capitan" of a ship requisitioned by the governor of Santo Domingo while trying to explore the mainland of the New World.  For those of you who enjoy games like Heroes of Might and Magic, and the Princess Bounty series, this game will feel right at home to you--with a large emphasis of Oregon Trail (remember that game in the 90's?).\n\nAs captain of a ship (that you don't have anymore), you start by handpicking followers for your expedition, judging by roles, personality types, and equipment that they bring with them.  There are five roles in the game--soldiers, hunters, scouts, doctors, and scholars--each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Personality types can range anywhere from aggressive to peacefulness, to racism to openmindedness, and many more.  Will this person fit into your group of misfits?  Will Fernando get along with Teresa?  And what will Pedro bring to your crew?  Is he worth the extra ration per night?  With a well-balanced crew, your chances of survival increase tenfold.\n\nExpeditions: Conquistador leaves a lot of questions you will be asking yourself, and gives you a great sense of adventure you long for in many games.  While travelling through the mainland, you find points of interests, complete quests for people, and explore, explore, explore.  When you are out of movement points, which happens oh-so-often, and can get very tedious, you set up camp for the night and set tasks for your followers to complete throughout the night.  Perhaps some followers will guard the camp from thieves/animals, while others hunt for food, while one person preserves food, or makes medicines.  And if and when you get into combat, it's a very challenging, risk+reward style of turn-based combat.\n\nWhen I say very challenging, I mean it.  This game is very difficult--but in a fun way.  Every decision you make in the open world can and WILL affect your expedition.  Injuries, and even deaths, will most certainly happen.  And if you do not treat an injured follower with a doctor, the follower will eventually get worse, and possibly perish.  If you succeed with quests, you gain experience and equipment, which you can use to eventually promote recruits to veterans and leaders, and upgrading their outdated equipment.\n\nExpeditions: Conquistador is a fantastic game for its money, and will keep you playing for a very long time (the main campaign will take OVER 20-30 hours on average), and also has decent replayability.  As a captain, it is a lot of work to keep your group in good spirits as you fend off natives and other Spaniards as you search for the treasures of the New World.  Although at times the game can get a little monotonous with camping, it throws you for loops as the quest advances.\n\nI strongly recommend this game.  8.4/10","October 31, 2014","true","37.8"," 98 of 104 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","98","104","0","2"

I had created an awesome all female squad.\n\nWe had slaughtered many and completed a handful of quests. Unfortunately my doctor died early on but I had been making do without her. I was a reasonable distance from the main city when a few of my girls fell ill. I was treating them best I could, until a terrible event occured. Isabella had been kidnapped by a cult and they were going to sacrifice her in a fortnight. I headed towards her location as fast as I could but I got caught unawares and several battles later more of my girls had fallen ill. I was running out of medicine, and time. I finally got near her location, but my time had run out. I feared the worst for poor Isabella, while I was struggling to keep half my team from falling fatally ill. I only had just enough healthy comrades left to battle, the rest I was juggling medicine between. I finally made it to the shrine and it was most definiately too late. Her cold corpse was lain out on the altar and I had a hard battle ahead of me. Somehow we made it through the fight, with my favourite, Rosalia left standing. We quickly tried to trace our steps out of the mountains to get back to the city. Many of my girls had died and the rest were critically ill. unfortunately we went the wrong way and before we could even get close, the remainder of my sick left my command, as morale was low from seeing so many others die. Rosalia was all I had left. We still had a few days travel ahead of us, but before we could make it, we were ambushed by tribal warriors and they murdered her before my eyes. I was defeated.\n\nGreat game, and I lost on easy XD Highly recommended","June 23, 2014","true","6.4"," 94 of 107 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","94","107","0","8"

Expeditions:Conquistador is the kind of kind of game that sits in your backlog for months and when you finally get around to playing it you realise what you've been missing out on.\n\nThere's a solid hex-tile based battle system at work here- employing line of sight, cover and flanking mechanics married with a variety of different mission objectives. In some battles the odds are truly stacked against your team, both in numbers and positioning - every encounter feels fresh and satisfying, particularly when you take down key characters during pivotal moments in the narrative. The game boasts a strong musical score throughout the adventure, helping to set and underline the mood during key moments in the game and it ties together the overall package beautifully.\n\nThe events system is where Expeditions:Conquistador truly shines, employing excellent writing with plenty of flavour and flair sprinkled throughout, easily on par with, if not exceeding the beloved triple A darlings of the industry. As you'd expect there are skill checks locking out certain character builds from particular actions. A great deal of flexibility is afforded to the player in how they choose to roleplay their character and you see the consequences of your actions and attitude reflected throughout the game, with allies becoming enemies and vice versa as you strike out across the continent - you really get a good sense of agency as you progress through the game. There's a good amount of narrative branching, particularly in the second campaign, even if some of it is just for flavour it's incentive to revisit the game and see things play out different at a later date.\n\nMy only gripes with the game are the camera is too close whilst navigating around the map and it only pulls back so far, panning the camera is also more restrictive that I would have liked. Neither of these issues really hampered my experience with the game. I'll be there day one when the developers release a sequel to this; they've more than proven themselves on all fronts.","March 14, 2014","true","49.2"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","68","72","0","2"

It's a strategic RPG that shares gameplay similarities with Heroes of Might & Magic. Except this one is more dialogue and story oriented than building castles and armies. The graphics are pretty simple but it doesn't take away the charm of the adventure one bit! The storytelling is what makes it all interesting. It will constantly require you to make decisions, be it for small matters of social nature or serious issues and military tatics. And it does it so well it makes you feel you're reading an adventure book, even when you fail or makes decision mistakes.\n\nAs you can see on the screenshots, the action part is turn based and takes place on tactical hexa-shaped checker boards. Each unit has its skills, and you better put them to good use during combats or specialize them in order to handle any situation. Strong defensive units, sharpshooters, doctors, fast skirmishers or even tinkers to set traps and covers on the battlefield. It feels very rewarding to win a battle because of a right unit composition, preparation or placement.\n\nThe RPG elements are there too, from a handful of survival skills to large sets of combat abilities you can give to each of your men. And these men and women also have to be chosen carefully! Every NPC in this adventure has its own convictions, interests or goals. The religious companions won't get along very well with the native culture or those who embrace it. The fame-seeking soldiers won't like your diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Some romances might also happen! It will all depend of your choices and how you want to explore the New World. It is your expedition story that is being told, here.\n\nThe only things i could wish from the developpers are more languages support (although it was already very enjoyable in english! But since the game is very text-based, it might be hard for some others to follow), and... SEQUELS! Imagine that game set in the Crusades? or the Silk road? or the Japanese islands discovery? With a good storytelling, these explorations could take place anywhere!","December 15, 2013","true","36.6"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","66","73","0","1"

It is a HARD game with LOADS of text and a dense historical and political context. If you dont enjoy reading walls of text and cant handle defeat stay away from this game.\n\nThat said, I'll list the pros and cons and at the end give my overall opinion:\n\nPros:\n\n- Rich, interesting and unexplored historical setting. For lovers of history (like me) this game came as a refreshing breeze.\n\n- Combat is well developed, complex but fun though it gets repetive over time. But its HARD, especially because the tutorial doesn't cover it very well. It took me about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay to effectively understand how to use the medic in battles and I can't say I mastered all the other 10 classes.\n\n- Beautifully written story and quests that makes you feel involved with the game, with your own character and your companions, thus making the huge walls of text actually a pleasure to enjoy. The writters picked up the historical atmosphere and the political complexities of Precolumbian Mexico really well (apart the female conquistadores, seriously?!). Previous historical knowledge about the Spanish Conquest of Mexico is recommended for the utmost fun though the game presents you very well with the minimum necessary for enjoyment.\n\n- Pretty interesting camping and resource micro-management. Not only the mechanics are very good but it also fits pretty well with the whole setting of the game.\n\n- Your choices DO matter! Not much for the story development in itself but for your party morale (covered in the next item)\n\n- Companions are very well written, each with an unique personality and historical background. This influences the way they will react to your decisions. Managing their different personalities and maintaining an overall high morale is essential for sucess in combat, making party management a vital part of the game. I just missed an option to directly talk to a companion, instead of waiting for random events with or about them to pop up.\n\n- Nice Soundtrack. Not really a masterpiece but fits well with the overall climate.\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics are simple for a 2013 game. I recon this is an indie game with limited budget but in my opinion they really could've been better, especially in the world map.\n\n- As I've said, this game is HARD. One random event or one small mistake in battle or in camp management can ♥♥♥♥ up an entire gameplay. This can be very demotivating for most players and it is especially painful when added to the bad auto-save mechanics.\n\n- Camera movement and trees. You will spend most of your time in the world map and the  top-down camera has its center always locked in your character. This hugely discourage exploring by making it very painful to see things far from your position. Wouldn't be a big deal IF collecting food, herbs etc from the map WASN"T essential to survive (There's a console code that unlocks the camera). Also trees not becoming transparent when you get near them can hide important collectables from your view.\n\n- Bumping into enemies. When walking through the world map, you will sometime bump into an enemy patrol or hunting party. Sometimes you will have the option to not engage them. If you do so, after finishing the event, they still stay in your path and touching them makes the same event pop up again forcing you to fight them or to make a detour for progressing. This is a serious issue as even the easiest looking combat can turn into a complete disaster with one or two small tactical mistakes.\n\n- Autosave: As said, this game is very hard and to add it up the autosave mechanic is very strange. I myself havent yet figured out how it works, so its safer to manually save often. Back in the days of Ultima and Breath of Fire this wouldn't be a flaw, but nowdays, in my opinion, it is.\n\nOverall: Expeditions: Conquistador is a GREAT game for an indie company. It offers a lot of entertainment for it's pricing tag and it was a great efort by the guys at Logic Artists to delivery a solid and enjoyable game. Its cons are hugely surpassed by the pros and makes it a must buy for RPG, turn based combat and/or historical settings fans. Just keep in mind that this game is HARD and has LOTS of text in it before buying.\n\n9/10","September 14, 2015","true","24.1"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","59","65","5","0"

But the challenge helps make up for that.\n- The battles are all premade, which somewhat limits replay value. But many battles have different approaches and you can choose your team.\n- Most of the team members don't have any character-specific dialogue, it's based on their class and/or traits.\n- Managing rations/food processing gets to be a chore, especially if you're giving some people double rations.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fitting and immersive soundtrack, good battle themes.\n- Very good writing, extremely important in a game like this.\n- Meaningful roleplaying choices which affect the resource management, the battles and the endings.\n- Well-balanced difficulty on Normal settings.\n- Good artstyle and tidy presentation. Nothing mindblowing but very fitting for a semi-historical RPG.\n\nSo overall, if you like what you see on the store page and it'll run on your system, get it. I bought it at like 5 times what it costs now that it's bundled and I don't regret it, because it's worth a good bit more than a buck. Looking forward to more Expeditions games, and I know I'll come back to this one sometime.","June 16, 2014","true","31.6"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","0"

The mechanic for this is similar to early Final Fantasy games, in particular FFVII. In the exploration facet, you can collect herbs, treasure and hunt boar as well as other resources with which you can create tools to help in battle. These resources can also be used in a barter system at settlements. New locations can be found in which you can meet new settlements and peoples.\n\nMeeting people is fun as the game provides a multiple choice story driven dynamic. Your choices, how you interact with the natives, determines your fate and how the story evolves. I was really happy with the choice as it involves you much more in the story and really allows you to play how you like. Diplomacy really is an element in the game in terms of which factions you want to eventually align yourself with (if you want to at all).\n\nAs well as multiple choice in dealing with other tribes etc. you must also manage your own crew! You choose your troops at the outset and this is also well done. Each person is given a backstory, general stats and three determining personality attributes i.e. Courageous, Open-Minded, Greedy. The characters all have morale which is affected by your choices in the game - greedy followers would gain morale from stealing from someone for instance while others may lose morale from that.   Therefore your relations with the natives will also have an effect, be it positive or negative, on your troops.\n\nAs mentioned, you harvest herbs, find treasure and hunt boar in the exploration mode but your troops will need to be carefully selected to manage your resources.  Doctors and certain other characters can create medicine from herbs while your hunters can preserve meat. You can also 'tinker' to improve elements such as rate of travel or items whcih will help in battle. Characters can be levelled as you like however. So, there is a lot of mini management involved in the game outside of exploration or battle - one must be strategic. If you make bad strategic decisions the game can be very unforgiving, even on a normal difficulty setting.\n\nFinally, battle! Having explained other elements at some length, I will be brief here - it is essentially turn based strategy. If you have played and enjoyed The Banner Saga or X-Com: Enemy Unknown, you will enjoy this. Fundamentally the mechanic is the same though it is very well done.\n\nI loved this game - 9/10.\n\nVery much hope the developers have a follow up to this in the near future. The system would allow for any theme or universe to be applied - Medieval Europe, Zombie Apocalypse(!), Classical Era (Romans) etc. though I understand the most likely follow up will involve Vikings. It seems the developers want to keep with a 'Expedition' (i.e. coloniser) theme so Zombies are probably out!","July 12, 2014","true","33.1"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","0"

You will explore the land and meet its people as well as would-be conquerors and colonists, gather resources, receive and complete quests and you will even be able to rebuild an old fort as your stronghold. Every turn represents a day during which you will be able to move between 25-40 movement points on the map and then you have to set up camp. During camp you will hunt for food, make medicine, heal wounded or sick team members, and look out for thieves. The combat is also turn-based and can be quite challenging.\n\nThe first 1/4 (roughly) of the game will play in Hispaniola. Consider this an (extended) tutorial. After you finish this, you will be able to move to the mainland which is larger (while not incredibly large). Whether you play a really nice guy, i.e. just map the area and help out where you can, or engage heavily in the struggle between two native realms on the mainland, and play them out against each other, or simply raid and plunder is up to you.\n\nWhile the game has some flaws and limited replayability, it is fun and creates a nice atmosphere. This is partly because the members of your band (around 10 or 12) will react differently to each play style, they will be Spanish or Native, peace-loving or warlike etc. and they have at least one personalized event. The game illustrates that there are sometimes difficult ethical decisions to make. To look for clues from a lost conquistador with limited food and medicine and several wounded team members in a hostile area is also intriguing. One thing is for sure: King Carlos wants you to come back with a lot of money or he will be disappointed!\n\nI will add some hints that will make your start hopefully less frustrating:\n- get 2 doctors, because if you have only one and he is sick, you´re *****ed\n- I also suggest 2 hunters, while 1 scholar should be enough\n- researching the cart upgrade will make you move faster\n- you should not camp on roads but 1-2 tiles left or right from it instead\n- the promoted soldiers give the very useful "stun" bonus\n- you need to get the skull\n- if in doubt, let Ana Vidal charge :)\n\nI fully recommend this game while it is on sale, if the full price of 19,99 is justified I cannot judge.\n\nAll in all: Yruenes is kind of cute! Ana Vidal, on the other hand, can fight! 9/10!","October 25, 2014","true","31.3"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","43","48","0","0"

Exploration is first and foremost a conquerer's act - over nature herself, if not the natives who inevitably resist the tides of change. I was a soldier, with senses long inured to the stench of blood, and I chose my companions accordingly. I needed grim warriors. None pious. We were not missionaries. I wanted the aggressive sorts, those fueled by bloodlust and goldlust. Nevermind I found their racism and greed distasteful. They were exactly what would be necessary in the heart of the jungle.\n\nMy choices proved apt, as Mexico was as treacherous as I feared. In those wild lands, we were alone. My predecessor, a man commanding a force of hundreds, had come here and vanished. He had made mistakes. I knew I could afford none.\n\nWhen my servants rebelled, I slew them to a man. I would not have them slitting our throats as we slept. After defeating a native patrol, I might have spared them. These young men and women were only defending their lands from strangers in shining armor. I left none alive, none to report back to their village about our arms, numbers, and tactics.\n\nAgain and again, I had to face the hard choice between surrendering my tactical advantage and attempting a diplomatic solution. Always I chose to strike swiftly and decisively. Yes I killed where peace might have availed me. But what if it had not? What if those peaceful overtures had led to ambush? I had a duty to my soldiers. They looked to me to keep them alive. That is what I did.\n\nYet the land soon began to work its magic on me. There was a vivacity here that could not be found in Spain's stone streets. The people possessed an earthly wisdom and a refreshingly naive curiosity. Many welcomed us openly, asking about our ways and our lands. They were, it turns out, not so different from us, finding joy in a good meal and a bountiful harvest.\n\nWe found common ground with the Totonac peoples, and sided with them in their rebellion against the Aztecs, true barbarians whose temples ran slick with the blood of pagan sacrifice. I allowed the Totonac Chieftain's teenage daughter, Anacaona, into my group to serve as translator. She stayed by my side throughout. I taught her to wield sword, spear, and musket. I shared our language and our ways. She was ever eager to listen to my stories, and each night as we camped in the swamps and jungles, I told her of past battles. Her eyes shone with the fires of these remembered glories, and a hope for her own.\n\nOf all of us, she was the truest and best adventurer. It was she who translated the glyphs on a golden gateway and led us into the legendary El Dorado, that shining City of Gold. It was she who manuevered through the temple of death's diabolical traps, braving a pit of snakes to uncover mounds of treasure. Without her, we would never have found the Fountain of Eternal Youth, which spring must have originated in Heaven itself.\n\nAh, Anacaona. She became the daughter I had always wanted.\n\nIt must have broke her heart when, following our triumphant battle over the Aztec Empire, I turned on her father and slew him in the same garden I had killed the Emperor. I know it broke mine when she chose him over me.\n\nI buried her with mine own hands, outside Tenochtitlan, its plundered temples and palaces alit with devilish infernos.\n\nI had been given a duty and an obligation, and I had fulfilled it to my utmost. I returned home with every companion but she still alive. Our ship held such treasure that it bobbed low in the water, our hold bursting with plundered gems. The king welcomed me home a hero, bestowing upon me lands and titles. My ambitions fulfilled.\n\nYet as I sit on my estate, watching the sun plunge beneath my tamed fields, I discover that somewhere along the way, my ambitions had changed. The jungle had transmuted them. The glory, the riches, the titles: all hollow now. I would give them all in order to go back and make a different decision. To choose the path of peace, so that Anacaona might have lived.\n\nAs a child, I thought the title Conquistador a grand one and never imagined I would hold it. As an old man, I carry it with a heavy heart. I will take it with me to the grave. Murderer. Betrayer. Conquistador.","April 17","true","28.6"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","29","31","3","3"

I may only have played E:C for 4 hours but in all of my 25+ years of gaming I have not come across such a game. Kudos to the developers! A heady blend of RPG, Turn based combat and exploration unlike any out there in the market. What really shines through, though, is the text intensive interactions between You and each party member. The conversations, although scripted, has enough choices to make the story seem seamless. I'm really looking forward to playing more of this and any similar efforts from this Dev team.\n\nEdit: I've had more playtime on this game and so far it has been challenging even on 'Normal' level. My biggest problem has been keeping my men (and women!) happy, motivated, disease free and in fighting order. The moment any of the party members get even mildly hurt or sick he or she cannot perform ANY of the Camp chores and this leaves the party shorthanded, especially if you find yourself in areas where the threats (either from the natives or thieves) are HIGH. This often leads to frustration when your carefully husbanded resources disappear overnight. I also feel that the Healing process is well implemented though probably too realistic and very taxing on Medicine supplies.

The game's mechanics are very similar to heroes of might and magic (more akin to King's Bounty - I, however never played this game), but instead of controlling castles and creature growth, you control a single hero and must explore the new world in order to obtain resources and riches, make alliances with locals and explore many sites.\n\nThe story of the game is very compelling. Although most of it is text-based, without voice acting (well, this is an indie game, not a high budged AAA title), the writing is very well done. The choices you make affect the world you're exploring and also influence your companions attitudes. Depending on your choices, you can be ruthless, greedy, peaciful, just etc, all according to your playing style.\n\nAll characters' stories are unique, although the character interaction occurs randomly and sparingly. Some of the quest-related companions are more colorful and tend to have more "screentime" than your normal characters. Most, however, tends to disappear after their related quests complete.\n\nThe combat is very balanced and most units have its own advantages and disadvantages. Most of the time, however, I used almost the same party, a composition of soldiers, hunters and a healer. Soldiers acts as your tanks, absorving damage and delivering high melee damage. Hunters do little damage, but are very flexible tactically and can be used for quickly disposing the enemy healers. Sometimes I could experience some other party combinations, using scouts and native troops, but my first lineup seemed to be sufficient to win most battles. Some units are just weird to use, such as scholars. The native troops are very interesting and have very unique strategies related to them. The amazon unit, for example, are exceptional damage dealers but can absorve very little damage.\n\nThe only weakness of this system is the AI. sometimes it makes very stupid decisions such as having its healer to seek one of your soldiers on the battlefield and fight him in melee or running wildly through your units provoking atacks of opportunity. Most of the time, however, it makes reasonable decisions such as seeking your weakest units to kill first, and looking for flanks and sneak atacks. I believe the AI performed much better during ambushes than in traditional battles - the first ones were very difficult while the others very easy. But considering how difficult is to program a good game AI and comparing to other available titles, this game performs well.\n\nOverall, the tactical part of the game is very well made, and if you are a tactical junkie like me, you will just love it.\n\nThe party management mechanics is nice, all characters must do some task in order to obtain food and other resources. After some hours, however, this party management becomes a chore, since it requires a lot of micro management, or you will end up consuming a lot of food or having your goods stolen.\n\nIn summary, expeditions conquistador is a very good indie game, delivering a high quality experience  with a short budget. The story is very nice but character development could be improved. The tactics part of the game is very enjoyable, while the party management is a bit repetitive.","December 1, 2013","true","58.1"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

Meanwhile you have to keep your team fed and motivated, which is easier said than done, sinc literally EVERYONE has their agendas, desires, expectation, religious views etc. Combat is handled very much a la "Blackguards". Their is a very nice element of improving through experiences, with a well thought out  skill tree (different for each specialty).

(I do not remember RPG about the Spanish conquest of America).\nPlaying Expeditions: Conquistador really feel like a pioneer of new worlds. Excellent writing descriptions of events and locations, quests (sometimes feel like the game is not a the video game - this is dungeon and dragons game). Battle system very similar to the combat system of dungeon and dragons.\nAmong the shortcomings can be identified too passive protagonist actually does become  de facto "talking head". In the battle  protagonist did not participate too.\nIt is also unclear why  developers decided to limit the battle by only 6 members,  while the game has 5 classes in battle using only a maximum of 2-3. One could for instance with the  passage game, expand battle map and add the number of soldiers in the combat.\nWhile in the game use a historical setting, for the sake of balance developers equalized all parameters in classes,  for example  Aztec and Spanish fighters has  no distinction. Dont be surprised when you see same damage from iron  and oak swords, or the same protection from iron  and leather armor. As the de facto all the basic classes same as Spain and the natives, victory in battle will bring correct command, upgrades and the choice of classes in combat.\nIn the battle conquistadors do not use horses and pistols (probably forgotten them in Spain :)))\n\n7.5/10","January 16","true","61.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

This is just my subjective opinion of the game.\n\nWhile this is not a random or procedurally generated game, where you could get endless replay value, it is intriguing enough that I have replayed the story a couple of times, making somewhat different decisions within the relatively linear story. While the game does not force the player to solve the story in a fixed sequence of steps, but instead allows free wondering through Hispaniola and Mexico, the main plot is still fairly linear. However it's how you'll handle that plot, where the devil lies. Will you be humane or genocidal? Treacherous or fair? The game neither rewards nor punishes either style of gameplay. It is up to you to decide whether you will murder a native village or trade with it, and your "dirty dozen" squad of conquistadors will have different opinion on your actions, resulting in their morale going up and down. And should it go down too much, you could end up with a rebellion on your hands...\n\nBut it's the tactical turn-based combat where the game really shines. Many complain it's too hard or too arbitrary, but I wholeheartedly disagree with them. It's a bit like a chess game with figures that don't always do exactly what you want them to, except it's entirely different. :)\n\nWhen it's your turn you can select any one of your troopers and tell them where to go and who to attack. When you've moved all, the enemy gets to do the same. Not unlike XCOM, only done better in my opinion. Cover matters, positioning matters, outfitting your troopers with weapon and armour improvements matter, perks matter, battlefield traps and barricades matter, who to attack first and why matters. And pulling off a good defence or difficult attack is really satisfying and makes you feel good about yourself.\n\nI am a typical save-scummer and will never click the "Iron man" campaign selection. I will replay the same battle many times in order to try out different tactical outcomes and combinations. But my aim isn't to save-scum to win the game as effectively as possible, but to extend the game as long as possible while getting the most enjoyable fights out of it. I finished the campaign once, then started it again, then just finished the first part of the game, then restarted it again, wanting to do some quests and battles from a different perspective, using different units and tactics.\n\nThe one shortcoming of the game, which is the main reason why I do this is, it's too short. The Hispaniola and Mexico campaigns combined, if you don't rush them, will give you some 30-40 hours of fun. An additional Inca campaign DLC would have been nice, but the devs said there's not gonna be one. A modding tool has been released which allows people to create additional plot twists and random events within the main campaigns, but I haven't seen anything available for download and play yet.\n\nIf you're into well thought out tactical games this one is for you.","January 29, 2015","true","95.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The strategy/combat, while maybe not Xcom, is satisfying enough. The story, resource/ally management, and variety of interesting choices add a great deal of depth.\nThere is a stronger relationship to your followers than in most games of this genre. Each recruitable character has distinct personality traits which will support or clash with your in-game decisions. There's incentive to keep your followers happy, but some are much easier than others.\nOne interesting example is Bonita Blanco, a hunter with 2 somewhat contradictory traits: "Peaceful", and "Racist". Since many choices in this game are simple cases of "kill or spare" whatever Aztec savages you may be dealing with, she can be a difficult gal to please. If you kill the savage, her racism is appeased, but her peaceful nature disappointed, resulting in +1/-1 morale. As you might guess, sparing the savage has the opposite effect, yet both ultimately produce no change in her morale. So how did I satisfy her unnecessarily difficult personality? Food!\nGiving a unit double rations has a chance of boosting morale. My Bonita Blanco was so fat, she occupied 4 hexagons at once.","September 30, 2014","true","51.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","9","11","6","0"

Expeditions: Conquistador is far more than a reskinned King’s Bounty, exploring a historical moment with confidence and skill. The combat system is effective and while some aspects of management become a chore, the focus on stories and characters means that there is almost always at least one interesting plot on the boil. The maps will be the same if I play again, so I doubt I’ll revisit but if there are more Expeditions to come, I’ll certainly pack a bedroll and hop on board.\n\nRPG/Strategy/Turnbase-\nthe game breaks down into four parts: exploration of the map, turn-based combat, party management and roleplay. It’s in the latter that the game finds much of its quality, offering meaningful choices during well-written dialogue, and decisions that have a bearing on the world, and characters’ relationships and concerns. The RPG aspects feed back into party management and while there is levelling, equipment and skills are doled out from a mass of shared resources, which diminishes the tales of personal progression. Equipment, particularly, is odd. Rather than finding items out in the jungle or buying them, upgrades are a numbered resource, which can then be applied to characters, moving their belongings up through the tiers that relate to their profession.\n\nBad...(just my opinion..)\n- Wish game longer..(Where the DLC? )\n-only 2 Map(this include prolouge map..)\n-Racist NUN!","October 21, 2014","true","38.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The gameplay, the story, the art, the sound - it's all done so well.\n\nThe game sets you up with a backstory which isn't unique to each time you start up the game from what I've been able to tell, but it's written well enough to support the rest of the story. Soon after the game starts, you must choose your crew members for your expedition that each bring different skills to your campaign as well as three character traits that vary from peaceful, aggressive, cautious, pious, racist, etc.\n\nAs a general tip, choosing expedition members that are similar will make your game easier, considering that a lot of the choices you make along the way will favor certain character traits above others, which will either boost or lower your individual members' morale depending on which choice you made. I ended up choosing a varied group that made the game a bit harder. On one of my saves, I had a mutiny due to the choices I made and just some general bad luck.\n\nThe game does a great job with presenting you different choices along the way that feel authentic, with very little circumstances where the choices didn't matter or felt like there was only one "real" choice the whole time, as is often the case with games of this type. There are no true "right" choices, especially when dealing with groups that are either pious or racist, and later on in the game you will actually have to think about some choices because either way you're going to have a bad time dealing with the political consequences.\n\nI found the combat to be simple, and completely engaging. The majority of your battles will deal with 6 of your expedition members. Each battle proceeds the same way, usually: you are notified that you may "begin battle"; you must choose 6 individuals for this battle, with the ability to move equipment around and read their stats before you make your selection; you *may* have a preparation phase depending on the circumstance where you can set up traps on the board, or position your units in more advantageous ways; your turn is usually first, and is played by A) moving your units if you choose and B) Attacking with your units if you choose; then the opposing force has their similar turn; you do this until you either win, lose, or surrender; after which, you will have to treat your wounded individuals with your doctors and whatever medicine you have available. It’s worth noting that you don’t actually lose units in battle. Instead, you lose them from your inability to treat them afterward.\n\nI haven’t finished the game, but so far it is completely engaging and fun. My expedition has a total of 14 members so far, and I believe I may keep it at this level because it *right* at the line of being too much of a drag on resources while still being able to achieve a lot via their character abilities.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Amazing Art\n+ Great Story\n+ Fun/Addicting Gameplay\n+ Difficult, especially in the beginning\n+ AWESOME level design - very creative ways they implemented different battle scenarios.\n+ Great UI design, with tooltips available to almost everything in the game, which was a great way to keep the player informed with all sorts of data without creating a cluttered UI.\n\nCons:\n\n- The only thing I can really say if I HAD to be critical, is that it feels "indie" only during the few cutscenes they had. Instead of moving animation, they were still graphics with subtitles. They could have made these parts more engaging just by adding sound, music, and acted dialogue. However, there have only been 3 (more or less) of these cutscenes so far, and the rest of the game is so well done that it doesn't feel like an indie game at all when it matters.\n- I would've liked to see more sidequests. This may be a plus or a negative depending on how you see it. The game creates an engaging story for the main campaign, but neglects any sidequests. I only bring this to attention because it says "RPG" as one of the tags, so it is worth noting.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nWould highly recommend to anyone who likes turn-based games, especially if you are a pre-Columbian era/European colonization history buff.\n","October 12, 2015","true","45.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The rules are sort of unique due to mainly melee-oriented combat, and you will find quite a few of challenges to overcome\n\n- Setting and story\nThe not-so-popular Age of Discovery setting is great not simply because it is fresh, but the game does a lot to really engage you in atmosphere and spirit of those days. The story is also quite interesting, not the usual 'kill the arch-demon' type.\n\n- Role-playing\nYou will really have choices to make, and you will face the consequences. You can be the conquer-the-savages type, or you can try and be more tolerant (maybe even too tolerant by the 16th century). The followers characters are sadly not unique, but defined by a number of traits. Nevertheless, you will have to deal with them having their own opinion.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- 3D graphics\nThis is an indie game, but I still think that the 3D world and animations are mediocre. The combat is a bit better. 2D art is good though\n\n- Interface\nMainly the adventure interface can be frustrating. Limited camera, bad pathfinding sometimes and the annoying bug when you're near POI but instead of interacting with it the game sends you to a journey around it.\n\nStill, I had a great time in this game. With King's Bounty not available on Linux, Expeditions: Conquistador is a nice replacement.\n\n","December 27, 2014","true","38.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You also have a lot of room to customize your team, which is much larger than a typical RPG party and gives you a lot of flexibility.  Upgrades offer customization but in general there are some obviously-superior options and others that you'd never take in a million years.\n\nThe story lags a bit towards the end if you've clear-cut the map, and the end-game is a bit anticlimactic - you have potentially changed the geopolitical landscape and it just doesn't register as deeply as it should.  However, there is a wide array of stuff to find, and if you are someone who *doesn't* try to find everything, then you will probably finish the game well before it overstays its welcome.\n\nSignificant downsides are that the gameplay gets very repetitive, and mechanics are clunky.  At times this feels like a video game about text-based, micro-managed camping and foraging, which is not exciting.  Movement is a slog, and the camera angles are locked in so tightly that it makes long-distance travel require a lot of scrolling back and forth on the screen.  Combat is pretty weak and can be laborious.\n\nThe story and setting are great, though, the developers are mining very thought-provoking and educational territory, and those are what rescue this from a thumb down.  However, for any spinoffs, they really need to upgrade the mechanics and gameplay, they are serious liabilities, and they got old quickly.\n\n\nGAME ADVICE:\n\nBring at least 2 Doctors, you can get random events that leave a team member injured, and you could probably get stuck in a tough spot if this was either right after or right before a difficult fight that sidelined your best fighters.\n\nSword/shield is a great general skill for everyone, including Doctors - you can passively block a lot of damage with a shield!\n\nI never deployed a Scout or Scholar in combat and it went just fine.  Usually I went 1 Doctor, 2 Ranged, and the rest Melee.  If I remember correctly there were a small number of fights with 4 team members and I either went 1 or 0 Ranged in the crew (but ALWAYS a Doctor).  I preferred Sword/Shield by a wide margin, but I had a few Pike-based fighters because they were philosophically compatible, and because one was an Amazon (and they are mobile widowmakers).\n\nOh yeah, make sure when you pick your team at the beginning that you don't mix and match too many party members with conflicting philosophies, unless you want to manage dissent and mutiny.","January 26, 2015","true","50.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Game has interesting plot, you can learn some facts/myths concerning spanish conquest and motives that conquistadors were driven by. It puts you in front of moral dilemmas, so you can choose how you resolve different situations, meaning by violence or diplomatically. In spite of that, game is quite linear and as a result replayability is limited. It could have more side quests. Soundtrack fits well to entire game. Combat system is poor in comparison to for example Age of Wonders 2. I mean there are not many tactical moves you can perform. I know it's quite different game in terms of world and reality but genre is the same. I don't mind you have to fight with enemy that overwhelms you in numbers, but you should have possibility to deploy to battle more units, regarding you have more than 10 under your command. Six is little funny number comparing to other strategy games. I know that muskets and arquebuses were quite inaccurate, but if unit is taking aim at another one that stands next to it and it misses most of the time in spite of the fact, game shows 70% chance of hitting the target, sth is wrong about that. It doesn't apply hunters and trappers who are designated for ranged combat but other classess that possess ranged weapon have extremely poor chance to hit enemy. In spite of those few pitfalls, game is worth playing, especially if you're fan of turn-based strategy games and want to feel like explorer in new world for once.","February 4, 2015","true","69.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is a turn based strategy game,with a main line compaign similar to M&M hereos serie. All types of units have its unique level tree, which is similar to that of Enemy Within/Enemy unknown. The plot is the same as the title describes: to explore the new world with your squad. All you team members have their traits, some are brave, others may be caustious. All your choices will change their attitude towards you and some of them will eventually get furious and leave you.\n\nOverall,  its a nice turn based strategy game, better than blackguard in my view.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/louskrad/recommended/237430/","louskrad","LouskRad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/louskrad/","3216 products in account","A "Turn based strategy RPG"; this game has a heroes/disciples style travel and tactical combat system, combined with rpg elements of a progressing party (a la X-com) and with a focus on story and choicemaking (a la fallout, etc). This ambitious combination, furthermore, is executed within a very accurate (well, mostly) historical setting and a very intriguing narrative. The immersion level of this game is simply amazing, and the fun factor of its gameplay parallels this quality. It has been a while since I've seen one from the "tactical RPG" genre this well executed, so I'm not kidding when I say this game deserves to be in the same shelves with the classics of the genre. (Yes, I've got the original fallout(s), and x-com in mind).\n\nThe soundtrack is addictive, the graphics are immersive, and the story is vey interesting. From romance options to various decisions you make, choices have important effects on both your followers (the party) and the shaping of the story - which in turn increases the immersion further.\n\nI really can't find much of a negative aspect to say. Bugs are near non-existent, replayabilty is there. The only thing I can think of for the moment, and that is only for the Steam version, is that the (Steam) achievement system is somewhat bugged, resulting in achivements sometimes not registering until you reboot the game. I'm pretty sure it will be fixed in an upcoming patch.\n\nOne last thing to mention (again, for the Steamers): while I was browsing the forums for this game, I saw that the developers are very active; they engage in discussions, provide help and are awesome people.\n\nI find it surprising actually that this game is so underrated and underheard of as the awesome game it is.","January 12, 2014","true","129.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's done well. It's never pages and pages of reading where I get bored and start to skim. It's just the right amount and done mostly as dialogue so it immerses you in charcter rather than a random narrator. This is an important balance that many modern "throw-back" rpg's don't do well.\n\nThe turn-based battle is done well with the shoot/attack them when they move idea. Keep the doctor and ranged units safe. I feel like i saw this in Jagged Alliance but that was 15 years ago so I'm glad it's back. I'm a save ♥♥♥♥♥. I failed my first battle and re-did it, but I see I got 50 points of XP either way. It was just my self-esteem that took a hit so I had to reload. I like that it's not eay and you have to plan well. This game really has strategy, you can't rush in. SO many of the newer turn-based games are basically over power with the highest tech style. This game has battles that require thinking, planning, and timing. Well done. Although only a few battles in I see it as 4 soldiers, 1 hunter, 1 doctor. Is there a better strategy? Perhaps when I level a scholar or scout they might have skills to use that overcome the damage of a soldier. One thing I would like to see is larger maps, the ability to see the move limit on enemies.\n\nSo it's an RPG STrategic tactical turn based game with elements of survival, plus exploration.\n\nTo the DEVS: I only know this game because I just discovered steams "suggestions for you". I took a look at Citadels but the reviews were so horrible I couldn't bare to get it even for 5 bucks. I hit the suggestions button again today to find that it's on sale. Why not advertise a bit? Get people talking. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT INDIE GAME. This is what indie games should strive for, and at a discount at 5 bucks which is too low IMO you could pull in many more people.\n\nWell best of luck to all, I only have a few hours in and maybe it gets boring but there's many a $60 AAA purchase that I've found less fun. If it never played again I've gotten already my $5 dollars worth.","March 19, 2014","true","31.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It has a compelling storyline, great atmosphere and challenging TB battles. But what makes this game so special is that you are not running from  battle to battle, as a matter of fact you can avoid battle a lot if you want, but the building and sustaining of your team everynight at the campsite is the part that's different and most fun. That is when you keep morale up and hand out chores for obtaining food or healing or researching or making traps and so on. Also you give out food rations and talk to team members sometimes. Everything has a consequence: if you decide to attack a tribe than maybe your peaceful team members will lose moral or if you are too cautious then your adventurous team members will lose moral, then there's pious ones, altruistic ones, narcissistic, courageous etc. Every member has three traits that determine how he/she will react to your actions.

The main problem is that your characters tend to miss more than 7 out of 10 attacks when they have a hit chance at 80% or more.  The enemy characters make 9 out of 10 attacks with a hit chance at 80% or more.  This can make you lose battles that on paper you should win.  For me this made me lose interest in the game very quickly as I lost way more battles than I won.  Overall this was a poor attempt at making a game set in the Spanish exploration in America.

I hope there is gonna more of it.\n\n+ The story is interesting enough.  I like how you're not out to save the world.  In fact, what you're out to do is pretty much up to you.  I also like the historical setting.  This particular setting is not that often explored and they haven't been shy about it and didn't fel in the total PCness or gentle savage BS.\n\n+ The narration is good.  Except for some voice acting (which is good btw) at the start and at the end, it's all text.  Fortunately, it is  not badly written.\n\n+ The character you choose on your team matters.  Really.  Not only for their stats but also for their personality.  They all have qualities and flaws and you'll have to deal with it.  Really.  Some character won't get along or won't agree with your course of action.  This is a really intersting mechanics and it is well implemented.\n\n+ They make you care about the character on your team.  Because they have a personality and will react to your decision you will grow to love them.  Or in some case, hate them.  I could have added this to the previous point but, it is so good, I had to make another point for this.\n\n+ The choice you make have consequences and some of those choice are mutualy exclusive.  This is not a game where you'll be able to see everything in one playthrough. Also, the consequences of your choices are not always obvious and I personnaly enjoy the subtility.  Something something is gonna reward you, or come back to bite you, futher down the line and you might have not expect it. This also means the game has a good replay value.  You might want to try one game where you're a do-gooder diplomat and one where you're an evil tyrant.\n\n+ Multiple endings that account for what you've done throuought the game.  Not only for one or two choice at the end but also things that might have seemed not so important at first.\n\n+ Team management during exploration with random events.  You have to make sure everybody can eat, that food doesn't go bad, that injured people get healed and you can research some techonologies.  Your teammember can also get hurts during hunting, or  your cart can break and you loose your movement for the day or, you can get attacked during the night.  And those attacks can be really though.\n\n- There is not enough variety of random events and you often see the same one coming over and over again.  At one point, they lose their magic.\n\n- You can solve the team micro-management.  At some point, when you have enough competent member on your team, you'll have it figured it out.  The injured will be healed, everybody is gonna be well fed, medicine and traps will be produced, etc.  May be there could have been a little more strugle there.\n\n+ Comabts where stategy matters.  Fights can get tough, you have to think and use your skills to overcome.  Not only you will to choose a good team for the fight but you'll also have to use the environement and, if you can, prepare the battlefeild (with baricade and traps).\n\n+ The game doesn't necessarily scale to your progression.  You can venutre and encounter groups of enemy way stronger than you currently are.  And you probably will. And get your ♥♥♥ kicked.\n\n+ Loosing a fight is not the end of the world.  Even some important fight in the storyline can be lost.  The game will account for it but there is no game over screen.  Adjust to the defeat and carry on.\n\n+ Land exploration is not just to get to one point to the others.  You can find stuff.  Not only treasure but also quest, ally, ressource and even village.  It doesn't feel like you're just going through; ou have to explore and discover. And finding your way is not always easy.\n\n- A lot of quest have you go around from point a to point b.  Those are fine when point b is new to you  but when it's a place you already visited, and you have go do a lot of back and forth, it can get boring.\n\n+ Music is good and appropriate.\n\n- Sounds effect are not that great.\n\n- Graphics and animation are not the best. Also, the whole color palette is really bland.  I guess they were going for something more realistic but I wish they would have opted for more saturated colours.\n\n- There is no enough of it.   Ok, this is not a real objection.  My first playthrought took me about 23h.  Pretty decent for a 20$ game.  But seriously...\n\n- The map is a little small.  May be, once again it is just that I want more but, at first, the world seem really vast then, you realize it is no so.\n\nThat's about it.   I hope this will help you make an informed decision.\n\nFinal score: 8.5/10","March 9, 2014","true","25.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The presentation and interface of the game is sort of iffy, but the voice work is good and the writing is even better. The developers obviously read up a lot on the period and made really thoughtful decisions about how to present the period. When you study history for a living you generally don't have high expectations for games and movies covering the area you read so much about, so when something comes along that goes above and beyond the norm in doing a really great job, you want to tell everyone about it.

It's a really nice combination of RPG and Strategy gameplay elements. As the name of the game suggests, the background is the historical event of the spanish expedition to America.

Its an indepth tactical turn based RPG. And you are a Capitan of a conquistador squad. You choose your squad, and everyone has a background, personality, likes/dislikes ect. So say someone who is Courageous might lose morale if you run, but the Cautious guys would like it. Or if you see natives performing a religious ritual, and ask them about it and leave them be,  the Pious and Racist people wouldn't like it. (I don't allow Racist people in my group. F'n bigots!)Then you set off for high adventure. Movement is similar to HoMM, where you have a set # of steps a turn, then you must camp. During camp, you must feed your guys and assign them tasks, and random things can happen. Battles are similar to Fallout 2/Tactics.

A hex-based tactics game wrapped in Heroes of Might and Magic style exploration. Framing this is a liberal, but just recreation of a time period with a morality that so quickly becomes alien to that which we know today. I love the way the most expendable of characters have their own personalities and motivations, which come to clash frequently and often violently. This game understands that humans cannot be so easily classified into good and evil, and even trying your best to be the good guy, you are forced to make choices which reveal some real ugliness buried within. Play the villain, on the other hand, and nobody will be on your side, the game becoming harder in very subtle ways. It's very rare that I feel as though I am actually playing a role in a "Role Playing Game" but Expeditions provides this feeling above all else. You're forced to be someone other than what you know yourself to be and have to deal with the consequences and failures and victories of that person. The choices are so well integrated into the game's actual game system (with loyalty and injuries) that you never feel like any choices are just throw away choices. You know that one click could be the difference between a safe escape or half your crew being wounded and having to scramble for medicine. Between a victory or a mutiny.\n\nIt's a damn good game, and anyone looking for a good RPG should consider it.","March 16, 2014","true","43.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The combat piece is nothing new, but the depth of storyline and intra-party interactions are top notch.  The development of the story does a great job of putting things in a historical content while still allowing the user to dictate the course of that history.  The personalities of each party member selected vary drastically, even past their contribution to combat and camp activities (which, ironically, can be a bit on the generic side).  The party mix and user choices drastically affect how the game unfolds.  Although the stagnant maps can seem to limit the replay value, the potential of learning more of each potential party member helps to make up for that.

Wonderful writing, a feeling of freedom in terms of choices and approach, plenty of choices that seem to matter - love the hundreds of little decisions this game requires. In all, this game has completely sucked me in, in a way that I haven't been in a long time; Wasteland 2 might be the only game I can say that has recently pulled me in like this has.\n\nThere is a learning curve here, and there doesn't appear to be too much out there in terms of guides/tutorials in english. This matters obviously in terms of the learning curve, but also because not all of the reactions based on character types are at-all obvious (sometimes they are, but still, I found myself surprised by negative party responses on a couple of different occassions). In any event, I found that just jumping in and playing through the initial learning curve was quite doable, even if it requires a restart. This isn't a paradox type game where you literally might not know what to do to start. The map movement is a little clunky as well, but given just how wonderful this game seems to be it is completely forgivable.

The art is great, music is awesome and plot is very interesting. You can learn quite a lot about the New World around in XV and XVI century.\n\nQuests are fun and doesn't leave you with this bad aftertaste of being repetitive. Characters have their own classes and small sub-plots that enrich the experience and actually makes you like them easy. Difficulty level can be adjusted to your personal preference and strategy vets can really feel the necessity to make important decisions pretty much on the spot.\n\nI'd only wish this game showed the fall of Aztec civilization and evil doing of player's expedition more explicitly in art instead of written description (fall of Aztec Empire was a dark time).\n\nOn the tactical level, Expeditions: Conquistador provides player with interesting battles that can be often approached in different ways and player needs to keep his expedition in shape and manage the risks coming with leading his party into deeps of the jungle as many risks await for him there...\n\nIn overall, I give it a clear 9/10 score.

Once you have them figured out, it's easy to use them, but you need to be smart with how you train your crew members\n-Character personality. Although the characters don't get involved with story as much as i would like them to, you do get to know them pretty, especially when you read their backround.\n-Build your own expedition team! Choose the characters YOU WANT.\n-Decision making. Many of the decisions you make greatly effect the story as well as the situations you find yourself in.\n\nNow about the negative stuff:\n-Many enounters are roughly the same. THIS DOES NOT ruin the experience or make it less fun, but it would be a nice addition. Most of the battle maps that you fight in are small,. You cannot be very strategic without barricades & traps which are hard to come by BUUUUUUT, the same makes up for it with it's unique design and terrain. You can use rocks, buildings and other things to hide behind, and use for ambush points! Conclusion: The game doesn't offer the most strategy that it could, but it still offers a lot.\n-If you lose ONE FLIPPING BATTLE, it greatly effects you to a huge extent. To the point that you will want to reload your last save. When you lose, all your troops get injured and you CANNOT use them in battle... So, all your weak guys are left, and the enemy you lost to will attack you again.\n\n\n\nIn the end, it is still a fun game so long as you play it correctly. I have played almost 20 hours, and am still not finished. That's $1 an hour... That's pretty good.\n","September 25, 2014","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player can often choose to get along with the locals, or help some groups.  Someone in the group is going to be unhappy every choice, though, so keeping up morale is interesting.  Camping is a constant juggling act of roles -should one hunter guard and beef up security?  This reduces the risk of bad things like thieves stealing rations or equipment, but also reduces the chance of the hunting party bringing home food!  The content is great though fairly short, and there are very few random battles.  I wasn't able to build up a truly awesome group before winning, and without any randomness, replay is limited.

There feels to be a generally lacking department as far as the battles go.  I've only just finished the first area of the game and moved onto the second, but it feels the same and its getting really boring for me personally.  Battles almost always play out the same, with only a few differences being when you have to outlast a certain amount of turns, but generally I do the same thing every battle as it seems to be the only way to get through them sensibly.\n\nThat being said, the choices presented in this game through party selection as well as ways to approach encounters with both foes and friendlies alike is some of the best I've encountered in a while.\n\nI say give this game a chance, maybe you won't find the combat to get too repetitive for you.  I'm going to personally continue this game and perhaps the combat will continue feeling dull to me, but I feel like I need to complete the game just to see how the story plays out.

Count me in. It's really a pity that instead of beating the nazis for the zillionth time, we aren't often given the opportunity to play games set in other very interesting eras, such as this one. I generally mistrust all these crowd-funded projects that have been trending lately. But the setting and style convinced me to give this game a shot when it was on sale. 30 or so hours of playing later, I'm happy I did.\n\nDespite obvious similarities to HoMM on the campaign map, the setting and its heavier RP elements help it make its mark. The story is loosely based on the actual events of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and is quite compelling. The game allows you to choose the path you want to follow and how you will interact with your troops and NPCs. You can be a friend of the common soldier, or a distant general. You can be a ruthless conqueror, or a friend to the natives. You can be an ally to the Aztecs or their scourge. And so on.\n\nMoving on to the tactical part now, the game offers a combat system which is both tactical and hard. The game has a finite and pre-determined number of battles. Which on one hand means that quite some attention was paid to them individually. On the other hand, there is only so many different ways you can play the same battle before you get bored of it. It would have been interesting to see what the combat system could do, if the game included completely random battles as well.\n\nFocusing some more on the negatives, it generally feels that the game lacks polish. There are several bugs and it becomes quickly obvious that it sorely needed more funding and work. There is also the question of content touched upon when talking about battles earlier. To put it simply: I wanted more. I'm not implying that the game is short, at least by modern standards it isn't. But by the time I finished the game I haven't had my fill yet. I felt that the game could give much more than it did.\n\nStill I will recommend this game. It hasn't really made me a believer as far as crowd-funded projects go. But at least it showed me that even in such projects, there are good ideas that can actually make decent games. I certainly hope the team will have better luck financing their next project.\n\nVerdict: Buy on sale.","August 30, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's got a board-game-ish feel, and it's one of those games that I can see people thinking is boring due to it's slow movement and pretty much being entirely based on exploration. There are really two games in my opinion that dance the line of being boring and being absolutely amazing; Expedition: Conquistador, and Sid Meier's Civilization. Civilization has long been one of my favourite games, and now this game has rocketed it's way to being right up there as well. There are some things that could have been polished better and it could be a bit smoother sometimes, but that's all visual stuff, and I feel either some patches or possibly (hopefully) a sequel with iron out and make this game perfect.

Wonderful writing, a feeling of freedom in terms of choices and approach, plenty of choices that seem to matter - love the hundreds of little decisions this game requires. In all, this game has completely sucked me in, in a way that I haven't been in a long time; Wasteland 2 might be the only game I can say that has recently pulled me in like this has.\n\nThere is a learning curve here, and there doesn't appear to be too much out there in terms of guides/tutorials in english. This matters obviously in terms of the learning curve, but also because not all of the reactions based on character types are at-all obvious (sometimes they are, but still, I found myself surprised by negative party responses on a couple of different occassions). In any event, I found that just jumping in and playing through the initial learning curve was quite doable, even if it requires a restart. This isn't a paradox type game where you literally might not know what to do to start. The map movement is a little clunky as well, but given just how wonderful this game seems to be it is completely forgivable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/recommended/237430/","jadziatuvok","Nicholas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jadziatuvok/","763 products in account","This is a very tentative positive recommendation, since Valve did not see fit to allow neutral reviews.\n\nThe first impressions of this game are outstanding. Starting by choosing a group with contrasting characteristics emphases the strategy which will have to be employed in making decisions throughout the game. Getting into the game itself, you are met with lush visuals, quality writing, some genuinely interesting strategic and moral decisions with branching results and nice music. There are lovely little touches, such as echos to sound effects when combat is in a confined area.\n\nOver time, though, flaws emerge. Combat is the major one, being a significant part of the game. It is remarkably difficult and frustrating - not through particularly clever AI (indeed, it can be quite dumb, including soldiers standing still while you take potshots at them on one combat map) but through overwhelming numbers and often superior quality troops. Melee combat is overpowered and classes are unbalanced.\n\nCombat can be quite sluggish, and the lack of a fast-forward key is an oversight (there is an option to increase the speed generally, but that's it).\n\nThe camera is frustrating, with your view on the world map constantly blocked by trees.\n\nSome aspects of the game are quite unintuitive. For instance, some quests need to be turned in at a town in the first map. Once you have triggered an event in the main quest, though, going into the town will only allow you to access that. Win that battle, and you still can't turn in your quests. A very frustrating situation for players - at least those who don't somehow intuit that you will be able to turn quests in again a couple of days later.\n\nThe biggest problem, though, is constant crashes. These problems have affected a number of users and the only potential solution is to turn down graphics settings - even on some systems which meet the recommended requirements  (which really should be revised) - and even then it does not always assist.\n\nThat's a lot of negativity, but I still lean towards recommending it. It's rough around the edges, but well-written, attractive and challenging games deserve attention, especially when produced by a novice studio like this one. By all means give it a go, and I hope you don't suffer the same crashes that I did before buying a new system.","February 20, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Decent story set in the 16th century during the conquest of the Aztecs by Hernando Cortez, good mechanics and balance (singleplayer, unsure about multiplayer balance).\n\nShort overview:\n\nThe game is split in two parts, a 3D strategic overhead map which you navigate in a style similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic/King's Bounty series. You'll pick up resources, deal with random events, manage plot-relevant encounters, equip your troops and basically do everything that has to do with managing your expedition. The random/story encounters often deal with individual members of your expedition (all of which have individual backstories and motivations) or with the inhabitants of the land and can be dealt in 1-3 ways, which possibly changes the outcome (either minorly: motivating your expedition member, avoiding confrontation/engaging in battle, or possibly majorly: which faction do you support?).\n\nIf you engage in battle via the overhead map, the game switches over to the tactical turnbased view. You can select up to 6 of your expedition members (initially available classes: soldier(dps/tank), scout(melee dps), doctor(healer), scholar(buffer), hunter(ranged dps) - more classes unlocked as you recruit them in the campaign), mixing and matching your classes/abilities to suit the situation. Objectives are usually "eliminate the other team", but can also include holding out for X amount of turns against a superior force or reaching a mission objective with your troops. Maps range from tiny (fits on your screen) to pretty big (2-5 screens).\n\nWhat sets this game apart from other tactical games is that you often have the opportunity to arrange the battlefield to your advantage by placing traps and barricades prior to the battle. This is often a necessity, as creating chokepoints/corridors of deathtraps is  a good way to hold off larger numbers of opponents.\n\nSuccessfully completing objectives gives you experience with which you can promote select members of your expedition, giving them better combat stats and class-specific abilities.\n\n\nThe good:\n------\n+ excellent combat mechanics. Fun fun.\n\n+ well-balanced and customizable difficulty (normal will prove a challenge for\nnewbies to the genre, while I recommend that veterans start on 'hard')\n\n+ multiple viable ways to fight battles depending on the terrain and trap selection\n\n+ good, believable writing (plot and characterization of the player characters/NPC)\n\n+ optional Ironman mode (no loading, though you have the option to replay losing battles by use of alt-f4)\n\n+ decent length and replayability (I think I'm about 50-65% through the game at 10 hours, so I'd estimate it at about the length of a XCOM:EU playthrough). I believe the campaigns are modular in nature, so DLC campaigns are a distinct possibility.\n\n+ (hotseat) multiplayer (I'll put this as a pro, since I haven't actually tested it yet but unless the netcode is terrible it's bound to be a good thing)\n\nThe bad:\n-------\n- overhead map is a bit annoying to navigate and doesn't look very nice. I wonder if a beautiful 2D map would've been a better design choice\n\n- strategic view is a bit empty. Running around and collecting resources seems a bit pointless - there should be way more encounters than there currently are\n\n- combat opportunities are a bit sparse when choosing a certain playstyle (though still plentiful enough to not be bored)\n\n- some minor bugs (the occasional graphics glitch, no biggie)\n\n\nAll in all, it's well worth the $20 (get it here or over on Gog.com for DRM-free), especially if you're hankering for some more turnbased strategy. I'd score the game in its current form somewhere around 77-83 (whereas Jagged Alliance 2, my favorite tactics game is an easy 90+ and XCOM:EU is around 80-85).","June 4, 2013","true","12.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

But the terrain gets in the way and obscures your view so you literally can't see your unit for all the trees! You have to zoom and pan the camera around to see, and that's a really frustrating design flaw in my opinion.\n\nEarly in the game the mentioned problems made me think "f*** this I'm quitting" but I'm glad I didn't after all. The story is very good, and the characters you meet and recruit have their unique personalities. There's a bit of a history lesson in there too.\n\nI'd be happy to see a sequel with a bigger map and campaign, and updated graphics and interface.

On your way you get delayed and presented with many choices on how to proceed.\n\nBattles are enjoyable. There are multiple ways to come out on top. You can make use of your RPG skills to scout the terrain, or deploy scouts to get an idea of the enemy party. You also select your party for each battle. The makeup of the party, their equipment, rank, and skills, all affect your success. Several difficulty levels allow the game to range from pretty easy, to quite a challenge.\n\nI didn’t have any trouble with the game. Some previous reviews mentioned crashing and the need for patches, so maybe waiting two years before playing is a good strategy! With all of the text in the game I expcted many typos, but only found one. (Someone wrote seize instead of cease, if anyone wants to fix it)\n\nThe story is great and remains interesting until the end. Several reviews mention historical inaccuracies, and freak out because there are too many women in the game… Just pretend the game is based on events which took place on Earth, but in an alternate dimension.\n\nThere is a lot going on in this game, and if you want to fully enjoy it, read the guides so you’ll better understand the interface, and mechanics before starting. You may also fail your first mission and call it a learning curve. Your second party will make it much further. I couldn't figure out how to equip or use the special equipment (traps, barricades, lenterns, torches...etc.) on my first mission.\n","February 7","true","45.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately this games doesn't do justice to the historical setting it's placed in.  It takes the complexity of the Spanish exploration, colonization, and conquest of the New World and reduces it to a politically correct misrepresentation of the era.  Feminism is endemic in the game and, if my first interaction with natives is any indication of how the game treats religion, you're either stuck making live and let live decisions or you're oppressing and murdering people in the name of God, Church, and country.  There was no middle-ground.  I guess I should have expected this given this line from the game's description: "Re-write the history of the Conquistadors: Forge diplomatic alliances with the natives... or crush the savages and bring civilization to the pagan tribes!"  It's still disapointing to see such a fascinating and rich piece of history represented so poorly.\n\nI found the gameplay to be less egregious but not terribly entertaining.  The camera in the game's traveling mode was maddening in how limited it's field of view was and the tactical battles were boring.\n\nI think the game had a very promising concept.  Certainly one that really hooked me into buying it.  It also has some interesting features and mechanics, but nothing so great that I was motivated to keep playing after experiencing the above.","April 2","false","2.9"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

The game's historical fiction setting, morally ambigious choices, great artwork, and music make this an incredibly atmospheric game, even if the graphics can be very basic at times, and the initial learning curve a steep one.\n\nThere are three primary parts of this game: the first is exploration of the game's two overworlds, where you balance party management and discovery. The second is the well written and character-centric dialogue, where you are forced to navigate numerous choices that have a number of effects on the long and short term outcomes of your adventure, and generally nudge you towards being a brutal leader, which feels very appropriate for the time period (you can certainly take the morally high road, though you will usually be the poorer for it). The final, and most significant portion of the game is the turn based combat, where, due to story events, decisions you have made, and random encounters on the overworld, your party of up to six fights an equal or greater number of enemies on a hexagonal based battlefield. There is a suprising amount of depth to be found here, despite the seemingly limited class-specific and special abilities.\n\nThe most impressive thing about Conquistador is despite some clumsiness in execution, and a repetition that inevitable sets in, all the different parts come together very well, and after an initially brutal difficulty curve, makes for an all-round enjoyable and challenging experience. This entire game was essentially a one-man project, and deserves your support; the developer has created a great and unique game template here, and I would love to see another Expeditions game set in a different era with similar gameplay. Conquistador is hopefully a great first entry in a larger series of historical fiction RPGs, and this is a recommended title if any of those sound the least bit appealling to you.","January 21, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You go on an expedition as a conquistador and do basically all the stuff a conquistador would do (in a top down strategy game.)\n\nPROS:\nThis game really does well with the easy to use tactical commands and team building. There are some challenging battles and a lot of quests/missions to do. You are pretty much on different open islands to explore, but ultimately you are on a linear story. You choose how to play the story and it is different based on choices. Pretty cut and dry.\n\nThe combat is tactical top down hex grid based which is nice. It's familiar and easy for an average gamer.\n\n4/5 Stars\n\nCONS:\nTo someone who has never played this style of game it can be daunting to see the different options at the start. The UI isn't as good as it could be and occassionally I get confused when I'm cycling between characters (since they all look the same in their pictures and names.)\n\nA huge con for me in this game is actually one of the tactical commands. They don't describle combat at the start. You literally are just thrown in without explanation and you have to divulge on your own that movement and your ability to attack after moving are color coded. Once you learn yellow and orange and green colors and what they stand for you figure it out, but ultimately a counter or icon would be really nice. You also don't learn the abilities without trying them out, which is really annoying when you want to level characters up.\n\nThe abilities are all kinda the same. Gain 5% of this or 10% reduction of that, but short of using a wiki or researching the games best builds you are stuck just going with your gut. Honestly they could have done a better job with the abilities and just scrapped them all together for pre-made builds. I think it would speed up my leveling and make me focus more on the story and less on the numbers game that E:C creates that ultimately isn't that important.","January 9, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It will surely fill your heart with the same feelings you had when you discovered your first tbs. The graphics are nice with bright and warm colours, the music gives a plus to the atmosphere. But the graphics and the sounds are the least things to be charmed by this game since its strong points are the story, the historically correct facts, some surprise mythological elements which I will let you discover on your own ( tip: find the volcanoes in Mexico campaign ) , the multitude of choices to solve conflicts and missions, different outcomes, a lot of units which you can upgrade when they gain enough experience. My only problem with it was a certain kind of battle mode, a fleeing kind in which you have to run across a battlefield of enemies to get to safety.\nOverall it's a very consistent game with elements of rpg as well, many perils happening along as you lead your group of conquistadores like members of your team falling into sandpits, toying with poison, mingling with the locals, starving, rioting because there is something that they don't like (also keep an eye on the morale! ) and many more. I really enjoyed it and it's been a long time since I enjoyed a good TBS, so if you have the opportunity to get your hands on it and you enjoy TBS you will surely love it.

Thus far, only 0.9 % of players received the "Masochist" achievement ( for playing on Ironman mode ) 0.8 % received the "Pizarro" achievement ( for finishing the game on Hard ).\n\nI first noticed that this game had an unusual design, in that the jungles were so lush, that you could not sometimes see your own character! Your screen is often filled with green, tree top canopies. You get a visceral, authentic sense of wading through a jungle.\n\nThere are two campaigns.\n\nI think that the game trailer is misleading. Similar to 1990's RPGs, in terms of the time spent, this game is 90 % exploration, 6 % questing and 4% combat. The percentages are off, but that is only because the game is so exploration-heavy, that it's hard for me to get an accurate handle on the numbers. As an example, it took me a couple of days, just to uncover the fog of war, for each campaign.\n\nYou assemble your expedition of ten team members from the following classes: doctors; hunters; scholars; scouts; soldiers. Each class has three statistics of varying degree. As an example, a soldier would be better at "guarding" and "patrolling", whereas a doctor would be better at "herbalism" ( first aid ) and "tinkering" ( constructing mechanical traps ).\n\nAs you explore, you find washed up crates, containing random amounts of: wood, metal, rope and oil. You use these materials to construct different traps that can be used in combat, such as a spiked pit trap.\n\nYou have to manage food, morale and medicine.\n\nDuring the turn-based, hex-style combat, the AI is fantastic and has fuzzy logic built in. On Hard difficulty, the AI will perform optimal moves most of the time and make mistakes maybe 2% of the time ( similar to playing against a strong, human opponent ). There is a separate slider, to increase the AI to maximum ( which would turn the combat into chess, I'm assuming ). There are 6 levels of escalating injury: "harmless"; "moderate"; "severe"; "critical"; "fatal"; "dead".\n\nThe quests are fairly straight forward and the writing was ( surprisingly ) very professional.\n\nIt took me a while, to warm up to the 18th century art style but the artist is talented.\n\nI love the music, especially the combat music ( which is featured in the game trailer ). The ambient sounds of birds and crickets chirping is perfect.\n\nThe game is stable ( as a game with an "Ironman mode" would have to be ). In 119 hours, the game only crashed once and that was when I alt-tabbed into a different window, to chat with a Steam friend.\n\nIt was a joy to play a game, with such a well programmed, clean and intuitive interface. I'm looking forward to other products, from the developers.

There is much to say, for I have played it at great length and to completion. Warning: spoilers ahead.\n\nThings I liked:\n\nThe tactical combat was rewarding. I found that most battles tended to end as either Flawless Victories or defeats; there didn't appear to be much middle ground in terms of outcome. I relied on a team of 2 soliders, 2 scouts and either 2 medics or 1 medic and 1 scholar. At first I eschewed the medics, as I felt that the in-combat healing was a little too fantastical for what I took to be a historical RPG. (More fool I, for the apparent rise of 3rd wave feminism 5 centuries early should have clued me on to the fact this game is quite fantastical.)\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n"Your guards failed to prevent the theft of 2444 valuables during the night." What in the holy hell. I understand the concept of RNG, but it felt like A) this happened way too often, as though some factor was not accurately reflected in the Guarding percentages (I never camped at below 85% and always tried my best to max it out at 95) and B) the amount stolen was way out of proportion to the value of other things that could be stolen, such as medicine, rations or various construction materials.  As a result, despite discovering El Dorado, I finished the campaign with Carlos ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me for bringing back a paltry ~15000 valuables.\n\nAnd that's another thing. El Dorado. While I enjoyed the quests and puzzles, I found the reward in valuables to be quite underwelming. Anti-climatic, even. In fact, I will say the same about raiding Quetzequoatle's temple. I wish I kept track of the figures, but I'm fairly certain my scouts rounded up more valuables on their nightly patrols getting there and back to Tenochitlan.\n\nI felt robbed of my glorious victory upon slaying Monteczuma. If I had known I didn't have enough troops in my barracks back at the Stone House, I wouldn't have embarked upon those final quests. I had resolved early on to do as the historical Cortes had done, but could not. I had to let those dirty savages keep their filthy empire of heresy. This was outrageous. The fort/barracks mechanic was introduced too late and not very well explained. I guess I was supposed to have my hermandad sit around and do nothing until some arbitrary number of soldiers was recruited.\n\nPart of why I went into the ending when I did (and thus losing Mexico for Spain) was that I was sitting on more XPs than I could spend and so felt that it was time to wrap this game up. The leveling needs some work. More promotions. More things to spend XPs on. I did use my hermandad from the Hispaniola campaign, so perhaps that explains the overage, but honestly, why wouldn't you use the same character?\n\nThe equipment system was flat and unimaginative. It inspired me neither in terms of cool factor nor in utility nor in versimilitude. Am I to believe that my 15th century Spanish soldiers would find value in weapons made of glass? Or in armor made of feathers? Give me the classic model of equipping units anyday; weapon, armor and accessory.\n\nArquebusses are ♥♥♥♥. Not the ♥♥♥♥, but ♥♥♥♥. These weapons were a big part of how the conquistadors did their thing. That they were inaccurate is well represented, but remember, these ignorant natives had no conception of black powder weapons. Where's the shock and awe? I tried using them but was profoundly dissapointed. Not even a leveled up hunter made them worthwhile.\n\nThe battle maps were sometimes confusing. It wasn't always clear to me if I could move into a hex or not; sometimes foilage would cover the grid.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite my criticisms, I did find myself playing the game to completion. I think at some point it became an obession. Which is highly to be desired in one's video games. I do not see much replay value in it, but I do look foward to the Expeditions: Viking game, which I will most certainly be purchasing.","July 10, 2015","true","56.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Bad player decisions lead to bad outcomes and loss of troop morale, for instance.\n-Resource management can be a challenge at first. Random travel events can quickly cause loss of rations, valuables, and medicine if you don't assign party members to correct tasks.\n\nMy only minor issue is the interface. Camping screen is click-intensive and can become tedious, considering you will be there several hundred times during a game.

There is much to say, for I have played it at great length and to completion. Warning: spoilers ahead.\n\nThings I liked:\n\nThe tactical combat was rewarding. I found that most battles tended to end as either Flawless Victories or defeats; there didn't appear to be much middle ground in terms of outcome. I relied on a team of 2 soliders, 2 scouts and either 2 medics or 1 medic and 1 scholar. At first I eschewed the medics, as I felt that the in-combat healing was a little too fantastical for what I took to be a historical RPG. (More fool I, for the apparent rise of 3rd wave feminism 5 centuries early should have clued me on to the fact this game is quite fantastical.)\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n"Your guards failed to prevent the theft of 2444 valuables during the night." What in the holy hell. I understand the concept of RNG, but it felt like A) this happened way too often, as though some factor was not accurately reflected in the Guarding percentages (I never camped at below 85% and always tried my best to max it out at 95) and B) the amount stolen was way out of proportion to the value of other things that could be stolen, such as medicine, rations or various construction materials.  As a result, despite discovering El Dorado, I finished the campaign with Carlos ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me for bringing back a paltry ~15000 valuables.\n\nAnd that's another thing. El Dorado. While I enjoyed the quests and puzzles, I found the reward in valuables to be quite underwelming. Anti-climatic, even. In fact, I will say the same about raiding Quetzequoatle's temple. I wish I kept track of the figures, but I'm fairly certain my scouts rounded up more valuables on their nightly patrols getting there and back to Tenochitlan.\n\nI felt robbed of my glorious victory upon slaying Monteczuma. If I had known I didn't have enough troops in my barracks back at the Stone House, I wouldn't have embarked upon those final quests. I had resolved early on to do as the historical Cortes had done, but could not. I had to let those dirty savages keep their filthy empire of heresy. This was outrageous. The fort/barracks mechanic was introduced too late and not very well explained. I guess I was supposed to have my hermandad sit around and do nothing until some arbitrary number of soldiers was recruited.\n\nPart of why I went into the ending when I did (and thus losing Mexico for Spain) was that I was sitting on more XPs than I could spend and so felt that it was time to wrap this game up. The leveling needs some work. More promotions. More things to spend XPs on. I did use my hermandad from the Hispaniola campaign, so perhaps that explains the overage, but honestly, why wouldn't you use the same character?\n\nThe equipment system was flat and unimaginative. It inspired me neither in terms of cool factor nor in utility nor in versimilitude. Am I to believe that my 15th century Spanish soldiers would find value in weapons made of glass? Or in armor made of feathers? Give me the classic model of equipping units anyday; weapon, armor and accessory.\n\nArquebusses are ♥♥♥♥. Not the ♥♥♥♥, but ♥♥♥♥. These weapons were a big part of how the conquistadors did their thing. That they were inaccurate is well represented, but remember, these ignorant natives had no conception of black powder weapons. Where's the shock and awe? I tried using them but was profoundly dissapointed. Not even a leveled up hunter made them worthwhile.\n\nThe battle maps were sometimes confusing. It wasn't always clear to me if I could move into a hex or not; sometimes foilage would cover the grid.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite my criticisms, I did find myself playing the game to completion. I think at some point it became an obession. Which is highly to be desired in one's video games. I do not see much replay value in it, but I do look foward to the Expeditions: Viking game, which I will most certainly be purchasing.","July 10, 2015","true","56.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You may have seriously wounded party members at the end, though. In some cases, bringing fewer than six members into combat encounter is key to victory. Scouts can move really fast....\n-Pretty solid underlying game mechanics. While some players may not like the design decisions they are mostly consistent in their approach. Bad player decisions lead to bad outcomes and loss of troop morale, for instance.\n-Resource management can be a challenge at first. Random travel events can quickly cause loss of rations, valuables, and medicine if you don't assign party members to correct tasks.\n\nMy only minor issue is the interface. Camping screen is click-intensive and can become tedious, considering you will be there several hundred times during a game. Likewise, a few more hotkeys for combat would most welcome.\n\nOverall, a game worth a look for the right kind of player.","July 25, 2015","true","120.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thus far, only 0.9 % of players received the "Masochist" achievement ( for playing on Ironman mode ) 0.8 % received the "Pizarro" achievement ( for finishing the game on Hard ).\n\nI first noticed that this game had an unusual design, in that the jungles were so lush, that you could not sometimes see your own character! Your screen is often filled with green, tree top canopies. You get a visceral, authentic sense of wading through a jungle.\n\nThere are two campaigns.\n\nI think that the game trailer is misleading. Similar to 1990's RPGs, in terms of the time spent, this game is 90 % exploration, 6 % questing and 4% combat. The percentages are off, but that is only because the game is so exploration-heavy, that it's hard for me to get an accurate handle on the numbers. As an example, it took me a couple of days, just to uncover the fog of war, for each campaign.\n\nYou assemble your expedition of ten team members from the following classes: doctors; hunters; scholars; scouts; soldiers. Each class has three statistics of varying degree. As an example, a soldier would be better at "guarding" and "patrolling", whereas a doctor would be better at "herbalism" ( first aid ) and "tinkering" ( constructing mechanical traps ).\n\nAs you explore, you find washed up crates, containing random amounts of: wood, metal, rope and oil. You use these materials to construct different traps that can be used in combat, such as a spiked pit trap.\n\nYou have to manage food, morale and medicine.\n\nDuring the turn-based, hex-style combat, the AI is fantastic and has fuzzy logic built in. On Hard difficulty, the AI will perform optimal moves most of the time and make mistakes maybe 2% of the time ( similar to playing against a strong, human opponent ). There is a separate slider, to increase the AI to maximum ( which would turn the combat into chess, I'm assuming ). There are 6 levels of escalating injury: "harmless"; "moderate"; "severe"; "critical"; "fatal"; "dead".\n\nThe quests are fairly straight forward and the writing was ( surprisingly ) very professional.\n\nIt took me a while, to warm up to the 18th century art style but the artist is talented.\n\nI love the music, especially the combat music ( which is featured in the game trailer ). The ambient sounds of birds and crickets chirping is perfect.\n\nThe game is stable ( as a game with an "Ironman mode" would have to be ). In 119 hours, the game only crashed once and that was when I alt-tabbed into a different window, to chat with a Steam friend.\n\nIt was a joy to play a game, with such a well programmed, clean and intuitive interface. I'm looking forward to other products, from the developers. I think that I paid less than $4 for this game, which was a steal!","December 12, 2014","true","120.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Expeditions wastes very little time in diving right into the feeling of being a conquistador at the head of a company during the age of colonization, from the politics to the racial divides to the different choices and approaches that you, the player, can take, and how those choices affect the setting and your team. And these aren't faceless dolls or pawns like so many other strategy games, but people with their own policital stances and beliefs and skill sets derived from a pre-made backstory. They have their opinions, and there are regular events that highlight those opinions and how they connect with the rest of the company. This game takes roleplaying to its core and makes you feel like a leader of friends and allies rather than a commander of disposable people.\n\nThat said, it's not all perfect. The in-game economy of always needing to buy rations or hunt for food can get tedious and irritating when you're in a hurry to get somewhere, the camping system, while interesting, has a bit of a learning curve, and the ranged weapon hit percentages can be horribly misleading. I don't think I've ever missed so many times with an 80% or higher chance to hit. Also, the directions in the second half of the game can get a bit hard to follow. There are quests to be done, but I'm not sure what they are in the service of, while the first part of the game was very well explained and set up. But these are minor when the writing is excellent, the tactical maps and combat AI are both fun and challenging, and the sense of immersion thatt he game introduces is top-notch.\n\nAll in all, I'm having a real blast with Expeditions: Conquistador, and would recommend it to RPG and strategy fans alike, because there's a lot in here for both. And if you like both of those genres, then it's well worth its price. A different story and setting from the mainstream, gripping characters with very real beliefs and politics, and the feel of responsibility, or power, that comes with making decisions that affect the company and others in the game all combine to make for an excellent gaming experience.\n\nBuy it.

It makes you grow attached to your party members only to kill them off because you didn't have the medicine to treat their diseases and lacerations. They'll become crippled in battle and grow hungry throughout your expedition. This is not a very pleasant game and your party's survival is a constant struggle.\n\nThe writing is quite excellent and reminiscent of older RPGs where we were expected to have some form of reading comprehension. The moral choices you make are actually tough decisions. Do you put down a revolt by force or do you leave the rebels alone (knowing that the rebels seek to create a free nation in this new world)? Do you smite the pagan tribe in the name of economic expansion or do you leave them at peace? Do you fight to the death or cut your losses and retreat?\n\nThis game truly forces you to slow down and think about your actions and their consequences, since every decision has ramifications. It's a refreshing change of pace from the linear and bland first person shooters that we get today that have no challenging thoughts whatsoever.\n\nThe only real issue so far is that you can't really pan the camera all that far, so it can be difficult to navigate the map.\n\nIf you're looking for a mature gameplay experience with a gripping tale, strong strategic combat, and freeform gameplay, this game is for you.","February 1, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Bugged. Beautiful. Cluttered. Revisionist. Old School. Historically-inaccurate. Ultimately...flawed.\n\nThis is a game that I wanted to love -- that I still want to love. But unfortunately it's flaws are both asthetic and mechanical, and lamentably myriad. EG: The game crashes when you try to return to the main menu, and it does so every single time. No matter how well-trained and well-equipped, your units will ALWAYS perform poorly, while enemy units will always perform with expert precision (even if unarmed, outnumbered, and incapacitated). It wants to push very particular 21st century political reinterpretations of the era of the Conquistadores, but it does so while simultaneously pretending that 15th-16th century Spain was an egalitarian culture in which men and women alike served in the military, in academia, etc. Kind of hard to push the "EVIL-WHITE-MEN-RUINED-PRISTINE-PERFECT-UTOPIAN-PRE-COLOMBIAN-AMERICA" narrative when you're presenting the conquistadores as a gender-and-racial-inclusive 21st-century-style group to satisfy the tastes of modern, historically-illiterate players... Etc. etc. etc. What you wind up with is a game that looks lovely, and is full of potential, but which is all the more frustrating and disappointing because of that. Its flaws make its merits into flaws, since they highlight what might have been and emphasize how far short the programmers fell of their apparent goals. I'd give this a pass. It'll only break your heart (and drive you bonkers if you're a historian).","January 28","false","12.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

At first, the pace was very slow as I had to learn the core mechanics of Expeditions: Conquistador. After almost ten hours, I could easily complete quests and win battles without heavy casualties while playing on hard difficulty. From this moment on, I really fell in love with every bit of what makes this a truly great game.\nFirst of all, the game comes up with a deep and rich combat system which lets you experiment as many strategies as you want. You can flank your opponents, hit and run, trap them... The AI is not that smart during the first fifteen hours. But as soon as you are about to complete the first segment of the main story line, things are really getting started. The AI is much more agressive and for instance, tends to focus on either your doctors or the biggest threats. It is also able to flank you and to incapacitate your team members in order to quickly win the match.\nBesides, I really enjoyed the story so far. As a planescape torment fan, I was surprised to go through so well written quests. Wether main or side quests, every piece of adventures I came across was fantastic. You'll spend most of your time reading long texts but they are so interesting and thrilling... What a divine pleasure nowadays!\nThen, don't even try to succeed without being proficient at managing your party turns after turns. You may lose a battle but you'll surely have to face the consequences. Moreover, you are accountable for every choice you make and your followers will react accordingly to their beliefs and ethic. Thus, sometimes you will be offered the possibility to know more about them and their background.\nFinally, if you can bear to spend the few hours required to dive in the core mechanics, you'll be rewarded with a wonderful and well written adventure as well as a very deep and complex battle system.","January 4, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has several qualities that have kept me interested for 40 hours (and still going on first playthrough):\n\n> The writing is fantastic.  The story revolves around your character, a spanish captain charged with exploring the new world shortly after Christopher Columbus made his initial "discovery".  You hand pick your expedition members each with well conceived bios and character traits. The story unfolds as you encounter new people and places, and is told through text and stylistically drawn images and portraits... the writing is so good I find myself hoping that the next village or encounter will have some description associated with it.  Honestly this adventure could be converted into a book.\n\n> There are hard choices to be made. Most encounters provide an opportunity to choose your response, often with very tangible benefits and consequences.  Like the Walking Dead telltale series, the best choice is not always obvious.  Many times I left the choices up on the screen and went to do something else for a while to think about how to respond.  Although I could have simply chosen one reponse then reloaded the game if I did not like the outcome... the "role playing" feel is so intense doing so would break the immersion.\n\n> Its an excellent survival simulation.  This game captures the feeling of being at the mercy of the land, and effectively manging your available resources to survive... especially at the beginning of the game.\n\n> Its historically accurate.  Many people and places you encounter are based on historcal fact.  There are historical codex entries that unlock as you encounter them... this adds to the immersion.\n\n> The tactical battles are fun.  The battles are based on a hex grid and are turn based like most games in this genre.  The battles can be very difficult in the beginning until you learn how to work with the available terrain and get the right mix of skills on the battlefield.  Once you unlock more advanced weaponry then the real fun begins.\n\nI honestly did not encounter any bugs.  There are a few things I might change to fix some immersion issues:\n1. Let doctors heal themselves.\n2. Make using a lantern or cannon expend a party members turn.\n3. For the cannon, make it necessary for someone to be next to it.\n\nVery minor things that at this point I don't really worry about.  An excellent game and if there is a sequel I will snatch it up immediately.\n\n9/10","January 23, 2014","true","47.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Decisions you make impact your experience playing through the rest of the game.\n\nYou start the game by picking what character stats you want. Two of the more important stats are diplomacy and tactics. You can focus on diplomacy if you want to talk your way out of situations or you can rely on tactics if you want to intimidate or gain a favorable position at the start of battles.\n\nNext, you decide which expedition members you want to take with you. This choice not only impacts who you can take with you into battle and how well you can survive off a foreign land, but also personality traits of members affect their morale & loyalty based on decisions you make.\n\nThe game itself is turn based fighting/exploration/diplomacy done with an isometric view. You need to camp after a set number of moves while exploring and there are random encounters that always keep you on your toes. The dialog is not only decent but at times it shines by providing lots of character to your expeditions members and some of the other NPC's you meet.\n\nFor an indie title, I am amazed at how well this game delivers in both scope and presentation. I look forward to any future titles made by the developer Logic Artists.","November 27, 2013","true","21.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The AI was a little stupid at times and the battles got a bit formulaic but there was just enough variety in the various quest scenarios to keep it interesting.\n\nThe game also does a good job at introducing a bit of history but it always remains light and fun.  Perhaps it could have been a bit darker by offering more reward for bashing the natives and more punishment for helping them to try and illustrate the historical attitudes of the Europeans of the time.\n\nI got his on the cheap from the Humble Bundle but I’d happily pay its advertised price and will look out for future games.\n","November 29, 2013","true","22.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as a conquistador in 16th century Hispaniola then Mexico with the power to be either an oppressive, slaving, genocidal warmongerer or an easy-going humanitarian.\n\nYou begin by selecting a backstory and a retinue of party members with different attributes and attitudes chosen from multiple classes. Each of these potential compatriots has a well-developed backstory which emerges throughout the game and informs or explains their attitudes to the world around them. Depending on these attitudes and the dialogue-based decisions you make throughout the game, party members may follow you to the ends of the Earth or grow to hate you. Gentle and humanitarian characters will not like your genocidal warmongerering ways, after all.\n\nMost of the game is spent on a strategic map. As an explorer, you choose where to go on these fairly large maps which take dozens of turns to traverse, Along the way, you pitch camp every night, deciding on the allocation of limited resources such as food, medicine, and manpower for scouting, defending, and forging.\n\nThe turn-based squad combat resembles XCOM: Enemy Unknown's cover and dice-roll based system but with pikes and arquebuses on maps depicting open-pit mines, Mayan ruins, or other areas expected of the time and place. As would be expected in a party-based RPG, you can change weapons and allocate experience points to your party members and each class has unique abilities. Combat is challenging and the strategic use of abilities and flanking is necessary for victory.\n\nDespite the unique setting and mix of successfully implemented borrowings from other games, Expeditions Conquistador does wear its welcome and feels repetitive after a few hours. The historical setting likely inhibited the developers from introducing exciting mid and end game enemies and mechanics that would be possible in a Wasteland or Baldur's Gate.  Enemies are obviously always humans and while you do fight against both American Indians and Spanish, the expected different feel of fighting two vastly different cultures with different armaments never materializes. The decision-making is shallow because it is not nuanced; it is always very obvious when you are going down the path of oppressor or humanitarian.\n\nOverall, Expeditions Conquistador is an intriguing game worth checking out if you are a fan of squad-based tactical RPGs and interested in the Spanish Conquest of the Americas. Let your inner Cortez or Pizarro reign free for at least a few hours, as long as you can find this game on sale.","April 10","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nimrodx/recommended/237430/","nimrodx","NimrodX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nimrodx/","365 products in account","This seems to be a combination of a hex map TBS, Oregon Trail, a game with text-based events that require some cultural understanding sort of like those in King of Dragon Pass, and an RPG where you can freely roam around a "world map" in a non-linear fashion. The TBS aspect comes in when you get into a fight and must fight a turn-based battle, somewhat XCOM stye, except it's on a hex map. Like Oregon Trail you have to worry a lot about hunting or trading for food and medicine, as well as processing herbs you find into medicine, preserving any meat you can't eat right away, crafting objects to use in battle (like barricades and traps), and researching "inventions" that do things like improve your movement rate. Unlike Oregon Trail though, nothing is linear and your followers (except for your slaves/servants) are not anonymous statistics; they speak up and interact with you as events occur and will urge you to do things or object to things based on their beliefs.\n\nOne good thing about the game is that you have the choice of whether you want to act like a racist conquer, non-racist diplomat, or some combination of both, but regardless of what you pick the game won't go easy on you. If your party is full of aggressive rascists they'll be forced to work with the natives at times and forced to negotiate their way out of stuff, non-rascists will still be forced to deal with the rascist attitudes of others in society, and the peaceful will still be forced to fight. So whether you want to subjegate the heathen savages for the glory of the Spanish crown or promote their acceptance among the Spanish settlers, you won't be able to get by acting only according to one attitude or the other.\n\nThe mechanics of the game seem pretty well balanced, and they're rather unforgiving when it comes to things like running out of food or being unable to treat your wounded whether due to lack of medicine or doctors. The game is not quite as unforgiving as XCOM when it comes to death; if someone's "hit points" (endurance) reaches 0 in battle then they aren't automaically dead, but they have a good chance of being anywhere from lightly to severely wounded after the battle. This is a major problem because wounded people require a dedicated doctor and usually something like 5-8 medicine per day to treat, with one day of treatment needed per severity level of the wound. To make things worse, they can't hunt, guard, patrol, or do anything else useful until healed. On the other hand, the reason you get such an opportunity to save your casualties is that you can't just hire new people like you can in XCOM. While you can sometimes get a new fighter, hunter, doctor, or scholar, you have to *find* them and sometimes convince them to join because they're all essentially one-off special characters, not faceless minions.\n\nOverall the game is a well made combination of several different types of game mechanic that I haven't seen all in the same game before this. When I was in high school all the kids used to play Oregon Trail and start out with 10,000 ammunition and no food or medicine because they just wanted to play the deer hunting minigame the whole time. I'm betting the same kids playing "Expeditions: Conquistador" would have their bloodlust satisfied by the TBS battles and they wouldn't have to pursue a really silly game strategy just to get in enough fighting. Because of that they might actually learn something while playing.","December 23, 2013","true","12.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And as far as that goes, it is accurate.  Expeditions: Conquistador is in fact substantially more complex than XCOM, and also quite a bit more unforgiving.  The moment you leave the first island fort-town in Hispanola, you will end up fighting outnumbered, outgunned, and outclassed.  To wit, I have yet to win a non-tutorial fight.\n\nAm I merely doing it wrong?  Have I utterly failed to do some basic this-or-that which would make the game play more smoothly?  Perhaps so.  I don't know what it would be off-hand.  To the extent that there is immersive schadenfreude in getting run off by spear-waving Caribbean natives, this game is effective.  But is it too much to ask for the newbie levels to be a little more forgiving?  It's one thing to sally forth into the jungle with your caravan laden with equipment and supplies only to return a couple weeks later starving, robbed, and bleeding; and quite another to have at least some success early on.\n\nI suspect I'll give Expeditions: Conquistador another run in time.

The problem is that it takes a good 15 minutes of attempting to scroll back and forth to find just where that exit point is. Then each time you want to move one of your party, it takes another 15 minutes to try and locate where each character is and then you can only hope that you have them moving in the right direction.

The first tutorial fight, the second tutorial fight involving baricades and a fight for treasure on the beach. I lost all 3 fights and it seems to me that the RNG is broken and always favors the opponent. It works by lowering your chance to hit the farther you are and when you are closer you have a higher chance to hit. Except my guys missed 90% of the time even when right in front of the opponent. While the opponent could stand on the other side of the map, through rocks and barricades and almost always hit (and for some reason almost always got to attack twice).\n\nI am not sure what this game is gaining by rigging the opponent to have higher chances of landing ranged attacks, but it is very frustrating to miss 6 shots in a row right in front of a guy while they are landing shots from more than 10 tiles away and through a barricade then getting to attack more than once per unit. It is definitely an impossible game even though they say otherwise when you can never win a fight?\n\nPlease fix the RNG, it is severly broken.","March 2, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

This is an under-the-radar hidden gem that deserves a huge player base because it is simply that good,\n\nAs the name suggests you take charge of a group of Spanish Conquistators venturing to the New World. Are you there for fame, glory or riches? The choice is yours!\n\nThe game itself is an excellent mixture of RPG, map exploration, character/resource management and turn based combat. You can be diplomatic and seek alliances with natives to add local units to your group and peacefully aquire what you need ... or .... you can cut down the savage  and take what you want fom them without pity!\n\nIts great that a game like this doesn't shy away from topics because of politically correct considerations and just lets you play however you want.; as a bloodthirsty conqueror, a peaceful diplomat or somewhere between those too extremes.\n\nThe battles are a lots of fun (and genuinely hard! even at normal difficullty) and take the form of  turn based and hex-centered combat. The games graphics aren't astounding like say, Skyrims are, but they are in my opinion definately above average for a game that focuses as much on the RPG side of things as the combat.\n\nI took a chance on this game because it was on sale and because  I love the period in history its based on . However, if I could go back in time I would honestly have donated to the kickstarter campaign for this game and/or bought it at full price. It really is that good, and is probably one of only a handful of games I would ever say are worth their full price on Steam\n\nThis is a completely underrated gem that I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone, you could honestly pay full price for this game and not be disappointed. However if your still not convinced, add it to your wishlist and get this the moment its on sale.\n\nSo, what do you say ... are you man enough to seek your fortune across the seas in the New World? Are you a modern day Christopher Columbus or Hernán Cortés? Play Expeditions Conquistatdor and find out!","August 1, 2013","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Set in an unique historical time period (the Spanish conquest of Middle America), you can pick your party members at the start of the game, each with his/her own background stories and character traits. Your party members will talk to you and react to your actions, and their stories and opinions really matter. You might want to leave passive characters behind if you're about to behave aggressively. And don't be surprised if discriminating characters react negative when you act friendly to the native Americans.

Very well written strategy/RPG set in a not-too-often-seen setting (16th Century Central America, in Hispaniola and Mexico). Game plays like a mix between Heroes of Might and Magic/Kings Bounty while on the world map venturing around, and in battle like a mix of D&D and Fire Emblem.\n\nThe characters (you choose from 10 of about 30 at the start, and can get a few more during the game as well), while they fit into classes, are all unique personality wise and many (though apparently not all) have interesting backstory events. They'll weigh in on your decisions, offering you advice, as well as reacting to choices you make causing them to gain/lose morale based on actions. Some are pious, adventurous, altruistic, greedy, narcisistic, etc and respond based on these traits. You can lose units for good (though not as easily as say, Fire Emblem, as falling in battle doesn't guarantee the unit dies, especially if you win anyway), as well.\n\nThe package is a little rough (graphics aren't the best, nor is the music or interface) but it's definitely extremely fun and I heavily recommend it.","May 31, 2013","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game itself is really enjoyable if you're an old Hero's of Might and Magic fan. Sure it doesn't play off the same build as HOMM but its near the same platform of a leader and troops ( class specific people ) along with resources to manage. It also plays off the old school game of Oregon Trail with it's random events generator. First hour you'll spend learning from mistakes and probably restarting. But once you get the basics down the rest is a fun game.\n\n1. Graphics aren't steller but fit well for the design.\n2. Replay value is pretty much based on the player. You'll basically have three styles to replay. Evil / Neutral / Good ,  but this doesn't mean you can't deviate from these paths and do hybrid paths. So it has a long list of choices to run. In all though you'll know the main events but as for text choices they all have an impact on your game.\n3. Value to listed price, I got my copy on steam with a 50% off sale for $10 and that alone was worth the game. Current price is $20 rounded. Would I buy this game at full price, sure once they bug fix and add more content. As for now I'd wait for a sale as it's only two maps. If they lowered the price to $15 I'd buy it now.\n4. The game developers on this game are very active in the steam forums and do answer the fans, that's a plus.\n5. The game itself is a good old school story game.\n6. Your actions do have an effect in game.\n7. Game has depth and isn't shallow.\n8. Game is still being worked on and made better.\n\nIf you like fast paced games then this won't be for you. If you enjoy story and well written dialogue along with a well placed turn based game with resource semi micro management then give this game a try. Like I said above its like Hero's of Might and Magic with The Oregon Trail.","August 3, 2013","true","59.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is an under-the-radar hidden gem that deserves a huge player base because it is simply that good,\n\nAs the name suggests you take charge of a group of Spanish Conquistators venturing to the New World. Are you there for fame, glory or riches? The choice is yours!\n\nThe game itself is an excellent mixture of RPG, map exploration, character/resource management and turn based combat. You can be diplomatic and seek alliances with natives to add local units to your group and peacefully aquire what you need ... or .... you can cut down the savage  and take what you want fom them without pity!\n\nIts great that a game like this doesn't shy away from topics because of politically correct considerations and just lets you play however you want.; as a bloodthirsty conqueror, a peaceful diplomat or somewhere between those too extremes.\n\nThe battles are a lots of fun (and genuinely hard! even at normal difficullty) and take the form of  turn based and hex-centered combat. The games graphics aren't astounding like say, Skyrims are, but they are in my opinion definately above average for a game that focuses as much on the RPG side of things as the combat.\n\nI took a chance on this game because it was on sale and because  I love the period in history its based on . However, if I could go back in time I would honestly have donated to the kickstarter campaign for this game and/or bought it at full price. It really is that good, and is probably one of only a handful of games I would ever say are worth their full price on Steam\n\nThis is a completely underrated gem that I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone, you could honestly pay full price for this game and not be disappointed. However if your still not convinced, add it to your wishlist and get this the moment its on sale.\n\nSo, what do you say ... are you man enough to seek your fortune across the seas in the New World? Are you a modern day Christopher Columbus or Hernán Cortés? Play Expeditions Conquistatdor and find out!","August 1, 2013","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first time you play it you will be convinced you don't like it. The interface is a little daunting. I was pretty sure I was not going to continue playing.. but for some reason I did. Then you take your party out of the city and your play sessions get a little longer each time. Next thing you know you are thinking about it when you are not even in front of the computer.\n\nIt is by no means easy. You really have to 'learn' the game. You can't waste a single resource or let your party sit idle at camp. Don't let fresh meat go to waste, preserve it! Turn those herbs into medicine, you will need it! Just figuring out how all that works was like a victory in itself (there are tutorials but they didn't work too well on me lol)\n\nThe encounters are fun, not always battles, but moral decisions too, and you realize you can't please everyone in your party with every decision you make.\n\nThe battles can be frustrating. I don't know if I have ventured too far too fast, but you come up against some tough guys. It seems like losing some fights is all part of the game. If you lose a battle, the game isn't over. You tend to your wounded, salvage what supplies you can and move on. It is demoralizing to lose but there is always next time, and when you pull off a flawless victory it makes it all the sweeter.\n\nThis game is like the great great grandchild of Seven Cities of Gold. The same sense of exploration and mystery is there. You never know how a village will react to you, or where your next meal is coming from. Sometimes diplomacy works, and sometimes it wastes time and loses you the initiative in an inevitable battle where every move counts. I can't tell you how many times a battle has turned because I made one bad move (damn that 'attack of opportunity')\n\nI have a feeling I will be playing this one for a while yet, and I look forward to it more and more after each session. Recommended, but beware it might take a bit of time for it to really hook you.","July 18, 2014","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The OST is both imaginative and entertaining to listen to, the art style is bright, colorful, and immersive, and the creative and experimental turn-based RPG elements are a blast to play once you get used to it. The writing is also very impressive, making you feel as if you are in the shoes of a real-life conquistador who has to face difficult challenges every day.\n\nOn a more negative note, the game, like most turn-based RPGs, can get extremely easy after a while, especially after you've been slaughtering hordes of Aztecs for hours on end. The interaction you have with your underlings, though well-written, is sparse, and doesn't give them enough personality so that you can care about them 100% of the time.\n\nAll in all, I think every stragety-loving person will find an amazing experience with this game.

This game is so refreshingly different from the other turned based strategy games around, and is great fun. I rarely write reviews, but feel like I must get the word out for this game.\nIn the game you lead a spanish expedition to the new world. You get to pick your initial party members from a pool of recruits, each of them has a unique bio, personality/traits, and skills. Your in-game decisions would affect party members differently depending on their personality. For example, trying to avoid a fight would please the peaceful members, but aggravate the aggressive one (morale dropping), killing natives would please the racist ones but anger the open-minded ones, etc. So far I found the "proud" ones are the best to keep because their morale always goes up after winning a battle, so it's easy to keep them happy as there are always battles.\nThe gameplay really consists of three parts, exploring, camping, and battles.\nExploring is similar to HOMM where you travel a set number of steps each day, picking up random resources, visiting towns and villages, and interacting with characters.\nThe camping system is quite original and the real meat of this game, where each night you assign different duties to party members. Hunters hunt, soldiers guard, scouts patrol (scanvenging resources), doctors make medicines or treat injuries if needed. There are also scholars who can research technologies or build traps that are used in battles.\nThere are not that many battles in the game (maybe 40 or so), but all battles are unique and very well designed. The battles could be harsh at the beginning when you havent leveled up or geared up. But once you get familiar with some of the battle mechanics like flanking and class abilities, it's not that hard. In the later Mexico campaign you would have access to most of the native classes as well as spanish ones. Mismatching the classes can bring more flavor to the battles. And just before you get tired of the battles, the game is over! Yes, the game is short by today's standard, but that's what I like about it. I can rarely finish a game nowadays.\nLast but not least, this game's writing is top-notch and really helps immersion. Reading the event descriptions and dialogues is like reading a novel.\n9/10, go get it!","July 9, 2014","true","49.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the very reasonable price, you get a clever game that balances some unique logistical mechanics with some more standard game elements, including some great rpg content.  The game forces you to make some tough decisions about how you're going to make your way through the world, and the difficulty is high enough to really tempt you to make some questionable moral choices in order to survive.  Character advancement and tactical combat are fairly standard, but well done - and they do a great job of reflecting the technology level of the setting (i.e., guns suck).\n\nA unique gaming experience, and plenty of content to keep you busy - while I'm not sure that I would replay, I've already invested 60+ hours of play time.","April 14, 2014","true","63.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After battle loss, you can limp back to town where some or all of your troops will need healing.

I did play on ironman mode to be fair (only auto saves), but I was between the second hardest diffuculty and normel the hole game, until the end where I had no choice but to lower it to easy, because I had no men left to fight with because they were all wounded from battles before. And don't smash me saying I just suck at commanding, no I dont I would almost win in all the stupid crazy hard battles but near the end I would be over run by the last few enemies because my men have no health left!\n\nSound 4/10 the music is basic and often repeated.\n\nGraphics 3/10 but given its not a triple A title I wont be to harsh, it is kickstarter backed and the enviroment is nice and the graphics are not bad don't get me wrong, but they wont catch your eye.\n\nCharacters 10/10 this relates to the story rating abit, the people in this game are amazing and there is a crazy amount of them to! Not to mention the realistic emotions and writting style.\n\nLength 5/10 The main story only takes about 20-30 hours if you only focus on playing that. the side quests and other content maybe add 20+ hours if you look hard and take your time.\n\nReplayablity 5/10 I am guessing here because so far I have only done 1 playthrough but I would say its most likely ok, but given the one direct path story line, only your choices would change anything.\n\nOver all Gameplay 40/70 or 6/10\n\n-Best book I ever played!\n\n\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is an under-the-radar hidden gem that deserves a huge player base because it is simply that good,\n\nAs the name suggests you take charge of a group of Spanish Conquistators venturing to the New World. Are you there for fame, glory or riches? The choice is yours!\n\nThe game itself is an excellent mixture of RPG, map exploration, character/resource management and turn based combat. You can be diplomatic and seek alliances with natives to add local units to your group and peacefully aquire what you need ... or .... you can cut down the savage  and take what you want fom them without pity!\n\nIts great that a game like this doesn't shy away from topics because of politically correct considerations and just lets you play however you want.; as a bloodthirsty conqueror, a peaceful diplomat or somewhere between those too extremes.\n\nThe battles are a lots of fun (and genuinely hard! even at normal difficullty) and take the form of  turn based and hex-centered combat. The games graphics aren't astounding like say, Skyrims are, but they are in my opinion definately above average for a game that focuses as much on the RPG side of things as the combat.\n\nI took a chance on this game because it was on sale and because  I love the period in history its based on . However, if I could go back in time I would honestly have donated to the kickstarter campaign for this game and/or bought it at full price. It really is that good, and is probably one of only a handful of games I would ever say are worth their full price on Steam\n\nThis is a completely underrated gem that I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone, you could honestly pay full price for this game and not be disappointed. However if your still not convinced, add it to your wishlist and get this the moment its on sale.\n\nSo, what do you say ... are you man enough to seek your fortune across the seas in the New World? Are you a modern day Christopher Columbus or Hernán Cortés? Play Expeditions Conquistatdor and find out!","August 1, 2013","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are dilemmas that stretch from the plot to the game's mechanics themselves. This game doesn't have "Moral Choices" this is the new world, there is no morality, only survival. You constantly have to be making decisions in this game that kill people, and most of the time it's up to you if those people are part of your party, or the locals. You're gonna feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by this game's conclusion, because being nice is just not pragmatic. Many of the hardest hitting moments in this game are non-scripted events, you may lose your best soldier to disease or desertion. You may have several random conversations with another soldier under your command, learn about their life, their family back in Spain, and then lose them to a native ambush. Maybe you really wanted to tend to everyone's wounds but you have three wounded men and only enough medicine for two.\n\nIn most other games, the moral choices are usually nothing more than fodder for repeat playthroughs, they might effect the plot or maybe your character's appearance, but the moral choices in this game always tie directly into the game's mechanics, maybe you really do want to be the generous savior of all the people, but if you gave that starving village some food you would be left with none of your own. I always felt like each choice actually mattered, but not in some telltale games way where characters react to me differently, each choice mattered because it was the difference between being alive and guilty, or dead and innocent.","March 23","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/237430/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A turn-based strategy game about exploring Mexico as a Spanish explorer. Graphics and sound are fine, story is pretty detailled and there's a good amount of events to read as you progress through the main storyline. The setting is pretty unique to me (not used as much as a world war setting) but don't expect complete historic accuracy.\n\nYou travel across the overworld and do quests, events, collect resources, and progress the storyline with the end goal of returning to Spain. It's turn-based so there is a limit to how far you can move each turn. As you do quests and events, you get XP to rank up your followers (which improves combat stats, unlocks a skill and increases equipment slots). At the end of the turn, you're forced to camp, set rationing of food, and set tasks for your followers (gather food, convert herbs to medicine, convert supplies to battle items, heal a wounded unit, patrol for a chance to find supplies, and guard to prevent theft). The resources you have to gather are food (each follower requires 1/day), valuables (used as currency and how well you did at the end of the game), medicine (used to heal followers), equipment (used to improve follower combat stats), and craft supplies (used to craft battle items).\n\nYou can lose a lot of resources from theft so may want to end your turn off the road (which has a very high guard difficulty) if the terrain nearby is any better. In the second part of the story, you'll find somewhere to store your valuables (instead of carrying them around to be stolen). However, since you deposit in intervals of 100, you can end up with a negative balance (which is kind of weird).\n\nThe camera is an overhead camera that gives you some degree of control but there are a few quirks. Going uphill seems to mess with the zoom so after you go downhill you need to manually zoom out again. It feels like the overworld camera is restricted for artistic vision (you can only see so far ahead of you) but I would've liked to zoom out a lot more (with fog for unexplored areas and unlit areas to show vision range) so I could see further and reorient myself easily.\n\nThe battle camera is alright but I'd still like the option to zoom out more for a big overview so I could quickly check where each enemy starts at the beginning of battles (instead of holding alt and panning around).\n\nIn battle it would be nice to check enemy stats in more detail than rank and class.\n\nYou can only set waypoints on the map on points of interest, it would have been nice to create your own waypoints anywhere. It's a little annoying that your movement waypoint disappears if an event box pops up so that you need to set your destination again.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed playing through the game. The story and events were the best part of the game for me. They were fun to read and it was nice you could roleplay a personality through different choices. The combat TBS part was good enough- there was unit variety, skills, combat cover, traps, and tactics. It's worth a try if you like reading story and turn-based strategy games like heroes of might & magic (without the fantasy setting- no magic/spell system).","August 9, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, I do not recommend this game.\n\nThe best summary I can think of is this: "Things go poorly and people die."\n\nThis is a game about being uncomfortable and frustrated, facing the harsh reality that enthusiasm and hope do not produce sucess. You will run out of food, and will have to decide who goes hungry. You will run out of medicine, and must triage your party to determine who should survive a failed hunt or even a spider bite. You will lose combat encounters because you are consistently outnumbered and have only the same options and attributes your enemy does.\n\nThe caveat is that despite all of your failings, the game will rarely, if ever, hand you a simple game over. Enthusiasm and hope may not produce success, but tenacity comes close. In the end, though, success in Expeditions: Conquistador won't  look like traditional video game success. It will look like you failed forward with some unknown force preventing your necrotic body and hollow spirit from simply dying and escaping this hell.\n\nTo reiterate and elaborate: I do not recommend this game. But, if you read all the above and still want to experience limbo and/or eternal damnation in the form of Spanish Conquistadors exploring Hispaniola and Mexico, by all means go ahead and purchase the game.","August 10, 2015","false","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the definition of an underrated hidden gem. Its a matter of opinion but for me this game easily one of my all time favorite in my 25+ years of gaming.\n\nIf you haven't tried it at least give it a chance. If its the type of game you enjoy you won't be disappointed. Mexico is where the game really shines.\n\nSupport the devs! Their next game Vikings looks even better and I would love to see them continue with this awesome series.\n\nWell done Logic Artists!","February 4","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitana/recommended/237430/","mitana","lmitana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitana/","44 products in account","This is an old-school PC game, with lot of saving/reloading. It consists of Heroes-like overland map and Fallout-like combat and dialogues. There's lot of adrenaline battles, as when your last expedition member succumbs to the last surviving enemy, or there is one last enemy alive when time's out. Combat is never repetitive, as environment, day cycle, number/type of enemies and goals always change (kill everyone, survive for certain number of turns, get to the escape zone or kill everyone in limited number of turns). There are plenty of nasty random events on the overland map that add spice to the gameplay and can be fatal sometimes. I was outraged by this game at first (because it is so different from today's typical Steam offering), but believe me, it's a gem!","February 7","true","57.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reducing the graphic settings got me through parts of the game, until this method didn't work anymore later on a different map. Maybe it could have used some more optimization.\nThere are prettier and bigger games out there that can do with less resources.\n\nIt is unfortunate that such issues arise that late in the game, otherwise a demo version could have helped in testing the game prior to a purchase.","January 14","false","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to restart it after the first 6 hours though due to not quite getting some of its importance.  But still, its a slow burner of a game with a very slow power build up. I liked the ending to it too.\n\nIf I had to say something negative was it was a little stressful at times due to the random encounters and not getting ambushed out of nowhere.","February 17","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
