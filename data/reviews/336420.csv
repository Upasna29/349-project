Then you are going to love this game.\n\nIt's a bunch of MOBA-esque things, like building items, the top-down view and QWER abilities, but instead of going against another team you're fighitng against hordes of mobs. Surprisingly difficult, but an absolute blast to play with other people. Plenty of unlockables as you play on harder difficulties and work your way up the ladders with your favored characters, each of which have different flavors that are all neat in their own way.\n\nAnd that five pack is just so damn affordable.","April 2, 2015","true","16.8"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/recommended/336420/","tejan","Tejan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/","450 products in account","It pains me to write this review, but since all of the reviews are from when the game first released I need to say something about the game.\n\nFirst, the game's online community is dead. The average is about 18 concurrent players online. For a game that is multiplayer centric a community as dead as this is a death sentence out the gate.\nSecond, the game is now abandoned. The developers gave us one update then jumped ship and moved onto Vermintide.\nNow if you're like me and got a pack of the game to play with friends you won't need to worry about other players joining you, but you will run into what made the community die off.\n\nProsThe game's setting and characters are pretty neat. It takes the characters of Krater and places them in an arena where they fight for others enjoyment.\nThe announcer is pretty funny in short bursts, after awhile he'll really start to grate on your nerves. (Seriously, after you hear "Will the gladiator be able to put that item to good use?" for the 50th time it gets a bit annoying.) Luckily you can turn off the announcer in the settings if you get tired of him.\nThe core gameplay is that of any hero defense game, so it's solid and pretty fun.\nDifferent wave length, I believe they're 3 waves, 5 waves, 8 waves, and endless, which allows you to play for as long, or short, as you want.\nConsThe progression system. While it's nice to have a progression system, how it was done was completely assinine. To put it into simple terms, you need to do certain things in game; however, they're often things that you would need to grind out as opposed to getting them through normal play through. (For example: the Medicus needs to heal some below 10% health 300 times. If you're letting teammates get that low you're a bad healer.)\nI've been pretty vocal on both the developer's forums and the Steam forums about how this could be changed, but not once has any of it been addressed by the developers.\nLack of content. The game has 8 maps and 8 characters, 2 characters of each class.\nNow there's only 3 maps I can think of that get played frequently. Pharma Initiative is the most played due it being the easiest to defend, Abandoned Mine is sometimes played since you can easily farm all the neutrals every round, and Rooftop Rumble is used when going for achievement farming as you can glitch out the AI and make it walk back and forth and never attack anything. So if you play the game chances are you're either going to play on Pharma or Mines, and due to how the games progression system works you're probably going to continuously play the same character over and over.\nBugs that have continued to go unpatched.\nOdd design decisions. From the missile silo, what you're protecting, being able to be attacked despite previous defenses still in place, to one of the healers only forms of damage actively pushing enemies out of other heroes skills there's a lot that seems really amateur.\nHonestly, I have many more nitpicks, but I've not played the game in some time so I can't remember them off the top of my head.\n\nIn short, the game is fun for awhile if you have a group to play with, but you should NEVER pick this up alone and hope to find people in game.\n\nThat being said though, the Dota 2 hero defense custom games are just as fun as this game and have better developer response, assuming you speak the same language as the map creator. Not to mention that they're free compared to the $25 you'd need to play this with a group of friends.\n\nUpdate on 2/26/2016 was only to fix formatting and grammar. Also added in the devs officially abandoning the game.","August 23, 2015","false","53.4"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/336420/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Bloodsports.TV comes to us in the form of a MOBA that makes you a mass murderer on reality TV and has fun doing it. Mixing ‘Beyond the Thunderdome’ with a classic MOBA formula, Bloodsports.TV tries to make itself stand out in the quickly crowding field of MOBA’s. While it doesn’t exactly succeed at being wholly unique in the genre, there is definitely fun to be had despite some limitations.\n\nYou get to play as murderous gladiators, thrown into battle to defend your missile silo from wave after wave of men being thrown at you in order to destroy the silo before the missile launches. Almost sadly, the wave after wave of men are simple villagers just trying to stop your maniacal band from launching said missile at their village. But if they wanted to stop their homes and families from being blown to kingdom come, they should be better at fighting! Am I right?\n\nYou can play this in a couple of different arenas and as you progress you unlock new items in either single player or online with a squad. The squad, of course, needs to be balanced with the usual healers, tanks etc. to make your squad of vicious gladiators the most vicious out there. The game tells you right off the bat that this is the best way to play, but out of stubbornness, I saw how deep I could go on my own. Turns out, you shouldn’t argue with the developers.\n\nThe multiplayer is definitely the bread and butter of the game and there’s some good ol’ fashioned MOBA fun to be had with Bloodsport.TV. With the right team, you can delve deep into the game, making mince meat of the villagers who are ever increasing in number and difficulty. Each map has a shop on it so you can purchase whatever boosts or items you may need to help you make it through and they are accessible at any time. Though, going to get a weapon boost mid-battle may end up costing your team, so it’s best to be used wisely. The six arenas were definitely a big plus as each of them ended up being quite contained. The variation was a welcome change to keep things interesting.\n\nThe art-style is something that helps set it apart from other games as it features some cell-shading and each of the gladiators are quite distinctive. The villagers however, not so much. The art really gels well with the absurd and post apocalyptic setting that the game brings, so that really stood out.\n\nOn the other hand, the music as well as the commentary from the host of the show stood out in a completely different way. The commentary had a limited number of sayings that were repeated quite often and the music is actually just on a loop, so it didn’t take long before I was playing the game on mute. There was also a bizarre difficulty setting that let you augment how tough your opponents are which seems like a good idea. Except that there’s around a dozen settings and some of them feel like you haven’t changed anything at all while others feel like you’ve gone from 0-100 with the click of a button.\n\nThe ‘Path to Glory’ system, which is how you progress in the game, did feel a little lacklustre as many of the ‘challenges’ you had to complete largely consisted of ‘X number of enemies to defeat’. While the health, strength and ability upgrades were helpful, I felt that the ‘Path to Glory’ system was unnecessarily complicated and could have just as easily leveled you up without the challenges.\n\nWhile Bloodsports.TV is a decent entry to the genre, it isn’t without its flaws. It can be chaos with a fully loaded team and an army of enemies which can either annoy or delight you. It has an art style that I really liked and helped compliment the setting and tone of the game but suffered from the music on a loop and repetitive commentary. It has plenty of character and arena differences to keep the gameplay from becoming stagnant, but its difficulty settings increase either too little or way too much. And while the leveling system is overly complicated, having a squad that knows how to use their characters properly can level you up quickly and you can punch through the game efficiently.\n\nIf there are MOBA fans out there who are willing to deal with the good as well as the bad, Bloodsports.TV is a decent entry into the field. It will give you a fun gaming experience that is equally zany and competitive. That said, you might want to play with the in-game sound off.","February 29","true","21.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

MOBA without the PvP competitive toxicity meets MMO raiding and bosses without the loot treadmill. The adjusting AI means solo players can do well, and the community is decent. 10USD may be high, but the game is quite enjoyable.\n\nI had been watching the game before launch, and picked it up in a bundle. The voice acting and visuals were a bit cringy, but I've grown to like them as the gameplay hooked me. It's easy to jump on, launch a server, and smash waves solo. Eventually the server will pick up some players, and you'll find the game really improves with teamwork. Several servers are active but full or password-protected, and netcode bugs will lead to rare disconnects. I'm enjoying the gameplay and progression system, and I'd recommend looking into Bloodsports on a sale or with a group of friends.","May 21, 2015","true","15.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Essentially, it's a cross between a MOBA and tower defense game.  It's like the former in the sense that you'll choose a character (there are four characters for each of the four classes, each with different skills) and start at level 1 at the beginning of each match.  As you level up, you can put points into your four skills and buy new items to place into your inventory.  Instead of fighting other heroes, you'll be fending off waves of enemies (where the tower defense bit comes into play) who are trying to get to your missile silo.  As you play a particular class, you'll level them up in a "path of glory" tech-tree/xp tree-esque system which unlocks different buffs and the like.

The game truly plays best in a group as unlike previous Hero Defence games you can’t just stack all agility and solo the whole game. There’s a good variety in items and heroes to use, with a decent number of maps to keep things from getting to stale. You also have to do combat with elite and boss minions who actually reward skill through dodging abilities and using your abilities and classes effectively. In saying that the bosses are quite bland and poor AI and pathing leads some silly situations.\n\nOutside of the core gameplay there is some humour and some callouts to the original game “Krater”. There is some external progression that is a little questionable but it being a PVE game is can get away with it. There is an endless mode and a leaderboard so there really is never ending content if that’s your kind of thing. I highly advise to get your friends into this game or make some, it can be hard at times to find people.\n\nI can recommend it, especially at this price (yo that 5 pack :O).

Bloodsports.TV is a multiplayer online battle arena game from Fatshark and Toadman Interactive. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nBy now you’ve all played either League of Legends, or DOTA, or Smite, etc. Or, you live under a rock. My first experience in the MOBA world was Guardians of Middle-Earth and I anticipated every other MOBA I played after that would be, essentially, very similar. While B.TV is similar to your run of the mill MOBA, the object of the game is different and a lot less stressful. Rather than fighting the enemy team, you’re working with your team to defend your base against waves of enemies. It’s a blast.\n\nI love the artwork in this game. I’ve been a fan of it ever since i first played Krater, another great addition to the gaming world from Fatshark. It’s like a less serious, Fallout style post-apocalyptic wasteland full of Scandinavians. What’s not to love? And the character designs are just fantastic.\n\nThe music is great, the controls are simple, the items are creative and fun, and the horde-style gameplay will keep you coming back for more.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThere wasn’t really anything that turned me off to the game while I was playing. We can just move along.\n\nThe Meh\n\nBecause it’s not one of the bigger name MOBAs, the community is pretty small and all but dead as far as I can tell. Don’t let that deter you though if you’re really wanting to play. It’s a fun game nonetheless.\n\nAlso, you have to pay to get the game itself, unlike other MOBAs.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nBloodsports.TV is a solid MOBA game and, if you’re a fan of Krater, you’re going to like it. If it goes on sale, don’t hesitate to pick it up and give it a try. As always, thanks for reading.","August 15, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love it just as much as I do the game before it, Krater, in which this game uses the Krater universe and characters and they bring all their cool skills with them and it is fun as hell. I made a online match and people joined and we all had fun going 10 waves as the Medikus, the tank, support, and dps, fighting off waves of monsters to not destroy our missile silo. The best game I can compare it to is Heroes of the Storm with no minions. You protect towers and ultimately your silo from defeat by AI controlled minions, by yourself or with friends. You can level up your skills while playinng and can buy items from the shop, all just like other familiar moba games. This doesn't really have a ton of ♥♥♥♥♥-footing around trying not to get hit or seen as your minions rank up exp for you. It doesn't work that way. Your coins come from your kills only. It's either you by yourself playing SP fighting hordes of monsters, or play with a friend or get someone online to help even the score and play moba style for some good fun. The teamwork pays off and wins rounds so use what you have to benefit the team and you should be okay. The only issue is that it is basically a mp game and barely anyone plays it so it won't last much longer probably. But even so, I still find a few games each time I boot it up. However sometimes they are all too high lvl so I make my own and sometimes ppl join, sometimes not. Depends on the time and the day.\n\nI love Krater's universe and this is a nice extension. Graphics look awesome, so do effects. Sound is awesome and music is great if a bit repetitive. Game controls really well also. One great universe worth making more games off of for sure. Krater 2 would be real nice.\n\n8/10 fun stuff","May 18, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where as the coop mode in a moba would pit you against AI bots of other heroes this is purely just wave defense. It's fun with friends and the easier difficulties are rather easy while the harder difficulties get much harder a lot faster. Simply put, it's a couple hours of fun at a time since after 2 me and my friend started getting bored of the game but we will probably play it again during some down time in the future.\n\nMy one gripe is that there are only 8 people to choose from, 2 dps, 2 tanks, 2 crowd control, and 2 healer classes. While they are all pretty cool and unique I do hope they add more in the future, one of the great things about mobas in general is you get all those characters to choose from that it takes a long time before it gets stale. That is where this game fails in my opinon. It is still however a really fun game with friends for the price. Just maybe don't expect to get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it.","April 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is for you. (Not worth for solo though).\n=============\n\nMeet Bloodsports, a futuristic take on ancient Roma's gladiators. You play a character among 8, each with a set of class skills geared towards one of the classic MMO roles (tanker, striker, healer, crowd-controller) to take on hoards of enemies and defend a nuclear missile (your core).\n\nGame is classic in mechanics but very good in implementing them. Each class has its own feeling and variety of tactics, combining skills and items to bring out powerful abilities.\n\nObviously the game is made to be played with friends. It's nice to play a few hours in solo but gets repetitive quickly. With friends, it's basically up to your own love for the genre.\n\nAs for realization, nothing to criticize: the art is nice and develops an identity to the universe, music and off-voice contribute weel to the cynical atmosphere, and I have no memory of any bug.\n\nAlthough it's no more updated, unfortunately, game is still worth its full price. You'll net between 10 and 40 hours of fun depending on your taste for the genre and how many friends you play with.\nWhen on sales, it's a premium pick if you have at least 2 other friends interested.","February 12","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

TV has a very simple concept. It play's like a online battle arena, but the goal is not to destroy the base of other players. This game is a wave based survival game where the main goal is to protect a rocket and fight until the game is over.\n\nGraphics are pretty awesome. The cell shaded look is really nice and some of the character models look really nice. Overall there's not much to talk about the art style.\n\nThe soundtrack is really good as it's composed by Mega Drive (Also did Hotline Miami). The sound effects in game though aren't that good. Some of the voice acting is incredibly bad.\n\nThe game has co op but there's a big problem. The game is already dead so if you do buy it be prepared to either get friends who play the game or play solo which get's boring really quickly.\n\nYou can choose how long do you want the matches to be. But the best decision is to make the matches four waves long as it doesn't last too long and it's just the right amount of time.\n\nI didn't encounter any bugs while playing the game. There is a minor problem where sometimes my character wouldn't do a spell even though I had enough mana.\n\nOverall Bloodsports.TV is a really good idea and the execution is really good, but the game is dead and playing Solo isn't that fun.  I do suggest trying the game if you have friends who play it or you don't mind playing solo.

Not exactly a MOBA but I can see some similarities, but not much. It's more along the lines of  Sanctum without the need to build towers as the towers are already on the map when you start. Also minus the whole FPS thing. But I highly recommend Bloodsports TV, particularly if you enjoy the Krater universe as it is based in that world.\n\nI have only played a few matches and I can see the potential in the game and can safely give it a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.  There are many things I think they could do to improve the game, but the core gameplay is good and fun.","March 31, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

A nice varaiety of characters to choose from with an array of maps to choose from, being a nice change from the same maps in DOTA and LoL. The enemies may be very similar although Bosses can be a challenge (especially if played in solo). The game is best played in Co-Op due to the difficulty of the levels, however the more payers you have, the harder the level will be.\n\nFatshark are also very much behind the game so I'm hoping that support for the game will continue and more features/heroes/maps will come in the future.","March 31, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This is put simply, is DOTA or League of Legends without the PVP. It takes all the stress and insults out of the two, and creates a wonderfully fun Co-op MOBA experience. Instead of other players/champions, there's LOTS of creeps, heroes, and bosses. The heroes and bosses have abilities similar to the ones you have and that you'd find in a MOBA game, to keep combat interesting. If you have a few friends and enjoy a good Co-op horde/defense game, this one is fantastic.\n\nPros:\n* Good visuals\n* Entertaining gameplay\n* Large map and difficulty selection\n* Good amount of items and combinations\n* Runs well and no glitches yet\n* Interesting and unique champions\n* Good amount of enemy types\n* Can host games with ease (No VPNs or dedicated server hosting)\n\nCons:\n* Only 2 champions per Class\n* Can lack replayability\n* Small community\n* No in game voice chat or callouts\n* Only one skin per champion/lack of personalization\n\nDefinitely worth it for the price, total steal for anything less in my opinion. 7.5/10\n","April 23, 2015","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's concept is amazing. For 10$ its so worth the price. Even if the game has a small pool of content, the amount of fun you can have with it is incredible.\n\nThe devs seem to be pretty patching it rather regularly and listening to what the community wants. Right now they're taking suggestions for items in the next patch.\n\nThe first few games you have to play a limited wave game mode, but this isnt a bad thing. I tried out all of the different archetypes and learned the mechanics of the game over the course of these games. Once you've gotten a few achievements down the "path of glory" progression system, you'll unlock the Endless game mode. THIS is where I really started enjoying the game. I've always been a fan of making stupid builds in MOBAs, and in endless, you really get to see whatever crazy build you can come with shine. There's a pretty wide assortment of items in the game already, and on top of that you can buy implants for 1000 gold which take up no space in your inventory but add permanent stats.","April 27, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like the concept of this game. And it is fun. The problem is that it gets old. Fast. Enemies are always the same. The classes get stale once you figure out a few build combinations. Not enough people play it to find a server you like. The biggest issue is that this is an online-only game and it's laggy WAY more often than it runs smooth (although, disabling shadows really helped with this)\n\nHaving said all that... it's only 10 bucks. So, for the price, everything here (bad or good) is perfectly acceptable. If this were a $20 game or higher... then no, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nthings I especially like:\n-the swedish vibe (character names, etc)\n-the announcer's voice (reminds me a bit of Robbaz)\n-art style\n-freedom to build characters however you like, and still be mostly effective","April 27, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially they took the team work of a MOBA and added a defense game with waves like those in dungeon defenders. So far I have only tipped my tow into the game, but as you progress in a match you do the normal buy this weapon to build that weapon etc..... You gain levels and put points in QWER just like a normal moba.... There is also a a good amount of characters with different roles like healers etc,.... As you defeat each wave sometimes you will be thrown a boss or creeps with special attributes that do certain types of damage AOE, DOT, and other single targeted damage. The game itself is pretty fun alone, but you will only get the most out of it playing with friends to utilize the different difficulty and class combos as a whole. The game seems to run pretty good and doesn't look like so cartoonish. I would say the art style is that of borderlands ( which isn't a bad thing at all ). Would I recommend this game ? Yes..... Because those people who have friends that play mobas and just want to play a different take on it will enjoy it..... Those who never played a moba will also be able to use this game to play with friends to see how they like that genre without having to deal with BS from communities if they are no good. I haven't ran into any bugs and would say the game in it's current state is pretty polished... The bottom line for $10 you're getting a lot of content from a genre that has become copy and paste.

It mixes diferent genres into one game in an interesting way. It has the moba elements in which you have a shop to buy upgrades and level up your abilities upto 4 levels each and sort of jungling elements.\n\nThe gamemodes available are certain number of waves with a boss at the end of the run and endless mode where you keep on fighting till you lose your base.\n\nIt has the typical MMO holy trinity, tank, healer, dps and also the crowd control classes. From what I have experienced so far you will need 1 of each class to succeed unless there are super crazy people with builds and skills that can pull off a certain group setup.\n\nThere are a good number of maps to play on. There is an overall progression tree or ranking system on which you level up depending on what class you are playing with. For example healing for a total of 25k hp ranks you up on the healer progression path and so on. Also there is a leaderboard for the hardcores who like to climb up the rankings.\n\nHaven't played  it much but I am planning on playing it more. Game is enjoyable even while running with random people. From the matches I played the community seems friendly and I hope it stays that way.\n\nGame is recommended if you are looking for a good co-op pve game.","April 2, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best part of this game is assembling a team, picking your roles (classes), and going to battle with AI. The developers have managed to remove all the grinding BS of MMOs introduce and give us just distilled experience of raiding. You bring your best the table, you fight, you win or you fail.\n\nYou want to go toe to toe with the big bad boss, play a Tank. Smack that dude in the face, ♥♥♥♥ him off, and let your teammates drain his health while you keep his aggression on you.\n\nFeel the need to help? Play a healer. Keep the tank alive as he grapples with the boss & heal the ancillary classes as they get aggro (when they shouldn't).\n\nFeel like dishing out some pain? Play direct damage, run around all psycho like and shred the enemies just try not to get noticed by too many lest they all get together and smash you before the healer gets to you.\n\nWant to spread chaos, play Crowd Control. Help the tank smash the boss, and keep the minions at bay.\n\nCONS\ncrowd control class doesn't play like a traditional crowd control but more like another dps class with a stun added in to their repertoire.\ntutorial doesn't explain the shop/item purchasing system well at all\ndocumentation for the game seems non-existent and doesn't explain shop/item purchasing system well\nPROS\nExcellent COOP experience\nGreat game mechanics\nVisually appealing game aesthetic (graphics/UI)\nNo grinding, you can drop right into the action (once you know what you're doing)\nBecause its PVE/AI you don't have to deal with toxic/hate filled voice chat\nSteam operates in a binary recommend it yes or no, but if it scored this I'd rate the game 90% the lack of documentation/explanation of store/class/builds is a large knock in my book.\n","June 5, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That’s fine on a mechanical level, and fine as an entry for players who have MOBAs as a touchstone, but it does a disservice to what Bloodsports.TV does well. Bloodsports.TV will need word of mouth from experienced players to sell it and save it from lazy comparisons.\n\nIt’s good. It’s fun and it’s a welcome return to a universe that could well have slipped into obscurity. Given that Bloodsports.TV is the price of a sandwich and a coffee it’s an easy sell, give it a chance and it could well develop all the intricacies that I was hoping for as well.\n\nhttp://www.permanent-beta.net/reviews-1/2015/4/7/bloodsportstv","July 6, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great co-op action killing waves of enemies. The gameplay is really solid and fun. There are currently only a few bosses in the game who appear on every map and only 8 characters to play.\n\nStill with its minor flaws, I would highly recommend Bloodsports.TV, it's a lot of fun and will keep you coming back to unlock the next achievement and set a new high score.\n\nUPDATE! Community is basically dead and no updates in a long time. A great game if you have friends to play with, otherwise pass.","April 22, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
