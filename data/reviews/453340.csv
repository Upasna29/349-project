"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agoddamnbatman/recommended/453340/","agoddamnbatman","Hermit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agoddamnbatman/","400 products in account","Overall, Hustle Cat is a great game. There are a few niggling issues that might be easily fixed but honestly none of them are major enough to detract from what is an incredibly enjoyable game.\nHustle Cat is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time. I was immediately attracted to the project; being a cat lover and appreciating its nonbinary options (and Graves having an uncanny resemblance to my husbando) made me back the kickstarter right away.\n\nSome basic info:\nYou can pick your pronouns (She/Her, He/Him, They/Them) and what Avery looks like (you have between masculine presenting and feminine presenting and a range of skin tones) but you cannot change the name. You can change which pronouns you want in the menu, whenever you like.\nYou can romance any of the characters regardless of any options you pick, however one character is a secret option.\nOne play through lasts about 2.5 hours to 3 hours. Any subsequent ones will take less if you skip. There are 6 routes in total. There are bad ends.\n\nThe good stuff:\nThe writing is incredibly enjoyable. It's certainly on the meme-y side of things, but the jokes were great, many had me giggling out loud. A lot of scenes made me cry; but YMMV. The characters are all very likeable and have great chemistry with each other. There are so many scenes I enjoyed, and honestly it was just such a fun experience playing it.\nThe routes are fairly flexible. Some visual novels I have played tend to lock you in pretty early and with obvious choices, but with Hustle Cat they have a points system. Don't feel like picking one option will lock you in to that character.\nThe art is mostly great. I really like a lot of the sprites, many of the characters have great poses and expressions that really reflect their character. Art is always important in visual novels as it tends to be what people judge the game on, and I think for the most part Hustle Cat does a great job.\nThe characters are all great. I was immediately draw to Graves, but then began to love Finley and Mason too. And then Hayes, Landry and Reese… Unlocking the secret route involves putting time in with everyone, but I don't believe any one of these characters routes was anything less than enjoyable.\nThis is an incredibly inclusive game! The fact that you can choose your pronouns and date anyone regardless of gender is incredibly amazing and honestly something that just cannot be faulted, unless you are against anything vaguely 'SJW-like'. The inclusivity is not harming you in any way and you don't have to romance anyone you don't want to; if the games inclusivity bothers you in any way then this just isn't the game for you.\n\nA few issues:\nThe screenshot button and steam overlay do not work. The game is easily tabbed out of, but I found the fact I couldn't take screenshots with steam really quite disappointed. I wanted to share things with friends who had already played the game and had to use a different piece of software to do so.\nThis is more or less severe depending on taste, but while I thought the majority of the sprites were good, some of the CG were disappointing. In particular I think of Mason's end CG, which seems to be unshaded and just looks a lot worse compared to the other CG. It almost seems like it was a time issue; the CG simply looks a little unfinished.\nThe skip button is okay, but could be better. The transitions still take a while and so spamming space bar is often a bit quicker.\nThe story feels a little disjointed in some places, and the pacing is rather quick. At one point Avery started talking about their crush; I had no idea who it was and how it happened! I know that it was because of a choice I made, but it doesn't make much sense if you play it without realizing that you effectively skipped a scene. I suppose this gave some suspense as to who I was actually romancing… I would've liked it to have been longer so I could spend more time with the characters, but of course I would have expected the price to be more too. In my opinion, this game is good value for money at full price.\nThere are so few save files! Having played a fair amount of visual novels I am used to having pages and pages of save files, but I found Hustle Cat a bit lacking.\n\n\nI enjoyed Hustle Cat immensely and am so glad I backed it on kickstarter. Whether you're interested in the plot, the cats, the characters, the inclusivity, or something else, you will find this game enjoyable. Visual novel purists might be turned off by the game's elements that are atypical of the genre, but I believe anyone interested in the premise or any of the game's aspect will find it enjoyable. If in doubt, wait for steam sale, but if you're in any way excited by the game, buy it now. Thanks Date Nighto, I won't be forgetting Hustle Cat for a long time.","March 17","true","9.0"," 86 of 104 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","86","104","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dyma12/recommended/453340/","dyma12","dyma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dyma12/","109 products in account","First, I want to note as a caveat, I have played only two of the game's six routes thus far (with the women, cause i'm gay). Note my time played - 3.5 hours, as of when I'm writing this. Unless some of the men's routes are much longer, which I seriously doubt, I can't imagine getting more than nine hours out of this. MAYBE if you really like rereading VNs. Even then, most VN's I've got through steam are quite a bit longer. (I've since finished all routes)\n\nI'm glad I played this game, but in good conscience I cannot recommend a game this short at this price. It is a VERY, VERY short game, and the price it's at as of my writing this review (17.99 USD) is just totally unreasonable.\n\nETA: I've played all six routes now. Total play time 8.1 hours on record (I did kinda blitz through the mens' routes; like I said, I'm gay and biased towards the women). They were all very well written and engaging, with good art and interesting characters. I stand by everything else I've said in this review - including, unfortunately, my non-recommendation.\n\nI can see why it's priced high; it clearly has very high quality art and text and music (particularly considering that there are six versions of Avery's face). But from a consumer standpoint it's really hard to justify.\n\nSo, on to the good.\n\nThe art is excellent, and the writing is great. Mason's route actually had me in tears. Finley is absolutely adorable. The beginning, and some short parts near the end, got a bit repetitive, but overall I liked all the different routes, how you learn different things about the characters etc.\n\nI like the ability to choose the pronouns for Avery, your character, and also independently select your appearance (there's a more 'masculine' and a more 'feminine' face available, and you can choose between three skin tones as well). This is reflected pretty well in the gameplay as well, though there were a couple awkward moments in Finley's route where a side character's dialogue seemed to be making the assumption that Avery was male, and noone corrected him? (The pronouns still fit, it was a broader text issue. Maybe just me.)\n\nAnd some small complaints, other than the length of the game. These don't affect my (non)-recommendation.\n\nThere's no text speed option that I saw, so you kind of have to click your way through each sentence of dialogue at a pretty rapid pace if you read pretty quickly. This can also lead to accidentally clicking past a certain portion of dialogue too early because you were trying to get all the sentences displayed, which leads to another quibble...\n\nMost other VN's I've read/played, you can scroll back at least a bit to see something you might've just missed. Hustle Cat, for some reason, does not. There IS a log, so if you just missed something you can open that and see the recent text, but it's odd that you can't just scroll back a little bit. I assume this is in Ren'Py, which I KNOW can do that.\n\nAlso, this isn't something I'm actually concerned with at all, but I know some people prefer much more interactive VN's. This isn't; in all of the routes, the first third of the game is making some basic decisions about who you get close to, which determines which route you're on; the middle third is non-interactive; and the last third may have one player choice which either immediately leads to a bad end or continues the story to the end. Again, I don't mind this at all, personally; just putting it out there for people who would.","March 19","false","8.1"," 92 of 121 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","92","121","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gracie320/recommended/453340/","gracie320","Cheerm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gracie320/","189 products in account","What really tuned me into the game was as the protagonist you can not only choose female or male pronouns but also nonbinary pronouns like they/them. That was neat! Also regardless of what character looks you go for both are the same height.\n\nThis VN doesn't go beyond kissing so its not very explicit. You get 6 character routes! 2 ladies and 4 fellas. Some of them are PoC (another ++ for me because representation is important! :D ) And you can romance any of 'em regardless of the gender you choose.\n\nThe story is really cute and it'll have you squeeing at certain scenes. Planning to upload lots of screenshots when I figure out why I can't take snapshots in game on Steam.\n\nThe music is great. I haven't seen any of the positive reviews mention this but its like really good elevator music. Like if an elevator was playing some of the tracks that I was listening to in Hustle Cat I'd probably stay on that elevator a little longer d: Like I had hustle cat playing on certain scenes for certain tracks while I was just doing stuff on my computer lolol.\n\nSome complaints I'd probably have is how I can't delete saves lol. Like there are so few complaints that I have about hustle cat and majority of them are just glitches like eyes/nose missing from faces and it happens just a few times but it doesn't really take away from how awesome it is. But there are things on Steam that I've noticed happens frequently like when I fast forward on hustle cat it crashes. But again other than all these really small things it really doesn't take away from a great story and characters that you can't help but adore.\n\nOver-all no regrets. You get 6 character routes which is about 15 hours of play time(20+ for me because I just couldn't stop replaying Mason's story before moving on) for a really cute and good story with really great music and really, really adorable characters that aren't perfect which make them perfect. Like I can name one trait(besides all of them being super adorable) that really shine in each of the characters but I think you'd probably wanna figure that out yourself.\n\nP.S. there are cats. Theres this one drunk cat I wish I could post a picture of but just look for it if you get this game.\n\nSo basically you get: Cats, diverse characters, Cats, Coffee, Donuts, adorableness. And Cats.","March 27","true","21.6"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","38","44","3","0"

The writing is lovely - not particularly deep and sometimes a little cheesy, but always relateable, interesting, and easy to go along with.  The romances are all EXTREMELY cute and really lovely; there's no toxic relationship ideals in this game, all the characters are well rounded and doing their best.\n\nHonestly?

That's how much I love this game!\n\nThe following is a copy of my review on itch.io.\n\n"I backed this game on Kickstarter and I'm so glad I did! I've only done one route so far (Finley's) but I have to say this game is stellar. The dialogue is so fun and natural, and all of the characters have such great personalities. Usually when I play a VN there's at least one character I can't stand, but with this I love all of them! The plot's real neato too. As I said, I've only done one route so far, but I can't wait to do the rest to get to the bottom of this little café.\n\nOne of the main reasons I backed this game was because of the nonbinary protag. I'm nonbinary myself and I'd never seen a game before that actually recognized my existence. You can choose pronouns at the start of the game and switch them whenever you want while playing. It's so nice that Date Nighto went the extra mile to make sure this game was inclusive to everyone. It just makes me so happy!\n\nAs you can probably see from screenshots, this game is gorgeous. The character art is fab and the backgrounds are super pretty too - it's clear a lot of love was put in by the artists. The GUI is fantastic looking too. I know it might sound weird to say, but a nice GUI really gives a VN a more unique and polished feeling. I've played tons of VNs, and the same rectangular text box begins to stale after a while. All the visual aspects of this game are just so polished!\n\nTL;DR I really can't recommend this game enough. If you've never played a VN before, this is a great place to start. And if you're a veteran of the genre like me, you'll find a totally new and fun experience with Hustle Cat!\n\n5 Cat's Paws out of 5!"","March 16","true","8.0"," 63 of 100 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","63","100","6","2"

Its overall vibe is very sweet.\n\nIn Hustle Cat, you play as 19-year-old high school graduate Avery Grey, currently crashing at their aunt's while looking for a job to help pay the bills. After scouring the internet for job openings and cat videos, Avery comes across a cute cat café in the neighbourhood, and they're hiring! That immediately ricochets Avery into the world of coffee, cats, latte art, ridiculously cute co-workers, and their mysterious new goth boss. But some of the cats Avery encounters near the café look an awful lot like their new friends...\n\nThe Good+ You get to pick pronouns, skin tones & body type looks for Avery\n+ The cute pastel meme/internet aesthetic\n+ You can initially romance 4 guys & 2 gals\n+ Everybody has various, distinct & interesting personalities\n+ Avery is no passive pushover protagonist\n+ The overall story is quite interesting\n\nThe Bad- The romance-specific endings are a bit short\n- The game is a little buggy; sometimes it crashes randomly or the skip button doesn't work\n- Some of the proportions on the CG art are a little off\n- Not all the story elements surrounding the supernatural angle are well-explained\n\nI had such a good time playing this, mainly because its tone is so friendly and cute! The witchy/supernatural story elements were a nice addition as well, and it was great to see how magic affected all the co-workers differently. All characters have a deeper issue that they're trying to deal with during the game, which gets fully developed during their romance route. I also very much enjoyed Avery's character! Realistic, relatable, and not just another blank slate.\n\nAfter playing through everybody's romance, you unlock the "secret" romance with Graves, your mysterious boss. This one is probably one of the best and also explains more about magic and witchery. Only downside for me was that it could have been longer, especially the romance-specific endings, also when taking the game's price into account.\n\nOverall, an extremely nice addition to the romance-themed visual novels here on Steam! I will definitely revisit some of its lovely characters again :D","April 29","true","7.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I bought it on a whim on a bad night and don't entirely regret it. Overall it's a recommendation for me but I do have a few things I want to say about it. Just gonna do a quick list:\n\nPros\n- Pretty dang cute art\n- Being able to choose your gender and romance whoever\n- Interesting story (so far, I haven't seen all the paths)\n- A pretty diverse cast of characters with interesting personalities\n- INCLUDING the main character! So many of these have blank slate main characters. Avery is not that at all.\n- Decent script overall, much better than I expected honestly (it's easy to cash in on the 'weird versions of sim dating' craze, what can I say xD)\n\n\nCons\n- This is the most finicky skip button I have ever seen in one of these games that have a skip button! I wouldn't complain so much about this, but this game REQUIRES you to play all the routes to get the full story. Sometimes it worked fine, othertimes I would have to X out and then in for it to work.\n- Shorter run time may be a turn off at the price (my play time mostly stems from me having it on in the background and coming back to it every once in a while, someone said eight hours elsewhere and that sounds about right. I have no issue with it, but people should be aware.)\n- This one is my biggest gripe: The stories really do feel imcomplete until you realize that you need to see everyone's to get a fuller picture (or at least pick the ones who actively cares more about the magic portion of the plot - Mason, my first pick, did not.) This is the first time I've ever really felt forced to romance people I had no interest in whatsoever to get any idea of the plot, because I prefer to romance female characters and this game appears to be specifically attempting to cater to the LGBTQ audience who want to follow their own preferences.\n- You only have like a page of save files (I think six or eight all together?).

It's not long by any means, and that's my single problem with it. It's charming, it kept me entertained, and it made me squeal like a little girl in all but 2 routes. I liked all the routes in their own way, with the exception of one. Because I didn't like Mason, I loved Mason. Mason is literally the perfect being. In the past, I've felt like I wished certain characters were real, but I never thought about it much more. Mason's existence has activley made me hate the fact that I can't just pull characters out of a game and love them forever.\n\nThe music is fantastic, the art is adorable in it's own way. The story is decent, nothing fabulous, but it's simple and beleivable, and for a game of this size, it works out better that way.\n\nMusic: 9/10\nArt:9/10\nDialogue:9/10\nStory: 7/10\nRomance: 18/10 (+10 for Mason being actual perfection)\n\nRoutes-\nLandry - 7/10, Adorable in a lot of ways, super cute, but Was overall a pretty boring character. Nothing special. Super Vanilla.\nReese - 8/10 I don't like him nearly as much as I like Landry, but he's just such a cute nerd I had to give him an extra +2\nHayes - 8/10 oh my god those ♥♥♥♥ing rose petals He's so nerdy I want to hug him forever\nFinley - 10/10 Adorable as a girl, adorable as a cat, adorable as a lover. Kind of felt gimicky, but was done very well.\nMason - 20/10 Best girl forever I want her to make a ♥♥♥♥♥ out of me, FFS Somebody kiss me like that I'll die happy\n________Spoilertime_________\nGraves - 6/10. Although this was definitley the best route for story, as far as romance goes, it Felt WAY TOO FORCED. I liked graves enough, but once I found out about a final route, I didn't have to be told it would be him. Called it. This works as the best story based route, and ties up quite a few loose ends. IT's blatantley obvious that this is the "Main, True Route". Maybe I'm just salty because Mason is best girl forever. Who knows.\n\n\n18/10 would love Mason again","April 28","true","11.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

There are some moments in this game that had me giggling with joy, but also quite a few tear jerkers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sentper/recommended/453340/","sentper","Senty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sentper/","21 products in account","(A briefer summary of it all will be at the bottom, in case you don't wanna go through a full essay!)\n\nHustle Cat doesn't really have what you'd call a proper gameplay exactly, though you could say the same about several other members of the Visual Novel genre, and I can name several that still don't give you as many options and interaction as Hustle Cat does, even if the ones it gives are a little bit light. It's definitely not for you if you're not a fan of text-heavy games, but you'll be right at home if you're into that stuff, or if you're looking to start!\n\nWith that in mind, Hustle Cat happens to have a WONDERFUL set of characters, a pretty engaging plot, and overall just really, really nice writing! The way characters are written and their dialogue is laid out is done in a way that you really don't see very often in several games, and though I absolutely liked some more than others, there truly weren't any characters I disliked at all.\nAvery, the protagonist, is an easy example of splendid  characterization, and their interactions with the cafe's staff are really fun to read and enjoyable to go through.\n\nI will say there were a couple of routes were things were handled a little bit strangely, and some certainly feel like they received less attention than others, although that tends to be mostly in the pictures department rather than in writing. General favoritism is there, but this isn't to say that the ones that were noticeably better liked by Date Nighto weren't amazing to play through!\n\nIt's easy to catch wind of how to go through each route, and though runs past your first might be a little bit uneventful on your way to taking on another one, the fact you can speed up doesn't really let that drag for too long.\nI do wish that the whole "cat" aspect of the game, which is the lead appeal, hadn't been dropped the way it was, though, but that might just be me. I'll give them a TON of praise for using the word "witch" as unisex, though! You hardly see people realizing it's unisex in most games these days!\n\nMoving on to the music, I can say it was...all right!\nNothing really stood out to me, and most of the songs began as generic before shifting to repetitive, but I wouldn't say they ever got grating or annoying to listen to, and some were very much perfect for the mood, at times.\n...Big emphasis on "at times", though, as there were tons of moments through the game where I felt as though a change in song or maybe a bit of silence would've been much better suited (almost expected) for what the text was carrying the mood through. It definitely took away from some scenes, for me.\n\nNext, we have the art! And boy, Hustle Cat is PRETTY!\nThe character expressions might be a little awkward rarely, but I usually found them to be really nice and fun to look at! The mugshot models themselves are really nicely shaded, with thick lines and great color choices that keep everything vibrant, cute, and just really...alive! Each character gets a very nice and decent selection of expressions as well, which keeps the text accompanying them always engaging!\n\nIf there's anything to complain about, it'd be that certain of the special event pictures tend to have awkward faces or anatomy at times, and then you have some others that just don't have shading at all, which I found really strange. These aren't so many that it'd damage the overall quality, though.\n\nThe interface is kind of generic for what you'd expect of a visual novel, and can be a little plain here and there, but it's definitely not unfitting or clashing with the style. It's cute, simple, and not pretentious or intrusive, so I can't complain at all.\n\nOne thing I absolutely wanna praise is the game's auto save feature! While it's not good advertising to say that the game crashed on me twice, it did happen at times when I was speeding through the dialogue, and my laptop happened to also be running several other things at the time.\nBut, thanks to the auto saving, I really didn't need to worry, since I could just hop back onto where I was just playing last time!\n\nOverall!Hustle Cat is adorable, and whether you're a cat person or a visual novel fan, you'll definitely like it! The cast is full of life and splendidly written dialogue, and even if the story might get a bit awkward at times, it always keeps engaging and fun to go through.\n\nThe music is a little repetitive and uninspired, and tends to clash with the mood or go on for too long sometimes, but it was never grating or annoying to listen to, at least in my opinion.\n\nThe art is gorgeous, with a few hiccups in some special scenes, but never losing charm or failing to bring life to the scene it comes along with. While the game might rely on the still character mugshots a lot, it still has a much more abundant selection of special art than most visual novels out there!\n\nIt's a pretty great game that could've been a lot better, but I can assure you it won't disappoint!\n","March 26","true","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you do not, then it is likely not a game meant for you. It is a more PG otome, so do not expect explicit.\n\nI have played all the routes (and got the achievements) and I find it was a great decision to have you play through all of the others before getting to Graves, who gives you a larger explanation as to what is going on.\nThe art is cute, the characters are likeable, and act III has some good intensity to it.\nIf you like the story and characters, it has replay value.\n\nMy only criticisms are I wish it had been a little longer to dedicate to the relationship building. As it is, it is fine, but it is not the longest game. I also wish there was some voice acting, as I feel it gives more life to the characters, but I also understand that means more time, more employees, and more money involved. My last is the antagonists’ motivation (which I will not spoil here). I feel it could have been something more substantial.\n\nEither way, it is a fun cute story with good characters.

This wonderful game was brought to my attention by a certain youtuber and honestly, I couldn't wait for them to make the videos on it I just had to see part of the story that much sooner.\n\nThe good: This game is quirky, a good sense of that is given as soon as you hit what is esentially the create character screen, you can be a he/ she/ it (none of these really effect your ingame appearance or ablity to romance any of the characters.) Each chacter feels interesting, including those you wouldn't think you'd be interested in, to the point, I who rarely reacts to the emotions of characters in game nearly shed a tear over the emotional scenes displayed. I loved all the characters, really, from Mason who gives off the feeling of being a biker gang member while still managing to be.... a female chef who seems to care in her own odd way to Graves, the odd goth, LARPing boss.\n\nThe bad: The timeline was obvious, you had set events with each character which were obviously switched out just to meet whoever your interest happened to be in that run. While these scenes were displayed reasonably differently to the point it felt like it was distinctly that character's.\n\nAnd really my only other regret is there wasn't more written.... Really, I played nearly every option except the option to stick around during a certain scene near the end but theres about five hours of story give or take to be had skipping over repeated scenes but all of it was just so filled with such a wonderful story I feel a bit lost without having anything more to see (including the secret path).","May 27","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Personally, this was my first otome game, and I was incredibly pleased with my playthrough, so much so that I will definately be going through and replaying some routes again (Landry is bae). The artwork is inviting, the music exceptional, and the writing exquisite! Each route opens up some more information on the facets of the characters surrounding you, and you come to care about each in their own right. My personal favorites were Landry and Mason. The ability to have a say in the player's characters visuals and pronouns was exciting!\nGrave's route was exceptionally well written, I must add.\n\nOverall, I say give this game a buy rather than watch a playthrough. Kudos to the small team who made this adorable project available to us players. The only negitave is that sometimes it would crash, though only after autosaving so no progress was lost. Only happened at most 4 times throught my whole playthrough. Finally, I cant help but say that I think there are some  areas of the game that I've yet to get explanation for.

I've never seen a game actually do that yet and it makes me so so happy that this one has. The fact that I can actually have my pronouns (they/them) in a game is just-- well, amazing!

However, I still highly recommend it.  It has instantly gone into my library of absolute favorite dating sims.\n\nThe writing is very immersing.  Going into dating sims, I expect the dialog to be really formulaic, but this one stood out.  I found myself chuckling and leaning forward in my seat with curiosity.  I especially loved the character Graves.  I was motivated to buy this just to pursue him after I saw him in the trailer (mischievous smirking, probably-a-wizard, with two different color eyes?  Yes please!).  Surprisingly, he wound up my second favorite love interest, and I really enjoyed his path!  As in, 'dead tired because I stayed up all night, needing to see how his path ended' enjoyed his path.\nAnd I'm still left with more questions about his past and some of Nacht's veiled comments!!!  'Think of me when  you do it again', what is he talking about?!?!\n\nWhich speaks to how much I loved Mason's route - my favorite of the love interests.\nIt had me in tears in a wonderful way.  She is a lovable character that I could not get enough of.\n\nAll of the characters are distinct and interesting.  The game does a great job of making the cafe feel like a family.  I couldn't stand Reese, but I was at least gratified that the MC constantly teases him for being a brat, and they didn't try to pass him off as anything but.\n\nMagic, cats, coffee, and lots of fun!\n\nIf I have one gripe about the plot, it's that  our super powers are garbage ;_;  Everyone else's are so cool!  Why was ours lame?  I kept expecting there to be a secret reason, but was disappointed that we're apparently the garbage wizard.  Also, that in many paths the explanation that we can control garbage is rushed, leaving me going, 'we can what?

The playthrough is somewhat short (a couple hours) but as there's several to woo the replay value is high. Still, I completed all run throughs in about 8 hours, so I am not sure if I think it was worth $20. Maybe 10 tops for the hours. It was fun though, but I definitely felt like there could be more. And while the art and music were great, there were some scenes I felt needed a lot more animation to better convey what was going on, rather than a single static pose for the entire thing.\n\nBut those complaints are minor.

Since that was caught my eye first! All the characters are well designed and pretty drawn. Not much shading on them yet solid and alive. Its very pretty and some pictures just makes you stare in awe.<3\nBut, the proportions does vary sometimes.. Still, its weigh up by that most of the art is beautiful.\nThe backgrounds are well drawn in detail, design and perspectiv. Yet very grey, it could have more colour to it.\n\nThe characters are all lovely in there own way! And easy to remember, both in design and personality. I like all of them.<3 They are all cute in there ways, and talents, reactions. Audeghjrghr why are they so adorable! It hurts .. in a good way..hum. The head character is also funny xD\n\nThe music is good, I have not so much to say about it. :S But the meny music catch one's attation quick and give a good feel to the game. It fits to the mood, and got my attation time to time ... Although when I do listen, it has a nice rythm and sound.\n\nThe story, its easy to get the route you want with the choices you get first. And each of the routes are cute, and the relationships walks in a good pace, it gives one a sweet feeling of waiting and see them to fall in love <3. Also interesting story to get to know each of the cast. And pretty fail safe, when the route starts, there is only follow the story for the most, which is worth it.<3 To get the whole picture of the story, then you need all the routes and puzzle them up in your mind.(Sort of ) Although .. it leaves one hanging at the end a bit, a curiosty that is not filled up. Perhaps realstic, yet one want to know a bit more..\nThe beginning get tiresome before each route. And yes, the skipe button .. I lost my trust for that one, since it did not always stop at something new. D:\nThere is also one of the ending scenes, that is also off .. You have your choice of partner, and see different scenarios, yet one scene is ''neutral'' ... or how I shall explain it. Its as if the main character has a short memory loss all of a sudden, since its the same lines that is said in each route, and the events before vanish for a second ...\nAs mentioned, to get the whole plot, otherwise it gets a bit ..weird. A evil guy all of a sudden then gone :S And no much explanation. Then the end of the route.  Even as one played the whole game, could have a bit more explaning, and dig more into the plot.\nPerhaps could showed more of it depths. Still, I like the story though, its enough to keep my interest. :)\n\nThe text is simple, for the most .. if not Graves is the one speaking xD. Its funny and natural ( if one read out loud, one can feel how the character would say it :D ), but some stuff feeled a bit forced, not often and easy to ignore.\n\nAlso it random crashes, but luckily it there is autosave, and can just pick up where one left. :D\n\nOne great feature about this game was to ''choose'' a gender! And apperance! Gay/lesbian/hetro/something! They does not actaully react or say much about it in the game though. But it could be BL, and that was enough for me <3.\n\nI recommend this game,  since it hade a good feel into it, and made me smile, both physically and mentally. And lovely, very lovely characters ~~<3 awhuruiegne ( There is also a feeling that wants me to play it again ). xD\n\n8/10","March 19","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do not await their release with anticipation, but when an interesting one comes out I will often times nab it and poke my nose in, and once I heard the premise for Hustle Cat I was sold in a heartbeat, but this is a review, so...is it good? yes, yes I think it's good, but not tooooo far above average.\n\nIf you want my tl;dr opinion it's about a 6/10. Good but coulda been a lot better, now for details\n\nI'll start by saying I have not 100% played through this game. I played through one storyline route, the Finley route, and hooooo boy.....that was a mistake. Her storyline is pretty preachy at a little over the halfway point, and it's really on the nose with what it's about, and there's some stuff that just made me wince in the writing. I wont spoil it, but, you'll know exactly what i'm talking about.\n\nI actually pushed for the Finley storyline at first. When I learned that you could select your gender pronouns at the beginning, I was hopeful that one of the love interests might be trans. I'm a trans woman myself, so it would have been a nice little relatable thing to see in game, and yes...I suspected that Finley was trans at the beginning, which is why I steered things down that path. However, nope, it turns out Finley is a soapbox to push some devs views, and it really shows. I wont dance around it. this partanes to SJW/anti-SJW situations. I don't care what your views are on that stuff, I find myself in the middle a lot of the time, but jesus hustle cat, your strawmanning was hardcore, and that's what bothered me. It was a poorly writen scene overall, and felt like it was only there to make a statement and empower Finley, who didn't really need it anyway.\n\nNow that the cat's out of the bag *eyebrow bounces* Let me get to the pros that make this shine!\n-The writing! When it's not preaching to you is great! I laughed a few times, I smiled many more, and I liked all of the characters for the most part\n-The art! The cats are all adorable, except that grump Mochi, and I never once felt disatisfied with the pace of art transitions like some games I could mention *Cough* Sakura Spirit *Cough*\n-The Choices! Holy moley thank you hustle cat for having choices. I like visual novels, but when there's literally only one or two choices *Cough* Sakura *Cough cough* Freaken....*Cough* Spirit *Cough* it takes me out of it because I may as well be reading a book.\n-The Length! Given that you're expected to play through multiple times for the different paths, I think this is a nice length. However, the ending does feel kind of abrupt, and this setting begs for a sequel.\n\nIt is a visual novel so there's not any gameplay to critique so I think that about sums it up! Though, I was not able to get the steam overlay to function with it. That may need to be looked at, or it could be a bug on my end.\n\nAll in all, I recommend it. It has about as much cheese as one expects from a visual novel, and save for my gripe about it feeling soapboxy at a couple points, I felt it was a really solid visual novel and I will be playing again, this time going after either Mason or Hayes.

I hope my grammar in this review is better than the game writers' in their game (pardon my English, it's not my first language). I guess we can start off by saying "It was a rusty relationship."\n\nI think it's easier to put down the pros first.\n\nPros:\nI laughed a lot because it was so terrible. At least my friends and I had fun?\n\n\nand that's it.\n\nAs for the cons, I don't know where to start.\n\nCons:\n\nThe game was very inconsistent throughout, no matter what route you played. The character dialogues were really off. It takes them a while to notice something completely obvious. Repetition is usually key when memorizing things, but it doesn't do well in a visual novel. it makes the audience feel stupid...like Avery. The artwork was inconsistent, and very sloppy. The perspective was off in just about every background. The anatomy is really strange. The necks were too long; in particular, their collarbones were too low. The arms and hands were oddly positioned. It works for CLAMP, if that's what the creators were going for (however, this can't be compared to CLAMP because at least they're consistent with their artwork). There were so many grammatical errors (my friend who is an English major even cried), it was clear that the game did not have an editor. There were a lot of spelling errors too, and they should really check all of these things before publicizing the game. The fast forward option is nice, but it would have been nicer if they had varying levels of speed. The game was pretty laggy on more than a dozen occasions. The user interface was simple, which was okay, but it feels like the creators tried to make it too simple. The "menu" button looked more like a replay/loop button, and I didn't know it until I clicked on it.  No real effort seemed to go into it. Not only that, the color scheme of the interface was atrocious. I'm not an art major, but I know that the colors chosen for the game did not go well together. Speaking of colors, they felt too flat in the game. The shading was really sloppy and so was the line art. Plot wise...well there seemed to be too many things missing from the plot; this confuses the audience. A lot of the information wasn't really given in game. I had to look on tumblr in order to make sense of the game. Not only that, the ending was anticlimactic because the main antagonist simply disappears with his tail between his legs. There was no real struggle between the protagonist and antagonist. Character development in each route seemed too fast paced. It didn't really feel like you got to know the characters before you went into their routes. Too many internet tropes were used. I understood some, but honestly, not everyone will understand them, and it will only leave them confused...like Avery in most of the game. Honestly though, nothing was a surprise in the game because the final climactic CG was part of the opening. Also, the opening was very heavy on auto tune, unless you enjoy that sort of thing. The background music was okay, though I had it muted most of the time. The slider for the music wasn't as smooth. Just one click and the music was pretty loud.\n\nDating cats was such an interesting concept and had so much potential. Choosing your pronouns and skin colors was pretty cool. However, that doesn't make up for my long list of cons. In all, this game wasn't worth the $20 I spent. The routes were pretty short and not well written. It was a good attempt at an indie game, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I don't recommend this game to anyone. My advice is to just save your money and fund Ono Kensho instead. if you're still interested in the game though, just watch Let's Play videos. My biggest regret is that I should've done that instead.","May 14","false","32.7"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","9","0","0"

No complex choices or plot.\nThe story is however not straight forward and pulls you in. You will come into the game with a preconceived idea of how this will play out as a run of the mill dating sim VN. The game doesn't take to long to through the first curveball and leaves you wanting to know where the story takes you from there and there are quite a few more twists throught.\n\nI really think people should play this game to 100%, though I though some of the routes were written better than others and there are parts that leave you frustrated and asking questions, but the mystery of the world around you doesn't get spoiled for you in one route or even five. You have to keep playing and piece it together.\n\nFirst review so I know it isn't great, but this game is and I wanted people to know.\n9/10","April 26","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This has been a trend lately on Steam, and needless to say, a lot of them are pretty horrible.\n\nHowever, I took a leap of faith and decided to play this game, and I'm glad I did. The characters are engaging, the writing is witty and funny, and the mystery is keeping me interested. I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm really interested to see where it is going.\n\nThe game asks for your pronouns at the beginning of the game and you are allowed to change your skin color, so it is a more inclusive game. However! This is a game that does inclusive well, without being judgy or preachy about it, which is a nice relief. It's more like the characters happen to be darker-skinned, rather than that being their entire personality and a way to get more people to play the game.\n\nThe characters are not basic stereotypes and they react to situations in a way that is both realistic and engaging, and fitting for the setting.  I have seen no typos and the music is not irritating in the slightest.\n\nI think my only complaint about the game is that I would enjoy the option to make the text larger, but that's because of my own issues with vision.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys visual novels.","March 22","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is very cute and there are plenty of jokes for anime and internet nerds to enjoy (Finley = Meme Queen) The appearance and gender options opens the game up to be very inclusive to a variety of people, which is incredibly unique in visual novel/dating sims/otome games.\n\nHowever, replaying the game becomes repetetive until you get up to a certain point where the game diverges depending on the route you are on. There is also only one bad ending that you can get that does not differ on any route, which I find disappointing.

The characters are all lovely and believable, as well as possessing unique problems and circumstances. The art style is very cute and there are plenty of jokes for anime and internet nerds to enjoy (Finley = Meme Queen) The appearance and gender options opens the game up to be very inclusive to a variety of people, which is incredibly unique in visual novel/dating sims/otome games.\n\nHowever, replaying the game becomes repetetive until you get up to a certain point where the game diverges depending on the route you are on.

This has been a trend lately on Steam, and needless to say, a lot of them are pretty horrible.\n\nHowever, I took a leap of faith and decided to play this game, and I'm glad I did. The characters are engaging, the writing is witty and funny, and the mystery is keeping me interested. I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm really interested to see where it is going.\n\nThe game asks for your pronouns at the beginning of the game and you are allowed to change your skin color, so it is a more inclusive game. However! This is a game that does inclusive well, without being judgy or preachy about it, which is a nice relief. It's more like the characters happen to be darker-skinned, rather than that being their entire personality and a way to get more people to play the game.\n\nThe characters are not basic stereotypes and they react to situations in a way that is both realistic and engaging, and fitting for the setting.  I have seen no typos and the music is not irritating in the slightest.\n\nI think my only complaint about the game is that I would enjoy the option to make the text larger, but that's because of my own issues with vision.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys visual novels.","March 22","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I just wanted one ending with Hayes, but I slowly came to love each character.....even Reese. It is a short game, but because there are 5 main endings and a secret ending, as long as you dont skip text you can probobly get around 15 hours out of the game with no repeated endings.

After just playing through one route, I can say I'm in love with it.\n\nYes, these are a few tiny little issues here and there, but there is nothing that takes away from the game play or story. They seem to be things with the game engine or something along those lines? Sometimes the transitions were a bit choppy and I would occasionally get a loading screen when a new scene was loading. The actual text itself were also seem like it was sort of....lagging I guess would be the best term? For some reason it would get better when I switched from using the mouse to hitting enter and whether that was the game itself, my computer, or just a state mind is yet to be seen. Like I said though, nothing that takes away the wonderful story and art this game gives you.\n\nI was expecting at least one of the plot points that happened in this story, but the rest. Wow. Not even close. It never felt like it was forced to me either and I never really found myself kind of disbelieving in how the game got me there. More often then not I found myself muttering under my breath in a good surprise about things that happened. The writing is wonderful and each character shines through with their own unique qualities and characteristics. At this point I have one played through one route and I loved all the characters. What I really love though, is how Avery has a personality as well and it actually shows as you play throughout the game. Where as some VN heroines/heroes come across as completely dumb or useless, Avery never felt that way to me.\n\nThe romance (at least the one route I played) was very natural as well. It was there, it was adorable, it made me smile and laugh, but it wasn't just in your face and then over. At this point I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how that plays out on the other routes in the game.\n\nIf you're interested at all in the game, I would say pick it up when you have the chance. It's a lovely visual novel that definitely lands on it's feet.","March 23","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game. It's charming, it's cute, it's sweet. The writing is great, the characters are lovely, and the music is chipper and fun. All the routes are good, and each person deals with separate issues, all of which are very human. It's a bit of a short game if you skip dialogue for your subsequent playthroughs for other routes, but I recommend just taking your time. The game is very well-written, and it's always a nice read even the second or third time through.\n\nThere are 6 routes total and there are two bad endings. One of the bad endings is a little jarring, as the splash art that comes up if you make the wrong choice is unsettling.  The bad ending choice is "Stay and help".\n\nI think perhaps my biggest qualm with the game is that some of the age gaps in some of the relationships make me uncomfortable, but the protag is over 18. I would've preferred if Avery was a bit older, like around 24 or so. All in all though, I love the game and I think it's great that we have a game that has queer/poc/genderqueer visibility.

It definitely has it's cuter moments and character interactions, but I didn't think it was quite as much as I would've liked. You only really go on one "date" with the character you romance, at least the one I did (Hawes.) And one might argue that maybe there's more to this than the usual "dating sim" part of a Visual Novel, but even the underlying storyline, and the cat cafe parts, don't really take up much more focus either. I just really would have liked more cute cat moments and boy/girlfriend moments, and cat boy/girlfriend moments. And to maybe see the human characters with cat ears and stuff.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't recommend it is for the price, price:value proposition and all that.\n\nArt is definitely pretty good, though the character profiles are not really nice and clean with the lineart; no inking, just pencil "tool" or whatever. And yeah that's a bit nitpicky, but I would kind of expect a cleaner look for a $20 Visual Novel. Though the possible gay choices and little character customization somewhat make up for that, I suppose. It's all certainly nice to look at, and you'll have more than your fill of cute scenes to gawk at. But yeah, if you value better art, or something a bit more fleshed out story-, choice-, and character-interaction-wise, I'd definitely wait til the price drops just a bit.

No complex choices or plot.\nThe story is however not straight forward and pulls you in. You will come into the game with a preconceived idea of how this will play out as a run of the mill dating sim VN. The game doesn't take to long to through the first curveball and leaves you wanting to know where the story takes you from there and there are quite a few more twists throught.\n\nI really think people should play this game to 100%, though I though some of the routes were written better than others and there are parts that leave you frustrated and asking questions, but the mystery of the world around you doesn't get spoiled for you in one route or even five. You have to keep playing and piece it together.\n\nFirst review so I know it isn't great, but this game is and I wanted people to know.\n9/10","April 26","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be fair, the ending scene was good for each character, but I would have loved the routes to have very different endings. Or even having multiple possible endings per character.\n\nFelt like there were a few loopholes or unknowns left over: The characterization was very good but I think the setting needed more material.

Honestly, it looked a little amature and I went into it expecting near crap- like most lesser-known visual novels/otome games on Steam tend to be. What I got was the exact opposite. The main character, Avery, and all of the cast are unique and likable. Avery's narration is relatable and I chuckled quite a lot at some lines. The magic mythos touched upon is interesting and left me wanting to know more. Doing all routes clocked out at around 17 hours for me, which is fanatastic considering this was an independently developed game. The art, while not the best (which can be an issue for some considereing visual novels, are, well, VISUAL) is charming and colorful. The backgrounds are very nice, more so than the character portraits. The abilities to choose your perfered pronouns and have some variety in apperence are also a big plus.\n\nMy only complaints about Hustle Cat come down to a lack of variety- which I know is strange, considering what I just said. The music got annoyingly repetative (two songs in perticular were played way too much during upbeat and relaxing moments that made them anything but). All the routes boiled down to the exact same big conflict at the end, with the exact same antagonist. The only thing different about each route is how he is taken down, but all of them end up being  essencially the same conflict. Worse yet, said main antagonist is given no development in any of the main routes- he is only given any sort of meaningful explaination for his actions AT ALL in the unlockable route, a trend in otome games that really bothers me. He was the driving overarching threat in EVERY ROUTE! It cheapens the impact of the original routes if all important story and weight is placed in the extra route. It would have been better if the antagonist of every route was more tailored to the chosen LI somehow. It made playing routes get very samey very fast when I knew what was coming.\n\nOverall however, this is still worth checking out, if only to support the developer in hopes they build upon what they did right in this game and make more. If you're more of a casual otome fan, this is just for you. If you want something with  more meat, I'd reccomend Ozmafia!! (a newly released game not without its own issues, but has a bit more bite) or Nameless, the one thing you must recall.","May 18","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I particularly liked that it wasn't high school, the rich spread of characters (finally, variety!), and the push to be inclusive for the protag (being able to pick your sex, etc).\n\nThe artwork is quite good, and miles ahead of most English-based otome games. There were a vew pictures where I noticed some flatness, which was jarring given how well the characters were shaded in others.\n\nThe storyline was really good, but I would have liked less vagueness in both the background explanations for the curse and more a bit more tailored experience for each character. For $20, I realize this can't be as in depth as some VNs, but a smidge more would have made the experience 100%.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the game, as it's really good.

However, when I started playing, I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Hustle Cat has a decent, compelling story, with interesting characters (I've only played one route so far, but that was all I needed to know that Finley is bae). My only gripe was that certain things at the end are not explained, due to Avery being "too tired to listen", especially considering it was something which I deemed important to the overall plot and would explain everything that happened. Now, I don't know if this is different in any of the other routes, if he listens more if he go's with any of the other characters, but regardless I thought it was a bad choice to not tell the player why everything happened. Despite this though, the story was still good, the characters were interesting, I no longer regret my purchase and I will go into the next dating sim that I play with an open mind.\n\n[EDIT: After having completed every route, I'd like to retract my earlier complaint about the game not telling you anything about what is happening and why, as it does, but you have to play every route to figure it out, and it doesn't specifically say what's going on sometimes, but it's not done in a way that makes it annoyingly vague, so it's fine and even though I was more open to the idea of playing a dating sim after completing one route already, I still underestimated the depth that this game actually held. I can definitely say i'm very pleased with my purchase (but Finley is still bae)]","April 17","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the music is great, the characters are enchanting (Well I\'ve done Hayes, FInley, Landry and I\'m now starting Mason) and who wouldn\'t love a game about cats?","June 1","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can tell there were multiple CG artists and possibly sprite artists as the art style is inconsistent at times, but I don't mind much. It's obvious a tremendous amount of work was put into this – props to everyone who worked on this game! 6 versions of each CG including the MC, even if they're only minorly different, and 6 sets of sprites for the MC, alongside the quality music and equal attention paid to each route among many other things. There are a few spelling and grammatical errors, but nothing too extreme, and they're not frequent enough to distract from the story. The pronoun choices and the MC customization options were a nice touch and helped make this game unique. There are a few issues, like lack of interactivity throughout a lot of the game, but the pros easily outweigh the cons.\n\nPros:\n\nQuality music and writing.\nInclusive of different genders, sexualities, and races.\nDiverse personalities of the characters.\nRefreshingly entertaining and non-bland MC.\nHealthy relationships!\nYou get to date cute kitties.\n\n\nCons:\n\nShort. 8-9 hours to be expected.\nVery limited amount of saves.\nThe game will likely feel somewhat unsatisfying unless all routes are done.\nNot a lot of options on the options screen.\nMostly linear once on a route.\nOnly one ending for each character.\n\nAs long as you don't mind the length and the mostly linear nature, this game will be very enjoyable to the majority of otome and dating sim gamers, assuming you're the kind of person to play through all the routes.","June 3","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Right after the release there were some problems with the skip choice, like it wouldn't always work or the game would crash, but I think that was fixed by now.\n\nIn general Hustle Cat has a cute story line, and it has a unique writing style and cute characters. I loved the different versions of Avery and the fact that one can have more than the standart two gender options! Way to go!\n\nMy only real issue with Hustle Cat was that I couldn't date Nacht and I really really wanted to.\nNacht was so far up my alley it was unreal and I enjoyed every scene with him.\nlike boy u can threaten me all night long-\n\nBut seriously: Hustle Cat is nice and has cute art and neatly written characters, but could have a little more content.\nLike unlocking more than one character under certain conditions etc\n\n\n","June 4","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
