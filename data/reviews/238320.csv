This is a great game and excels at what it was made for. That said, it is not for everybody. Thus, I shall be listing what to and what not to expect from it.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- Survival horror: there is no fighting (on your part), running and hiding is the aim of the game.\n- Jump scares: yes, it's a survival HORROR for a reason. Keep a spare pair of underwear available when you are playing this game.\n- Explicit and dark: violence, gore, vulgar language, some nudity and sexually related incidents all play a part in creating the dark, horrifying atmosphere of Outlast.\n- Interesting storyline and background information: The storyline has a bit of a twist in the tale, things aren't exactly as you expected them to be. Also, with all the notes and documents one collects in this game, one gets a decent amount of background information which helps with the atmosphere of the game, develops the plot (and player understanding thereof) and gives the player insight as to the nature of the silent protagonist, as well as some of the antagonists you'll be facing.\n\nWhat not to expect:\n- Hours of replay value: your first playthrough will probably be about 5-6 hours and the DLC about 1-2 hours. As the game progression is always the same, there is little reason to play it again (with the exception of wanting to get achievements).\n- Competitiveness: There is no form of multiplayer or leaderboards of any kind.\n- Something suitable for children (you should have picked that up by now)\n- Sunshine and roses\n- Clean underwear\n- Being able to sleep at night (slightly exaggerated)\n\nI absolutely loved this game and highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the horror genre, whether it be movies or games. I hope the information listed will help you in your decision of whether or not to purchase this game.\n\nHappy Gaming!","October 8, 2014","true","41.7"," 977 of 1,008 people (97%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","97","977","1","81","12"

Jump scares are definitely not the only things that will give you the chills, this game has strong atmosphere, and lurking around to avoid being seen by enemies can be some of the creepiest parts of the game, and can be terrifying when you're being chased.\n\nThe game also has enough meat to it to put all of it's mechanics to good use without ever feeling underplayed or gimmicky. I also feel that the game does a good job of making you care about the main character's well being, he goes through so much crap in this game that it makes it all the more motivating to keep going and see what happens next.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/238320/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Let's get one thing straight: I am not a fan of horror. I'm a giant wuss, a man baby that screams at every jump scare and closes his eyes when things get too gruesome. It's a genre that is quite frankly too much for me and one I tend to avoid for the betterment of my own sanity.\n\nAll the same horror fascinates me. I'm intrigued by why anyone would voluntarily choose to experience something designed to terrify them, compelled by the different ways horror can be effective, and find myself continuously drawn to horror games especially it's the most difficult to do well and as a result the most interesting and impressive when it's done right.\n\nOutlast might not be the absolute pinnacle of interactive horror, but it's certainly close and an impressive bar for other developers to shoot for. It knows how to not only startle you, but to petrify you in fear from the force of the terrors within it. It's vile and grotesque beyond question, perhaps the most disturbing game I've ever witnessed that is still making me cringe as I recall some of its most horrific moments. It does all this however in a way that's oddly, even scarily compelling, almost as if some dark part of you wants to see how far the developers are willing to take it or if there is ever any light at the end of a perpetually dark tunnel.\n\nOutlast achieves much of this through an incredibly dense and oppressive atmosphere, and a deep understanding of its own mechanics. Your helpless in Outlast, forced to sneak and hide from enemies that can often see and hear you much better than you can them, but the game never becomes frustrating or tedious do to an almost constant supply of hiding places, or the ability to outrun your pursuers should you be spotted. This doesn't mean it's an easy game, or one you can casually run through without worrying over enemies, but it places you into situations you can't handle and never feels punishing the way too many horror games have a tendency to when they rely so heavily on trial and error.\n\nThis is thanks in part also to how well Outlast cements you into its world. There's never a moment where you feel like anything more than a helpless journalist with a camera, and this vulnerability and immersion is one of the most important factors in why this is such a terrifying game. Every stumble, heavy breathe, cut and bruise, and nervous peek of your character is presented in a way that makes you really feel as if you're inhabiting your character. He might be a blank slate in every other respect, but when you step into his shoes the real world seems to melt away as you traverse an almost literal hell on earth.\n\nEverything in Outlast becomes secondary to scaring the living daylights out of you almost the second you grab your camera and step out of your car unprepared for what awaits you inside Mount Massive Asylum, and it's because it's so effective at this goal that it's easier to forgive some of its less polished aspects. A general lack of direction and inability to recall your objectives means it's easy to get lost running in circles, even more so with the nearly impenetrable darkness around you that often hides doors and pathways, and without any map to speak of even just retracing your own steps to try and rule out where you haven't been becomes a challenge that at times removed me from the experience as I was forced to resort to a guide just to progress.\n\nThe narrative as well, for as interesting is it is when you can see it cohesively laid out on paper, is told in such a way as to be all to often jumbled and convoluted past the point of anything intelligible if you aren't paying incredibly close attention to every line of dialogue and document picked up. Even then, it switches gears often enough as to seem almost intentionally written in such a way as to keep you constantly in the dark, guessing at the few threads that are thrown at you what it all might mean. There's a reluctance to commit traced throughout the entirety of Outlast, as if it's concerned about spending too much time on one character of story moment lest you begin to assume it's the main focus of the game. The end result is something that's consistently intriguing but rarely satisfying.\n\nThe most disappointing part of the experience though is the final chapter, which jumps the shark not only in terms of narrative, but also its setting which loses almost all of the terror of the areas that preceded it and closes the game out on a rather odd note. I didn't dislike it because of the ending, so much as I did what it did to the game as a whole, which up until that point had been nothing but consistently excellent.\n\nBut it should be taken as rather large praise that despite Outlast's very present issues, they rarely become more than a minor disappointment or anything you have time to think about with how intense and stressful just surviving in this asylum is. Developer Red Barrel doesn't know how to craft a narrative or direct the player particularly well, but they understand acutely how to do first person survival horror to a degree that deserves commendation. If you have any interest in horror of the most unsettling and macabre nature, Outlast deserves your time. As someone that appreciates horror for what it is more than what it does to me, Outlast succeeded in ways that truly surprised me, and now has me hesitantly interested in discovering more of the genre I've tried so hard to stay away from.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 31, 2014","true","6.3"," 365 of 392 people (93%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","93","365","392","31","11"

Personally, I love being terrified while gaming but alas very few horror games have been able to chill my blood to the bone and leave a path of sweat trickling down my back. Games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill had the market sown up in the early days but for this gamer they were nothing more than a snooze fest than an actual scare fest. Thanks to the buoyant indie scene horror seems to be coming into its own and particularly on the PC.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195609400\nA lot can be said how the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent changed the name of the game. By simply placing an ordinary and often troubled main protagonist into a world with no way of defending themselves but instead running and hiding from the terrors of the night; developers where finally able to allow pure horror to emerge from the shackles of weaponry. Outlast takes place in a mental asylum on a dark and stormy night (what doesn't get scarier than that?) as you take control of a journalist, Miles Upsher, who acting on a tip-off that things are not well at all at the Mount Massive Mental Institute decides to take poke around to see if there is a valid story worth printing. Armed with nothing more than a hand held cam-corder his investigations will uncover a dark and deeply disturbing secret housed within its walls. It's better the player enter this sick and twisted world with as little information as possible so avoid youtube playthroughs and other detailed reviews until you have played it yourself.\n\nGameplay wise Outlast employs the same mechanics set about by Amnesia with the exception that the main character can now vault over obstacles in his course whilst fleeing from some particularly disturbing characters. In between filming what you see you will be doing a lot of frantic running and hiding lest you forfeit your life. On a scariness level - Outlast succeeds admirably even outdoing Amnesia at its own game. This is truly a terrifying experience (up the ante by turning all the lights off and playing with headphones on) and with fantastic AAA style graphics truly immerses you in a world of horror that is coupled with a sparse but very tense soundtrack. The audio for Outlast and the various sound effects it employs to scare it players is top notch.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226065665\nIf I have one complaint about the game, it's that it gets bogged down by its length. For a horror game to be truly terrifying it needs to be able to sustain that tension and usually tension of this sort can only be sustained for a short period before it becomes rather rote and unfortunately Outlast does become rote somewhere in the middle. It seems the developers (Red Barrels) were far too in love with the idea of scaring gamers that they missed the number one rule - brevity! By the time Outlast reaches the final stages of its story it picks up a bit again (the story it tells is quite a good one for a game of this nature) although it does rely yet again on what's been told countless times before in the movies/print media so you probably won't be particularly surprised or shocked at its outcome.\n\nThe DLC - called Whistleblower - that can be purchased to supplement Outlast is a truly harrowing afffair and I would say up's the scariness level by 10. Playing Whistleblower in the dark with the headphones on I could only sustain minutes rather than hours before actually developing a tension headache and on more than one occasion I was literally screaming out aloud in absolute terror and in the process frightening the rest of my household. The main villain in the asylum for this piece - a cannibalistic psycho with an electric chainsaw - is literally the stuff nightmares are made of and had my skin crawling for the majority of the DLC's length. The DLC also succeeds admirably when it comes to the tension because its literally over in 4hrs. I would love to see more additions to the main game like this campaign because I really enjoyed the DLC.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195609761\nAs it stands - Outlast is now one of my favorite horror games on the PC. It does frustrate me a little that developers, and that includes the Amnesia Developers, still haven't gotten the pattern down perfectly yet (there is no need to artificially inflate your game when it's a horror game) but for a start this is a game headed in the right direction. Lets hope they get hold of a good editor should there be a sequel.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 16, 2014","true","16.8"," 640 of 719 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","640","719","0","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/238320/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Outlast is a first person horror game which was released in mid 2013 on the PC while also being released afterwards on consoles. It is own by approximately a million users on Steam too.  The game is also built on the unreal engine.\n\nThe game is based around a story rich campaign told in first person narrative style set in a psychiatric hospital which has been overrun by murderous paitents.  Your character, Miles Upshur, has no means of combat, other than shoving enemies out of your way. You are forced to use the technique which most would do when faced with the types of enemies in this game, running for your life and hiding like a little girl under a bed.  You also carry a notebook and a camcorder, which is used to document the events inside the hospital. The camera is used as your mechanism of seeing in the dark, but obviously in good horror genre style it has a limited supply of power - so you also have to explore the hospital for batteries to keep it turned on.\n\nOutlast is built on the Unreal engine; so the graphics are top notch; they really capture the scene and will have you cringing in horror at some of the sights you will see. The lighting is absolutely perfect, along with the rain effects when outside.\n\nYou can go as deep as you want with the story; you can either follow the plot by just wandering around the halls and purely just going off the scripted events that happen or you can delve very deeply into the story by finding all kinds of documents scattered around in drawers and cupboards.\n\nThis is easily the scariest game I have ever played. On top of the stunning visuals that are almost life like, the game has the best audio you will ever find in a horror game; footsteps, background screaming, musical tempo changes. They are all amazing and you won't find a game which captures it more perfectly than Outlast.\n\nOutlast is hard; the first "level" chucks you straight in at the deep end as you have to scramble around a beefed up guy to turn the power generator on; this is the first of many challenges you will face in the game. You have to really stick at it at times to try work the best method of progressing around some events. You will be very lucky to complete the game without running into any problems.\n\nThe whole game took me seven hours to complete; this was my first playthrough and there sadly isn't any other reason other than collecting all of the documents to play through it again. The story is linear and you will end up with the same ending each time.\n\nRegardless of the lack of replay ability, Outlast is easily one of the best games to come out in recent years and horror fans will absolutely love it. If you aren't into jump scares this may not be for you, as there are plenty and you will probably find yourself alt F4ing out many times.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

But during and after playing this game.. those money are saved...\n\nI just couldn't stomach the food for right now and i couldn't sleep last night...\n\nThere is a chinese saying.. "尸山血海" Which is use to describe the battle field or Masscure... It's word by word meaning is "Corpse Mountain, And Blood Sea". This game literally take the meaning and produced the effect.\n\nI only posted 1 screenshoot of this game and I had to choose one of the very basic ones and put on spoiler...\nThe other ones I end up deleting simply because it feels like a crime to show such graphic picture on internet to kids that may stumble upon them.\n\nI did play Insane difficulty to start to try to get all the achievements but gave up 3 hours in cause it's just a bit too hard since you basicly playing ironman and simply cannot die even once. Just lower the difficulty by 1 would be a great experience. 17 hours marathon was enough for me to complete the main game and DLC. I am sure a lot people can do much faster if they just play on normal.\n\nAs I play this game. It immendiatly felt like the good old resident evi 2l: Nemesis. You are constantly pressured by enemy you cannot defeat and have to find way to evade, hide and use enviroment to your adavange to dodge/delay the encounter. Except this time you play a reporter(for DLC a software engineer) and unlike Jill you don't get a weapon... not a gun.. not a bat.. not even a shiv... You don't get to use a single weapon in the entire game.\n\nAll you got is camera that have infradvision for you to see in the dark.. And there are alot dark...\n\nGraphics of this game is really not that great but creater made it super nasty and even borderline disgusting and give a grand sense of surreal terror. The way Horror game should be!\n\nThe story, dialog and interaction is great though out the base game. The DLC even improved what worked for the base game and even made it better.\n\nThere is section of full 20 seconds in DLC made me hold my balls the entire time and afraid it's gonna be table saw away...\n\nThe heavy breathing and scared sound the main character feel so real.. and as you playing the game there will be many time you feel your heart beat match the main character's heartbeat. Sometime too fast.. sometime stopped!!!\n\nYou must use everything to survive in this game and sound/music play a huge importance and it's very well done. You can just feel the big guy breathing down your neck when you being chased.\n\nFor horror Game I have always said Silent hill Series would be my No.1 because that's psychologically involved...\nIt still is my number one. But this game grab second very easily. It's not as story involved and intriging as silent Hill. But It  will make a weak man ♥♥♥♥ his pants... (I didn't .. but i did lose sleep and food over it soooo...)\n\n9.9/10 for a Great horror Game experience... And please keep kids less then 18 away from this game..","September 14, 2015","true","17.3"," 211 of 236 people (89%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","89","211","236","98","11"

Outlast I guess.  It's been in my backlog since summer. Supposed to be scary or something."\n\nAnd there I went.  Oblivious to what I was getting into.  Honestly, I had only watched 2 minutes of vids online and a Conan O Brian review. Then came the game; immediately creepy. And it quickly moved on to scary and terrifying. The world seemed a bit Portal 2-ish, but the actual gameplay...was amazing.  Pacing, story, real HORROR, and tension like I had not really felt in a horror game.  Not that I have played a ton of horror titles, but I would put it on par with early Silent Hill games.\n\nI won't go into the details.  Really, it would spoil it for you.  Honestly, very basic.  You are a reporter checking out the weird stuff happening at the aslyum.  And then you walk in into an evil Wonderland complete with menacing large evil killers and a nutso with no pants.\n\nSpeaking of that, tweedle-nude and tweedle-nuder didn't get me once.  I was kinda proud of that.\n\nYou can't fire a gun or use a weapon.  The only defense is running, hiding, ducking, and having your heart up in your throat as Chris Walrider walks by you...aw! He found me!  AwHHHHHH!! RUNNNN!!!\n\nOf all the games I have played this year, this has to be one of the best made in totality.  The length is just right.  Cues and progression move at an exact rhythm that does not allow you to slow your scare down. The jumpscares are there, but are by no means the meat of the game.  There are no useless time wasting missions.  Everything has a reason and the most annoying mission in the game\nis perhaps one of the most terrifying when you do not know what will happen next at all.  Normal difficulty is not impossible and not once did I get stuck on geometry.  A few things are not apparent - that much is true.  Granted, if they were, the game would not be hard enough.  It's just right.  Really.  It's absolutely just right.  Kudos to the dev team.\n\nAt one point I told my buddy I was really wasn't super scared anymore by about the middle of the game.  BUT.  I could not play for more than an hour or so or my heart would not slow down enough for me to sleep well.  Too much tension.  Then he said "Isn't that what terrifying means?"\nHe was right.  Even when the horrific graphics no longer phased me, it was the sheer tension of the game that kept me in it's grip.  That is amazing, and impressed me more than many AAA titles I've played in the past.","November 25, 2014","true","13.7"," 131 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","94","131","139","16","5"

An engaging story of horror, with a cast of sick and twisted individuals to torment and terrify you.\n\nSet in an insane asylum run by a nefarious group, you play an intrepid reporter, intent on getting a great stroy. Unfortunately for you, it turns out that you are to become that great story, and your aims quickly change to a simpler one: Get Out!\n\nThere is a mix of supernatural and pseudo science that has an X-Files feeling to it but at its heart this game is a classic horror experience. You don't fight, you run and you hide. Actually the hide mechanics are pretty good and the 'enemy' AI will keep you on your toes (or cowering under a bed). And the game uses an interesting mechanic in the nightvision mode of the camera. It allowed the game to cover you in darkness and yet still be able to see, albeit not very well, and having to use valuable batteries. But more importantly it somehow made the game feel more real. More like a documentary gone wrong. Something akin to the Blair Witch Project.\n\nIf you like horror games, this is a must have.\n\nYou can see my playthrough of this game here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFCh-5BXs6M&index=1&list=PLE7DlYarj-Dcgi5vf_vnazG4kzaSqrpjV\n\nAnd my play through of the DLC (Whistleblower) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI5-KCpqwPs&index=1&list=PLE7DlYarj-DfItvZz_L4yOTgJ6B5UCnQH","January 30, 2015","true","7.4"," 117 of 124 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","117","124","6","0"

This is classic survival horror - a creepy setting, no weapons, and no way to survive except to hide. You play as a journalist investigating an abandoned insane asylum, based on an anonymous tip of shady goings-on there. The only tool you have at your disposal is a video camera. The main hook of the game is using the camera's IR (night vision) mode to see just what the hell is going around you. It makes for some very effective moments of terror. Imagine knowing something scary and nasty is out there stalking you, but not being able to see what's 3 feet in front of you... yeah, that's the experience in a nutshell. Those moments are what makes this game effective. But unfortunately the whole game is not just those moments. Some parts I found to be somewhat tedious. For example, in one section, you have to explore an area to collect 3 fuses to restore power to something, all the while being stalked by crazy people. It's tense, to be sure, but also makes you realize that you're playing a game with a lame "collect x things" mechanic. It kind of brings you out of the experience a bit. The final section of the game is also sort of hit or miss, as it changes direction in a big way (reminds me sort of how Amnesia fell apart a little bit towards the end). But it's not necessarily bad... just different (I don't really want to get into spoilers at all), so it's one of those things where you might like it or you might not. But the majority of the game leading up to the end is pretty much consistently good. The environment is creepy as hell, the atmosphere is dark, and the "enemies" (mostly disfigured inmates) serve their purpose well. There are a few jump-scares, and the aforementioned fetch-quest sections where you're being chased, but mostly, the horror of the game comes from the combination of atmosphere and having to rely on a camera (whose batteries drain quickly when using IR) to be able to see. On the downside, you sort of get used to things after a while, so the scare factor wears off a bit towards the end. So it's ultimately a good thing that the game only lasts around 4-5 hours. Any more would have been too much. Despite the flaws, there's still lots of good things to experience here, so if you're a fan of this genre, you pretty much have to play this at some point. I think the price is probably fair, but if you can wait, it's definitely worth picking up in a sale.\n\nTechnical notes: I ran into a major bug towards the beginning of the game that prevented any further progress (it involves shaking the mouse during a quick-time event). The issue has supposedly been fixed in a patch, but it didn't work for me. There is a pinned post in the Steam discussions explaining how to work around this if it doesn't work for you either.","September 15, 2013","true","6.8"," 244 of 300 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","244","300","0","0"

The game does contain a good amount of jumpscares along with the overall tense feel of the environment, and even if you're not a fan of cheap spooks, Outlast does a wonderful job of placing them in areas you probably wouldn't expect them to be, getting the best reactions out of the people playing it.\n\nOutlast also has fantastic aesthetic value, as the graphics are some of the most realistic I've seen in a long while. That being said, if you want to enjoy the full visual factor of this game, you might want to make sure your computer is up to speed.\n\nThe game does have its flaws, of course. The story is well placed together, but in order to fully understand it, you'll have to make sure to collect all of the documents and notes you come across, making the experience a bit confusing and monotonous at certain times. I personally also had my dislikes with how the entire thing came to a close at the end, as it wasn't the best wrap-up I've seen.\n\nAlthough it has a few rough spots, Outlast is an overall excellent experience, and I was satisfied throughout the entire game. It's also the only horror title I've ever played that's caused me literal chest pain and nausea. Like, ever. So it's pretty damn good. Pick it up if you've got the coin. A definite must-buy for horror fans.","November 27, 2013","true","30.8"," 151 of 174 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","151","174","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alainpham/recommended/238320/","alainpham","Tiny Rick!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alainpham/","488 products in account","I do not scare easily, for my heart is filled with darkness and I probably have no soul.  I marathon horror films in the middle of the night, solo.  I went to Great America's Halloween Haunt and annoyed the employees by trying to scare them instead.  I also jumped off a building one time.  I'm kind of like Will Smith in that crappy After Earth movie, but without the scientology and a bad actor known as Jaden Smith.\n\nThis game, however, changed things for me.  It put fear back into my heart.  Its tendrils, so tenderly burrowed its way into my amygdala, from the very bottom of my bunghole.\n\nI started out in a car.  When I got out, there was a building.  I realized I was very tall.  This pleased me, because in reality, I am not that tall.  I got through a gate door and fiddled around with the controls to learn the game.  Walking to the building, I discovered the door was locked, so I had to find another path.  To the left, there was a small opening that I had to crawl through like a dog.  Dog is the preferred meat source of my people.  Getting through that hole, I saw an open window a few stories up.  I had to climb like Assassin's Creed.\n\nOnce I got inside, the lights turned off.  I got scared and jumped back out the window.  Then I decided to kill myself because I did not want to go any further, so I jumped over the edge.  I plummeted to my death, only to be ressurected by the stupid game.\n\nI knew I had to continue, so I walked around.  I went into another room across a hallway.  The TV turns on, but that doesn't scare me.  I keep moving.  I see vending machines and a vent.  I don't want to go into the vent, but I guess I have to.  Going through the vent, I see some guy running around.  I'm scared so I stay there for a while.\n\nAfter a while, I decide to jump down.  There is a door, I open it.  Something jumps out at me.  I scream at the top of my lungs.  I hide back in the vent for a while.  I finally am brave enough to leave the vent and continue through the dark room filled with corpses.  I come across a guy dying.  He tells me random things.  I don't really care.  I'm scared.\n\nI find batteries in a bathroom.  There is a hand sticking out of the toilet.  I wonder if It will wipe me.\n\nI leave the bathroom and continue on.  There is no way to go except for this tiny passageway I have to squeeze through.  I decide to squeeze through.  Out of nowhere, some giant fat dude with no skin grabs me and says something.  I scream at the top of my lungs as he throws me through the tinted window.  I continue screaming for a while at the top of my lungs.  I see some guy going through my things.\n\nI can't do this anymore.  This game is too scary.  Save and Exit.","October 31, 2014","true","2.0"," 127 of 152 people (84%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","84","127","152","50","4"

As an investigative journalist you explore an abandoned mental asylum. There you will find yourself soon being hunted by some sick individuals who still wander its halls.\nMost of the time you will spend between heart pounding encounters exploring the hospital, trying to find clues to the mystery that landed you there in the first place. You will also spend most of that downtime dreading the next encounter because you never quite know when its going to hit you next.\nOutlast is a dark game. Without your handy camcorder and its nifty night vision display, you would not be able to play this game. Survival depends almost exclusively on managing your supply of camera batteries for fear of losing your ability to see. You must keep a close eye on your camera battery at all times and remain aware that the battery will drain faster if the night vision is turned on. The night vision effect itself is portrayed beautifully and really manages to capture the essense of a found footage film.\nCombat is not existent and emphasis is instead placed on trying to outsmart your attackers and hiding in moments of desperation. When you can not shake your attacker, the best option is to break line of sight and find a place to hide. As a result, the gameplay feels like a satisfying game of cat and mouse. Situations often boil down to a desparate run for survival that have you barreling over objects and looking back over your shoulder as crazed madmen pursue you.\nThe game looks fantastic and the sound design in Outlast is awesome. The sound is the glue that keeps the whole thing together. Everything from ambient noise to your own character's heightened breathing in moments of panic is excellent.\nOutlast is the best horror experience I have had in years. It is a must have for fans of the horror genre.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","January 28, 2014","true","15.6"," 99 of 118 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","99","118","0","0"

Your red Jeep leisurely glides up the dark path to the front gate recalling Half Life's tram ride into Black Mesa. Upon exiting his vehicle and locating an way into the monolithic nut house it doesn't take long to corroborate the information that led Miles to Mount Massive. The build up to first contact with the horrors within the asylum is classic. Strange noises assault your ear drums, your character's breath becomes shallow and ragged, human figures dart across long halls and lock themselves in rooms and pools of blood stain hallway carpets... Your trusty camera documents your findings and allows Miles to take notes. These notes act as an internal monologue relaying your character's thoughts and feelings. Documents can be collected a la classic Resident Evil and flesh out the motivations of the dastardly Murkoff Corporation. It's a tale that swirls science and religion together in a mostly compelling package.\n\nUnfortunately, Miles didn't get his concealed carry license so that he could tote a rocket launcher around under a trench coat like a proper video game hero. Instead he is armed with only a camera that has night vision. It's this feeling of helplessness that is the crux of the game's scares. Upon encountering Mount Massive's monstrosities you are left with two options: run or hide. Most of the lights in Mount Massive don't seem to work anymore giving you plenty of cover to sneak past the mangled psychos that stalk Miles provided you move slowly. If you choose to sprint past the opposition you have keys that allow you to look back and survey your lead. Not every Asylum patient is a threat and this helps keep tension high since figures in the distance can be benign or send you to an early grave. Unfortunately, the pace of Outlast is hampered by a lack of puzzles and a reliance on key collecting or switch flipping for progression. These sections are predictable in addition to being uninspired since flipping switches alerts your psycho stalkers and generally prompts a mad dash for a hiding spot. Proper puzzles might have provided better opportunities for frights as well as encouraging exploration. Outlast is also very linear with few places worth poking your camera lens. Dark corners and dead end rooms often yield extra batteries for your camera or documents that flesh the proceedings out but fail adequately reward players who poke their noses around. Consequently the strict adherence to the critical path means that completing Outlast takes a mere four to six hours.\n\nThe halls and rooms of Mount Massive are soaked in blood and covered in viscera, sinks are littered with severed limbs and diabolical looking medical instruments are scattered around. It doesn't seem as though the Murkoff Corporation spent much on renovations as the interior of the facility is crumbling and decaying. All of these foreboding details are rendered with a liberal amount of grain and noise giving everything a course texture. Lighting is dynamic and moody and the limited field of vision when viewing the game world through the night vision on your camera is intense. Miles animates well, his hands grasp corners as you peer around them and that way the camera bobs to emulate the motion of his head while running creates a very immersive game experience. The excessive motion blur isn't exactly welcome however and may make players with sensitive stomachs nauseous. Enemies look like they belong in Leatherface's family photo album with their mangled and stitched up visages. It's unfortunate that there are so little variation among them. Also the animations of your foes are not as commendable as those of Miles. They look more clumsy than menacing and watching them slide across the floor as you hide under a bed dimishes their stage presence.","November 25, 2013","true","10.9"," 143 of 184 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","143","184","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gegamiga/recommended/238320/","gegamiga","MegaGiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gegamiga/","2629 products in account","First of all, this game isn't optimized for 32bit systems and requires some unorthodox system tuning to make it work properly (or at all!). Why is it this way, when it uses now really dated Unreal engine, is a question for the devs.\n\nThe game is not as nearly as scary as the hype made it out to be. A lot of horror is derived from gore, which is, in my opinion, always a cheap trick. There are some jump scares too, but they are not overused. The main terror factor is that you are completely helpless when confronted with anybody/anything that wants to hurt you and have to rely or running fast to a hiding place. This, combined with the camera's night vision mode provides the same effect as one we already seen in Amnesia: A Dark Descent. - player is left feeling vulnerable and helpless, the feeling that is only strenghtened by main characters unwilling sobs and heavy breathing. On the other hand, the fact that it takes several hits for enemies to end your life (at least on normal difficulty) diminishes the overall feeling and could have been made harder on the player.\n\nMusic, environmental sounds and animation have all been done beautifully and with much detail and serve to enrich the environment and the atmosphere. Graphics are solid, even rough at places (some textures look like from a 10 year old game), so it only adds weight to the question of unusual system requirements.\n\nThe story is told via documents you find while roaming through the asylum, notes that the protagonist makes and, on a rare occasion, by NPC characters you interact with in some way. This is a formula used by many games, but it has not been done well. It's both hard to follow and uninteresting (several cliches jumbled one atop another), so you'll probably stop caring somewhere along the way, which kinda defeats the purpose of you playing as a journalist who wants to expose what has been happening behind the walls of the asylum.\n\nThere are some interesting moments to the story though, but they revolve around things that concern the player and not the 'big picture'.\n\nOverall, even though not a masterpiece of horror, Outlast is still quite enjoyable and is bound to send more than a couple of chills down your spine.\n\n7/10","October 2, 2013","true","6.1"," 248 of 346 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","248","346","0","4"

Half the reviews I read down here were just people saying that they played for like an hour before closing the game out of fear. I'm giving a legitimate review as someone who's had multiple playthroughs of Outlast, and about three fourths through Whistleblower. Alright, without further ado, here goes.\n\n\nBefore I got this game, I really, really wanted it. In fact ever since it was announced and released, I wanted it. It seemed legitimately scary and, overall, just a fun game. A few months ago for my birthday, my friend was kind enough to get it and Whisteblower for me together. Needless to say, I was overjoyed, installed and played the game immediately. I started a new game on Normal and began my playthrough. After finishing my first serious playthrough, I played through it again. Both times were a hell of a lot of fun, and some scares still get to me. I really did love this game, and I'm loving Whistleblower just as much.\n\nStories aside, you probably want the actual review. Fair enough and I'll give it to you.\nPros-Great, tense atmosphere\n-Amazing, immersive sound and music design\n-Enemy design is absolutely terrifying, character and model-wise, Eddie and Trager are prime examples\n-Full body awareness\n-Simplistic "parkour" system that lets you traverse the map in various ways to help hide and run from enemies\n-Player characters actually have implied personalities\n-Every character has their own unique personality that gives them their own charm\n-For the most part, you actually feel like you're in danger, and you feel compelled to run away from the danger and survive\nWith that said, for a first game, and just on its own, Outlast really, REALLY outdoes itself.\n\nCons-Cliched setting, and semi-cliched story, it's been done before, though I will give Red Barrels credit for making it work\n-Deus Ex Machinas, they're in abundance, I mean Miles and Waylon are LITERALLY the luckiest people on Earth\n-Trager could have used more of a role, for his character\n-The ending in Outlast was kind of a buzzkill, though Whistleblower makes up for it\nBased on your opinion, the cons can outweigh the pros or the pros can outweigh the cons. I went with the latter.\n\nFinal verdictNow, finally, the final verdict I give to Outlast. My final verdict is a 8.9/10. It would have scored higher, and may change, if I knew what else is to come of Whistleblower. Expect an update by that time, but this, for now, is my final verdict. I really loved Outlast, and I feel it's deserving of all the praise it got. Now we just have to wait for Outlast 2, yay!","July 24, 2015","true","15.0"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","48","54","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadviper31/recommended/238320/","shadviper31","ShadowViper31","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadviper31/","29 products in account",""Engrossing, stimulating and gripping, the definitive proof that survival horror is alive and well-fed in indie gaming."\n\nOutlast is the first game created at Red Barrels, a relatively recent indie company based in Montreal, Canada. Indie gaming has been rising in notoriety in the last five years, reviving old-school genres, like platforming and horror, and offering generally good and refreshing experiences. Red Barrels, a team made of no-more-than-a-handful of veteran dissidents from BIG companies (like Ubisoft, Naughty Dog and EA), and graduates from NAD (National Animation and Design) Center, delivers just that: a good, refreshing experience that shows, just as Amnesia did, that the horror genre is still thriving and innovative, especially in the indie part of the industry.\n\n\nYou play as Miles Upshur, an investigative journalist that seeks to uncover the truth behind Murkoff Corporation and its operations at Mount Massive Asylum, in Colorado. As any true horror-game protagonist...hrm, I mean, as any true journalist, he decides to force his way in. However, bad luck strikes, and Miles sees himself trapped as (and with) the inmates of the asylum, with nothing but his camcorder.\n\nThe story revolves around the 'predicaments' that Miles has to go through in his attempt to escape. Most or all of them are caused by the asylum's inmates, which have taken control of it after a series of shady events, research and experiments. Yeah, cliche as hell itself, but that's how you know it's a horror game. I mean, if it's stupid but it works, it's not stupid. What I'm trying to say is: what matters is how it's worked out. How it's developed, and how it's 'acted'. And it is rather well, I must say. The whole mood is ingeniously maintained at the same tone throughout the game, and the tone is panic-struck after-a-marathon racing-heart beat. Mostly because there is no combat. The only thing you can do besides recording a lunatic violating a dead body, is flee from said lunatic when it goes ape-sh*t on you. Apart for some short interludes, most of your time will be spent either trying to get somewhere while running from someone who is chasing you, or asking yourself how long it has been since the last jump scare, and dreading the impending proximity of the next.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much I love this game's atmosphere. The thrill of carefully opening a door and peer inside to make sure it's safe, or make it to a room before a chaser, and slam the door just barely before he gets there, to slow him down. Looking around a corner or waiting in a locker before the coast is clear, praying that the guy who's after you won't check the one you're in...The sole exception to this rule is the abundance of batteries (needed to use the camera, and its night-vision feature), which are sometimes placed in meaningful places, like next to a radio, but, unfortunately, most are just scattered around. It's not that it's not realistic, but it kinda of spoils the fear of running out of something we desperately need. However, in my second playthrough, I didn't find this to be such an issue, as I wasted far more batteries using night vision, looking for all the documents scattered in the environment (that serve for exactly what you think they serve).\n\nBut getting back on the discussion of the story, the mood is also really well achieved and maintained when it comes to the characters you meet. They're all completely deranged and insane, obviously, but most have relevant personalities and a good design behind them. I'll point out two examples. First there's this duo you meet relatively early in the game that, albeit their savage and aggressive look and stance, have a somewhat cheeky, but nevertheless dark, dialogue between themselves. Second, sometimes you'll find harmless characters, which come as a great complement to the regular loud murdering sicko. They'll be just minding their business, doing like...things crazy people do.\n\nMany say that the story takes a sour turn in the last hour or so, but I don't think it does. What basically happens is, the answer to something that is happening at the asylum slowly begins to turn mythological...but you also feel like it could be dismissed as an illusion or a mirage or something like that. It's never actually explained except in the very end, and this part is somewhat different from the rest of the game. But, it's still very exciting and climatic. The ending is worth it, and the plot twist is probably not what you expected.\n\nIn the graphics department, I'll kick it off by praising what I think this game does best, and that is lighting. I mean, it's nothing short of perfectly adequate and neatly executed. The light fills the room like it's supposed to, never too dark, never too bright. It really maintains the overall consistency and tone of the game in the best way. But it's even better when there is NO light. Then, Miles will need to use his camcorder handy night-vision feature, which is implemented in a terrific way, not only as a graphical treat but also as a neat gameplay mechanic. The environment is sometimes confusing, but not enough to be a bad thing (it's a horror game, after all, and for better or for worse, it adds to the panic and agitation). The environment design fits the ruined and decadent asylum ambiance like a glove, just like the grainy effects on the screen, when you're using the camera, match the found-footage effect. The animations are competent, not awesome, but, in general the graphics are great.\n\nThe sound is also top-notch, from the simplest sound effect to voice-acting, even the musical score played when you're being chased. I can't point out one sound I was displeased to hear or that I felt didn't belong there.\n\nIn conclusion, I say that Outlast is a definite must-buy for all horror games fans. At 20 bucks, it offers one of the best experiences of the genre. It highlights the indie gaming quality and stands as one of the best examples of it (along many other, and increasingly more). The only sour feeling I had playing this game was when I finished it. The game is short (it only takes 5 hours or so) but it doesn't feel short. And that is the mark of a great game.","January 22","true","166.4"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","33","33","4","2"

Within the first half hour of the game I got scared so hard combined with the poor digestion of overly-spiced food that I literally sh*t myself.\nSo there's that.\nNow, what is Outlast? Is it just another first person horror game? Well, basically it is, yes. But that's not a bad thing at all.\nOutlast puts you in a mental asylum gone batsh*t sour, arming you with nothing but a nightvision camera. From there on you'll sneak and crawl through the asylum. Unfortunately for you, you're not the only sneaking and crawling person in there.\nThere are no weapons (no guns, no chainsaws, no large purple d*ldo's or whatever tickles your imagination) to defend yourself with. You either run and hide or you stay and die. Is it that simple? Well it could've been if they had payed their damn electricity bills.\nThe asylum you get to explore in Outlast is dark, and I mean dark dark. You will rarely be able to see without using your camera's nightvision function, and even if you use it there's a chance your battery runs out. Now THAT delivers an entirely different level of "scare" to the table.\nThere are jumpscares, I'll admitt it, but those will be the least of your problems. Your main problem is that you know you're not alone, and that you don't know whether you are or aren't.\nIf you're tired of shooting your way out of scary s(h)ituations, treat yourself to Outlast. It's scary, it's atmospheric, and it's definately worth every minute you dare to spend playing it.\nOh, PS: don't eat spicy food before playing.

Crazy disturbing, but not too many jump scares.  Buy it.\n\nEND SHORT VERSION.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Superbly detailed graphics. Ran buttery-smooth at 60fps on my machine.  Sometimes I just liked to walk into empty rooms and stare at them, they are so amazingly specific.  Devs captured the "night-vision infared camera" look perfectly.\n-Convincing atmosphere.  Played this game at night with the headphones on and the lights off and after 20 minutes I felt like that dude in Tron when he got sucked into the game.\n-Genre-pushing visuals.  Saw things in this game (and the dlc) that I NEVER saw in any other game, ever:  HOLY CRAP, DUDE WTF AM I LOOKING AT???  IS THAT GUY tenderly carressing A willing adult partner IN THE agreed upon location???????  AAAAARRRRGH WHERE IS THE "UNSEE" BUTTON???????\n\nCONS:\n-another one of those "run, hide or die" stealth games. No weapons, anywhere.  Problem for me was there wasn't enough variation; running and hiding through the entire game got a little boring sometimes.  Wished I could I pull off a stealth melee kill at least once in a while, just for a little variation and pace change.  Admittedly, though, most folks will be too scared out of their mind to agree with me on that point.\n\n\n10/10 - would calmly play this in the near future again","September 5, 2015","true","14.1"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","86","43","50","21","3"

I'm your very own Centipede bringing you the first installment of Chose Your Own Review!\n\nHere's what you do: just ignore that Recommended yes/no part; instead simply pick the option that leads to your personalized recommendation of Outlast and then just highlight the text below with your cursor!\n\nEasy, right?! Nothing to it! Bob's your uncle! Here we go!\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a horror fan, blood and guts don't scare me. I'm looking for the next big thrill and ain't no price or jump-scare stopping me!\nUr so cute omg! Play Outlast during mid-day lunch break, in a well-lit room surrounded by your noisy bros. Keep a casual attitude and act like you're showing off the game to your bros. Make Benny Hill noises during chase scenes to lighten the mood.\n\nI'm a pessimistic person, a bit depressive and with a bleak outlook on things. I search the darker side of life but I'm really more into the subtle psychological narratives, dark and twisted mind states. Not so keen on jump scares.\nYou prolly want Amnesia - it's on your recommended list, of course. Outlast's story is a bit silly but the moment-to-moment gameplay will be tense, like a primal game of hide and seek. It will make you feel more alive and appreciative of life's sanity-filled moments. Get it on sale.\n\nI rather consider myself a regular, socially-adjusted person; would like to get more into horror as this seems to be a catchy genre and looks like fun.\nYou're in luck! Buy Outlast and play it with your dates. Outlast is excellent for a romantic night-in. The saying should go 'Dinner and an Outlast chase' as far as I'm concerned; get that adrenaline pumping and you're in for some disturbing loving.\n\nI'm a relatively sheltered person and I'm curious about the horror scene; would be cute to get in touch with my darker side.\nYou're a cutie-pie. Get Outlast right now, play it home alone at night, lights out, headphones on, it will be the start of something wonderful. Meet me for brunch after you finish it so we can share thoughts.\n\nI'm like - SO into horror! I just looove Nightmare on Elm Street and that American Psycho thing was oh-my-god I could just see myself in it!\nOh boy you're gonna like this. Outlast is a very cheap investment for the success of your next Let's Play! series. Play it with your friends while downing Kahluas and blasting reggae on your surround system. Scream like a little girl when you see something moving in the dark so that your neighbours get some of that entertainment in their lives too!\n\nI am a connoiseur of the finest disturbing horror. Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun and Saladfingers all bore me now, played all the Amnesia and Penumbra games back to back - still left me wanting more!\nYou are Chuck Norris. Outlast is actually kind of like your childhood so you will be quite bored. Give it a miss, Chuck.\n\nGore! Violence! Blood for the Blood God!\nU're drunk. Play Outlast while getting drunk on a sunny Saturday morning. Wheee! Or instead go play GTAV or Assassin's Creed I DON'T KNOW.\n\n\nI want to be the King and Queen of Cheese! Buy some Cheese Cleese?\nYou are the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. You are a mere mortal person wading through a meaningless, vapid, hostile existence. Play Outlast while watching Monty Python and simultaneously slapping yourself very roughly. Delight in feeling something, anything, even if it's mere discomfort.\n\n\nI am a refined individual and enjoy the finer things in life; Cabernet Sauvignon, chess, Arcangello Corelli and 120 Days of Sodom. I like it when the red liquid comes out of people...\nSave your time old chap, don't buy Outlast; life is your true playground, you can play in real life instead!

It was originally run by Nazi Germans to conduct researches for the USA, but 1971 it was finally closed - caused by the brutal murder of three scientists.\n\nEnough spoilers, let's look at it graphically. I must say, aesthetically this game indeed serverd a great job of giving you the shivers... from dark creepy places to corpse-filled bloody rooms, it has all the horror classics you can imagine... well let's forget about the forest-cliché. Story-wise, I am... fairly dissapointed. Excitement was not really built up, the storyline was pretty casual but I guess that's a matter of taste, right?

You will feel nothing but fear and horror throughout the entire game, it's simply amazing.\n\nSo all my life I've been watching horror movies, read scary novels and what not. Figured Outlast wouldn't be that much of a difference, but it turns out I was wrong. Outlast throws you into the depths of hell by the name of Mount Massive Asylum and really pushes you to the limit. As soon as you pick up the camera and sneak into the building you can feel the intensity rising. You're about to have an experience of a lifetime, in between running for your life, hiding under beds or just screaming like a little girl as you try to find a way out.\n\nThe story could have been a bit more polished. At times it was quite confusing what was really going on, could it be I had missed a file somewhere which could explain what just happened? But overall I found it more and more intriguing the deeper I went. The more files I picked up, the more characters I met. Every meeting with a new main character really messes with your mind. They're all twisted in their own little ways, ranging from wanting to cut you to pieces to stitch you back up, eating your flesh or just brutally ripping you apart for their own amusement.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the immersive atmosphere of the game. The distant lights you hoped to be safe, the creeping shadows you tried to hide in. It really felt like you were there, surviving for your own life whilst trying to figure out what really happened in the depths of the asylum.\n\nThe Whistleblower DLCIs definitely a great addition to the game, and it delivers horror in a different way. You're taking the role of Waylon Park, a software engineer who works for Murkoff who is also responsible for the e-mail which brought the reporter, Miles Upshur, to the asylum. Having a completely new perspective on what's going on it still delivered the same, if not more horror on top of an already extremely scary game.\n\nOverall the game gave me an amazing experience I'd recommend to anyone who would like a good scare and/or a great story to throw yourself into. However, keep in mind that it does contain quite vulgar language, gore and a lot of nudity.","January 4, 2015","true","8.2"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

I’m talking straight up deranged, demented and disgusting! This is the kind of horror that terrifies the likes of Clive Barker & makes Stephen King look under the bed at night! It’s hard to imagine what kind of sick individual has written this abomination of a game, but I imagine me and him would get on just great.\n\nTruly, there are many horror survival type games out that have done the whole “trapped in an insane asylum” blah blah so cliché… but wait, this is different. There is a sick, twisted quality in the lining that sets it apart and offers up something, dare I say – interesting, no, maybe intriguing? It leaves the same kind of impact Silent Hill did all those years ago when you first played it; a combination of perfect atmosphere from the infinitely well-tuned audio, the visual disgust of ‘no-limits’ gore & the clever writing for the sicko’s you face off against.\n\nThis game is a steal at its price, it will have you pooping your pants and re-thinking every horror game you played up till now. All other horror titles that release now have a benchmark, and I’m sure this game, with it’s planned DLC it will outlast most new contenders. 9/10.","May 13, 2014","true","12.5"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","2"

It's linear, easy (even on harder levels of difficulty) and short (3 to 4 hours). It's forgiving due to frequent and well-placed checkpoints. It's pretty straightforward so you can't really go the wrong way. Also your enemies can't outrun you and unless you make horrible mistakes, you're invincible. THOUGH the games has a pretty good atmosphere and setting and is fun to play despite all the flaws that it obviously has. Outlast tells a very deep story, which is quite hard to catch the first time you're playing. Speaking of the ending.. I personally find it a little non-authentic and I expected something else, though this doesn't really affect the final score.

And the fact that it was created by indie developers makes me wonder why all indie developers don't make games of this standard. They did get funding, however it is still a very high-quality game. Well done to the producers too, they made this game very scary, but not so scary that people wouldn't buy it because of the fear level. Now onto my opinions of this game. As you can probably already tell, I'm a fan of this game. I loved every second of it, the excitement, the fear, the horror. I do agree with people who say this game could've been way more horrifying, but at the same time I feel like the developers got it right with the plot, difficulty, build-up to scary moments etc. I also really liked the notes and documents system and the variety in the enemies (variants). Now with the Whistleblower DLC, I really want to say I enjoyed it more than the main game, but I'm just not sure about it. But for a horror game, it has an excellent story. The story and exploration mixed with the notes and documents made me feel like I was immersed in every situation, which, I think, the developers of all horror games should strive for. All in all, Outlast is a very pleasurable encounter for those of you that enjoy being frightened so much that your mind will scream in affliction and writhe in agony due to the malevolent nature of this game. 8.5/10","August 11, 2014","true","13.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

The story is clever enough to assemble all themes into a complete picture and tie it with some historical facts, but the most important thing is this: Outlast is really scary. Honestly, no game before has made me feel such strong emotions. Outlast is a must buy for all fans of scary stories. Outlast is a game designed to frighten even those who deem themselves hard to scare. What we have here is a proper survival-horror game that thankfully doesn’t make the transition to the action genre like so many other horror-themed games these days.Outlast’s combination of stealth, platforming and horror is exceptional, the benefits of the diverse experience of its highly talented development team always in plain sight. Outlast hits most of its objectives, serving as head of a new series for the horror subjective.","May 8, 2014","true","34.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

If you were a fan of the first game's intense a atmosphere, and scare teasing you will enjoy the DLC.\n\nIt tells the story of a Waylon Parks The Whistleblower who informs Miles of the atrocities happening in Asylum. There are more than a few nods and mentions to the base game, which will keep the fans happy and provide plenty of 'Aaaaaaah I remember...' moments.\n\nThere's just something about the Outlast series that I really like. I'm not sure if it's the presentation, or the sense of hopelessness mixed with the strong desire to survive the main characters have. Perhaps it's something to do with how I always come away feeling like the engine and experience would make the ideal 'Alien' survival game.\nIf Alien: Isolation is anywhere near Outlast in terms of presentation, story, style, sounding and lightning they'll be onto an instant hit with me.\nThat feeling of slowly pacing yourself through the corridors of Mount Massive, peeking your head around the corner to scout the junction. Your heartbeat rising as you see a suspected insane inmate ready to tell you a secret... the sound of chains... the musical ques all work together to create a really gripping experience.\n\nI'm not one to scare easily, but this game (and the DLC) got me a fair few times. Not only with the well timed and scripted jump scares, but with the sense of panic that can (and will) takeover as you scramble away from foes determined to cook, fix or marry you. It's one of the few games were you CAN'T fight and flight is your only friend. Running and scramble over objects, squeezing through gaps and hiding in lockers or under beds has never felt so 'real'.\nThe realism is another aspect that works so well for the game. I felt like I HAD to go slowly, I didn't want to run and announce my arrival and position with the heavy stomps of footsteps.\nIt's not only the speed of the game, it's the First-Person sway and bobbing. I know some people aren't a fan of the simulated movement of the head however it works so well in Outlast and really helps you believe you're the protagonist.\n\nOverall Outlast - Whistleblower DLC is well worth the time, especially if you played the base game. Sure it has similar elements to Outlast, but that's the beauty of it for me. Play this in the dark.\n\nJust make sure your other half doesn't burst through the door 2am in the morning, turns the lights on and scares the crap out of you...","July 25, 2014","true","4.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","3"

You know that mood shortly before it begins to rain? Lighting flashes soft thunder sound mixed with a nice sunset and an old lantern waving in the wind. Controls are easy going and intuitive. Mount Massive asylum is huge. You visit several areas of the asylum where some can be a true pain in the ♥♥♥ when you run out of batteries. Oh yeah you are equipped with a camcorder that you can proof what you experience in Mount Massive. Every time you use "night shot" it is consuming battery power. The "night shot" replaces the flashlight in the game.\n\nI noticed weather changes during play through - so later in the game it rains cats and dogs. I loved the sometimes slow pace of the game  with lot of hiding in the dark e.g. where you have to get the three fuses - but maybe that´s just me TYLER :) There are fast paced parts alike where you have to run like hell to escape some baddies who just want one thing -  hunt you down! You quickly realize that you are the prey in this game - at the latest when you lose some fingers...\n\nAll in all the reason I played OUTLAST again and again was the cool asylum setting. If you´re a fan of movies like "Grave Encounters" this game could be right for you since Unreal Engine 3.5 does a great job offering you Mount Massive Asylum as a playground. I can nothing but recommend Outlast as it is a great thrillride through an typically 1950´s asylum.","June 2","true","26.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","3"

I've heard so many people say it's short, boring and only good for jump scares but it's so much better than that. There's a great story, unique characters, LONG gameplay (I've got 8 hours invested so far and i'm still on chapter 5. there are 8 chapters.)\nLike I said, there is storyline and there is a thick plot. There are plot twists that you wouldn't expect and sometimes you'll even feel guilty for killing or seeing a character die. The game attatches to you. I've found myself gritting my teeth through entire gameplay and not even realizing it till I come to a checkpoint.\nThere's more than 'jump scares'. There's chase, anxiety and the process of prey and predator. All you can do is hide most of the time so when you can finally fight back during times you have a sense of acomplishment.\nI could go deeper into the details of difficulty and finding batteries but it's all really just a matter of narrowing your resources and using them wisely--mostly just batteries.\nHonestly the only problem I've had with this game is that it tends to get confusing when running away from enemies in a small hallway or room. You will bump into walls and get stuck behind objects but it's easy to get out of. It's nothing to deduct from this wonderful game.","May 14, 2014","true","33.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

There is an area later on in the game, a open courtyard for the asylum that has rain pouring down and is completely pitch black, save for intermittent flashes of lightning.  It looks absolutely spectacular and I haven't seen such good lightning in a video game since STALKER.\n\nMost horror games will have high quality sound design and Outlast has some of the best sound design in any horror game I've come across.  The music is haunting, subtle and memorable, and when you're cowering in the shadows you wish it would go away just like the crazed denizens of the asylum.  Sound effects are executed perfectly, everything from footsteps to slamming doors and ambient noises will leave you questioning whether that noise you heard was just ambient noise or something sinister in the darkness.\n\nArguably, the story is the only thing that could be really criticized as being underwhelming.  The story of a reporter who investigates an asylum due to an anonymous tip and the horror and events that unfold is definitely not an original idea.  Then again, if you're looking for original stories in horror you'll probably be disappointed most of the time, as most ideas have already been done.  The final area of the game and the ending could potentially not sit well with some people, but I enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed Outlast and I don't think a horror game will come out that will top it till Frictional's next project, SOMA.\n\nDemerson's overall score for Outlast: 8 dangly inmate ♥♥♥♥♥ out of 10.","December 6, 2013","true","9.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","2"

This game sets on fictional asylum, investigating the Murkoff Industries about the experiments. You play as Miles Upshur, a journalist, trying to expose the truth about Murkoff's plans. Let's talk about the game, you cannot fight back, all you need to do is to hide and run away from those creepy deranged experiments. Also, you have a night vision camera to guide through darkness BUT you need a battery to use the night vision, so use it well or you will end up finding batteries if you are running out. Outlast's setting is dark yet creepy soundscape, that gives you an immersive experience of the game (if you are playing at night with headphones and no lights on XD). The gameplay time, it's about 2 - 6 hours if you are searching for documents and notes. The backstory seems to be interesting about what happen during and before the events of the game if you are reading the documents. The story, I don't know about it, I'd say it is above average, better than generic. The most annoying sections are finding three keys for a key(yo dawg) or opening a door, it's a rinse and repeat process.\n\n+ Pros + Dark and Creepy atmosphere\n+ Forgot to mention, jumpscares\n+ Detailed graphics running with Unreal Engine 3 (not bad for an indie developer)\n+ Chase scenes are heart pumping\n+ Story\n+ Controls\n\n- Cons - 3 keys sequence throughout the story\n- Ending of the game\n\nOverall, this game is recommended if you want to sign up for it. It is not recommended if you have a heart related sickness or phobia of the dark. The only thing that frustrates me is finding 3 keys sections. The game is still the best horror game I have ever experienced. I will post a review of Whistleblower DLC soon.

I really enjoyed the way the player's body interacted with the environment (holding a hallway corner with your hand as you peek around it, for example). The video camera mechanics were great, too. The type of scariness is similar to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but in Outlast, the enemies have names and personality that makes some of them way more creepy than the servants in Amnesia. Overall, it wasn't quite as scary as Amnesia, due to it's heavily scripted nature. It did have some great adrenaline-pumping chase scenes, though, reminiscent of the good parts of Mirror's Edge.

Sometimes you just feel you are playing an Action game, not a Survival Horror)\n-Some scarejumps are really predictable specially if you have played some games of the genre\n\n-------\n\nIn my personal opinion, Outlast is a "must-play-game" it's good.\nSincerely, i was expecting more "horror" from this game, not really as scary all the ppl thinks.\n\nAbout the Whistleblower DLC BUY IT!More Outlast action, so if you liked Outlast you will like the DLC, the DLC is actually more terrifying than the original game, so you will like it a lot!","December 10, 2014","true","13.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","5"

The lighting effects are amazing. Even the small details are just mind blowing. Like the attention to detail on the rain and even the detail when the rain hits a window and you can see the water lines dripping down. On top of that, the sound effects and soundtrack is top notch giving you that feeling of true horror. If you ever seen a horror movie where you would hear the music score pick up and get tense when a character was running for their life and about to die then you should expect the same with OUTLAST. The more your life is in danger the more the soundtrack gets tense.\n\nAlso, the sound detail put into your characters' level of fear is some of the best I have ever heard. His breathing changes according to the level of fear he has. Like hearing him breathing heaving from nose and mouth to the point of dry mouth you can hear him close his mouth to swallow and continue breathing heavy again.\n\nThe controls are very smooth and responsive. Like running for you life, feeling the enemy breathing down your neck, you manage to get away and slamming a door open and turning quickly to shut it, then do a running slide under a bed to hide hoping you won't get found.\n\nYea, this game is scary and tense. I hope they make a second part to OUTLAST because I would definitely play it. :)","September 11, 2013","true","15.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

Sometimes you have to solve very easy puzzles having to do with your escape (like climbing on walls and finding an exit).\n\nThe NPCs are scary and they show up right when you least expect it. I can say that it is like Amnesia. In other words when they find you, you have to run in order to get away from them. At times they can run as fast as you and that's really frightening. In general the A.I system is satisfactory (compared to other horror games).\n\nThe graphics are attractive! The colors are excellent! You can cleary see the details of each object while the moves are really smoothly. There are a lot of realistic scenes. Even if when you camera is on resolution is still pretty good.\n\nMusic and sound effects merge perfect with the plot! That makes the game even scarier.\n\nTo sum up, I really recommend that game (especially in sales) for the funs of horror and action.

This is gonna be my first article. I am not serious about going into Videogame Journalism but still, I decided I'd do something 'productive' with my time. I'll begin with a game I fell in love with, but sadly, can't marry it, Outlast.\n\nOutlast, the description is terrifying in it's own sense. The game is about a guy called 'Miles Upshur' who is a freelance journalist. He receives an anonymous tip from a guy who says that he worked in the Mount Massive Asylum. Miles feels this is gonna be a nice thing to take down the Murkoff Corporation and goes. Indeed, Miles had a bad childhood since he didn't watch much horror movies or he would've known what was gonna happen, but anyways, Miles did that so that we may enjoy.\n\nBACK TO THE TOPIC.\n\nOutlast is developed by Red Barrels, a company composed of ex-AAA developers. The devs used to work under big names like Ubisoft and EA. Well, Red Barrels used Unreal Engine to power their game.\n\nThe game has stunning visuals for an Indie. The description itself says, 'AAA Quality'.\n\nTo provide us with immersion, the game has amazing soundtrack, sound effects, and of course, No HUD.  Yep, no HUD. Of course, this is not a typical FPS.\n\nI'm a soundtrack-♥♥♥♥♥. I'll play any game with good soundtrack. And seriously, this game has a DOPE Soundtrack.\n\nStarting with Gameplay\nThe game is a FPS. Of course, you knew that. The gameplay is like Mirror's Edge with horror. It focuses on your camcorder and quick wits rather than those twitch reflexes.\n\nThe controls are not too extensive like Bohemia Interactive's Arma. There is a key for journal, another for Nightvision. Just these two. The remaining are simple WASD, Shift and Space.\n\nLet's get to the mechanics.\nAs I said, the game features no HUD. You don't fight, you run. Yep, Run and hide. But majority of the gameplay, you'll be hiding. Why? You'll simply be toooooo scared to go on. Like me.\n\nThe game has good physics, although, Environment doesn't play a major role, except from climbing. To be honest, if you've played Mirror's Edge, and then play this, you'll notice striking resemblance in freerunning and parkour mechanics. Although, Outlast doesn't have wallrunning and stuff, of course, Miles is just a journalist.\n\nYou happen to have a camcorder with you during the game which let's you record events, on which Miles writes his notes. I prefer having the camera out all the time because you never know which event is important. Your camcorder also has a Nightvision inbuilt, which you'll be using all the time. Realistically, your camcorder requires AA batteries to function. You'll have to think before turning on your NV or else you'll be running blindfolded from the variants until colliding with a wall and getting beaten to death.\n\n\nStory Time!\nYeah, the game has a good storyline. It feels real. Although, it's not open ended. The game is linear and thus the choices don't affect the story. You don't get any choices to be exact. The only choices you get are whether you should run or hide. Yup. Just those two.\n\n\nAaand remember, for the first time, Hide.\n\nIs it difficult?\nWell, not really. Everything is difficult at first. There are a few difficulty levels. I recommend you Nightmare, sounds tough, but I recommend it for high immersion and fun. Insane is not recommended because you don't get saves.\n\nVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDICTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!\n\nGraphics.\nStunningly good for an indie. 10/10. Runs at the Medium on my potato.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics.\nGood. Feels realistic. Not a lot of features but good. Extremely atmospheric.\n\nPrice.\nThe game is worth 20$\n\nSoundtrack.\nAmaaaaaaaaaaazing! I love it. I love the soundtrack. The BGM is amazing.\n\n\nSo, Should you buy it?\nI'll be honest. If you liked Mirror's Edge, you'll love this game. A tinge of puzzle with buckload of horror. If you're into atmospheric and storyline, buy this.","September 23, 2014","true","17.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Good game to get on discount as it is quite short (4 hours first time through). There is no combat and no puzzles so the gameplay is very limited. Mostly just exploration mixed with stealth. Gotta hide from everyone trying to kill you.\n\nAtmosphere is pretty good. Sound design and feel of the game is almost identical to condemned. Shame I couldnt grab a pipe and smash these nutcases.\n\nThe game is suposedly scary for most people but i found it wasnt very creepy for me. (I played on a 50 inch tv in the dark, with headphones). I found amnesia and p.t. to be far more unsettling. But this game does have a lot of "jumpscares" unlike the other 2 i mentioned.\n\nThe story is not bad but nothing new. There are a lot of files scattered around you can collect and read.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game and definately got my 6 bucks worth (sale). I dont think this is worth 20 dollars tho.","December 31, 2014","true","8.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/238320/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","An excellent first person horror game developed by Red Barrels! Outlast puts you in the shoes of an investigative journalist called Miles; he wishes to explore an asylum whose name and address were specifically mailed to him by one of the asylum's employees stating there are horrible things going on and that he should promptly investigate.\n\nUpon arrival you immediately notice that the game gives you a camera and... nothing more. In the dark the device's night vision mode provides you with visibility but that's all - Outlast does not give you any weapons. Those of you who played Frictional Games' Amnesia may find the concept similar - yes, here, just as in Amnesia, the dark places are your best friend. When encountering enemies you immediately need to hide as you can easily die after a couple of hits.\n\nAs your equipment consumes batteries you frequently need to search for these throughout the game. And while the game's story unfolds as you progress further it's worth checking every corner for collectibles - these are dossiers further explaining the things going on in the facility.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of a kind! The game reminds you of those found-footage horror flicks that started in 1999 by Blair Witch Project. While in well-lit (or barely lit) places you do not need to use your camera it is still advisable as Miles takes notes only when pointing his camera at certain things / events. Through these notes can you really see how he's getting more and more desperate and crazy as he further ventures into the horrors of the asylum!\n\nThe game is full of scripted events. While you think hiding is always successful, sometimes Outlast wants you to be seen by a monstrous, homicidal patient and deliberately puts you in a chasing sequence. Miles can easily vault over the obstacles  while running but nothing is more frightening when you have just escaped into a room and just closed the door behind you but you can hear the bashes of your enemy on the door while trying to hide!\n\nGraphics look good thanks to Unreal Engine 3. But the game's score and sound effects make it stand out! There is a reason why a lot of people say a headset is a must! While it is an indie game Outlast offers you roughly 5-6 hours to complete the story. Greater difficulty settings give you fewer batteries and those of your thriving for the maximum can complete the game on Insane difficulty: here there's no checkpoint so in case you die you can start it all over again!\n\nOutlast is a great game! It has a terrifying atmosphere not many horror games can offer these days. Its DLC completes the story for you and helps you with some unanswered questions. Gameplay-wise it offers fewer puzzle sequences as many of the players found these too repetitive - the developers did listen and made an even better game!","May 21, 2014","true","23.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The isolation of being able to obtain notes or see in the dark only through your video camera makes you feel completely vulnerable, much like Amnesia or Penumbra. A lack of being able to defend yourself heightens the anxiety for sure. I would say that this game fits more on the side of psychological horror, however, as much of what the player sees or experiences is meant to elicit a visceral or uneasy reaction rather than complete and utter scares; not that those have been neglected, either.\n\nAll in all, a good game, significantly long enough, the DLC is worth the money, definitely a favorite of mine, with a fun and different story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhamwich/recommended/238320/","samhamwich","Sam Hamwich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhamwich/","1858 products in account","Games of the horror genre usually don't hold my attention well, (either because I find them a bit over the top in the scare department, or they are lacking in anything but jump scares).  Outlast however somehow manages to keep me playing, and feeling nervous at the same time.\n\nBefore I go into any sort of detail let me place Outlast's concepts in 3 simple steps.\n\nStep 1- Give players an eerie atmosphere with a basic creepy concept, such as I don't know, say an insane asylum? (Wait this does work, trust me)\n\nStep 2- Tap into the human psych and our deep down fear of being chased and hunted and place them in an interactive story 20 inches from our faces.\n\nStep 3- Continue to attack that primal fear relentlessly until we actually have to put down the controller/keyboard/mouse.  Then make us come back so we can experience this thrill as soon as our heart rate settles down again.\n\nThis shouldn't be a working formula for a good game, but for some reason, this works fantastic for Outlast.\n\nThis basic bit of thought pattern is what I call the "Outlast Effect"(Yes i have been using this term out of the game!) The best way to describe this sensation is when you turn out the last light in the basement and quickly run up the stairs because you can feel or sense something lurking in the dark behind you.\n\nGiven the fact that your character is only equipped with a video camera, which can record the horrors you face( and also provides you with semi-good night vision), the action can get quite intense.\nOutlast often makes you feel like someone is watching you, and this is usually the case.  You always feel as if around every corner you'll get a nasty surprise or find someone who wants you dead.  Yes, there are a bunch of jump scares, but they are very well placed and they seem to be placed strategically rather than in obvious spots.  The true horror this game provides is during its countless chase scenes. The game mechanics can add to this sensation greatly if you choose to use them well.  You can spin your head to look backwards to see if the enemy chasing you is gaining ground, you can also dive through doors, turning quickly to slam it shut on your pursuers. You can hide under beds, in lockers and sneak through small cracks that you can barely squeeze through.  The ability to hide from the enemy makes it interesting as well, and the AI reacts quite well to finding you.  Early in the game they rarely check for you in the correct hiding spots but as the game progresses the enemies seem to act more randomly and tend to catch you hiding more often. The game mechanics work excellent in this setting as well.  The mental hospital provides small narrow corridors, which are perfect for providing you with a claustrophobic feeling once the bad guys start chasing.\n\nThe sound in this game is fantastic, from your character's breathing when you are hiding, to the sounds of the mumbling maniacs pursing you down the narrow corridors.  The different types of enemies come with their own sounds, some of the larger baddies carry chains, and one even has a massive pair of scissors.  You can often hear muffled footsteps in a room close by, or echoes down long corridors.  The music is very well orchestrated to fit the tone of being helpless and it seamlessly fades in and out according the danger.\n\nThe visuals are also done well, the graphics are on par with any of the newer releases and the animation is fantastic.  When learning around corners your hand can be seen pressing against the walls or doorframes.  These items may seem like small detail, but that's actually what makes a good game noticeable in my opinion.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic addition to anyone's steam library.  The story is a bit lacking and considering the action is all about hiding and fleeing rather than fighting it may not be for everyone.\n\nOutlast gets a 9/10, and a big thumbs up!\n\nSamHamwich out.\n","December 9, 2013","true","14.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Please enjoy''\n-Quoted from the game before you start playing Outlast.\n\nAs quoted here, this is exactly what Outlast is all about and is extremely well done, Especially the camera since you play as Miles Upshur, an investigative reporter whose ambition earn him an intimate tour of hell on earth. You start of as Miles driving towards the Mount Massive Asylum to uncover the secrets while you investigate the place that no other reporters would dare to do.\n\nAnd since your only options are to proceed forward and uncovering the truth you either run, hide, or you die.\n\nThere will be a lot of unexpected things happening to you and the controls are very smooth, Especially while you use the camera, The battery only gets drained when you use the night vision that has a green view to it, and isn't very strong you can see a few meters ahead and should you run out of battery you will almost be completely blind adding a lot of tension to not consuming all of your batteries.\n\nNavigating in the corridors of the Asylum, you're terrified of what awaits you and what as you uncover more of what has happened and is still happening, The secrets you find out that you never imagined was possible and as you're stuck in the Asylum trying to escape from the place. The language in this game surprises you kinda as it intesifies the experience in the game, It feels so real as if you were there.\n\nIn short, I really do recomend playing Outlast for those that enjoy playing horror games on evenings in the right atmosphere with a good headset so you hear well aswell.\n\nGreat game, 10/10, I couldn't have asked for anything better in Outlast.","October 1, 2014","true","11.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The isolation of being able to obtain notes or see in the dark only through your video camera makes you feel completely vulnerable, much like Amnesia or Penumbra. A lack of being able to defend yourself heightens the anxiety for sure. I would say that this game fits more on the side of psychological horror, however, as much of what the player sees or experiences is meant to elicit a visceral or uneasy reaction rather than complete and utter scares; not that those have been neglected, either.\n\nAll in all, a good game, significantly long enough, the DLC is worth the money, definitely a favorite of mine, with a fun and different story.

The whole world just gives off this ominous feeling and you are unable to shake it throughout the entire game. If there is one game that I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone, whether you're a fan of horror-games or not, it would be this game. This game will ruin all other games for you and I am hoping that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (which is due for release in a few days), can duplicate the standard that this game just set for me for horror games, if not heighten that standard. I applaud Red Barrel Studios for this amazing work of art.\n\nThis has renewed my faith in the Horror Genre of video games.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo I have decided to update this for the DLC that just came out, Whistleblower.  Whistleblower overall was a good game and followed suit with the original Outlast feel and atmosphere (which is a good thing!).  It did however become repetitive in its nature and being able to consistantly run-away from the enemies (and know you can without being caught) really began to dull the game experience and take the 'scare' out of it.  I wil say that I thoroughly enjoyed the new enemies and the freaky environment jump-scares.\n\nOverall, up to the point of the DLC Whistleblower, I would give this game a 3-3.5 out of 5.  I feel that the game becomes too predictable after a certain amount of time and doesnt really push the importance of batteries onto the protagonist.  You can take pretty much all the time you want in the world and study the enemies patterns which makes it a lot easier/less scary.  I am hoping that the next DLC proves to be more unpredictable but I absolutely LOVED the ambience that was introduced during Whistleblower.","May 7, 2014","true","10.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Outlast, which is a journey through an insane asylum that has become a true hell on earth, is Red Barrels' pride and joy, if you want my opinion on it. If you haven't played the game, allow me to explain how its scare factor is significantly high.\n\nSimilar to games like Amnesia and SCP: Containment Breach, Outlast is a survival-horror game where you only have three options, which (as stated in the intro of the game) are as follows: run, hide, or die. While this may make Outlast seem like a sort of ripoff, there are a few major differences, the greatest being the camcorder and how it is implemented into the gameplay. Not only is the camcorder your only means of navigating the dark via infrared vision, it also gives you the ability to get info on what happened in the story by recording certain events as they happen before you. This, to me, makes Outlast stand out to the other horror games I have played.\n\nWhile the game does tend to get rather repetitive at some points, what with a find a few things while avoiding homicidal enemies in the process, this is only a minor flaw that can be overlooked if you try hard enough. Story, setting, ambience, and quite a few other things make this game feel like what a found footage film should aspire to be.\n\nWhat really sells this game to me are the enemies themselves. Known as the "Variants," the enemies of this game come in all shapes and sizes, quite literally. The unique Variants are the most effective means of terrifying the player, and their backstories (explained via documents found as you go through the asylum) make them even more monstrous.\n\nIf you're into scaring the pants off of yourself this Halloween (or any time of the year, really), I suggest you get Outlast. And if you have a little extra coin, put it into the Whistleblower DLC, which adds in a completely new story that ties in to the main game almost perfectly! This game is the scariest I've ever played, and I'm certain it will scare the pants off of you as well.","October 26, 2014","true","27.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You play as a reporter, who gets an email saying some dark things are happening in an insane asylum (why didn't the person who send the email just contact 4 stoners and a dog?), and you try to find out what happened. The gameplay is similar to Amnesia, where you can't fight back, leaving you to hide, or outrun your persuers. What I loved about this game is that it uses jumpscares correctly, because they happen to suprise you so your defenses would go down, rather than trying to scare you. The graphics are great, and it makes the game feel more 'alive'. The enemies are quite horrifying, and the ones that scared me the most were the twins and the doctor (I forgot his name), not because they jump out at you, but because what they do to you. I would recomend this game to avid horror fans, and I am personally astounded by the game, but I am a little dissapointed at the length of the game, lasting around 3 to 4 hours long if you don't try to find everything. Overall, I love this game, and I can't wait to get whistle blower.\n\n(Update) I have gotten whistleblower on sale, and boy is it horrifying! I was not as scared playing outlast because I was playing with my cousin, and whistleblower gives you more reasons to be afraid. The main character in whistleblower is Waylon Park, who is a computer engineer for the mental asylum, who tries to tell Miles (the main character in Outlsat) about the happenings in the asylum. Before Waylon could send the message, he is taken and experimented on, but escapes and tries to find a way out. I have not beaten the game, but the enemies are really unpredictable, and Whistleblower is a great addon to Outlast. ONLY PLAY IT AFTER YOU HAVE BEATEN OUTLAST, AS WHISTLE BLOWER HAS A LOT OF SPOILERS!

They'll play it because a friend sent it as a cruel gift, or because they know it'll be hilarious for others to watch on YouTube. The appeal of fear is pretty obvious, but if you're like me, horror games are never all that frightening. Still, I find myself playing horror games from time-to-time to see if they excell in other areas.\n\nIn that respect, Outlast is an excellent game. Underneath all the frequent (and often unavoidable) jump-scares and prolific gore, Outlast is a game with expertly-crafted mechanics, an intriguing (if convoluted) story to tell, and stunning visuals. You'll find yourself legitimately curious about what secrets Mount Massive Asylum holds. Unlike most survival horror games, Outlast doesn't bog the player down with a tedious inventory system or intentionally-unresponsive mechanics. Instead, the player quickly and fluidly navigates a labyrinthine environment, using only a night-vision camera to help see in the dark.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games, then you've already played this. But if you never bother with games that just focus on being scary, I recommend you still give this one a try. Not because Outlast will frighten you, but because it doesn't sacrifice gameplay in favor of cheap scares for the easily-spooked.","August 31, 2014","true","12.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I cannot say enough good things about it. The atmosphere is phenomenal and extremely well put together. Paired with the music and sounds, it can't get any better.\nAs for the actual gameplay, Outlast needs a little thinking involved. You shouldn't expect for everything to be clearly marked for you. Outlast does, however, get a little repetitive - grab your three items to unlock this or fix that and you advance, all the while a monster patient is lurking around. It can get to feel a little repetitive, but if you're like me, you won't exactly notice. You'll be too busy trying to keep yourself alive and complete the objective. One downfall I did notice, besides the repetitveness, was the length. I've realized that most modern horror games aren't incredibly long, and this game follows the rest. I do wish there was more story to find, more gameplay, and a change in pace - i.e. reduce the repetiveness and try something different with the flow of the game, which is something we can hope for in Outlast 2.\nOutlast was a terrifying experience for me. There are gruesome cutscenes, jumpscares, and chase scenes. The characters are certainly twisted individuals. You can almost feel the pain, fear, and adrenaline that rushes through Miles Upshur, the protagonist in the story. His emotions are very well conveyed to the player. Not only Miles's emotions, but the various patients' emotions, as well. Plot twists, unexpected events, perfectly conveyed emotion, and a fantastic story really add to the game's atmosphere.\nThis is a game I will recommend one hundred times over. Very fantastic game with great features. It can certainly send chills up your spine.","July 9, 2014","true","14.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VictorSeven/recommended/238320/","VictorSeven","VictorSeven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VictorSeven/","261 products in account","When I first saw Outlast, I was intrigued. In the midst of so many Slender clones and games full of cheap, ineffective jumpscares, I was craving a sense of depth with a horror game. I found that depth in Outlast.\n\nTaking the role of an investigative journalist acting on an anonymous tip, I entered Mount Massive Asylum and soon found myself creeping slowly through the seemingly abandoned wards, straining for any sounds beyond my own footsteps, jumping at my own shadow. The game's atmosphere is the best I've ever experienced, bar none. It forgoes the cheap horror tradition of relying on screams and musical stings, and instead uses your entire environment - creaking floorboards, closing doors, lightning and thunder, even distant, ragged breathing - to set you on edge and keep you there the entire time.\n\nThe game is brilliantly rendered, with stunning visuals and graphic depictions that truly reinforce the feeling that you've just stepped into hell on earth. The effects of the game on the main character become more and more apparent, and you'll notice a few types of damage you sustain stay with you for the entire game. The broadness of the creativity I experienced in the multitude of different settings kept me guessing, and the changes in venue served to take me out of my comfort zone JUST when I thought I was beginning to calm down. The pacing was perfect.\n\nGameplay was astonishingly spot-on. No glitches or bugs, and I was delighted to find that the main character, Miles, has a bit of parkour ability. Somebody put Mirror's Edge in a horror game? My character actually has a chance at running? I've never experienced that before, and the feeling of having a slight chance to survive while skillfully vaulting desks, hopping up to catch a ledge, and hanging out a window to avoid a pursuer, makes the experience both more terrifying and exhilarating when you narrowly escape with your life. The game makes you think, and if you forget to look up, you will die.\n\nThe story was phenomenal. Mount Massive, even in the state of its decay, is a living, breathing thing. With characters such as Chris Walker, Rick Trager, Dr. Wernicke, the Twins, Father Martin, and the Walrider, I found myself morbidly curious about how they came to be, and was delighted to find many answers. The Notes and Documents system added a whole new dimension of depth that made many of these characters more than just "the monster you run from." Learning about Chris Walker's origins, his motivations, how the Walrider came to be, the project that put Rick Trager in charge of his own ward, the truth about Dr. Wernicke... the list goes on. There is so much information on the things you're running from that it begins to change your mind, and in some cases, you actually begin to understand some of these characters.\n\nOverall, this game is one of the most tense, terrifying experiences I've ever faced... and I'm tough to scare. Bravo, Red Barrels. I can't wait for the Whistleblower DLC. To see Let's Plays of Outlast, visit VictorSevenGames on YouTube. And buy this game!","March 14, 2014","true","73.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't know why I am here or what the hell passed in my mind that day. I'm a freelance journalist and due to economy crisis I had to find a good, impressive, fresh article to jump out of the mess and start to be someone again. There were stories about this asylum....stories never confirmed because no one had the guts to come here to prove them somehow. But that could be my only chance. The night I decided to come here it was dark and rainy, the desolation around the asylum got my attention immediately. I've opened the gate slowly, a shrill sound came from it. Suddenly something moving from one of the window, really fast I've pointed my camera and zoomed. A shadow, really fast, ran all over the room then it disappeared into nothing. I moved slowly towards the door, it was open so I went inside. My footsteps echoed in the corridor, when I've reached the hall a dead body on the floor, totally immersed into his own blood. My heart started to pump faster as I turned around and I've start running fast towards the entrance door. I've reached it but it was closed! Closed from the outside! In few second I've heard a laugh and suddenly a voice..."you are one of us now", I turned around fast and I saw someone looking at me with blood eyes and an evil smile on his face. In total panic I entered a room and I've slammed the door behind me. "There is no place to hide!" Screamed the voice from outside, and few second later the light went off. I've searched my camera as fast as I could but It was too late.....there was something....or someone....breathing....BREATHING....near me...It was too dark, I wasn't able to see nothing...some footsteps, more and more close to me...my heart stopped for a bit...I felt the sweat running down on my forehead....suddenly a hand....A DAM HAND ON MY ARM...I could felt it....it moved up and down in my arm...then a voice...whispering "....Don't worry...there is no turning back for you....you are us...you can't escape..."\nMy breath started to be more and more hard as I runned away randomly inside the room.  I stumbled on something and I fell down as the voice started to scream "WHERE DO YOU THINK TO GO?". Fastly I grabbed my camera and by pressing randomly I've managed to activate the flash to light the room. I saw a door...but I even saw him...his clothes were dirty of blood...his face full of scars...and he was holding an axe in his hand...still dirty with fresh dripping blood...I jumped up and, with shaking legs, I've tried to reach the door, I went out and I've started running along the corridor. All the lights were  turning off one by one, I've looked at my back and he was chasing me! He slowly disappeared into the dark that, as an hungry animal, was eating all the light in that place!  I looked ahead and I saw another person looking at me with a evil, scary smile on his face opening his arms to me as he was waiting to hug me! I saw a door on my left and I went inside really fast...but sadly there were three person inside...as I went inside they all looked at me....their eyes never moved from me...they never closed them...slolwy they moved more and more close to me...I wasn't able to move...I was totally freeze with the door on my back...\nBUMP!...a fist on the door....BUMP!...another one....but I wasn't able to do nothing...the fear took control of me...as I slowly went down...while the three persons started to say "...you are not from here....he will want to see you.....he will want to see you....you will be one of us...." like a chant over and over...one of them hit me with a vase....and now here I am in this room...or better...in this cell.\nI don't know from how much time I am here...there is nothing here...only a window with bars...I'm unable to sleep...I'm unable to focus...why I am here?....why I've done this? -starts to cry-...what they will do to me?....I'm sorry Jane...I'm sorry...I've left you and our kids alone....I'm sorry...-starts to laugh- yes....yes....YES!.....this is just a dream...just a bad dream...YES IT IS!....-laughs uncontrollably- yes!...when I will wake up everything will be good...everything will be okay! -rumors of footsteps and a door opening-\nundefined person: "You are ready" -keeps laughing- "ready?...ready ready ready!...is a dream!...just a bad dream!...I am ready!" - "come with us" -rumors of footsteps and a laugh fading away slowly-\n\n-random rumors.....a slow breath- undefined person: ".....you will be the next one....you will be the next one...you will be the next one.....you will be the next one.....youwillbethenextone....YOUWILLBETHENEXTONE" -electrical sounds-"\n\n*STORYTELLER MODE OFF*\n\nDo I have to add anything else?...This is a worth successor of Amnesia...or more precisely...a more grown up and mature son of it...this game will run you mad, this game will mess with your mind, this game is not for everyone.\n\nGraphically is the best horror adventure I've ever seen in a while, the sounds and the music create that tension and that fear that will mess with your feelings while you play.\n\nYour character is not a super hero, or an army guy...he's a normal man...he will tremble...he will panic...he will pass out from the fear even....\n\nIf you suffer of heart problems or you are claustrophobic don't play this game....but if you are brave enough or if horror excite you....there you go....the best horror of 2014....for now....\n\nOverall:\n\nGraphic 9/10\nSounds 10/10\nFear factor 9/10\nGameplay 8/10","June 26, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Armed with only a camcorder,your tasked to explore the moira asylum,however things take a big turn when you discover that the asylum is not what it seems to be.The game starts out well,tells you how,when and where to hide whenever your spotted by the variants.Sad thing however is that in my opinion although it's a little scary,the variants aren't that intimidating.Once you realise you can slam doors in their face and easily hide under beds or cabinets,it soon becomes a game of hide-and-seek.Intense parts were still and always will be the *special* variants that chase after you.

Outlast gives you the same paranoia as amnesia but also throws a lot of unexpected jump scares in your face to peak your paranoia. Very fun and scary game.\n\nEven though you're in an asylum, the environment changes drastically depending on which part you're in. Most of the changes are destroyed walls, stairs, floors, and lots of guts and blood which give it a unique "art" style for each room.\n\nNot being able to fight doesn't mean that you won't see any violence. Be prepared to see people get their heads ripped off, impaled, and disemboweled. This game is not for the faint of heart (though it is fun to watch those who scare easy play this game!)\n\nI highly recommend this game.

While your only means of defense are running, hiding or using the environment to your advantage, you will experience some creepy moments trying to avoid being seen by enemies.\n\nThe excellent sound and ambient tracks contribute heavily to the game’s atmosphere and are supplemented by a decent storyline, that makes you care for your character’s well-being. And the ending is disturbing yet strangely satisfying.\n\nUnder normal circumstances puzzles are used to give the player a moment to relax. This game has no puzzle section at all, which will put you under constant pressure to proceed without respite.\n\nFun fact: The DLC complements the main storyline and provides an insight into the background story.\n--\n\nMy rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:\n\n-	Atmosphere\n-	Characters\n-	Details\n-	Puzzles\n-	Story\n-	Controls\n\nBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:\n\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).\n--\n\nAtmosphere: S-Rank\n\n(Like the harder I try to escape, the deeper I get.

The graphics feel really great for an indie title, and the sound design is impeccable, from excellent acting to Samuel Leflamme's intense strings playing.\n\nHow about the scares? The world has a surprisingly creepy and disturbing atmosphere, but it relies too much on jumpscares and gore, even though it has genuinely frightening moments. Outlast is filled with intense chases instead, with sometimes several madmen hunting you from almost every possible direction. This fills the game with great pacing, which sparingly lets you breathe for a moment as you run away from disgusting monstrosities. And it's still scarier than Machine for Pigs.\n\nOutlast stumbles mainly on the repetitiviness and level design of the middle act, which confused me far more than it should have. As I stated earlier, this game is short, with my playthrough lasting approx. 5 hours. Devs have promised additional content though. Enemy encounters can also be easily predicted and their AI is as predictable. And they have big, wobbling ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nMy final verdict is 8/10.

I was wanting more soon.\nI was pleased to discover the playable DLC-Whistleblower with more of the same content, and high praise for it on reviews.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/273300\n\nAlthough I felt like I was "stuck", after a few chapters you learn the nooks and crannies to creep into and evade the creeps.\n\n-It's between a rock and a hard place to recommend this game to everyone there is nudity here,\nI believe DEV's don't need to use nudity it can be avoided the same for foul language, these things are'nt necessary in a game; LET US remember principally games are made for the younger generation.\n\n-Observe the balance of my views if you like!\n\nDEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDDIES\n-So, to clarify things, I am recommending this game to an older generation of gamers who want to be entertained.\nI am advising the younger gamers to steer cleer of this game as it contains nudity.\nTo the younger gamer that "HAS IT ALL, & WANTS IT ALL", here-in my review is your warning.

After getting an email from an anonymous source(Waylon Park from Whistleblower),he is prompted to go into Mount Massive Asylum and uncover the truth behind Murkoff's intentions in the asylum. He then finds that Mount Massive has a darker story behind it than it may seem.\nThe gameplay is great,with it involving carrying a camera around.

BLUD AN GOTZ.\n\nbut seriously. this is probably the scariest game I've ever played. Also, perfect length in both the main story and DLC.\nThe story is incredible. Just when you think "escape the insane asylum" gets stale, the real stuff starts happening.\n\nI'm never getting anywhere near this game again. Isn't that every horror developers dream review?\n\nMy biggest suggestion is to play the main story until you reach the female ward, then switch to the Whistleblower DLC. Play that until you're half way through the Vocational Block, when it says "12 Hours Later." All the events that occure in the main story happen within those 12 hours. At this point, switch back to the main story and finish it, then finish the Whistleblower DLC.\n\nLast suggestion. Don't try to collect every document and film everything along the way. Respond the way you would in real life. Would you go into that room with the bloody door just to pick up a few batteries and a document? Would you go back and film the corpse you just watched die while you're being hunted by the killer? As a journalist, you might be. But make the choices you think you would, don't just be an achievement hunter. It will make the game infinitely more terrifying.\n\nHave fun...\n\n\n\nTLDR: I'm never getting anywhere near this game again. <3/10","December 30, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/byrondoonsblap/recommended/238320/","byrondoonsblap","Biodegradable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/byrondoonsblap/","54 products in account","Outlast is a game that will make you afraid of the dark. Not only is it terrifying thanks to an utterly disturbing atmosphere, finely-crafted jumpscares (yes, it can be done) and a forboding musical score, it's also relentless and will never let you rest. Need a breather? Too bad, cos the psychopath behind you wants to wear your head like a hat, and he ain't gonna take no for an answer. You reckon you've been in a situation game-wise that made you feel completely helpless? Unless you've played Outlast, you don't know squat, pal.\n\nNow some reckon that Outlast is a tad overrated, usually pointing out the flawed story and questioning why the protagonist doesn't simply leave the asylum. But honestly, in an era where every other horror game has either fallen victim to trends, turned themselves into an action-adventure game (looking at you, Resident Evil), or given up the ghost completely, this phenomenal game is a welcome return to decent, principled horror. Red Barrels (the development team) understands tension, atmosphere, and knows how to leave you beaten,  bloody, bruised, and begging for more.\n\nIt's a staggeringly beautiful, lovingly crafted and deliciously creepy game that has well earned the praise it has received. Any self-respecting horror fan will have this gem nestled among the rest of their collection.","June 21, 2015","true","32.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you are not a fan of the horror genre, do not ask if the game is scary or not. Even though it is a matter of preference what exactly you find scary, this game is definetly scary. It's got suspensful chase scenes, jump scares, and just plain general creepy-ness.\n\nBUT\n\nThis game is not only scary, but it also has a very intriguing storyline as well. Both the main game and DLC are linked together, and you will discover more about the universe within the game in Whistleblower.\n\nThough Whistleblower is a prequel (without giving away too much) towards the end of the DLC, the timeline syncs up with the main game and you see some of your actions unfold from the main game.\n\nAlso Samuel Laflamme has done a magnificent job with the score to this game. It's an eerie mix of creepy and beautiful, which really adds a whole new level of immersion to the game.\n\nAll in all this is a fantastic game, and is definetly worth full price.","January 23, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buttonbasher/recommended/238320/","Buttonbasher","Buttonbasher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buttonbasher/","972 products in account","I'd consider Outlast to be way more of a thriller game with jump scares, than a horror game.\n\nThere's usually a point in these kinds of games where the scare tactics fade away, and you notice the mechanics behind them. Once that occurs, the game suddenly has a lot less tension, since instead of being super afraid of the monster pursuing you, you're now just paying attention to their looping routine around the level.\n\nThat happened within the first 20 minutes of Outlast for me. It's not necessarily a terrible thing, but it did remove a lot of tension from the game from that point on. It continued to degrade from there, as you find out that dying is often more advantageous than hiding, as it gets you to the starting point in the many "Go find three Fuses/Turn two cranks/Pull two lever" 'puzzles' the game throws at you. When caught, you get a very clear look at a 3D rendered generic looking monster, which tears away any remaining fear of them. The sound design does a pretty good job at trying to restore some of it, and the chase sequences remained pretty okay because of that alone.\n\nThe thing that made games like Amnesia really special to me, is the looming sense of dread. Outlast never really had that for me. The nightvision camera effects were cool though, and the game does have it's moments of legitimate spooks. It's just more often than not, you're left with a bad stealth game, with increasingly ineffective jump scares.\n\nI'll still probably check out the DLC, since I liked the game well enough. I just wished that the spooks lasted longer than they did.","January 30, 2014","true","6.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Despite being a short game, the atmosphere is presented well. The night vision in your camera view made for an interesting aesthetic, abandoning the typical flashlight gear presented in a lot of horror games. While the game remains very playable on the first playthrough, the thrills and scares become boring and expected since there is not a variety of enemies. The documents are also a problem as they are many times dull to read, giving the player less incentive to seek out documents hiden throughout the asylum.

Theres no fighting, only running like Amnesia but you only can hide in preset locations like lockers or by cowering behind objects. Added to that is alot of trial and error where you come into a new area and immediately dudes start chasing you so you bumble around and then die a few times until you figure out where to go and how to get there unscathed (or maybe its just me?). In Amnesia you could compensate much more easily for ♥♥♥♥ups and explore more easier since pretty much every shadow was a place to hide. Makes this game feel alot more static in comparision.\n\nTheres bosses of some sort and i wish the game woulda kept to them for chasing you around or at least make the standard mooks disposable because seriously, after the umpteenth one those arent really scary anymore and id rather wander around looking at giblets sprayed on the walls or wondering if a corpse is only faking it instead of slamming face first into walls because i gotta run from some dorky freak with a piece of wood again.\n\nAlso the night vision camcorder is a neat idea and graphical effect with an interesting impact on gameplay - as long as you get to use it sporadically. Unfortunately it gets very very overused in particular towards the latter third of the game. After an hour of having green burn into my retinas those sections of the game became a ♥♥♥♥ing annoyance rather than scary. The game made up for it with a maybe clicheed but nevertheless refreshingly different endgame section tho.\n\nSo why am i recommending this despite trite gameplay and the developers being too lazy to do the lighting for a level or two or three? Because of the atmosphere. Great graphics, great music, the levels are diverse enough for being all in an asylum setting, the jumpscares are spot on and not too many and its also deliciously grody.

In game, you're in control of a journalist that came to an asylum to find out if those terrifying rumors he got from his source are real. Belive me, you're not ready for what is waiting inside...\n\nAdvantages\nImmersive story with ton of surprising twists and turns\nEvery second of gameplay is full of tension\nRealistic graphics along with frightening level design are making quite an awesome impression\nHide&Seek, along with parkour and sneaking elements creates one of a kind atmosphere\nThe AI of your stalkers in incredibly intelligent, it's quite scary when something walks by the bed you're hiding under, but it's horrifying when something is looking for you under every bed and in every locker\nSounds are simply stunning, they're more real than most of the things I hear on my daily basis\nFiles and recording provide an amazing backstory\nGame is very intuitive, without any clear directions you are able to find your way to the objective\nDisadvantages\nEnemies get repetitive after a while\nSummary\nIt's easily the best horror game I have ever played in my whole life and I think it will take a while until any new game will live up to this name. It's frightening and atmospheric, the story is deep and really interesting. Control over character is perfect, movement is great thanks to nicely done head bob effect and parkour elements. About that camera thingy... At first I was disappointed that it was a thing in game, but it was implemented perfectly, especially with night vision required to pass few levels. Everything just fits ideally and together creates Outlast, THE BEST horror game I have played and one of my favourite games overall.\n\nPersonal score\n10 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 23","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The main character "Miles Upshur"."Miles Upshur" a freelance journalist, receives a tip-off from an anonymous source about Mount Massive Asylum, a psychiatric hospital owned and operated by the Murkoff corporation."Miles Upshur" is incapable of combat, except for certain scripted sequences in which he pushes enemies away. To navigate the environment, the character is able to climb to ledges, vault over low obstacles, crawl, and slide in narrow gaps. Except for vaulting, enemies are incapable of any of these maneuvers, which gives the player a certain edge. In addition, the player can survive encounters with the inmates by hiding inside of lockers or under beds, although certain enemies may search the room and attempt to locate the player for a short time before moving on.Since much of the asylum is dark, the player must use Miles' video camera to see, thanks to its night vision function. Using night vision consumes batteries, replacements of which are scattered throughout the environment.When injured, Upshur must avoid taking any further damage for a while, which will allow him to recover.\n\nPros:\n- One of the best survival horror games with a good story.\n- Fascinating story told through documents and notes.\n- Scary moments will make you scream.\n- Very dark atmosphere.\n- Fast-draining night vision camera keeps tensions high.\n- Very good sound design.\n- Absence of weapons requires smart uses of hiding spots.\n\nCons:\n- The graphic isn't the best.\n\nThe Verdict:\nOne of the best horror games i have played it made me scream sometimes. if you like survival horror games which include no weapons at all then this game is for you it delivers high horror story and atmosphere with a good sound effects. it takes a man to finish this game.","January 26, 2014","true","10.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

If you play a lot of horror games, you won't find this terribly scary.  However, if you have a low threshold for horror, you will probably find it quite gruesome.  It relies on gore and shock to get a reaction from the player, rather than pacing and imagination a la Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  There are also a lot of jumpscares, but they are spread out well enough that they don't become too predictable.\n\nWhile I didn't find this as scary as, say, the original Amnesia, I did find it extremely exciting.  There are no puzzles to solve in Outlast, so the gameplay never stalls due to some overly confusing puzzle.  It's easily the best-looking horror game I've ever played; the setting is very detailed and the levels are always interesting (particularly towards the end).  You'll be using a nightvision camera to see through most of the game; the camera effects are very well done and look fantastic.  There are also a ton of little details in the way your character moves and in the environment that add to the immersion.  The devs took their sweet time polishing this up, and it shows.\n\nThe only thing I would knock this game for is being poorly optimized.  It uses the Unreal engine, which is quite old, yet I could only run it on medium/high settings (it goes from low to very high for reference), even though I have no problems running games like Bioshock Infinite and Skyrim maxed out.  Even on a mix of medium/high, I occasionally had dips in framerate in one of the larger levels, which was irritating.  I should point out that the game still looks great on medium, so this wasn't really a big deal.\n\nAccording to Steam I finished the game in 5.4 hours, but I'll definitely be replaying it.  I got this on sale for about $7 and it was totally worth it.","November 29, 2013","true","8.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonymous01/recommended/238320/","anonymous01","Chimera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonymous01/","142 products in account","Simply nightmarish and surreal atomosphere. The last place I'd want to be stuck in is a mental asylum, on the top of a mountain, with little to no cell phone service. The enemies in this game are needless to say, bone-chilling, with evil backstory to reinforce their malevolent history and behavior. Personally, I believe the constant feeling of danger from some sort of sneak attack, or simply just shaking in my seat hoping that the enemy doesn't check my hiding spot is what truly gives this game the thriller that it so obviously portrays.\n\nThe atmosphere is extremely terrifying; it's as if danger is around every corner. You can't go anywhere without some kind of surprise, but they're all different so it's unique, you get scared everytime. The little things are very impressive too, like the night vision. It's not a very common idea, but the night vision is actually very effective at adding a creepy atmosphere, which the game doesn't really need; it's overkill. The fact that you can't just hide in the dark is also very giving to the atmosphere. There's 3 basic actions you can perform whenever a monster spawns: you hide, you run, or you die. I also enjoyed the even smaller things, like whenever you lean to peek through a doorway, your hand will show as in keeping structure and balance to your character; it adds realistic human body reactions, if you peered through a hallway at that much of an angle, more than likely you'll topple over.\n\nThe mechanics and controls of the game are flawless, to say the least. The fact that you can turn around to view your pursuer while you sprint for your life is surprisingly well done. My only real concern is the vaulting in the game. Let's say for example, you're being pursued by the ruthless Chris Walker, and a small desktop happens to block your hallway. Instead of your character vaulting it, he will jump right into the desk, hindering your movement, allowing your pursuer to get closer, putting you at risk. It all works out, nonetheless, because this adds psychological terror; personally, I think of it as: you know you messed up, and you're at a much larger risk of getting caught."\n\nAll in all, I'd give it a strong 8.5/10, due to it getting kind of repetitive torwards the last little bit of the game. If you don't already own it, I'd recommend putting down a quick $20 to enjoy a one of a kind horror survival.","February 17, 2014","true","20.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

However, this is one of those games. Yes, this game is somewhat average in length, 5-6 odd hours, however I believe it is the the most atmospheric game of 2013, after Metro: LL. You play as a journalist who goes to an insane asylum somewhere in Colorado with nothing but your camcorder and a handful of batteries to investigate allegations of torture and other misuses of inmates. 10 minutes in and you fight for your life. The only supplies that you scavenge are batteries. If use your camcorder as well as its night vision your battery will drain twice as fast.\n\nThis game combines the best elements of Penumbra, Call of Cthulhu, Amnesia and forges a whole different monster of a game. The voice acting is outstanding, the level design is impeccable, the level of gore and nudity is unparalleled. This game does not attempt to scare you with cheap scares, it succeeds in terrifying you. There is necrophilia, torture, beheading, impalement, hanging, disemboweling, you name it - Steven King would stain his pants if he played this.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding. Especially the realistic furniture design coupled with rich textures - a remarkable feat with the Unreal Engine.\n\nThe gameplay: very few games from a first person perspective nail the concept of playing as a human, and in this game it FEELS like you are playing as a human in every sense of that concept. First off, you see your legs and you cast a shadow, THANK YOU. You cannot punch or kick, you are practically defenseless, you can climb up, climb down, you can crawl, you can peek from the behind corners while holding the wall with your hand, you can look behind you when chased, you can jump just far enough to be able to get a hold of that ledge 2-3 yards in front of you, you can hide under the bed or inside the lockers or inside the stalls and you can lurk in the dark corners waiting for your foes to pass by, you can hear your character's heartbeat as well as his erratic breathing and scream from sheer horror or pain and you can be wounded, permanently... No other game was able to capture this amount of atmospheric survival tension.\n\nJust when you think you grew enough balls to be able to withstand the next encounter the game proves you wrong, lest you are able to think quickly on your feet, discern boarded up doors from the unlocked ones and be able to run and not get cornered. When encountered by a brute, you get one freebie - a slight knock around. Second time you get caught - you die. Most asylum residents are docile and oblivious, some are frightened more than you are, some strut around with their junk hanging like they own the place, ready to punch you and gut you if necessary. When you play the game without dying for 30 or 40 minutes you truly feel that payoff - as if you yourself were able to avoid a brutal death and the game provides you plenty of opportunity to live long enough without reloading if you are patient and agile enough.\n\nThe game is hard but it is also fair. Stealth is essential, noise is death and your ears are just as important as your camcorder. You won't always be able to see your enemies, but you should be able to hear them approach. The game tries its best to differentiate between locations, puzzles and succeeds in doing so for the most part.\n\nWhen hiding you sometimes have to guess which one of the hiding spots the enemy won't check out. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't, but it's always best to get the hiding spot as far away from the door as possible.\n\nThe only few things that stand out is that you cannot turn the music off, which, actually fits in pretty well and helps build up tension although I'd prefer total silence when it comes to these things. Your character is pretty much mute when it comes to dialogue. Also, I would add the option of playing the game with permadeath mode.\n\nI am happy to be living in an age when these types of games can be made. This is the first time when I tried recording my reactions while playing this game much like those youtubers do with Amensia, Horror House 2, etc.\n\nWe don't get too many well-made horror survival games and this is definitely it.","September 5, 2013","true","10.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I played through the entire game before writing this review. I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and it is very hard to find a game that scares me. While this was an amazing game, it was not very scary. This may be different for other people, but there were probably about 10 jump scares, and there wasn't really any psychological horror in it. The game was atmospherically horrific however, because 75% of the game takes place in the dark. The enemies in it were decently scary, and what I enjoyed was that you can not fight back. I loved the graphics on this game, they had their own king of feel to them. The gameplay was okay, but it got very repetetive because you were constantly having to find two things while being hunted by an enemy. One of the cool things about the gameplay was the use of the camera, which has limited batteries and has a nightvision mode. Throughout the game you can find bonus documents and read about different psychopaths and such, which was a very cool collectible experience. The story in it was okay, it wasn't too story driven, but there was a story. The game is not at all like a Silent Hill, or any other game that just uses psychological horror. Difficulty wise, the game wasn't hard, however there were parts that I died in over and over. The game should take at least 6 hours to beat without a walkthrough, so it was decently long. Overall, Outlast is a great game to play and I highly reccomend it.\n8/10","September 29, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as an investigative journalist who recieved an email prompting you to go, well investigate. The game quickly throws you into the tense, grim atmosphere of the asylum, and is unforgiving in its presentation.\n\nThe game is quite gory, and with excellent graphical quality. Most horror games don't particularly frighten me, but Outlast managed a few jumpscares that really got my heart pounding. The atmospheric quality was also excpetionally scary. It is definitely a frightening game.\n\nThe gameplay is reflective of the character; he's a reporter, not a warrior. When trouble comes your way, you run and you hide. There is no combat. You do, however, have a camera which serves in place of the standard flashlight or lamp using nightvision. It's not perfect, but that only adds to the feeling of being trapped and helpless. There are sections of the game that follow a very tired pattern of "Go turn two valves" or "Go pull three levers," but they weren't enough to take away from the overall value of the game.\n\nThe story was not particularly amazing, though I did enjoy it quite a bit. As the game was story driven, it was enjoyable to find the various documents and reveal the past of the asylum and its inhabitants.\n\nLastly, I'd like to complain against steam for not tracking offline play times, making my playthroughs of the game reduced to 45 minutes according to my account. Oh well.\n\nAll things considered, it was an excellent game. It exceeded my expectations. I would absolutely recommend it.\n","January 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Great steps have been taken to avoid this game holding a single note from beginning to end. There is enough variety in the environments and scares to elevate a fairly superficial story to the nearest this gamer has been to a first-person, interactive horror film. I cannot count the times I have been lured increasingly closer to the screen only to leap backward from it in surprise or revulsion. There's an undeniable beauty to the game's human carnage which is both mystifying and frightful. The cruelty on display between characters and also towards you, the player, sets up a sense of incredible dread, of putting one's back to a window or door, of entering a room. So many times I wondered if I should just run away or shut down in the corner and wait for death. The game is gripping and certainly perfect for playing in the dark with surround sound. I dare anybody to play on Occulus Rift.","January 18, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay seemed very much minimal and out of body. The entire time I felt I was looking in, and was not much immersed at all. Add to that the scare factor was greatly exaggerated and well... I was left disappointed.\nAnd then I bought Outlast.\nWhile there are many things I love about this game, I do need to put out a few warnings:\nThis game is really gory. Not much for the squeamish at all.\nThis game becomes very intense. I had to break at points because I just got too freaked out, something that hasn't happened to me since being hounded down by Nemesis in RE3.\nI'll start off with the immersion.\nEven though you -know- you're another character, his background is left vague and the only true objective you have is "survive”. In this sense, it really becomes easy for the player to integrate his or herself with the character. That YOU are being chased, that YOU are cramming yourself in a locker, breaths stuttering and heart pounding as the door to the room is broken in. It makes it a very real sensation. I suppose it also helps to see hands reaching out to interact with objects rather than them floating in midair as well.\nThe second thing is the environment.\nVery eerie, creepy setting… and just about every little thing gets you. Floorboards creaking will leave you on-edge trying to determine if that was you, an enemy, or just those old floorboards. The lighting is also pretty dynamic and fantastic in this game, striking scattered chairs and disfigured faces leaving you with a feeling of uneasiness.\nBut I would have to say the piece du resistance is the music. What a fantastic arrangement this game has. As enemies find you, a shrill shriek of horns and strings alert you that your presence has been noticed. As enemies wander around, low, lingering tones with the occasional, random rise reach your ears, lulling you into a calmed state as you adjust only to be jarred from it over and over. And when wandering around with a new objective, subtle notes run across your ears, masked by footsteps and creaking doors.\nIf you're a horror nut, this is the game for you. If Amnesia just wasn't doing it for you, this will. And for $20, I couldn't ask for more.","October 21, 2013","true","22.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everyone wants more when it comes to video games, but in a survival-horror game you want quality over quantity and Outlast hits that nail. I bought it while it was on sale and was worth every penny (I can garuntee the length of the game is not worth the off-sale price). The game is short and can be beat in less than 10 hours, but the scares last a lifetime. When researching this game DO NOT form an opinion on how short it is (comes with S-H turf after all). The graphics are wonderful and the scares quite satisfying. Plot constantly twists and turn (like your head if caught sometimes XD) and the story is very in-depth and addictive.

A wave of imitiators and screechy Youtube reaction videos followed as it became clear how cheap and easy this kind of thing could be to put together.\n\nSo there's been a lot of dross, in other words, but the occasional gem.  Outlast gets the formula entirely right.  You're unarmed, sure, but physically capable:  you can sprint, vault over desks, clamber into vents, jump over broken floors, and generally conduct yourself as a reasonably healthy person would if they were being pursued by a nutcase.  The game emphasises your physical presence, down to the shadows you cast in front of you and your hands gripping the edges of walls when you're near them.\n\nNot the longest game around, but the right length for what it wants to do, it does admittedly wear out its bag of tricks a little before the end - you'll begin anticipating things rather than being surprised by them.  This is a very minor quibble, though, and is kind of inevitable with this sort of thing.\n\nGenuinely unsettling and occasionally very scary, this is how this kind of thing should be done.","August 19, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Essentially Amnesia-style gameplay in a new setting, it's good-looking, well-designed and doesn't fall prey to many of the pitfalls that remove the horror from supposedly scary games - it knows when to use silence and emptiness to full effect and doesn't ramp up the action as the game progresses, barring the weak ending.\n\nJump scares come often and can get predictable, and aren't the main strength of the game. It's the organic horror that comes from being stalked or looking for a hiding spot in a panic that really makes it memorable. The sheer gore and disturbing elements, including sexual overtones to the antagonists, are uniquely unnerving though they might alienate some players. Good horror doesn't need to be gruesome, after all.\n\nFairly short and with a very weak final act much less compelling than the rest of the game, it's not for everyone, but is fine fuel for those who love the unmatched rush of feeling genuinely afraid.","January 14, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will run, you will scramble, you will slam doors shut behind you and with your heart rate ever increasing, try to shove a cart in the way to block the door. You will be scared.\n\nOutlast is intense, and scary, something very few games manage to do. It never feels too easy, or too difficult, and most importantly never feels cheap or gimmicky.

I have played Slender, but not much and I was awful at it. This being my first real experience with a horror game I have to say I was satisfied. This game definately spooked me an made me jump a good bit. Honestly though the scariest part was the body in the library, which was the very beginning. This may have been because I was playing on Normal, so don't listen to this if you're wondering how scary it is. Most of the rest of the game I just spent getting angry and taking breaks from repeatedly dying while searching for 50 sets of keys, switches, and valves. The story was great, loved it a lot more than I expected, although the ending was not my favorite, but I guess it fit with the game as a whole. I would recommend this game to any who likes horror or wants to try it. Even if you get frightened easily I would recommend playing higher than normal if you want the real experience.","June 25, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A wave of imitiators and screechy Youtube reaction videos followed as it became clear how cheap and easy this kind of thing could be to put together.\n\nSo there's been a lot of dross, in other words, but the occasional gem.  Outlast gets the formula entirely right.  You're unarmed, sure, but physically capable:  you can sprint, vault over desks, clamber into vents, jump over broken floors, and generally conduct yourself as a reasonably healthy person would if they were being pursued by a nutcase.  The game emphasises your physical presence, down to the shadows you cast in front of you and your hands gripping the edges of walls when you're near them.\n\nNot the longest game around, but the right length for what it wants to do, it does admittedly wear out its bag of tricks a little before the end - you'll begin anticipating things rather than being surprised by them.  This is a very minor quibble, though, and is kind of inevitable with this sort of thing.\n\nGenuinely unsettling and occasionally very scary, this is how this kind of thing should be done.","August 19, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is short and can be beat in less than 10 hours, but the scares last a lifetime. When researching this game DO NOT form an opinion on how short it is (comes with S-H turf after all).

The gameplay seemed very much minimal and out of body. The entire time I felt I was looking in, and was not much immersed at all. Add to that the scare factor was greatly exaggerated and well... I was left disappointed.\nAnd then I bought Outlast.\nWhile there are many things I love about this game, I do need to put out a few warnings:\nThis game is really gory. Not much for the squeamish at all.\nThis game becomes very intense. I had to break at points because I just got too freaked out, something that hasn't happened to me since being hounded down by Nemesis in RE3.\nI'll start off with the immersion.\nEven though you -know- you're another character, his background is left vague and the only true objective you have is "survive”. In this sense, it really becomes easy for the player to integrate his or herself with the character. That YOU are being chased, that YOU are cramming yourself in a locker, breaths stuttering and heart pounding as the door to the room is broken in. It makes it a very real sensation. I suppose it also helps to see hands reaching out to interact with objects rather than them floating in midair as well.\nThe second thing is the environment.\nVery eerie, creepy setting… and just about every little thing gets you. Floorboards creaking will leave you on-edge trying to determine if that was you, an enemy, or just those old floorboards. The lighting is also pretty dynamic and fantastic in this game, striking scattered chairs and disfigured faces leaving you with a feeling of uneasiness.\nBut I would have to say the piece du resistance is the music. What a fantastic arrangement this game has. As enemies find you, a shrill shriek of horns and strings alert you that your presence has been noticed. As enemies wander around, low, lingering tones with the occasional, random rise reach your ears, lulling you into a calmed state as you adjust only to be jarred from it over and over. And when wandering around with a new objective, subtle notes run across your ears, masked by footsteps and creaking doors.\nIf you're a horror nut, this is the game for you. If Amnesia just wasn't doing it for you, this will. And for $20, I couldn't ask for more.","October 21, 2013","true","22.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I really got scared many times in the game and after I really laughted at myself. The game really challenge you with dark areas and the way you react in a emergency moment when you see a lunatic in your front. The game has excellent graphics and I really loved the camera that we use and the night vision, it make it feel more scarier and I also thought that was really original. Althought the game is scary and you have a lot of fun, it also brings shocking scenes that contain violence. So before buying it, you need to be aware that you are not influenced on this type of violent game and neither believe in spirits or have some kind of disease that can influence your own life somehow like my first day playing I had nightmares. So really think to your self if you want this kind of entertainment for you.\nOther way, I finished the game 4 hours and I had the impression that this lasted forever. It is not long and you get stuck many times on corridors not knowing what you need to do or where you need to go. The own terror makes you scared to move forward and get out of the areas you are hidden. In the game you cant punch or attack your enemies just run from them and defend yourself when they jump on you. You can also hide in places such as beds, shelfs, behind desks and others. It's really interesting and different how they planned the game, while running from a lunatic you can also look behind to see if someone is folllowing you. Also you can close doors to hold the enemies and put objects over it so it get harder to they brake the door.\nYou can film everything that happens on the game but after you cant see what you filmed that this was kind of dissapointing but the gameplay in general is way better than any horror game I ever played before. I totally recommend this game for the more prepared people that are accustumed to play scary games. My only concern is the ending of the game that was a lot dissapointing, more than anything. I won't spoil anything but, yes, the ending is horrile and unbelievable. But not considering that, don't disseast from buying it, the price total worth it and the gameplay and the art of the game is cool.","May 12, 2014","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as an investigative journalist who recieved an email prompting you to go, well investigate. The game quickly throws you into the tense, grim atmosphere of the asylum, and is unforgiving in its presentation.\n\nThe game is quite gory, and with excellent graphical quality. Most horror games don't particularly frighten me, but Outlast managed a few jumpscares that really got my heart pounding. The atmospheric quality was also excpetionally scary. It is definitely a frightening game.\n\nThe gameplay is reflective of the character; he's a reporter, not a warrior. When trouble comes your way, you run and you hide. There is no combat. You do, however, have a camera which serves in place of the standard flashlight or lamp using nightvision. It's not perfect, but that only adds to the feeling of being trapped and helpless. There are sections of the game that follow a very tired pattern of "Go turn two valves" or "Go pull three levers," but they weren't enough to take away from the overall value of the game.\n\nThe story was not particularly amazing, though I did enjoy it quite a bit. As the game was story driven, it was enjoyable to find the various documents and reveal the past of the asylum and its inhabitants.\n\nLastly, I'd like to complain against steam for not tracking offline play times, making my playthroughs of the game reduced to 45 minutes according to my account. Oh well.\n\nAll things considered, it was an excellent game. It exceeded my expectations. I would absolutely recommend it.\n","January 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Great steps have been taken to avoid this game holding a single note from beginning to end. There is enough variety in the environments and scares to elevate a fairly superficial story to the nearest this gamer has been to a first-person, interactive horror film. I cannot count the times I have been lured increasingly closer to the screen only to leap backward from it in surprise or revulsion. There's an undeniable beauty to the game's human carnage which is both mystifying and frightful. The cruelty on display between characters and also towards you, the player, sets up a sense of incredible dread, of putting one's back to a window or door, of entering a room. So many times I wondered if I should just run away or shut down in the corner and wait for death. The game is gripping and certainly perfect for playing in the dark with surround sound.

So far that seems pretty normal for a horror game, but as you progres you find out that it was a retakaning on the MKULTRA experiments of sleep depravation and experiments of the sort made on patients of the asylum, the plot thickens as you go on and discover what happens.\n\nThere are great unforgetable moments on the game, the story is not too expansive besides the notes that you find, there are little "cheap" jumpscares, but most rely on thick ambiance and paranoia of the player.\n\nThe graphics and production values are nothing but amazing for an indie developer, they are top noch and could be easly compared to a triple A title with water physics, SSAO, great lightning effects, great sound (pherhaps  one of the best I have seen), and while the game is a bit short it is a scary expirience throughout the entirity of its gameplay (3-5 hours) keeping you on your toes most of the time.\n\nThere are just a few complains. There arent any real puzzles and the game does get a bit repetitive , but this are minor and is definetly worth the value of admitance.\n\nGreat game, cant wait for the sequel to come along! :D","December 29, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Outlast is a decent psychological horror game. It had a strong beginning. But as I progressed throughout the game, it becomes a glorified Hide and Seek with Fetch Quests over 9000. Whatever scary ambience it might've had disappeared and left me frustrated as I encounter these annoying mooks that tend to get in my way when I just want to progress with the story. The Level Design can be so frustrating especially when landmarks look alike. You'll find yourself stuck in an hour on an area if you're not careful or can't remember where you went because you're too busy running away from the annoying predator.\n\nA piece of advice, don't apply logic on Horror games, they don't work most of the time and you will tend to miss some vital areas. (e.g. Go into a room where it's all bloody and there are people in despite being an outsider, lol).\n\nDo I want to recommend this? Yes and No. I like Outlast's ambience, voice acting and the setting. What I just hate about it is how the gameplay works.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/238320/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Outlast is a picture perfect example of everything done right in a horror game, making the player feel completely helpless and hunted in an environment that makes them feel uncomfortable with a looming sensation of something just around the corner. With 0% of the budget on combat, Outlast has been made completely immersive with subtle and frightening sound effects, disturbing visuals and perfected first-person animations.\nThe story of Outlast begins with a midnight drive to a supposedly abandoned asylum following a tip from an anonymous lead, the player takes the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he delves to uncover the sinister secrets of Mount Massive Asylum.\nImmediately upon entering the asylum the player gets a sensation of being watched, confined and exposed, setting them up for a start at the slightest bump, scratch or shed of movement seen from the corner of your eye. The atmosphere is perfected with high-quality graphics and sound assets, which build up in intensity until exploding in the players face in an intense climax of terror upon their first encounter with one of the asylums mutilated patients.\nAs with any game, while Outlast is good there are some drawbacks that keep it from being perfect. Outlast's puzzle solving lacks variation, recycling the same old method of rushing to press a button or turn a valve while an enemy chases you. While contributing to the sensation of being hunted, re-using these kinds of encounters over and over with a lack of effective follow-up made the game feel largely repetitive and I felt took a large part out of the experience.\nOutlast has also unfortunatly indulged in the cheap shots that are jump scares, which require little-to-no buildup and I feel have no place in a true horror game as they only serve to provide opportunities for talentless hacks like pewdietard to overreact. In comparison with another terrifying game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which had no jump scares and instead relied completely on it's atmosphere to scare the player, this comparison proves to me that horror games worth their weight in gold do not need jump scares and should rely on their immersion, which is something that Outlast would have done very well.\nFinally, without giving away too much, the story felt rushed and incomplete in some places, which didn't leave a lasting impression on me and failed to avidly explain the reasoning behind the inhumane experiments in Mount Massive.\nSo while Outlast is a very good game and a welcome addition to the horror genre, it suffered some flaws that kept it from living up to it's full potential.\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent remains the scariest game I've played.","September 15, 2013","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Luckily there was Halloween sale on Steam and this game was put in the basket.\n\nThe game in a nutshell: you are a reporter with a hand camera as a deadly weapon. You want to investigate an asylum where supposedly experiments were performed on the nut jobs locked in there. Getting in is a piece of cake, but getting out, that's what the whole game is about.\n\nThe macabre atmosphere is overwhelming at start. You continuously look through the lens of you camera, because it is equipped with night vision. This green/black tones add to the darkness of your environment, making it easy to poop your pants whenever a freak comes dangling from the sealing or start chasing you in a hall way. But in the end, this scary stuff also loses its effect if you are being chased around for the umpteenth time and all you want is the chase to be over and continue.\n\nNonetheless, a great addition to the Horror/Survival genre and let's hope the Outlast 2, which is currently in the making, continues along this path.\n\nEdit: just finished the Whistleblower DLC. Nice addition to the game, but nothing special. Look at it as a Blue Shift to Outlast.\n\n7/10","November 23, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shades of 'Metal gear solid' and the early 'Thief' games with a clever eye for detailed mayhem, the creepiness of the place, the glaring lights (where applicable), the locked doors overlooking easy escapes, the tight places, the underlying sense of immenent and ever-present danger; ... the delapo-porn aspects of this game were quite refreshingly well conceived, 3 thumbs up to the devs.\nThe scares are well designed and engaging but the conceptualization of the game is a testimony to the breadth of the team's vision. The melding of challenging visuals, erm... enforced partial non-visual experiences and excellent audio work made for a slow-burning ramp of confidence and capability I have rarely felt in other games.\nThere were some neat tricks that didn't come off too well, the "camera dropped"/totally helpless sequence lead to some great stuff but cues for gaining the full terror of the event could easily have been missed, the malevolence of the 'Twins' was fantastic but I would have liked to engage (i.e; Run screaming away from) with these guys more, the (non) connection between Chris, security Nut, the twins and the Walrider is incredibly confusing at face value and I believe may have suffered from the unsettling 'notes/documents' interface. The end scenario seemed a little confusing to drop on the player after all the skills acquired in the earlier sections but the dramatic change in tone brought a challenging edge of dilemma to strategy-making on-the-fly.\nFor fans of 70's horror movies and stealth-em-ups you can do way worse than have a shot at this title, seems like tips of the hat to Thief, Half-life 2, and the 'Monolith' Team of F.E.A.R. A little short for the truely shifty and nimble but that is highly compensated for in the beauty of 'Mount Massive', the complexity of the layout, fine texturing work and intelligent lighting. A great night or two of horror entertainment handled well.\n9.4/10","April 24, 2014","true","39.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Essentially Amnesia-style gameplay in a new setting, it's good-looking, well-designed and doesn't fall prey to many of the pitfalls that remove the horror from supposedly scary games - it knows when to use silence and emptiness to full effect and doesn't ramp up the action as the game progresses, barring the weak ending.\n\nJump scares come often and can get predictable, and aren't the main strength of the game. It's the organic horror that comes from being stalked or looking for a hiding spot in a panic that really makes it memorable. The sheer gore and disturbing elements, including sexual overtones to the antagonists, are uniquely unnerving though they might alienate some players. Good horror doesn't need to be gruesome, after all.\n\nFairly short and with a very weak final act much less compelling than the rest of the game, it's not for everyone, but is fine fuel for those who love the unmatched rush of feeling genuinely afraid.","January 14, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The reason why it is effective is so obvious that I'm surprised more games don't do it. Here is the secret ladies and gentlemen. PACING. Yes, it truly boggles the mind, but PACING is the key to a good survival horror game. The game doesn't just start throwing you into an attack from a murderous zombie army with a shotgun in one hand and your ♥♥♥♥ in the other. You start reading about a strange facility, you travel there in your car, and enter it. Even after that you aren't attacked for about a half hour. Now, keep this in mind. The game does occasionally use jumpscares, but honestly I don't mind them. They are used sparingly and the scariest part is the anticipation of the jumpscare. They are only used about 3 times throughout the story. Now, I'm not going to spoil the story, so there won't be a breakdown on what I do and do not like about the story, but it is told fairly well through documents and notes found throughout the facility.

The game requires exploration, investigation that rewards us with further exposition of what is truly going on; aswell as more batteries for the camera you carry that is the only source of seeing in the pitch black hallways.\n\nWhether it's finding fuses, navigating vents or hiding from naked dudes with pipes; the game is a truly terrifying and polished experience; any issues such as a short length of about 7-9 hours and an abrupt ending; are for the most part shadowed by the exilirating thrill this game offers by combing  the best of the gaming worlds.\n\nOutlast raises the bar for every future horror game, indie or not. The developers are also talking about making the sequel ;)\n\n4/5","October 27, 2013","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

There are no annoying aspects to controlls or anything like that. Although there are not that many ways in which the game is trying to give you the mental breakdown you might be looking for you do get scared - terrified even.\nI would definitely recomend this to fans of survival horror.\n\nShortcomings would be:\n1. Too short\n2. Charaters (including yourself) seem under-developed. Personally I think that you don't get enough info, background, or a chance to "spend quality time together" to really care... about anyone.\n3. Objectives, tasks, obstackles border on repetitive. This would certainly be an issue if the game was considerably longer.","February 16, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Outlast is a survival horror game where you CANNOT fight back. This means your ways of surviving are to run, and hide or not get seen at all. It gives you the feeling of terror to know you're helpless once you get found. Now I played only on the normal difficulty but I imagine the harder the difficulty the less batteries for your camcorder AKA your source of light in the dark are spread around. Now minus that I did come to a part where I had no batteries and I could barely see anything at all, I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants and shut the game off. Other than that there are some scenes with full out nudity, thank Gods for the terrible lighting or I would have saw what hangs between my legs. Now overall Outlast is a great game, it lacks a large soundtrack but the silence can be scary at times. Depending on how brave, fast and smart you are this game can last anywhere from 4 to 12 hours in gameplay.  Now a big issue with this game like all ones it the main kinds of times you get scared are from scripted jump scares, like all Horror games these happen sadly. As I remember there are only a handful of the scripted ones but the "hunting" parts of the game are horrid. (Horrid in a good way.)  The hunting sequences are when an AI (Weather a standard enemy or a "boss") is in the area where you need to solve a puzzel or get a key etc. etc. patrols around looking for you usually in the pitch black. Overall the game is great for it's time and deserves a 9/10 and a ♥♥♥♥ your pants seal of approval.","May 12, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Aldo Raine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bawnjourno/","34 products in account","I picked this game up during the summer sale for a pretty good price compared to the normal tag of 20 bucks or so, and after waiting literally 3 days straight for my sorry exuse for internet to download it, I finally managed to get to playing it, the beginning of the game does a fairly good job of introducing the simple yet interesting mechanics, and you do get to see a couple of the splicers mentally ill patients before you actually encounter them face to face (which Is good). however when you do get to actually dangerous encouters with the splicers evil patients, its quite obvious that they dont have good ai, but maybe its becuase its just becuase theyre mentally ill? I say they had bad AI becuase MOST of the enemies you encounter somehow  immediantly know your around, and then they proceed to walk from one end of the area, to the other back and forth until you leave. So your expected to sneak around while whimpering like the ♥♥♥♥♥ journalist guy you are and find an escape. However I found it really easy to just run past the "scary" monster and jump through the convenient air duct or gap in the wall that leads to the next area.\n\nWhile you'll probaly be avoiding the patients anyway (I know I didnt , its funny as hell to watch the patient zombie things suddenly turn around scream, and kill/chase you) it is important to note that not all the patients are hostile or bad, matter of fact a lot of them have some interesting things to say, a lot of wich have to do with the underlying story about the asylum itself and whats been going on. Later on in the game you notice (as a player) that a lot of this crap is supernatural, and not just caused by these crazy splicers insane patients. Which personally I dont like anything with ghosts/magics/thingsicantevenfreakingseesohowisthisfair?!/ so that didnt appeal to me but whatever, not like that matters.\n\nAs you make more and more progress it gets apparent that the protagonist starts to get a bit insane, but not beacuse the (minor spoiler)  permanent injuries him and his camcorder he treats like a child have sustained , but it has something to do with the place itself.  and he becomes more and more attached to the place and solving his goals.\n\nAs you near the end a lot of truth is revealed about the company that has been running the asylum and the kind of stuff that has been going on with that company, but its not nessiciarly something that makes you gasp, just more to the story.\nAnd when you get to the final area in the game you finally get to enounter the supernatural being for yourself, and while ot probaly is harder for you to hide. its still just as easy to simply run past it and continue on your goal, just while holding the shift key.\n\n( I probaly shouldve stated this earlier, but who cares, this review is super unorganazind and probaly unapealing anyway)\nThe overall scariness of it isnt that high, which the game really does try; but I only found myself scared a couple times, and both were due to a random jumpscare, which there were plenty of, but these ones were just a bit more strategically placed instead of the usual random guy popping out and then running back to whereever the hell he came from, and somehow telapathically locking the door behind him because he thinks interacting with the only guy in the building who is sane and doesnt look like he is made of a bunch of peices of skin being sewed together is a bad idea.\n\nSpoiler:\nThe game ended up ending like your average(?) horror game would; you utilizie the enviorment to kill the main monster/enitity, then you limp to the door that would take you to saftey, only to suddenly get killed by people who wouldve actually saved you in a normal situatuion, however this game did put a more satisfying twist to it by having you come back to life in the form of that supernatural monster that you killed (and somehow absorbed its magic powers) and then killing all the people who shot you, unfortanatly you dont get to see it, just listen to audio of it, but I guess having only audio on a black screen did help the game go from ending to credits, which I can understand.\n\nSo all in all, its a pretty good game for the price I paid ended up paying for it (only 4$ (gotta love sales!))\nwhile I stated a lot of things I didnt that I didnt like about it, I did enjoy the overall expierince, the main things that made me recomend it is the good length and story, however the lack of actual scariness was a big turn-off, I dont think its worth paying the 20 bucks or so for the game. But Its obvious that some people really did get scared in this game, so it would be to them!","July 15, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is just short enough and delivers enough content to be recommended, but it only offers JUST enough to be recommended. With the major competition of this game being the far superior Penumbra and Amnesia games by Frictional Games it has quite a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the gameplay and "horror" are barely enough to hold the average player through. It goes for the jump scare route roughly 100% of the time. The jump scares themselves work the first and maybe the second time, but after you see it's a sub-par "one trick pony" there's no horror left in it only frustration. The enemies in this game do not follow the wonderful template set by Amnesia where they seemingly come and go as they please instead they follow a set path they patrol until you pass that area. Along with that the A.I. that they have is rather dodgy to when they actually see you and trying to hide from them can be a pain. I personally discovered that the easiest way to get past the enemy is to simply run past them the second they bust the door down instead of wasting time trying to hide. Once you run past them in most places where you have to go to make them disappear is in that room they came from. If you do try the hiding route expect to waste time dying for reasons that shouldn't happen and getting spotted in places that really don't make sense. None of that is scary. It's frustrating. A better game for jump scares is Doom 3. A better game for weaponless stealth horror would be Amnesia or Penumbra. A better game for crazy psychological/paranormal experiments is F.E.A.R. or Condemned. If it was the guts and gore that scared you even Dead Space is better for that. This game really only serves as a way to kill a few hours if you have a horror itch and have already played all of the above games. If you haven't then what are you waiting for!\n\nOverall I give it a 6/10.","October 12, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But just because there is no gimmick in this game, doesn't mean it is bad.  On the contrary, this is one of the best horror games I have ever played.  The atmosphere is erie in the asylum where everything seems a little off (that may be from all the corpses and blood) and where the patients are as crazy, and deformed as it gets, and you never know how they will react.  Sometimes they just curl up in a ball and scream, and other times, they are chasing you through the sewers.  The camera that you hold to record what is happening also adds a creepy layer when you use the night vision.  The game is excellent at making tension.  There are times where you don't get attacked for twenty minutes, but you are always on alert because of the excelent sound (from the heavy breathing and heart pounding from the main character, to the sound of chains and foot steps in the distance) and the closed corridors with many doors that you don't know whats behind them.  There are also a couple good jump scares that got me, but not enough to get tire-sum or take away too much control from the organic scares that happen.  Some of the scariest parts of the game are unique to the player and not cutscenes.  For example, I was in the sewers when this big mutant who stalks you throughout the game appears.  I try to sneak past him, but he sees me and I start running.  I see a little drain hole and a quickly crawl into it.  Once Im in this cramped space, I look back to see his feet right there.  He pauses for a while before walking off.  Calmed down now, I start making my way through to the other side, when to my surprise, he had gone around and was waiting for me.  I tried to go back, but it was too late.  He dragged me out and beat me up.  It was one of the biggest jump scares for me, and it wasn't a cutscene.  They also add different scare elements and different locations (hospital, normal asylum area, office, sewers, etc) so it stays fresh, and keeps you on your toes.  The story is nothing new in the horror genre, but it isn't terrible.  The little notes that your character writes about diferent things that happen thoroughout the story, adds a bit of personality to the silent protagonist.  There were a few things that took me out of the experience though.  One was the ridiculous amount of pain the protagonist could tolerate.  He had things done to him that would normally make someone pass out, but he just grabs his camera and moves on.  Another thing that made it less scary, was when you realise how easy it is to lose someone chasing you in some cases so you don't feel the need to sneak, because there are practacally no penalties to being spotted, but this is only about halfway through.  They do a few things later in the game to freshen it up again.  To sum it up, this is a geat horror game that I would recommend to anyone who wants some thrills and solid gameplay this year.","December 4, 2013","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is told through notes you make when you have the camera out and through documents you find strewn in the levels.\n\nIt borrows from the Amnesia series in that you can't actually defend yourself against any of the unpleasant things you might encounter. Your only course of action is to run and to hide. However, whereas in Amnesia you might have had something chasing you and you knew it would kill you so you ran until you were safe with your heart pounding, in Outlast you are required to backtrack past the same enemy over and over. Far from being scary, it just becomes an annoyance.\n\nThere are many sections where you need to find a key (or other item) but when looking for it you will be seen by an enemy, then you'll run, hide in a closet, wait for him to leave, then go and search again, the same thing happens, repeat ad nausem or until he finally kills you. The scariness is gone and it just becomes frustrating. You know what you have to do; you might even know where the key is, but you have to get past something that will chase you and instantly kill you.\n\nThere is functionality to look over either shoulder using Q or E. It is not very useful though because it is disorienting. I suppose that was the intention: when running from something you take a quick glance over your shoulder and see it just behind you. The trouble is, in real life we are unaware of the movement of our head because our brain processes it for us. We don't see the world spin when we turn our head. When the game shows you everything spin it's not actually realistic, it's annoying and makes the "look behind" function not very usable.\n\nThe need to use the camera with its night vision to see does add some tension, which is helped along by your character breathing heavily etc. There is an outdoor part which is reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project in its atomosphere.\n\nIf you like horror games then this is worth a play. It has a great atmosphere and some nice visuals. There are a few jump scares and to start with it's quite immersive until the gameplay gets a bit samey and you know what the threats are. But by that time you'll probably see it through to the end to find out what happens. The game is about the right length in that respect.","December 17, 2013","true","6.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The camcorder has a nightvision feature that drains the battery as it is being used. This made for a quite exciting and high suspense game as you are sometimes racing to find a battery before you are left in the dark with all the bad things you don't want!\n\nThe game wasn't extremely long, and compared to Dead Space, the death scenes were still good, just not Dead Space good haha which is ok because this is Outlast. I wish they had more variety for the death scenes (multiple per enemy). Either way.

Definitely a screwed up story, and some controversial religious topics to anyone who is offended by blasphemy. Very graphic, lots of gore, and NOT for the faint of heart.\n\nI would rate the game an 8/10\n\nFantastic game worth every penny (though is was gifted to me by a stream viewer, I feel I would of not been upset and feel it was money well spent!!)","February 24, 2014","true","19.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is just short enough and delivers enough content to be recommended, but it only offers JUST enough to be recommended. With the major competition of this game being the far superior Penumbra and Amnesia games by Frictional Games it has quite a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the gameplay and "horror" are barely enough to hold the average player through. It goes for the jump scare route roughly 100% of the time. The jump scares themselves work the first and maybe the second time, but after you see it's a sub-par "one trick pony" there's no horror left in it only frustration. The enemies in this game do not follow the wonderful template set by Amnesia where they seemingly come and go as they please instead they follow a set path they patrol until you pass that area. Along with that the A.I. that they have is rather dodgy to when they actually see you and trying to hide from them can be a pain. I personally discovered that the easiest way to get past the enemy is to simply run past them the second they bust the door down instead of wasting time trying to hide. Once you run past them in most places where you have to go to make them disappear is in that room they came from. If you do try the hiding route expect to waste time dying for reasons that shouldn't happen and getting spotted in places that really don't make sense. None of that is scary. It's frustrating. A better game for jump scares is Doom 3. A better game for weaponless stealth horror would be Amnesia or Penumbra. A better game for crazy psychological/paranormal experiments is F.E.A.R. or Condemned. If it was the guts and gore that scared you even Dead Space is better for that. This game really only serves as a way to kill a few hours if you have a horror itch and have already played all of the above games. If you haven't then what are you waiting for!\n\nOverall I give it a 6/10.","October 12, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The ambience is truly amazing and greatly fits and improves to horror scenes. And the soundtrack is good. ( In my opinion ) The game's conflicts however, seem to be a bit repetitive, usually requiring you to activate certain pumps/engines while avioding one of the games enemies who walks around looking for you. The game story overall is good, and has their share of plot twists.\n\nThe graphics are highly detailed and realistic, matching the overall scene of Mount Massive Asylum very well. The asylum looks truly realistic, and I can't help being sucked into the game every once in a while.\n\nThe only negative thing I would have to say about this game is its repetivity, like I recently stated, this game constantly requires you to keep activating engines and stuff, while evading the boss. You  can try rushing along, or you could use stealth, which involves alot of waiting for the right moment and eventually getting seen and running back.\n\nThe game really fits as a survival horror, having only few "fight" scenes, one being when Dr.Trager last tries to kill you in the elevator.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this as a good horror game full of exciting ( and scary ) adventure.\n\n8/10\n\n\nIf you're into horror games, go ahead and buy it, it's a good game to play.","July 17, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I love this game, no doubt. It's creepy, the scares have a lasting effect and the graphics are great. As a horror game, it does it's job. Friends of mine can't play this game for more than 20 minutes and the DLC is even better/scarier than the original content. The only downsides to the game are a few aspects of the hiding mechanic and it's replayability. It IS replayable to a degree, but like all horror you get used to it after the second or third time through. I'd still recommend it as something to bring out at a small party/ horror night though.","September 25, 2015","true","12.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game consists moslty of jumpscares, but these are well done and, for the most part, unexpected. Things you expect to come alive and jump at you, never do. And situations that seem safe (compared to others) turn out to be the most disturbing and stomach turning scares Ive ever seen. Adding on to this, the feeling of being 100% helpless has a huge impact and at times found my self panicking along with my character as I scramble in the dark trying to find something to hide in or under. All and all, this game has taken at least a year off of my life. And my heart still has yet to return to a normal pace, though this may be influenced by fatty foods.

There are times also where you reach a point were you have to turn 4 valves or find a key or turn on the power before continuing which can feel anoying. But overall its a very very nice horror game with great immersion. Also I recomment you pick up the DLC also because in my opinion its worth it as if its its own standalone side-story (but does invovle the main story). Also dont think about logic when playing this game, there isnt much of it here (like "bad guys" always know where you are and how to get around to the ponit where I swear they teleport and the fact that there are they are using weapons but you cant use anything like a punching bag, I mean wasnt there security/task forces with shotguns and assult rifles in there and even thoguh some of them died, you see no weapons.)

Many things don't make any sense either, like the AI (not too bright), battery life or where enemies actually come from. You do not have to hide, I even managed to simply run until they stopped following me. There are no puzzles. Plus, the game isn't scary.. like .. at all. For my sense of humor it was more like a fun ride - tons of organs+body parts (lavvl), funny (&&stereotypical) characters and notes (with lots of spelling mistakes in the german version).\nThis may be a good choice for you if you're scared of ... let's say the darkness(nyctophobia) or nosocomephobia - cause I don't think normal ppl will find this scary. (maybe you don't want it to be..)\n\nPlayed on 'nightmare' difficulty, since I wanted to have savegames.. .","November 2, 2014","true","47.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Outlast is riveting from start to finish, full of real scares. The game doesn't rely on pop up scares that are unexpected and make you jump (although it has them!) But rather relies on full tension having you walk around knowing something is about to happen, creating anxiety for when it does actualy happen. Some parts I literaly had to stop and have a break as my heart was pounding and my hands were sweating so much I felt I couldn't go on :)\n\nReally clever level design, it felt very original and authentic. And the music/soundtrack added to the tension and even created some of it. The A.I. also was brilliant!\n\nThe best horror experience I've ever had, and one of the best games I've ever played!!\nBring on The Whistleblower DLC!\n\n10/10.","September 22, 2014","true","7.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I do not usually pick up or buy horror based games (nor do I see horror movies). However, I received this game as a gift from a friend during the Winter Holidays.\n\nThis game was really well done. The graphic and shadowing made it realisited as you made your way through the Asylum on Mount Massive. Having to depend solely on your ability to hide, sneak, RUN, to get through the treacherous place and maze of corridor made the game tough and enjoyable.\n\nThe best part in my opinion was the camera. Having to rely on it throughout most of the game. (well essentially all except a small bit). But it made you think about when you should use it and when you shouldnt. Especially since batteries that powered was your lifeline and you never know when you may need the camera (and if you had no batteries left...damn that blows).\n\nI played this game over two nights with friends who watched the twitch and spent the time chatting and commenting on the game and what was happening (whether complaining at my inability to jump or my inability to play different voices of the letters out loud). We had a blast.\n\nI highly recommend this game. The whol survive as things go bump in the night was a lot of fun. The best part of the game is the cracked camera. The thought and cleverness of the developers/designer to do that as you traveled. This made it very realistic since a camera does get beat up like the character.\n\nThe whole story puts you wondering the asylum and you start to care about your character. Feeling bad he falls when you jump or when he gets caught and killed. You go through so much in this game that you become connected, he goes through so much in this game that it makes it all the more motivating to keep going and see what happens next.\n\nI recommend playnig this game.","January 30, 2014","true","19.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However, I feel I have played enough to the point where I can tell that this game is going to be adequate. This game isn't too scary. I know that everybody says it's the most scary game of 2013, however, it's not. I have gone through the game so far without making a sound. The jump scares get you, however, that is the only part that will truly get you on edge. The game is still fun, however it doesn't really fill the hype I got off of its fans.

This review will contain no spoilers for neither plot nor story.\n\n-TRIAL AND ERROR SIMULATOR\n-CHASE AND RUN AWAY SIMULATOR\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI AND HIDING SIMULATOR\n\nIf you buy this game, prepare for sub-par gameplay. You have little  to no influence over whether you survive an enemy encounter or not - as aforementioned, in obnoxious CapsLock, when you encounter an enemy, all you can do is run away  - which is all well and good, right? "Many games, especially of the Horror genre, do this", you say.\nThe short answer would be yes, but the problem is that there is often ONE PATH to slip away from an enemy, often involving opening doors and closing them again, and it's IMPOSSIBLE to tell whether the door is actually locked or not, meaning you'll die 19 times to one enemy because you just happened to "make the wrong guess" as to which way was the right one.\n\nIn general, you have very little control over the main character's actions; oftentimes, when tense action is happening, it involves first-person cutscenes of the events, with you just sitting there watching. In essence, all you have control over in this game is:\n-Movement (limited due to the aforementioned)\n-Picking up certain items (involving batteries for your camcorder, files/journals and certain progress-vital items)\nThat's it. Quite dull.\n\n"But Shape - why are you recommending this game then?"\nBecause of three major points, which, in my opinion, easily compensates for the aforementioned flaws:\n\n1) The plot: Many Horror games, and especially movies for that matter, have an incredibly dull and boring plot, and only get small points for cheap jump scares and similar tropes. This game is not one of those. At all. While there certainly are jump scares, the plot of this story is easily one of the most interesting, fascinating and most well-fleshed out ones I've experienced in any Horror game, being up there with classic Silent Hill, classic Resident Evil and the first Amnesia (note that I'm not comparing this plot to those games, it is in no way similar, it just delivers the same amount of quality). It puts you in the setting, ranging from fairly peaceful-looking to fishy to "what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on?" to batshit insanity. And it does so in a very smooth way, with no try-hard scares and forced plotting like you occasionally see in other games of the genre.\n\n2) The design: This is mainly focused on characters - both their aesthetic appearance and their personality. You are presented with a wide array of interesting characters, all done in a way where you're never quite sure whom to trust and whom to oppose. You're going to be falling through the cracks attempting to figure out who is good and who is bad - in other words, the characters are what presents this great plot in its own way: a complete and utter moral greyzone.\n\n3) The atmosphere: The story unfolds in an old mental hospital, and you might think it's cliché, that you've seen this all before, that it is an overused setting. And you might be right - but assuredly, it has never been presented in the way Outlast manages to: grim darkness in every corner, the palette of clinical instruments and brushed steel paired with horrible gore and bloodstains, spiced with deranged freaks walking around everywhere, unpredictably, makes the raw experience of this game easily worth both your time and your money.\n\nOverall, I would certainly recommend this game - if you manage to read this review while there's a sale, there is ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE not to buy this game if you're a die-hard Horror fanatic like me, and you've got money in your pocket. And don't worry about my initial remarks about the gameplay: they're effortlessly overshadowed by the great story, you're in for.","December 12, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my opinion it might be the best horror game I have ever played. If you like horror games, you will probably love Outlast. (Particularly if you like to be trapped inside an asylum where something has gone very very wrong and the most of the people you meet will be dead people and/or people you wish would be dead, or at least not there to chase you and kill you. Oh, and also - You can't defend youself. Just run and hope that you wlll not run out of batteries for the nightvision of your camera.) This game will probably scare the living crap out of you. It's brilliantly horribly scary and disturbing and Red Barrels have done such a fantastic job, especially considering it's such a small indie game studio.","October 24, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
