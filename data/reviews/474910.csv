Some mahjong games set up the tiles randomly, but this one obviously follows a type of algorythm where the game wont screw you on the first few steps, offering you a short grace period before you run into issues. (There's one puzzle I couldn't get more than 15% complete before having to use every power up I could, eventually resorting to using most of my crystals to completely refill the powerup bar.) As you progress through the storyline you'll find yourself needing to use these power ups more and more as the puzzles get more difficult. One of the power ups will reshuffle the board.\n\nThere's a neat feature that allows you to remove a tile from the board and hold onto it to match later, but you have to match it before being able to pick up another one. There are hundreds of challenge puzzles available that don't affect the story portion of the game.\n\nAnother portion of the game involves "boss fights" that play very similarly to games like Bejeweled or Pokemon Shuffle. The instructions for these games aren't explained very well, so it took a while for me to catch on. There are health orbs for yourself and the enemy. The bar next to the health bar shows which color orbs will give you "crystal energy" to attack. For the entirety of the first boss fight, I had to avoid matching purple orbs or I would get attacked. Each time I was able to attack, my color changed.\n\nThe achievements are buggy right now but the game just came out so it should get fixed soon.","May 25","true","4.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

It runs smoothly, it has a few gimmicks that don't interfere with gameplay, and it runs perfectly smoothly on relatively low specs. It's a good coffee break style game. Definitely worth its value.","May 25","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Surprisingly difficult levels as it progresses, interesting story and a good amount of both game hours and replayability (there are puzzles with really difficult 3-star goals).","May 25","true","2.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Its got a sherlock holmes esque storyline to it that you must solve some jong puzzles to solve it. Not bad for a few dollars to kill some time and play some jong.","May 25","true","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The game is fun and the powerups make it interesting. Still a little buggy. I got stuck on level 8 (billiard room) and it was on this level that the game ate 3 of my little magic powerups and I had to restart it to keep playing. Downloaded on my mac and I can't exit the game without a force quit or taking it out of fullscreen mode. It looks gorgeous on the retina screen! but super annoying to exit. I also tried adding a new profile while playig on my mac, and was unable to type a player name. It worked again after restarting the game.\n\nThe game just came out, so there's bound to be minor annoyances and buggy things.","May 29","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
