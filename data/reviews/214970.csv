I must've seen some spark of greatness in it though, because I kept it in my "Currently Playing" folder instead of moving it to my Steam Graveyard of games I am finished with or don't care about. Boy am I glad I did. I booted it up and after another slightly less mediocre first part to the second level, I got to ride on a wolf mount. It was a little awkward to control, but I felt powerful and had a lot of fun.\n\nFrom there it only got better. Epic boss fights, a few fun guns (laser and grenade launcher), three different pilotable mech suits, and non-stop action. If you like Metal Slug, Contra, and sometimes frustrating physics, this game is for you! And for any achievement hunters out there, it's not too difficult to 100%.","December 4, 2013","true","9.6"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

This is one badass, fun game, with epic, memorable bosses and creative elements like some pretty basic physics and destruction. You can destroy log bridges to send everyone falling to their doom, blow up the supports of watchtowers. Crush enemies under boulders you push over. Physics like that, which add to the fun. The enemies can take a beating and the weapons feel good, but even if there is a variety of weapons, not many feel different from one another. The levels seem like a marathon. They are so long you might find yourself wondering when they end. This is probably good.\n\nEarlier I mentioned epic bosses. I don't use that term lightly. It makes me feel weird, but let me tell you about the first boss, a helicopter or hovercraft with arms with multiple phases. If its not shooting at you, its dropping soldiers out. If its not trying to hand pound you into the ground, its literally crawling after you. Its insane and awesome. It is very memorable and covers a lot of ground.\n\nTo keep things fresh, you can pilot mech suits... if not grab the gun off of a destroyed mech and use it on your enemies. Oh and if that's too normal for you, in the first level, you can ride a giant Arctic wolf. Its pretty nice.\n\nThe game is challenging, you do have a health bar, and ammo depletes, and you can die more from the controls than you do anything else, BUT the game is very forgiving, with plenty of checkpoints.\n\nThe controls take a bit of getting use to. You have your standard jump, duck and weapon switch keys, but then to aim you use your mouse. This allows for more precise aim, but I'm more used to the Contra controls of having 8 direction shooting instead of precision. If you're used to Teraria, you'll be used to this. There is floaty jumping that can take some getting used to and the physics seem really light and springy. The boxes will bounce around if lightly nudged. Some of the animation is springy like old cartoon characters. That is probably Flash animation for you.\n\nIt took a while to get over it, but when I did, I found this game to be really fun to play. There are crazy Holy ♥♥♥♥ moments, and moments where the physics can have some unique experiences for a 2D run n gun game, such as seeing a mech jump onto a floating box. The box bounced the mech up and kinda floated away just enough for a giant fish to eat the mech. That wasn't supposed to happen, but it did, and it was cool.\n\nWell worth $10.","June 30, 2013","true","2.8"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

Enemy&boss designs are awesome(and I actually mean it!), physics effects are actually useful, music fits the gameplay. Most of the problems come from the fact that it was made with Flash. Controls are somewhat laggy, framerate seems to be capped at 30, but still doesn't feel smooth, bad gamepad support, etc. None of these problems are game-breaking though, just a minor irritation, for me at least.\nUpdate. I see that many reviewers compare it with Contra/Metal Slug and don't like the added physics effects. Well, this is NOT Contra. To me, its more like Abuse, which also was slower, controlled with mouse and involved slightly more thinking than average platform shooter. Physics, in my opinion, adds to the game, making every playthrough slightly unique, creating unexpected opportunities as well as irritations. I heard, this is called "emergent gameplay", but Nintendo kids seem to prefer games they can memorize and play by reflexes alone, instead of improvising, even a little.","December 15, 2013","true","12.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/214970/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Intrusion 2 is a modern take on Contra/Metal Slug. And when I say modern, it is not an empty word!\n\nHowever, let's start with what is familiar: Intrusion 2 is a 2D side-scroller with action and platforming, shooting soldiers and robots (some of which can be piloted) while occasionally negotiating some jumps. A lot of games have tried to ape the aforementioned classical games, but very few have come close to touch their greatness. Usually, they are dull with scarce enemies, repetitive levels and clunky controls.\n\nThe controls of Intrusion 2 are not beyond any criticism. There is some floatiness to the main character, but it does not make it clunky. It just feels weird, but it is still reactive and shooting is instant. One of the reasons for this feeling is that the characters are not sprites with all their animation frames pre-rendered. Every limb, every object in the game is actually controlled like a puppet by the physics engine. A modern spin that sets this game apart from its ancestors, in addition to the ability to shoot at 360°. The physics make the game feel both awkward and awesome at the same time, as robot legs fly around and kill soldiers in their fall. And there are mechas with grappling hooks battling by throwing rocks at each other when they are not flying around pulled by their ropes before a sword finish.\n\nSounds cool? Wait until you see the boss fights. I have rarely seen such amazing boss fights. They have tons of different stages and are hard while still being easy to learn, making them an entertaining challenge. They also look good, which helps making those fights memorable.\n\nHowever, if the game keeps things fresh and cool during the first hour, once the novelty factor wears off the levels feel too lengthy and look-alike. There is very little variation in the settings and formula despite the promising snowboard chase at the start. The music is not especially interesting and too repetitive/annoying rather quickly. The robots have terrific art and animation, but the backgrounds look oddly photo-realistic and not very awe-inspiring. Since I am tackling the negative points, the difficulty associated with whimsical physics might frustrate quite a number of players. If you are not a good player, set the game on easy and enjoy the awesome beginning. If you like a good challenge with still more leeway than a very demanding game like Contra, you will no doubt pull through the short campaign and have a good time despite the less entertaining later levels.\n\nA concession to make to the physics engine is that the game runs slowly. The framerate does not go higher than 30 frames per second, and some slow-downs can be experienced even on a good machine. This is most likely due to the fact that the game was coded in Flash, just like the original Binding of Isaac. Surprisingly, despite the intensive use of physics, there are very few bugs and issues. The controls are well tuned so that the player can instinctively achieve any action without pestering, such as grabbing cords or moving over physics-bound objects.\n\nAs a conclusion, this game is not perfect but an impressive example of what a modern Metal Slug/Contra would be. There are a lot of very cool stuff in here, so I definitively recommend trying out this game. Especially for the battles against larger enemies and the boss fights. The game feels like it is great and could almost be placed up there with Metal Slug/Contra, but it is dragged down by a few negative aspects and lack of variety once the beginning is behind.\n\nGood news, most if not all of my gripes appear to have been corrected in the next game from the same developer: Jetpack Squad. This is something very promising that I am definitively looking forward to, and hopefully Intrusion 2 was the stepping stone to a masterpiece!","March 15, 2015","true","11.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

The mech designs were cool and the boss battles were epic. The final battle in particular was one of the most insane boss battles I’ve ever played in a game.\n\nMy main criticism about Intrusion 2 is that the levels just dragged on for a bit too long. Enemies and scenery just repeated a few times too many. It took me over two hours to play through the game, while Metal Slug fits the same amount of content into a much shorter game with more replay-value.","June 24, 2014","true","3.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

The bosses are absolute monstrosities and are brutally evil to fight. There are a handful of mounts/vehicles you get to use and none of them make you overpowered, nor do they die immediately and feel like a waste. Pickups are interesting and each gun has a purpose while also sequentially increasing in power. If there is one thing to complain about it’s the characters movement. I’m not sure if the planet is supposed to be low gravity, but you practically float through the levels. If it’s intentional then I’m sure it’s well implemented, but I find the lack of fine control to be very irritating.\nOverall if you’re into the game type, Intrusion 2 is pretty awesome for what it is.","April 6, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017953416/recommended/214970/","76561198017953416","James Sunderland","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017953416/","762 products in account","QUICK TIP: If you're having trouble downloading this game, try rebooting your computer in "safe mode with network capabilities" and then downloading it. It worked for me, and you can very easily Google how to do that. Once fully downloaded and installed you can just do a regular reboot again and it'll work fine.\n\nThis is without a doubt my favorite side-scrolling shooter ever, and it should come highly recommended to anybody who likes games that can deliver both incredible spectacle and intense difficulty. And when I say spectacle, I do mean it: if anybody ever tells you indie games just cannot deliver the same kind of epic setpieces as AAA-titles, point them towards this game and then smile as they go, "What?! WHAT?!! WHAAAAAATT??!!!1!" Hell, stick a facecam on 'em & upload it to YouTube, and you'll probably get a couple thousand views.\n\nThe more difficult the level, the more awesomely ridiculous the setpieces: from fist-pumping gunships, to wielding grenade-launchers off the backs of giant wolves, to a gun that is also a Tron-bike. And that's not even getting into the final boss, who I won't spoil here. So yeah, the presentation: awesome. The graphics are pixelly but more than detailed enough to convey the awesome action-scenes, and the soundtrack does an excellent job backing it all up. It's exactly the kind of fist-pumping hard rock you want out of a title like this, and it gets absolutely zero complaints from me.\n\nBut I also mentioned difficulty, didn't I? Oh boy, the difficulty in this game... Okay, for the record: *yes* there is an Easy option, and it should at least let you get as far as the first boss fight. But this is not the kind of game where people who're just interested in the story can just coast along on Easy without having to worry about dying. This is a game where you pay attention, or you die. Literally, since the boss fights are all about memorizing their attack patterns and figuring out how to dodge them. And you won't do that on your first go. Or your second. Or third.\n\nOr tenth.\n\nBut for as challenging as they are, these fights are not hard because it's unclear what to do. All the attacks make it pretty clear how to go about dodging them; it's just that the bosses have so much health that it's hard to perfectly remember and dodge those attacks so many times over the course of a fight. You *will* take damage: the trick is just doing more damage to them first.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who saw this game or saw a Let's Play and thought, "Man I wanna try that." then you'll probably make it to the final boss on Easy. But if you're thinking of recommending this to someone as a casual indie title, forget it. This is not something you play on the bus home from work: this is something you play til 1 in the morning, when you finally beat that boss after 2 hours of trying & failing and you unironically shout, "IN YOUR FACE!" at your monitor. That's a damn good feeling, but only if it's actually what you're looking for in a game.\n\nThat's the Easy setting. As for Medium, it is exclusively the domain of hardcore fans or shooter veterans. Nobody else need apply. The Hard setting is for masochists who think Metal Gear Solid 2 at European Extreme just isn't challenging enough (yes I'm serious). However it is worth noting that despite those insane challenges, the game *does* actually have an initial difficulty curve. You won't get blown away in the first 10 minutes, if that's what worries you.\n\nIf there are any downsides to the game, it's that (A) all that great challenging gameplay doesn't really have a narrative to go with it, and (B) the developer seems sadly reluctant to fix the downloading issue mentioned above (or tell people how to circumvent it: I spent a good hour finding out that tip I put at the start). The narrative is... barely there, to be honest. There's so little of it that you can't really call it bad or distracting: it certainly doesn't detract from the experience. It's just kind of a missed opportunity for the game to show that all your hard work actually has in-universe consequences.\n\nThe downloading issue is annoying yes, but to be fair: when the game was originally released it wasn't there. It appeared after a patch and was never fixed. So I'm counting that as a mark against the dev, not the game itself. And again, the tip up top should work.\n\nWho would like this?\n- People who like side-scrolling shooters.\n- People who like spectacle in their action games.\n- People who like seriously challenging/punishing difficulty.\n- People who like cheap indie games that are nonetheless stuffed with content.\n\nIf you fall into any of those categories, the game is definitely worth its retail price and *ABSOLUTELY* worth picking up if it's on sale.\n\nWho wouldn't like this?\n- People who play games mainly for the story or characters.\n- People who don't like great challenge that's based on pattern-recognition.\n- People who don't like side-scrolling shooters.\n- People who don't like fist-pumping gunships.\n\nThose people should stay far away from this title. It will not float their boat, or any other flotation device for that matter.\n\nAside from the download issue, the game is actually a technical marvel. It runs entirely in Flash, believe it or not, and it runs smooooooooooooth. Like, we're talking Barry-White-pouring-a-Colt-45-over-buttery-velvet smooth here. It never lags or stutters, the install file is small and it doesn't eat up too much processing power. It's also surprisingly long (factoring in how often you'll die) so if you buy it then at least you'll get your money's worth.\n\nThis game is the perfectly distilled essence of Side-Scrolling Shooter. What that means for you is your call. But for me, it means a 9/10.\n\n(Oh, and the final boss is Top 3 material. I'm not even kidding.)","January 26, 2015","true","7.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's available the remapping option and regardless its limit, helps many different playstyles.\nIt's not a senseless action what this game gives: it's a challenge. In some parts of the game there's a slight difficult peak if no ammo has been saved previously.  And the unique in-game physics it's a constant part of both trouble and an additional weapon for the player: while a bit strange or awkward used correctly you could use boulders, crates, even dropped weapons to kill enemies. And not only using the Grapple Mech, since each different weapon has has a different knockback power.\n\nGraphics:\nGreat mecha design, bosses are unforgettable (and unforgiving), wonderful backgrounds. Soldiers and wolfs are affected by the physics so animation seems strange and not quite natural.\n\nStoryline:\nIf played without interruptions is quite clear that the "intrusion" in enemy territory is a wonder spawned from an action movie. Looking on some sequences is far from being without sense.\nIt's a shame that even if it's structured as a single mission no hints are given on who's and why the main protagonist have to battle his way to the final boss.

The run-and-gun genre was essentially a combination of the approach to player movement found in side-scrolling platformers with the blistering frenzy of the shoot-em-up genre. Fast-paced action, destruction and carnage, huge boss fights, and epic set pieces were all standard parts of the run-and-gun. Intrusion 2 returns to these sensibilities, but combines them with a physics-based design. As a physics-based game, objects tumble and fall over each other, bend under weight, or are pushed back by gun fire. Everything interacts, and the result is quite intriguing. By combining the relentless action of the run-and-gun with physics-based interactions, Intrusion 2 is wildly chaotic, and extremely fun. You can take out enemies by shooting them, but you can also tumble a rock onto them, or blast apart the structure they are standing on. It's more open-ended then your typical run-and-gun, and this adds a layer of unpredictability that perfectly compliments the emphasis on action-packed craziness. Also, it's a weird example of a side-scrolling game that is actually better played with keyboard and mouse, as it's mouse-oriented targeting system is refreshingly accurate. At the same time, Intrusion 2 is just as relentless and explosive as any Contra or Metal Slug game. Ride and shoot on the back of a massive wolf that can leap over buildings, or snowboard down a mountain while robotic serpent dragons explode out of the ground, Intrusion 2 has the over-the-top action-movie aesthetic that is classic to the run-and-gun genre.\nIf you want a short, furious, overwhelming action game to play, Intrusion 2 is a pretty great pick. It's distinctive, but with a classic run-and-gun feel.\n","March 6","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The grab here is that most of the trappings in a level have physics to them, from the crates to suspended logs, that you can manipulate to your advantage.\n\nSounds like a solid idea on paper, but the first problem in the execution here is that the object physics do more harm than good. Their primary use is to shield you from fire, which is practically a requirement for survival in the second boss fight. Unfortunately, you have very little means of manipulating objects. You can only walk towards an object to push it, and shoot it to give it a little more momentum if needed. Crates and the like make effectivive means of cover, but only in a "heat-of-the-moment" kind of way. You could never plan out your own crate protection fort because you don't have enough control over objects to plan something like that. All of these moveable crates, as well as debris from defeated mechanical enemies,  start to pile up and have a tendency to block off ammo pickups or a paths.\n\nThroughout the game you can pilot other means of transport. There's an oversized wolf, a gunner mech, and a similar-looking mech but with a sword and claw that can grab and shoot things. The wolf controls are easily the worst in the game, featuring the inability to turn around fast and sudden stops for seemingly no reason. The mechs controls are more adequate and it does feel slightly empowering when you pilot them.\n\nThe game's sound design is flaccid. The levels' music is quick to loop and there's only the bare minimum for sound effects. The ninja-type enemies in one level had their own sound effect, but every other enemy is silent. Voice effects would have helped craft a unique personality to the mech enemies in the game. The soundtrack ramps up during boss fights, but the dearth of sound effects gives off a sense of emptiness.\n\nThe game ran sluggishly in full-screen mode. Only when I switched to windowed mode did it run at 30 fps, which it is apparently locked at. I'm not someone who thinks anything under 60 fps is unplayable but I find it odd that a game in such a face-pasted genre would restrict itself to 30 fps.\n\nOverall, the game is okay. It's a decent challenge and can produce some intense moments. Unfortunately, rather than top the likes of Metal Slug, it just makes me want to go play that instead.","May 19, 2014","false","3.7"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

It has amazing designs and some incredible looking bosses, a great sense of what made old 90ies arcade-games so über-ridculous and fun. It has a kickass-soundtrack, too. And lots of really cool ideas as well - in theory this should be one of the best games of it's kind.\n\nThere is just one little problem: physics. This could have been something like Metal Slug or classic Contra - but the physics ruin it all by adding a certain random element to a form of gameplay that since the olden days of Arcade-yore demands precision and perfect control. As a result the entire game doesn't behave in the way one would expect and becomes extra-frustrating when you get stuck in another crate or when all kinds of objects land on your ammo-pick up or Health-pack preventing you from getting them in time and thus failing your mission for no acceptable reason. It's "random and fun"-approach gets old rather quickly, trust me. There are infinte examples where the physics just keep the gameplay from achieving ultimate greatness - less would have been more in this case.\n\nAnother problem is the use of Flash. While it's certainly the most impressive flashgame I have ever seen, it is also capped at 30 frames per second - meaning the game feels sluggish and slow further adding to the whole "floatyness" and feeling of imperfection due to random physics. For every really cool moment this game has there are two equally frustrating bits where you either die by random stuff flying around or not being able to advance because you either need to clear out debris (by running into them or shooting them - there is no real pushing/dragging-mechanic as far as I know) or use objects to create platforms to jump to higher areas.These moments drag the game down, hinder the flow of the action and add nothing other than silly randomness that will be on your nerves once you start trying to take the game more serious. Especially in combination with rather long levels that aren't exactly all that varied it just becomes even more apparent that the inclusion of solid objects being subject to a physics engine was not a good idea or at least not an idea that has been really thought through.\n\nDue to this, I just cannot recommend this. Consider it an incredible techdemo that shows insane amounts of developer talent - but if you are looking for something "proper oldschool" it does not deliver. Particularly if you grew up on Turrican, Metal Slug or Contra/Probotector - avoid this! It may look the part, but it just doesn't play like it.","November 25, 2013","false","2.8"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","25","51","0","0"

It's a game that shows complete disrespect for basic game design. Instead of making a functional side scrolling 2D shooter, the developers instead tried to go with what looked cool. I'll give them credit, Intrusion 2 does look very cool. But it doesn't function well as a game at all. The physics objects (why the hell would you include stuff like this in your 2D shooter) are constantly getting in the way of you AND the enemies' shots. This wouldn't have been too bad if the developers didn't purposefully clutter every single area with boxes and barrels. And the barrels and boxes aren't the only ones that use physics. Pretty much everything that isn't nailed to the ground has these stupid physics. Including the ragdolls of those you kill. This makes moving around a PAIN. Oh yeah, lets talk about that for a moment. You move very sluggishly. This makes any sort of dodging hard as you usually won't be able to jump in time to get out of the way. At least you're bullets move fast right? Nope. The speed of the bullets is about a centimeter per second. Most bullets anyway. Because of the lack of velocity with the bullets, you're going to be missing a lot, because by the time they've arrived at their target, he's already 50 feet away in the air. Intrusion 2, as I stated previously, is a game whose developers have shown utter disrespect to the laws of game design. They could have made a really fun game, the core mechanics of Intrusion 2 are actually quite good. But they had to completely ruin it because they wanted to look cool. The game tries WAY too hard to be "cool". Oh look you can ride on a wolf oh look you're fighting a huge mech serpent after snowboarding down a mountain avoiding a grenadier's bombs LOOK HOW COOL THIS GAME IS!!!!11! When in reality no one cares. If your game is not fun because of it's mechanics people aren't going to care how good you make it look or how hard you try to be cool. Now if you want a game that's like Intrusion 2 but actually tries to... well.. be a GAME look at Capsized. Capsized is Intrusion 2 with infinitely better execution. Heck, it even looks cooler and doesn't need to throw it in your face constantly like Intrusion 2.","May 25, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","21"

The physical interactions with environmental objects are frustrating, and I was very often finding myself trying to wiggle my way into a pile of junk to pick up health or ammo that got buried, or even worse, trying to wiggle my way OUT of a pile of junk when I got trapped, pushing boxes out of the way, getting over trees and various physical obstacles, etc. The controls on the wolves/in mechs are AWFUL, so much that I didn't see any point in using them other than jumping higher/further with the wolf. The weapons are decent and varied, but all in all I'd say this is just a glorified generic internet flash game with presentable visuals and a very dull, uninspired, and even annoying soundtrack.

I am writing my first review and it makes me feel like I'm about to throw up. Not because of this group but because of the person that introduced me to it. They were one of my best friends but I did something to hut them and we are no longer friends and it makes me feel sick inside thinking about them. I screwed up and I feel so bad just thinking about all the things I did wrong. This person and I will never be friends again (no matter how much I want to and keep saying sorry) but some wounds never heal and thats something I've had to live with for these past couple weeks. Anyway this review is dedicated to them even if they don't take the time to read it .\n\nIntrusion 2 is a classic style run and gun platformer thingy. It harkons (I don't know if I spelled that right) back to the days where arcades where king and games like this were popular. It is in the vein of Contra and Super Metroid in the style of its gameplay. It is based on the original game Intrusion (which is a free to play flash game on the internet) that I have fond memories of. Back in my younger days (even though I am not that old) I used to play alot of flash games and this one stood out because it was extremely difficult for me at the time. My brothers would always challenge me to beat the first level (which I still haven't done yet but with my gaming skill now I probably could) and I would always fail. The character who we called red scarf man (for obvious reasons) always taunted me with his cool guns and supposed skill except when controlled by me which then he would become a running target that screamed "KILL MEEEEE!!!!"\n\nNow back on track. This game is AMAZING! it is $10 for 9 levels. It has a graphics style which to me seems like psuedo 3D and a physics engine. You start out parachuting into a snowy location and you can guess the rest (anyone but you, you kill). The game is infested with charm. Like most games now it has a silent protagonist (Red Scarf Man) which I would like to believe is like a super secret Russian agent (the game is Russian if you didn't know). I don't know the bad guys name but who cares they're bad guys you don't need to know their name all you have to do is shoot them. After progressing for a while you start to see the effects of the physics engine really shine. You can crush people with large rocks, land on them from great heights and hurt them push them off cliffs etc. You also get to ride wolves; YOU GET TO RIDE A FREAKIN GIANT WOLF WHILE RAINING BULLET HELL UPON BADDIES, HOW COOL IS THAT!! I have found a semi cool trick where you can manipulate the physics to get the wolf to run straight up a wall, but after that you get to the first boss fight which is a giant ship thing where *spoiler alert* you have to shoot its engines and cockpit (haha sex joke) until it blows up. Of course you have a giant array of kickass weapons to back you up like a railgun.\n\nThe next area (if I remember correctly) is a sort of skiing thing where you have to fight robot dragons that rain from the sky and bury in the snow. This part I had some trouble on because they would pop out of the snow at you (I wasn't paying much attention). Then after you dismember them you get to the water world part thingy. Here (if you want an achievement) can push people into the water where the mutant pirannas (something I'm also wondering if I spelled right) will promptly devour them. Seeing as how this saves you bullets I would reccomend it. Then after you gone through an enemy base you meet this giant gun weilding robot lady who proceeds to shoot at you. She goes through several stages of the fight including a disco ball laser rainbow reflection thing. After she is defeated you take her very overpowered gun and proceed to fire the rest of the laser so it burns a hole through a mountain to escape.\n\nAfter this you escape and you find mechs. The first of your choices is a sword mech, but as you go on you can get a machine gun mech with a rocket launcher and you go through the levelt\ feeling overpowered until you fight the weird cat robot thingies. It is not very difficult to beat them but your mech does have a limited amount of health so keep that in mind. But you should be fine.\n\nAfter this in my opinion the levels become slightly repetitive just a little until you reach the final area. I wont explain the end or the final boss cause It's something you have to experiene for yourself. But now its time for my final thoughts.\n\nIn conclusion I really loved this game. It does warrant a secong playthrough if your an acheivement hunter but i'm not. I've logged 37 hours into this game just replaying my favorite stages and trying to find all of the secrets. It is very strange to find an indie Russian game especially one that is this good. This game is a great throwback to those of you who enjoyed the old arcade style games. Even though I wasnt alive to experience the Golden Age of Arcades I can still appreciate this game. From a great price to engaging gameplay, guns, physics, and crap tons more I think this is a must buy to those of you who like a fast paced game with fun gameplay and great physics.\n\nIt has great gameplay, a good price, a kickass soundtrack, and a nice length but it could use some better option configuration and multiplayer because this game would greatly benefit from it.\n\nIn conclusion I give it a: 9/10","February 13, 2014","true","37.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Do you like Contra / Strider? Do you like shooting things so much them explode everywhere? Intrusion 2 is the game for you. At the time of this recommendation, I have only put a few hours into the game. Nevertheless, I doubt my opinion on the game will change. This game is fun. Period. Why?\n\n1. Gameplay:\nGameplay is fast and fun, and can be played with a controller or mouse and keyboard. The shooting mechanic is easy to understand and the guns to choose from are quite nice. Movement in the game is quite easy as well, but can be a bit strange at times (getting stuck under things and having to slowly move stuff to advance). Almost everything is interactable or moveable as well.                    4.5/5\n\n2. Graphics:\nFirst sentance up top; IT FEELS LIKE A FLASH GAME. Graphics are not great, but with games today, graphics usually don't matter. One thing to point out though; sometimes the character models limbs can move in weird ways. Only thing I found weird about it. I love the style the graphics give off, regardless if they are made with Flash.                  4/5\n\n3. Difficulty:\nNow I am not the best at side-scrollers, and I am not the best at contra, but dang, this game gets hard fast. First big boss lasts quite a long time but is easy to figure out, but the next boss could send you for a loop due to the controls and your lack of ammunition if you are running low. Inbetween boss fights however, the stages are challenging, but not brutal, besides some mini bosses.                                   4/5\n\n4. Sound:\nWOW! Awesome music. It gets your addrenaline pumping and gets you ready to fight whatever is ahead. Although it is nice, there seems to be a few tracks that loop a bit too much. Love the music, but not the same song over and over again. Still gets a perfect score due to how BADASS AND AWESOME THE MUSIC IS.                                  5/5\n\nOVERALL:\nI got this game for free in a contest, but, if I had played the demo of this, I would have definitely bought it. Awesome and fun game to take your stress out on.\n\nScore: 87.5%    B+","January 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Before this it was only really Half-Life 2 & Shadow of the Colossus that made me say "Wow... games can do this?"  Back when I was growing up and used to play Contra all the time... this is always how the game working in my head.  This game is how a modern Contra game should be.   I'm blown away that this game hasn't recieved more praise from people.  If there was justice in this world people would be finding a way to throw money at these people until they make a third game.\n\nThis game is literally just Contra being played in a world dominated by the wonky physics of flash bike trials games... with a dash of anime mecha action because it kicks ♥♥♥.  If you liked Contra ... buy this.... however DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER!  IT JUST SPOILS THINGS FOR YOU!  Buy it unseen!  That way you can experience all the coolness without knowing what to expect.  Easily the most awesome and intense boss fights I've ever had in a game... ever... period.  You'll likely end up like me... caught off guard, pleasantly surprised, and stuck with a constant grin on your face.  Later you'll come out of your stupor and wonder where the day went and why your face hurts.\n\nYou may want to wait till the game is on sale though since its a very short game and $10 is a bit steep for literally one sitting of playing.  Although given the experience it delivers I wouldn't have regretted if I payed the full $10.  Some people complained about the fact that the game is slow because its capped at 30 FPS... honestly I didn't even notice it.  I actually thought any slowness was just in my head due to being in the "zone."  Personally my only complaints about the game are that there is no "dash" or "run" ability you just always walk even when the circumstances CLEARLY deserve at least a concerned hussle.  Also the fact that, at least on 1920 x 1080 full screen, the graphics look pretty pixelated.  The backgrounds are very nice looking but unfortunately they help to make the sprite graphics pixelation more noticeable.  Some antialiasing of some kind would really help the sprites.\n\nAll in all its a must play.  Its a shame that other games don't seem to be taking the awesome stuff from this and incorporating it.","September 24, 2013","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

You are Scarfman, and you must kill a bunch of random people and robot things to win at life. The story is downright non-exsistant but the game is fun enough to power through that and power it does. The weapons all have a use, usually sitting around waiting for a robot or fire-ballon and all feel right as you blast past a wide range of bosses and enemies.\n\nThough it's not always the most fun when a mechsuit slides in and is throwing everything in the room at you. The difficulty is mouse-eatingly high at any given time and trust me when I say you DO NOT want to take a break as the levels are very long and checkpoints reset if you close the game. Bosses are a good fun to fight when each one has it's own way of doing things, but you will die, a lot, as in this is the 2D sci-fi shooter version of Darksouls without as a many exploits.\n\nI had fun with it, and I think anyone else could. 7/10","May 17, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Playing this right after finishing Capsized makes me think of the huge differences between them, and both are very good games. Intsusion 2 is very much like Metal Slug for those who are famaliar with it, except that this is a keyboard/mouse game, which is a disadvantage if you want to play with ease on gamepads. Several things make this game special: first is that projectiles are slow, which gives the player more immersive gameplay because you get to play on your reactions and technique, and not memorization. Second is the physics engine makes everything tangible, so player actually feels the "shape" of evey object on the screen when the figure they control goes side by side with enemies or crates.\n\nControl is responsive, more bonus. The only shortcomings are probably that the graphics not very smooth.\n\n7/10.\n\n*UPDATE* Just finished this game and I especially want to praise the detail this game had shown me throughout the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/214970/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I still remember when Flash games blew up on sites like Newgrounds, opening the doors to all kinds of small-scale platformers, puzzlers, and more. The most popular ones were always those that took the animation system to its limits, creating smooth, detailed movements out of roughly-pixellated limbs and parts. Intrusion 2 is very much a game in that vein, with a lot of attention paid to its look, and not a lot paid to its balance.\n\nYou play some Strider-looking fellow on an unarticulated crusade to kill lots and lots of of dudes on some snowy mountain. The controls are the common WASD to move and mouse to aim your hilariously flexible arms, but there's solid controller support here that I found to work much better. You start with but a pistol but soon come across weapons like an SMG, beam cannon, and grenade launcher. You'll need them, too, because the soldiers and robots of Intrusionland can take a lot of punishment.\n\nWhat complicates this otherwise simple setup is the physics. Everything that isn't part of the landscape is affected by physics, including crates, boulders, weapons, enemies, and you. Killing soldiers ragdolls them, sometimes in really funny ways like when jetpack guys limply careen off into space. Blowing up robots or crates leaves debris you can kick around or stack. And of course, there are heavy rocks and such to push onto your foes. Areas can be pretty dense with objects, leading to literal piles of corpses or mountains of scrap metal.\n\nI bet that sounds like fun, but sadly Intrusion 2 is not designed to make the most of the chaos you can sow. The physics system is one of the older, twitchier ones that can make objects explode off of each other just by intersecting the wrong way. While that can be funny, it isn't when they trap you between crates, or launch you into tough enemies, or fail to work as platforms when crossing pirhana-infested waters. Enemies can do tons of damage very quickly since there are no invincibility frames, and checkpoints are entirely too far apart. I had to repeat one section almost half a dozen times because I kept getting glitched into boulders or knocked into guys with machine guns who just lay on the triggers.\n\nThere's so much cool stuff in here like riding wolves and fighting helicopters with arms, but the shoddy design of the encounters and the unpredictable physics make them more frustrating than anything. Your wolf, for example, is fully articulated which makes it look amazing in motion. However, its stride is dependant on its animation, so it can get stuck in platforms or take like eight tries to scale a wall because the limbs just aren't hitting the right places. And enemies are more than happy to blow you clean off of it with rapid-fire or hitscan weapons if you get hung up on anything.\n\nIt's a game built on precision that doesn't give you the control to be precise when you need it. Shootouts can be intense and rewarding, until you slip on a loose crate and your foes get a dozen free shots on you. Bosses are infuriating, with tight patterns that must be followed on top of whatever debris that has accumulated. I made it about halfway through the game before giving up, getting one-shotted by an unseen enemy with a grenade launcher after passing a platforming section over floating barrels that took me multiple tries. Intrusion 2 might look great but it feels terrible to play, and as we all know, looks only get you so far.","February 8","false","1.1"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","16","34","0","0"

It was done completely by 1 guy, which is impressive, the art style is interesting (if a little goofy at times), and the music can be pretty driving until you've heard them loop a dozen times.\n\nThe boss fights are pretty cool, except they are basically impossible the first time through. You will lose repeatedly until you figure out the bosses' patterns.This may be the generally accepted mechanic for games like this, but I've always found it frustrating.\n\nThe levels are very well-done, and are noticeably different each time. There are even little mini-levels where you're sliding down a snow-covered slope, which are a blast.\n\nThe controls are serviceable with a 360 controller, and I've heard they're good with keyboard+mouse too. Sometimes, though, they genuinely get in the way, and the way the wolf moves is inherently weird. It works, though.\n\nThe game is also rather short. I enjoyed it for the most part (other than dying 20+ times in the final boss alone. Frustrating to the max), but it's fun if you enjoy mindless side-scrolling shooters.\n\nThe game is at it's best when you are frantically trying to dodge one enemy's bullets while shooting another. It's at it's worst when you're trying to time precision jumps or dodge boss projectiles, and the controls get in the way.\n\nIf you use a 360 controller, I STRONGLY recommend you unbind the jump key from the analog stick, or you'll be jumping over and over and over and over and over when you never wanted to. I used LB instead, and left RB to cycle through weapons.","January 21, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Even for 10, I wouldn't say you're getting massively ripped off. I do think the graphics are nice, a lot of the game brings me back to the snow level from Contra and that's some good nostalgia. It's a 2D side scrolling shooter, so you should be prepared to get some frustrating sections, but the difficulty isn't too unforgiving. The physics do work against you sometimes, but I really enjoy the nonsensical moments that pop up with the physics, and I can't stay mad at the game for that.\n\nFor the people saying it's a flash game, yes, it is. What's the big deal? Should all flash games be free? Shouldn't some people be compensated for their good work? I don't really see why people keep bringing that up as a knock against the game.

It's flashy (heh heh... it's made in Flash, also...), it's bold, and it's fun as hell. It's difficult. It's rewarding. Sometimes, it's downright frustrating. But it's an amazing game.\n\nThe pacing is top-notch, the game successfully funneling you through dozens upon dozens of enemies, mini-bosses, and tough as hell big bad boss baddies, while keeping you entertained with unique landscapes and new weapons. The level variety is good, with a couple missions having you restricted in various ways.\n\nThere's no real story to speak of, but that's alright: you don't need to know anything except you're a badass hero, you have an array of awesome guns, and you've got to kill all the things you see. The soundtrack, however, is top-notch; full of overdriven electric guitar and crazy riffs, you'll never stop jamming out as you unload thousands and thousands of bullets into enemies.\n\nThe whole package leads up to one of the best boss fights and one of the best levels I have ever had the fortune to play through, culminating in a long, difficult (but not unfair) boss fight against an enemy unlike anything you've faced yet.\n\nIntrusion 2 isn't on many people's radars, and that's a shame. Do yourself a favor and pick this up as soon as you can if you want a roller coaster ride of adrenaline, shooting, and great music. The game can be a little janky in spots, but it more than makes up for it. It's not too long, it's not too short, and it never bores you.\n\n8/10 Bullets","December 24, 2012","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

(Requires 360 pad or mouse) It's a platforming shooter with similarities to Metal Slug and Contra, but with physics based gameplay. Your affinity for this game is likely based on whether or not you like physics based games. Personally, I don't think it melds that well when a shooter requires skillful aiming, dodging and timing, yet you may get hit because you couldn't get around enemy/level debris or get hit while jumping a bullet because you expected you can dodge it - instead the enemy actually compensates for where you where while moving. With a Metacritic of 80, most people would probably disagree with me. I don't care too much for the low quality metal (I appreciate the effort). BG graphics are good, but I don't care for player/enemy/object sprites.

The logistics of the best way to fight enemies gives me a headache. You have to look where you are shooting to hit things while looking at where you are to avoid getting hit which is impossible for the brain/eyes to handle. Compare this to Contra where you don't really need to try to aim much and mostly just concentrate on dodging. Another thing is that everything blends together visually. Everything is just a mess of colours and you don't know whether it is an enemy, projectile, or crate unless you are directly looking at it. Games like this usually use some sort of system so that everything can be quickly identify based on colour. Also the music is really obnoxious. Everything about this game is really annoying and is an absolute pain to play. Did the game devs just not understand very basic concepts like flow and game feel?\n\nSome games are fun to play, some games are boring, some games are poorly designed and unplayable. This game is somehow in a new category that is functional but mentally painful to play.

The inclusion of physics based controls are a terrible choice in a contra style shooter. Also the final Bosses move set seems to be on a RNG set of moves.   the sound track is good for the first 5-10 minutes then it just loops and becomes grating on the ears. Also the auto swtich weapons on pick up (that you cant turn off) has gotten me killed so many times. Also the inclusion of a pin point laser gun and the gernade launcher are just plain terrible. They are both weak as can be and like i said the floaty controls make these weapons usless. OVERALL i can not recommed this game not even if its a dollar or less it is just a bad game.

You shoot enemies, pick up weapons, and shoot more enemies.  The game is challenging, like old school arcade games are, making you work fairly hard to get through each level, and there is no health regenerating mechanism so you can easily die if you're not careful but there are checkpoints in each level to respawn at.  The level design is pretty good but nothing that is very exciting, which is what I would consider to be the only minor downside of the game.  What I enjoyed the most are the boss fights.  They can be frustrating to play, but when you beat them it feels incredibly rewarding.  It is a pretty short game, but I would recommend playing this title.\n\nAs an interesting note, this game was made by just one peson.","June 23, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But while that feature is certainly its biggest strength, it is also the game's most obvious downfall. Nobody can deny the innovation that the physics play brings to the table in this genre. Environments can be influenced to craft the various battlefields around the player's needs and to bring doom to enemies in all sorts of hilarious ways. It wouldn't be a far cry to honor the game by calling it the Half-Life 2 among sidescrolling shooters.\n\nOn the other hand though, the physics feature doesn't influence the gameplay as deeply as it is the case in Valve's masterpiece, and it doesn't work quite as smoothly either. In fact, more often than not, the imprecise use of the laws of motion, paired with the ever-present low gravity feel to it, can go a long way toward ruining the momentum of an otherwise solid bullet fest.\n\nAside from that, however, Intrusion 2 offers everything you'd want from the genre: numerous enemy types, that have to be taggled in different ways, a couple of different stages, various difficulty settings and, perhaps most importantly, thrilling boss battles. The soundtrack, as repetitive as it may be, does a good job of intensifying the action mood. If there is anything the game does lack, it's probably a bit of variety in regard to the artistic design of the different levels.\n\nConsidering the price, Intrusion 2 is a solid sidescrolling shooter with a bit of a twist, that unfortunately doesn't quite manage to live up to its potential, but that should be fun to fans of the genre regardless. 7/10","June 21, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A good attempt at a great idea, but it got old fast for me. The physics routinely become a pain in the ♥♥♥ with somewhat arbitrary behavior and giant piles of detritus which bury things you want to reach and are hard to climb around on. The whole game feels floaty and the weapons are largely anemic little things with projectiles that waft gently through the air and barely offer any feedback on whatever they do manage to hit; sound design is pretty poor, including decent but way, way too short music loops. Level 1's boss is absolutely fantastic, but level 2's boss was annoying, and level 3's boss drove me to give up and uninstall the game. The most fun I had with it was piloting a mech equipped with a grappling arm and a big sword; they probably could have made a more solid game just out of that idea. It's alrightish overall I guess, if you're more patient than I am with 10-minutes-at-a-time boss fights, or many, many attempts at them when said boss just bumps you off a cliff to your immediate death.

Intrusion 2 is a nice little glimpse into the really hard to beat 2D action past of gaming, with awesome, huge bosses (beating Intrusion 2's final boss is one of the hardest things I've ever accomplished in my life in my opinion, and I have a college degree, so that should give you a pointer about the epic hardness here).\n\nJSB out!","July 29, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not concerned about plot, length or an upgrade system-- it's just two or three hours of fantastic gameplay ideas.  I could not stop smiling at all the crazy stuff in this game. The physics are bizarre but the game is all the better for it. This takes all the fun elements of Metal Slug and Contra and leaves the frustrating bits that were only there in the first place to make sure you fed as many quarters into the machine as possible. Part of the fun of Metal Slug and Contra is having two players, which is not supported in this game.

Those kinds of physics that make boxes fly everywhere when you shoot them. This is might make/break this game for you. On one hand- you'll love when you balance those boxes just right to climb over an obstacle or use as improvised cover. On the other hand you're going to hate when you lose health after being hit by a random box, or when you cant collect a pickup or activate something because a box is ontop of it. I personally, think it adds to the game. The game is designed around it, with the right weapons and keeping an eye on your surrondings you can use the physics to your advantage. It also adds a degree of random to the game so you're always thinking on your toes.\n\nAs for the rest of the game; it plays like a modern Contra with a dash of amazing. Challenging, a variety of weapons, epic bosses. Mech suits, Wolves you can ride on, a health bar, animations based on physics, depleting ammo and EPIC BOSSES! Truly some of the best boss design Ive ever seen. Its Run n Gun to the power of awesome. If the physics dont put you off- I strongly recommend you at least try it.

I really like it.\nWith keyboard and mouse the controls often feel like they are more in your way than there to help you play the game. But having plugged in a good gamepad with sticks for aiming the guns in Intrustion, I've been having a blast!\n\nThe music is sometimes a bit like water torture, but just try not to stay in the same area too long. If the music starts to drive you insane, then take that as a hint that you've been sucking and have spent too long in the same section of the level. =)\n\nThe physics are a little bogged down, but thats quickly forgiven once you get used to having physics at all in a game like this! It's really cool to blast a bridge out of your way with your gun, or to bend the trees over and push things around. But all this trash all over the ground is as much a bother as it is fun to kick around.\n\nOverall, I'd give intrustion an endearing 7/10, on my way back to play it some more =)","January 4, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The background music can get repititve but the metal score fits nicely  with the gameplay. I'm not so great with sidescrollers and I was doing ok in this so despite that fact, . I'm not sure if this will be all that difficult for hardore sidescrollers. The sound effects are good and sync well with the weaponry available. It uses the checkpoint system for saves which is less than ideal but inevitably the game's difficulty (and potential tediousness) will be increased. I've only found 3 weapons so far so I'm  hoping to find a lot more. A decent amount of the environment is destructable but I've yet to encounter a situation where I got stuck as a result of being able to blow up things around me. The graphics aren't spectacular but are serviceable and certainly aren't retro which is all the rage with the kids these days. The game design reminded me a bit of the old Psygnosis games you could get for the Amiga and Atari ST which were  sort of ahead of their time. I got the game via a bundle, but I believe the regular price is only $10 and therefore worth the investment if you enjoy sidescrollers.","February 5, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs on a ragdoll physics engine and never drops in frame rate. Biggest problem is the physics themeselves, they like to get in the way and make everything feel awkward and in the way at times.

A good attempt at a great idea, but it got old fast for me. The physics routinely become a pain in the ♥♥♥ with somewhat arbitrary behavior and giant piles of detritus which bury things you want to reach and are hard to climb around on. The whole game feels floaty and the weapons are largely anemic little things with projectiles that waft gently through the air and barely offer any feedback on whatever they do manage to hit; sound design is pretty poor, including decent but way, way too short music loops. Level 1's boss is absolutely fantastic, but level 2's boss was annoying, and level 3's boss drove me to give up and uninstall the game. The most fun I had with it was piloting a mech equipped with a grappling arm and a big sword; they probably could have made a more solid game just out of that idea. It's alrightish overall I guess, if you're more patient than I am with 10-minutes-at-a-time boss fights, or many, many attempts at them when said boss just bumps you off a cliff to your immediate death. I'd have to give it something like a 6/10.","December 27, 2012","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a little more difficult than alot of modern games, but the challenge is welcome and fair, although some of the boss fights can seem a bit lengthy.  Speaking of boss fights, while there are only 3, they are extremely fun and well crafted, probably the most memorable part of the game.  Riding wolves and piloting mechs in addition to the arsenal and enemies makes this game a blast.  The physics are a little wonky, but it makes for some really interesting gameplay.  Its short tho, took me 6 hours with quite a few retries on the final boss.

The only things which would qaulify it as a game is progression and the boss battles. Otherwise, expect wading through tons of 'trash mobs' to get to the exciting parts, because most of the handful of levels are filler. Playing as a mech or fighting the 'stalker' chracters makes the game an insanely fun tech toy. And the boss battles are entirely worth a recommendation. But the game is not paced well, so that you go from 'epic' to 'slog' in a few seconds, and the boss battles never really achieve the epic craziness of, say, Metal Slug.\n\nThe mech play, stalkers, and boss battles make it worth a playthrough, but it doesn't feel like a game to me.

There's quite a bit of enemy variety and at times the game makes you feel like a true action hero (think Just Cause 2 combined with Metal Gear Solid, except in 2D). Sadly it's virtually unplayable in fullscreen mode due to the cursor lagging and warping all over the place and the characters going into slow mo' whenever the screen moves an inch. You can get around this by playing in windowed mode but you can't change the game resolution while doing this so you're stuck with a really small screen unless you change your desktop resolution to 640x480.\n\nAnother small gripe would be that the higher difficutly level is locked. Why make us play the game before we can play it on the settings we want. Although in retrospect the game was quite difficult as it is and you don't have to play the game through all the way on normal before unlocking the harder difficulty level so I suppose it's not too bad.\n\nI'd say if you liked Abuse then you'll like this one assuming you don't mind working around the aforementioned issues concerning lag. I'd like to think that my computer can run a 2D game quite well without resorting to the steps I mentioned so the game is likely poorly optimized but still plays well enough considering it's been made by one man on his own.","February 18, 2013","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's quite a bit of enemy variety and at times the game makes you feel like a true action hero (think Just Cause 2 combined with Metal Gear Solid, except in 2D). Sadly it's virtually unplayable in fullscreen mode due to the cursor lagging and warping all over the place and the characters going into slow mo' whenever the screen moves an inch. You can get around this by playing in windowed mode but you can't change the game resolution while doing this so you're stuck with a really small screen unless you change your desktop resolution to 640x480.\n\nAnother small gripe would be that the higher difficutly level is locked. Why make us play the game before we can play it on the settings we want. Although in retrospect the game was quite difficult as it is and you don't have to play the game through all the way on normal before unlocking the harder difficulty level so I suppose it's not too bad.\n\nI'd say if you liked Abuse then you'll like this one assuming you don't mind working around the aforementioned issues concerning lag.
