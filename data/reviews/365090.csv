The rest of my game time was spent unlocking all maps and characters. So this game can be completed in less than 2 hours! It's local multiplayer only. I don’t know anyone that does that, so even adding the feature is a waste. It would have been an amazingly fun true multiplayer game though!\n\nThere are 4 different areas to battle on; most of them are similar and smaller in nature so the actual map means little. The gameplay isn't bad if not pretty repetitive. There are some fun power-ups that add some excitement to the matches such as shields, bombs and more!\n\nThere are around 30 different characters; 20 which you must unlock during single player campaign. Each map has 5 players to unlock and that equates to 2-3 matches per player unlock. It's almost grindy since there is such limited content.\n\nOverall, this isn’t as fun as a real snowball fight. The AI doesn't make this game dynamic enough to keep playing for hours on end. Once you complete the campaign you will be done forever.\n\nWorth $1-2. This is a short single player game.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Free for all and team modes also exist. Powerups, new maps, and characters become unlocked as you win more matches. Powerups include shields, heals, invulnerability, and various types of explosives!\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nEasy to pick up\nQuick games (a few minutes each)\nDifficulty settings for the AI\nAchievements\n\nCons:\nLuck is sometimes a factor as powerups will spawn next to your opponents\nPowerups seem to favor spawning near your opponents (not random?)\nNo online play\nRepetitive after a while\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n\nGreat pick up for the price. However, limited replayability due to the nature of the game so far.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations  here","November 29, 2015","true","0.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","17","24","5","0"

Great little party game if you have multiple controllers(also works with keyboard and mouse) and others to play with. Even fun as a single player game against the AI. Has free for all and team based combat. Cute graphics, solid gameplay and easily worth the asking price. Could have more arena's and I really wish it had online multiplayer - which might be coming!
