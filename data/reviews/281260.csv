"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparticusjoe/recommended/281260/","Sparticusjoe","Orsonposter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparticusjoe/","315 products in account","First let me get this out of the way: I've played this for probably an hour, despite what steam's weird gametime tracking thing says. I've played it on a few different computers which is probably why it says I've played it for such a short time.\n\nSecondly: This is probably the second worst game I've gotten on Steam, the worst obviously being Air Control.\n\nIn Desert Gunner, you're a guy manning a turret. In the desert. That's literally it. The "multifacited levels" the game description promises is really just one level where your convoy drives slowly in a straight line and you shoot at things.\n\nUnlike some of the great turret shooters out there (Beachhead 2002, lookin' at you buddy), in this one you'll have NO clue weather or not you're actually hitting anything. You fire and fire and fire and no visible damage or anything happens. Then your'e dead. Start the level over again. But when you start the level over again you won't be able to tell because the whole level is a straight line.\n\nYou can switch between guns with the WASD keys, not that the game tells you that. Also, when you start the game up, the three green dots that are offscreen on the main menu are actually "options", "credits", and "exit" respectively. You simply won't be able to read them because the game, on all three computers I've tested it on, the game insists on running on a non-native, non supported resolution.\n\nI've tried it on a 4:3 monitor where it started in 16:9, and a 16:9 where it started in 4:3. No idea why that is, but worth noting: You won't be able to read half the main menu items.\n\nIf you're a gun-nut such as myself, you might be interested in reading the technical specs the game has on all the weaponry you'll be using. You'll be significantly less interested when you find out that most of them are downright incorrect, and all of them are wirtten in text with font so small that you can't read them.\n\nAll in all, don't waste your dollar. It's not even fun to laugh at like Air Control, it's just a mess. The developer put three seconds of effort into this, so you should treat them similarly.","June 22, 2014","false","2.9"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","34","35","0","0"

It is buggy, bad sounds (rockets sound like fireworks, machine guns sound like peas being dropped on a plate), graphics are good compared to other aspects, animations and models are just horrible. The second "rail-FPS" i played this year. The first one was Rambo: The Video Game. I think that Deser Gunner > Rambo. So thumbs up for that.","May 19, 2014","true","0.4"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","19","6","31","3","0"

The game was officially released Dec 31 2006, but the game is one of the best you could probably find. It takes skill, patience, and the capability to enjoy yourself. The game is amazing, and out of 5, I'd honestly rate this game a 6. It is top of the line, without a doubt.\n\nI truly recommend everyone to buy the game, seeing as the price is amazing too!","March 19, 2014","true","70.5"," 242 of 3,177 people (8%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","8","242","3","4","167"

My itch to beat every game I start has damned me once again.\n\nThe AI is atrocious even for their simple, menial existence. The graphics are laughable. The levels are the same boring stretch of highway for 20 missions and the machineguns sound worse then cap-guns and half-inflated whoopie-cushions.\n\nI bought this for 50 cents, and I should have saved it for the vending machine in my workplace breakroom. I can't believe the chaps who made Beachhead crapped out this pre-alpha of a "Finished" product.","February 19, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could likely get a Windows 98 PC and a game for it cheaper than this is AND it be better quality than this. This game is one of the poorest I've had the misfortune to play, how they plan to sell it at $4.99 is outrageous! They clearly need to move a decimal over to $.49 but it still isn't worth that or the 84 MB it stores on your computer. Definitely not worth it for a game that has the most choppy graphics I've seen on Steeam, poor controls, etc. Many regard ET for the 2600 as the worst game but this sure comes close.","June 7, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Considering it is a 2006 title the graphics are not bad and it runs smoothly. The real issue is the lack of introduction or instruction. The first mission you are immediately being attacked. I figured out that you can shoot the primary weapon with left mouse button and usually a machine gun with right mouse, also you can switch between units in your convoy with up and down. Are there any other controls? I don't know.\n\n6/10 buy for a dollar.","September 21, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
