So I bought it on Steam to to preserve until the end of time...\n\nThis game is absolutely fantastic! This is a RTS game but basically you take control mostly 4-5 soldiers per missions. So it is commando like and more tactic than gathering resources and build build and train troops... You always have to focus on the mission objective and you can solve any way you want to get the job done. Maybe this sentence as an example will be a bit spoiler so I warned you: the mission is to destroy 2 battery guns, you have 4 soldiers against lot of enemies, you can easily sneak to the first battery gun and instead you blow it you can use to take out the other gun on the other side of the map rather fight your way through the enemy... then just blow the first one and get out.\n\nSpoiler ends.\n\nIf you start with only handguns, kill a few enemy and take their weapons. There are 4 campaigns, each with 4-5 missions. If you preserve your troops from the beginnig, you can use the same troops on the following maps with the same inventory. Note however, the American campaign a bit different.. and if anytime you screw the map and have to restart a mission you loose your own man and will get default troops. So keep saves on different slots.\n\nYou can destroy anything if you have the correct weapon in your hand or under your a+s+s... Oh, you dont have tank, kill its crew then repair and use it. Your tank have run out of ammo, neutralize another one (dont blow it) and take its ammunation. You dont have AT weapons but there are strong vehicles in your way? hmm.. you have molotov cocktail! Aim at the engines and watch the firework! Use covers all the time, lean from edges or just lure the enemy out from a field with lighting fire. Are you surrounded with enemy troops, blow a hole in the wall and escape. There are 50+ enemy heavy tanks, you have katyusha......\n\nDo you like write history again? Then you are a Hero of World War 2.","November 2, 2014","true","1.3"," 58 of 60 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","58","60","3","1"

It is fully in 3d and you control soldiers, cannons and armor to complete your Commandos-like mission. In every map you are outnumbered at least 10 to 1 and it is a pure joy to defeat the enemy with these odds. Many things are interactive, like railroad switches, blowing up bridges and buildings (it has great physics), burning down forests (with matches) to flush the enemy. It has a ridiculous amount of units types anything from a tiny motorcycle to a king tiger and lots of weapons such as mp44, panzershreck, and mg42. You can heal soldiers and repair tanks and even strip weapons from them (you can grab a 50 cal from an american jeep and walk around Rambo-like).\n\nI've had a blast with this game and what makes it even better is that the sequels such as Men of War are even better. I give it 8.5/10 , you should try it. (Note: This is a Russian made game so it may be brutal difficulty-wise. I recommend you start on Easy mode).","September 27, 2014","true","486.4"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

At one time there was a breakthrough on many points, such as graphics, physics, gameplay, and even now, eleven years later, it looks worthily. This is the main index of the living classics. It never gets old.\nNow about the pluses, a sizeable number of which we have.\nLet's start with campaigns. It’s four of them with 5-6 missions each. Given the fact that each map  will take at least 3-4 hours of game time, we heve more than 80 hours for the first walkthrough. It all depends on your natural talent, skills and patience. Plus, the mission completely replayable.You can always try the other, unbeaten way. Can, and will likely want to, because the number of possible tactics is huge. It is not my first strategy, neither the second, and I know that the starting missions of the campaign is usually takes you by the hand by its plot and slowly show all mechanics and the perspective of easy victories. «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» from the start makes it clear, that you are in a meat grinder, to get out of that and, even more to win, will be not that easy. It gives you to understand the responsibility of choice and the value of human life. You can not throw units lives. Firstly there are few of them, but number of enemies, waiting for you is incalculable. You start first map of the campaign with one tank, one armored vehicle and two foot soldiers. And that's all. You need to calculate every move, to act covertly, gently, and then maybe, I repeat, maybe, you will win. And that, for a moment, in the first map, which is usually taught to build barracks. No construction, by the way. And that's great, because not everyone is interested in building “Theme park” in the game about World War II. If you, comrade, like to focus on killing enemies, rather than taking care of flowerbeds, then “Soldiers” just for you.\nThe visual component, as I said in a brief introduction, is good even now. It does not hurt the eyes, and sometimes even surprising. And this, for a moment, in 2004. I remember this year. Then released “Warhammer: Dawn of War” and “Rome: Total War”. So «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» looks on par, and in some places handicaps such titans as above. Especially impressive is destructible, and the ability to use anything and everything that is on the map. Want to swim in the water, want to hide behind a haystack, want to bring down a monument to Stalin with the tank (i did). And you can do this and much more. The map has no blind spots. All that you see is interactive. You can damage, destroy and explode practically everything. No vehicles scale of lives, as a plus. Vehicles are divided into components, each of which is also interactive. Shot down a caterpillar, as a result, the tank is not going anywhere, hit the tank’s turret, and it will never shoot more. At least until you repair it. Yes, you can repair vehicles parts. As i said, fully interactive.\nBut the biggest bonus is inventory for any unit. Yes, yes and vehicles too, which by the way is stuffed by a crew of 2 or more people, fully playable and with their own inventory too, of course. Other words, playing «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» you control all! So the game will be interesting not only for hardcore strategy fans, but roleplayers too. And direct control mode will attract shooter fans. In other words, it is almost for everyone. But there is one limitation - not for the faint of heart. If you want a jaunt or a Pulp Fiction, this is not the case. «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» - is James Joyce of RTS.\n«Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» as delayed onset muscle soreness. Yes, it hurts, but that's okay, because you know that pain makes you stronger. After all, what is the life without a challenge.\n","November 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

I had a couple of issues where you get the objective to get to the point X, the game never tells you where it is.\n\nBut I like it.\nIt's gameplay is a mix of XCOM and WW2 with surprising attention to details, such as physics, weakpoints on tanks and enviroment destruction..\n\nFor example, once I ended up having to fight a heavy scout car, that was impervious to small arms fire. Ofc I had no AT weapons, so I hoarded a bunch of HE grenades on one guy and spammed them at the scout car to see what happens.\nIt's tires blew up on one side and the moment the last tire flew off, whole vehicle flipped over to that side, rendering it useless.\n\nBuildings can be destroyed in a manner similar to Battlefield Bad Company 2, but much simpler. You can colapse them with tanks and most armored vehicles, sometimes a really too tactic to surprise attack a tank is to move behind the building trough which the enemy cant see you, boo! You're within 20 meters of the tank (preferably the backside).\n\nEven though it has its flaws and the resolution support is a bit wonky, I have never played a more complex and realistic WW2 RTS. And yes, I have played CoH 1 (much simpler vehicle system) and 2 ("butthurt" button spam) and neither come close to this game.\n\n8/10 - Had to take off some points for horrid voiceacting and badly done campaign. But the gameplay itself is stellar. Just take note, some key's cannot be changed (use macro keys on your keyboard for these) and the default keybindings aren't meant for a human being with two hands.","September 5, 2014","true","19.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elaintahra/recommended/11480/","elaintahra","elaintahra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elaintahra/","199 products in account","I highly recommend trying this game out even if it is old. This game is by far better than anything else we have found (as of january 2016) in terms of 2-4 player co-op WW2 micromanagement of squad level.\n\nYou start out with one or few soldiers (and maybe a vehicle or two). Each soldier, gun and vehicle has it own inventory. Soldiers have stamina and health. Vehicles have each part as a component that can break and an inventory for ammo and other stuff, for example repair kit. Soldiers have primary weapon and a secondary slot (can have multiple of each if inventory has space).  Between and during the fighting you spend time looting for ammo, guns and explosives, repairing vehicles. For example a track can get blown off of your tank and you will have to get a repair kit out and try to fix it maybe under fire. Tanks and big guns have their own caliber so you have to check the ammo you find. Your vehicles have fuel and it can run out. In that case you can take a Jerry can or an oil barrel and loot fuel from other vehicles. You can complete missions in many different ways; for example there is a tank that has its crew outside smoking cigarettes? take the crew out and steal their tank.\n\nVehicles have slots for driver, gunner, loader, commander and you can also sit guys on top of the tank. If you have less than full crew in a tank, you can't for example drive at the same time when they load the gun and so on.\n\nYou can lay mines against tanks and against infantry and you can find a mine detector. You can find pistols, assault rifles, grenades, smoke grenades, bazookas, submachine guns, machine guns, normal rifles and sniper rifles and there is lots of variety on them. Each soldier also has 'skill' on how well they can use specific weapons (that little white dot or two above the gun). You can loot machine guns from tanks and also replace that damn Bren on the british ones with MG-42 if you want. You can mount a field gun or a Nebelwerfer you find and use it to shoot indirect fire.\n\nYou can drive all vehicles by either clicking on where they should go, or even better (This is the best part of the game), you can press CTRL and control the vehicle directly (or soldiers for that matter). Driving a tank around and shooting is VERY satisfying feeling. All buildings also crumble when you shoot them with HE shots or AT grenades. You have to select AP ammo when trying to take out a tank, or you could throw an AT grenade or Molotov cocktail on the engine. Everything is thought out and just works.\n\nMissions are often quite hard and unforgiving; There is no save possibility within the missions. You can (and should!) have Fog of war on to have more realistic gameplay. Missions take 15 mins to 2 hours depending on the playstyle. You start most of the time with only few soldiers and few clips of ammo and your task is "ambush the convoy" or "destroy enemies in town". Normally your soldiers have revive kit of three charges to help out a bit.\n\nWe play LAN over internet by using Hamachi and it works perfectly well.\n\nThis game also has very few bugs, I don't remember seeing more than one or two in 11 years of playing.\n\nYou have 4 single player campaigns as well as CO-OP campaign missions but you also have more game styles, such as Deathmatch, Assault, Escort (don't remember all).\n\nIn addition you have domestic animals such as cows and chicken. You can give out your soldiers to your co-op partner and vice versa. You can accidentally light yourself on fire. You can swim over rivers or lakes, you can drown in swam.","January 19","true","39.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

If you've played Men of War (any of them) think of a much smoother flowy system with what I believe to be better sounds in game. This is the OG, all of the Men of War games (except Battle of Empire) content came straight from this game, but this game did it best. Campaign has a perfect story mode and missions. Instead of a multi-layered "attack this" mission like on the AS campaign, this game has good stealth, challenging attacks, and all other sorts of goodies for you to enjoy. With several campaigns with at least 6 missions each, and I believe it was 7 Bonus Missions for you to play with this game provides hours of enjoyment. I believe there is only one grip I have with the game and that's the lack of an editor, however I can forgive that because this is the first in the series.\n\n9/10 - 10 Scale\n\n90 - PC Gamer Rating Scale\n\n1/1 - My Rating Scale\n\nEdit: MAKE SURE YOU RUN IN COMPATABILITY MODE!!

Firstly the AI is totally brain dead, it often won't respond to commands or go the wrong way if you order them to go somewhere, this forces you use direct control most of the time (mainly for vehicles). And this brings me to my second reason, the camera movement is really limited and makes it frustrating as you are forced to play at weird angles and this limitation really bugs me. There are plenty of good MOW games to enjoy, just not this one. (side note! if you still bought the game and it crashes on launch, run it in comparability mode, that should fix the launch issue)","February 20, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","1"

Heck, its my favorite RTS ever! The single player campaign proves to be a bit of a challenge, but it just makes it alot more fun and more satisfying once you've beaten it. With all of your moves, you have a sense of urgency hoping your soldiers don't get shot up as they move from cover to cover. The multiplayer matches are definetly alot of fun, and you can even play by yourself to get the hang of things. You can test out all of the vehicles and troops for each of the four countries. The mods make the game a TON more fun, and some can add a plethora of tanks and troops and balance out troops more. It sure adds to the game, and i would highly suggest this if you have friends to play it with!","August 11, 2015","true","69.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
