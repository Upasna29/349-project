Honestly if it weren't for the art, it would be much easier to make up my mind.\nAs it stands, I would give it 7/10, only because despite the art I genuinely enjoyed the game.\n\nPros:\nLots of content  would take a lot of time to play through and get all of the different endings.\nThe main character is relatable, and all of the datable characters are likeable.\nStory is fluffy and cute, believable well written dialogue for the most part.\nBuy all the clothes.\nMake all the pancakes.\n\nCons:\ndat chin tho...\nJokes aside, my biggest complaint with the game is the art. Although I will say after a few hours of playing my irritation with the art subsided to a degree, but thats not to say that it grew on me because even after a few hours of play I would find myself distracted by the seemingly disjointed chins of literally every single character in the game. If you don't think you can get past the art, don't bother with this game. Even the CG's are pretty wonky looking.\nSome might not like the stat raising aspect (though I personally don't mind it)\nThe story lacks any real depth, (again, I didn't necessarily mind this myself. For what it is, I think this is just fine, though others might be disappointed with this.)\n\n","October 15, 2015","true","12.0"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","36","38","3","0"

I picked it up somewhere else last year and got a Steam key when it crossed over. So I have a bit more time on this than is in my stats.\n\nThis is a pretty straightforward otome game with different routes, datable guys, friend-datable girls, day-to-day decisions and managing different attributes - it's also self-aware about the romatic-confession-at-the-end-of-school-term trope. In terms of sex, it's very tame. There's language to indicate these kids know what's up, but you're not getting much more than cleavage and abs. Sowwy. ;-)\n\nYour protagonist (name and birthday of your choice) is a British girl going through her last year of UK high school at a new school, so she has to start from scratch making new friends. She does this in pretty short order with the prototype outgoing quasi-♥♥♥♥♥♥ girl and the prototype shy-ish high-achieving girl. There are also a couple other girls that come along in time for friendship possibilities with pretty distinct personalities and stories (some of which don't become fleshed out until you get through a couple routes). As for the datable boys, you've got the prototype flirt, the sensitive musician, the jerk brain/drama guy, the younger athlete from a nearby school and a young art teacher. While these guys fit common otome roles, they have enough twists to them to keep them somewhat interesting (said flirt is also a jock, the art teacher is also a model and tattoo artist). You go through the year day-by-day choosing different activities which get you points for different attributes which help your prospects with the guys. As you go on different routes, you can date on the weekends (which is also when you can buy clothes that certain people may like or not and also go places on your own), though if you've done well enough with a guy or girl, they may call you to go out while you're on school breaks. Along with all this, some routes have slight mini-games to test your memory (all routes have the one where you, that's right, are making pancakes).\n\nThere are a good number of routes, and a few of them can't be tried until almost halfway through, which makes them a bit challenging. The routes aren't as simple as racking up the points - certain decisions have to be made as well. While there are some repetitive aspects, I appreciate the variety of routes and what's needed to complete them.\n\nAs has already been discussed in some places here, the weakness on this game is visual. The character design is meant to be a riff on anime, though the shadows and body shapes will look really wonky to some. I think the look is pretty much the same as it has been through the years, with just a few tweeks here and there. Also the text is a straight and small Arial that people could actually have a hard time reading. But as you may have figured if you've gotten this far (thanks!), I don't care. I like these characters, I like the sense of humour they have and I like the variety of things they get to do. There are a couple other things (jobs! taking exams!) that I haven't covered through all this. But hopefully you get the idea now that if you're a fan of otome games, you can have a lot of fun with this one.","October 14, 2015","true","16.0"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

Although there weren't any additions or changes made (other than a bug that was fixed from the direct only version), Lucky Rabbit Reflex! (LRR) is as great a game as I remember.  ^^\n\nLRR is basically a visual novel with dating sim elements.  You play as the new female student starting her final year of college (in the US, it would be the final year of high school) in a new school.  There are a total of 6 guys that you can date although only 4 of these guys you'll find in the school.  The other two you'll have to search elsewhere.  Also, there are a total of 5 girls that you can become BFFs with.  The dating sim elements include, of course, asking each of the guys on a date on Saturdays or asking one of the girls to hang out with them as well as stat grinding.  There are 4 different stats you can grind but you must make sure that the stress level doesn't get too high or else the MC will be more likely to fail at raising certain stats.\n\nAlthough the art itself did put me off from buying this game for a while, the story and gameplay more than made up for it.  I liked that you can achieve multiple endings with most of the guys.  Four of the guys have three different endings-a best end, a good end, and a dual end.  The dual end happens if you're trying to romance said character and another certain guy at the same time.  I haven't seen this possibility in many VNs/dating sims.  Also, one of the guys is a secret character so you have to figure out who it is and how to romance him although the developer's site does have a walkthrough of this game if you're trying to achieve a certain ending or pursue a possible character.  So basically, what really hooked me to this game was the multiple playthroughs you can have although I liked the story that I read for each dateable male character.  Each one of them had me hooked to his story although I'll admit that I liked certain ones more than others.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend buying LRR if you're a fan of VNs, dating sims, etc.  A lot of play time can be had from this game so it's well worth the money.  ^^","October 31, 2015","true","66.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It is so endearing and weird in its own special way.\n\n+ points for Brit humor. nay, humour.\n\n+ points for semi-angsty-red-head who is secretly sorta sensitive and 'intellectual' which means he likes books n stuff, rite?\n\n+ winning for costumes and dress-up....though....it srsly bugs me that you cannot actually SEE the MC wearing her new threadz that you just saved up for weeks to buy..... grrr. srsly, need patch for that. and n00dz.\n\n\nOnly drawback? Dat chin doe. Good thing I am too drunk to notice most of the time when I am playing, but at first I almost did not buy the game because of chin. But yea it is apparent this is the 'chosen style' of art for this game and I can complain about it but it does not change the excellent text and overall mood of the game. I think the funky chin thing kinda adds to the lighthearted nature of the game. if you want supr srssss get Amensia or something like that (which I love in its own special way too, ofc) but this is a separate animal entirely. and I can appreciate that.\n\n(though - not entirely sure if it was intentional in a stylistic sense or in a "this is the best I can draw" sense but either way I accept it for what it is)\n\nalso kinda petty but I wish I could change MC appearance. she looks like someone who used to annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, so I wish I could at least pick my hair color, length, eye color, skin tone, and outfit. but I kno this ain't an MMO....alas.\n\nWill probably modify/update this after I finish playing cause I am sure I will have some thoughts to add...\n\nPS: needs moar lesbian. but like I said I am not through it yet so mebbe I will be (hopefully!) pleasantly surprised (?)\n\nPPS: doubleplus points for 2005-ish references. ahh, nostalgia... where my flip phone at?! also LOL add track pants = instaStreet!","October 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/impracticalmagic/recommended/404030/","impracticalmagic","Impracticalmagic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/impracticalmagic/","200 products in account","Recommended if you enjoy a fairly straightforward otome visual novel / stat raising game.  Detailed enough to get to know the various characters and doesn't feel too short.  Not a lot of surprises, but I thought it was good - I don't always need or want harrowing and dark, and these characters actually seemed to act more like normal people (of 17-19) than in many games.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Enough unique features/plots in the different storylines to be interesting as you try to complete the different endings\n+ Likeable characters\n+ Generally well-written (and the dialogue was more realistic than usual)\n+ UK setting (I really enjoyed the setting and the slang - so many games are set either in Tokyo or the US)\n+ The endings (Best, Good and "Dual") were quite well done; I thought the "dual" endings were a neat touch\n+ The intro to the game pokes fun at itself...\n\nCons:\n\n- The artwork takes getting used to; many people have criticized the strange chins and it *is* a distraction (but I found many of the CGs were fine)\n- Parts of the game are pretty repetitive\n- Not sure why you can "fail" when attempting to improve a skill, since you can just save and reload\n\nOverall:  Glad I bought and played it, sorry I'm just about done.\n","March 12","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are what really made the game shine. All of them are dynamic and interesting and by the end of each of their routes i really liked all of them. The writing is good and has lots of quirky British humour.  I also really enjoyed the protagonist she was really fun to play as. I would recommend this to all otome fans in search of some light-hearted fun.","March 13","true","66.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
