I really enjoyed playing it and i think if all promised features are added, this can get a deep CCG / TB-RPG experience.\n\nRight now there is only PVE against 3 bosses with 3 Heroes, but it is enough to show the intentions of the developers. The Heroes all have a different playstyle and ressources, as the bosses have distinct strengths an weaknesses, that require certain strategies. Sometimes toooo "certain". If there is something to improve on, it would be the balancing on some cards ("Fire of Life" and "The Cross" come to mind) and give more room for different strategies.\n\nI recommend this game right now for people that like to play PvE encounters and want to help improving the game.","March 8","true","4.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

However, the content that is present in the game is a lot of fun -- which bodes well for the future.\n\nLabyrinth is a tactical dungeon crawling game where each hero has a deck of cards containing spells/abilities that the hero can use on combat.\n\nMore cards will be added over the course of early access, but the initial cards feature a nice variety of mechanics and tactical options. The heroes feel very different from each other, and the game makes you feel "clever" when you combine the Heroes' abilities properly to win a fight.\n\nGame is fun so far.

I have only had time to run one dungeon, but I am already impressed by the depth of the game. Right from the start there are combos to find and work to your best advantage.

Currently the game offers only three turn-based boss battles which I completed in 35 minutes - that's it. Labyrinth in its current state isn't even a demo.\n\nAs the bright blue text on the store page says: "if you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development". I'd challenge any of the current positive reviews to argue that they're genuinely "excited to play the game in its current state".\n\nFor what it's worth, the foundation of the game does show some promise, so I'll update my review as required later on in development.\n\nNormally in my reviews I like to summarise the game mechanics. In this case, although I can see the ghost of mechanics such as deck building, how everything will ultimately fit together is pure speculation.\n\nIn terms of what there is to see, everything is very solid so far. The difficulty was exactly right, not too easy and not too tough. There were no bugs that I noticed and the graphics looked good with no glitches.\n\nGameplay was fairly intuitive and fluid and despite the lack of tutorial I picked it all up within a few minutes.\n\nStill, this is an extremely narrow 'vertical slice' and there's nothing that might tempt anyone to keep playing after a quick look. I'm not even sure there's enough here yet to generate any particularly useful community feedback.\n\nI'm also not especially looking forward to multiplayer either. At the moment the game feels very much like a good, turn based solo exercise, which incidentally would suit me completely fine. I guess free to play multiplayer is where the money is.\n\nOnce loot and level progression are introduced I might check back in, but without either of these things implemented yet I suggest sitting this one out until much closer to the offical release.","March 8","false","0.6"," 39 of 65 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","39","65","2","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/412310/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLabyrinth is going to be a very exciting game when all is said and done. Of this I am one hundred percent certain. Imagine a card game such as Hearthstone or Magic The Gathering in a turn-based strategy combat game. It’s as exciting as it sounds and the combat comes hard and fast with the main form of strategy coming in the form of having a great understanding of the cards in your possession and the manner in which the enemies, especially the bosses, maneuver and how to combat that.\n\nUnfortunately at this very early stage of development there isn’t very much content to get through and you can complete what is there in half an hour – more if you’re not as skilled at this type of game. However, do keep in mind that the game is early access and what you do get to experience already is a bite sized piece of what the developers are constantly working and striving towards. As such there isn’t very much to discuss gameplay wise other than to say that I enjoyed my time going through the three different combatants that I got to face in my time with the game (thus far that is all that there is).\n\nI played with three characters throughout my experience all of which come with their own unique card decks which means that you’ll have to learn not only one set of cards but however many different classes are in your party. At this stage there is a tank (warfare hero), a healer (faith hero) and a pyromancer (wizardry hero). There is also a rogue (skulduggery hero). Each of the classes that I got to play with behave exactly as you would imagine the class to in this type of game which is already a very strong advantage for the game.\n\nThe only thing holding it back at this stage of development is its lack of content but it is coming. Labyrinthe has the potential to be an outstanding collectible card game which is something that I very much look forward to sinking time into and to drag me away from Hearthstone.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","28.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Very limited interaction as of now, but the 3 available boss battles and 2 dozen or so cards per class let you get a good feel for the game.  The labyrinth fights are pretty basic at this point, and only get hard if you try to pull cheeky stunts with the summoned minions.  I have only crashed once while playing, and that was probably my fault since i had about 10 other programs running (was playing from work).  Some of the other reviewers stated that a tutorial was needed, but i didnt have any problems jumping right in.  its very intuitive gameplay  made it simple enough, in my opinion, to not NEED a tutorial.  Having some of the card's 'Key Abilities' defined might be nice, a glossary in the help menu maybe?\n\nOverall the game is enjoyable as is, with the abilty to change up your hero decks and test out strategies.  When labyrinth construction is available i hope there is a way to battle your own labyrinth to "test it"  i look forward to being able to make a more challenging boss.  The three bosses they have currently are too easy especially since they allow you to modify your hero decks.  Priest deck feels incredibly overpowered with the amount of damage that can be done while simultaneously healing.\n\nAnyone expecting hundreds of hours of gameplay from a early access beta need not apply.  If you think this game is something you will enjoy at release, toss the 10 bucks at them and get familiar with it on your lunch break.  It is more about giving them some input on bugs and glitches, than ejoying countless hours of fun at this stage.  The more info they have the faster the game will get released, after all.\n\n\n\n\n","March 9","true","20.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

In every fight i tried to adjust my tactics to the specialty of the bosses and i think they did the same. it seemed like they too altered their played cards accordingly and i must say they did a good job.\n\nFrom reading other peoples feedback i assume that there is some luck of the draw involved (on the enemies side and little mitigated by mulligan on the players side), but i seriously don´t think the game is too tough or too easy and it isnt just luck of the draw here. This is serious strategy/planing combined with having to analyze what the enemy does. The game being realy short at the moment so there is that to consider in terms of what i write here.\n\nI would love to see more content soon, will surely try my own decks on the evil enemies and will sure stick around tot test every new update.\n\nSo far, mostly enjoyable as a first glance into what is coming and i would recommend everybody who was interested enough to scroll down to the reviews to stay interested:-)","March 9","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The core of the game is based around personalized boss rooms and card building.\n\nThe game is two layered at the core, on one end you have the hero building aspect where your objective is to build a team of heroes with the ability to take down your opponents dungeon. There is alot of options in how you want to go about your heroes aswell. On one hand you can go a standard tank, healer damage setup. On the other you can go an all out damage, all with it's pros and cons.\n\nThe other end is your ability to customize which bosses you want your opponent to go up against and how they play out. Each boss is also built around the card system. A boss is built around fifteen slots, divided between perks, spells and minions. Different bosses will have different amount of slot allocations allowing a large variety on how you want to build your labyrinth.\n\nThe cards you have at your disposal can be divided into Hero/Boss , role and general. Hero/boss cards are cards only that hero or boss has access to, whereas role cards are avilable to all heroes and bosses who fall within the same role classification. Lastly there are the general cards, these cards are for all heroes or bosses regardless of where they fit in gameplay wise.\n\nI have a ton of fun when playing this game as it allows alot of theorycrafting, testing and very indepht analysis of how to build around heroes and abilities to create synergies.\n\nAll in all, i can very much reccomend this game as i see it having a bright future and a great community growing allready.\n","May 19","true","86.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a great combination of CCG and Dungeon Raiding. The game is simple to play but provides complex strategies for more experienced gamers. You can play every once in a while as a casual gamer or play a lot with the games endless variety. The ability to attack and be attacked allows for constant changing in your strategy and adds a lot of variety to the game.

I was already sold on the concept of the game, but didn't expect to love the implementation; the interface and action are intuitive if you are familiar with TCG/tactical RPGS, if you aren't I'd recommend watching some gameplay videos or waiting until a tutorial is built in.\n\nIt took me three attempts to complete the three bosses in the Raid, and each boss required a different strategy to beat.

The movement and 3D models are great additions and make it feel like we're starting to see aspects of other genres being pulled together. I had a couple flashbacks to my childhood playing tabletop D&D with miniatures. :)\n\nThe graphics and overall polish are much better than I expected, especially considering it's early access. Once I figured out the movement (click and drag in the green area) and turn system the basic gameplay was fairly straightforward, but I can see there's a lot of depth to the strategy. I was able to kill the first boss but it got significantly harder after that.\n\nI especially like the movement of Edrick, who can shadowstep in and out of range - very cool. I can also see the ranged buffs/heals from Lavella being strong once I understand how to use them better.\n\nThe bar which tracks turns is clever and adds depth to the decision making process when choosing your next move. A tutorial would be helpful, but considering it's early access I'm glad they prioritized getting the gameplay smooth and bug free first, which it was.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how the game progresses as features are added and it goes into full release.

No major issues, perhaps a slight delay/wonky nature when dealing with the cards.  Bottom line is that I enjoyed myself and am very much looking forward to more features being released in the early access phase for testing, especially collecting new cards and testing new heroes.

I think I made it through with about 12 using the option to heal between each fight. Point being keep healed up if you want to make it through. My opinion good design, decently challenging, and decent cards to play with hopes to build a large inventory of variety to play.

To complete this mission, you have but a certain amount of time. Time becomes crucial as you pierce trough the summoned hordes to defeat the stage boss. Soon you come to the conclusion that each move counts, as it costs you ticks (a portion of time) to complete an action. Each action is represented by a specific card and a deck of those cards defines a heroes moveset.\nIt is much fun to tweak a deck to gain most out of your different abilities and look for synergies between cards and even heroes. Currently in an early stage of development there isn’t much to do except for raiding the three stages and defeating the bosses there.\nOverall a very promising game with lots of potential, possibly redefining the way we think about card games in the competitive sector.

The game system, using time ticks, is reminiscent of the World of Warcraft Miniature game, which was a great game and sadly got pulled because of company politics. I'm very happy to see it being used again!\n\nThe way Defense decks work is a cool variation on asynchronous pvp in that you have a lot of knobs to turn: you choose which boss will guard your halls, what spells and attacks it can use, what kind of perks it will have to boost specific spells or stats, and which creatures will be joining in at the start of the fight. You can choose 5 spells, 5 perks and 5 creatures, and the value of those 15 cards together can't exceed a threshold of 45 stars, making it really fun to try and get that perfect defense deck together - augmented by replays you can see of other players trying (in vain, naturally) to beat down your setup. Consequentially, it makes it really fun to make your own assault teams since there are a lot of things you need to consider in order to be able to beat opposing bosses! It's a pretty tough game difficulty-wise at the moment and I think that's great.\n\nThe game of course isn't perfect (yet) by any means, but that brings me to why I really recommend trying or at least following this game: the developers. They are highly responsive to feedback, and I've had several nice chats with the devs on the steam chat, for instance. If you have questions or criticisms, I can recommend bringing it to their attention because in my experience they will listen carefully.\n\nThe game is still incomplete at the moment, but is already a lot of fun and I recommend trying it out!","March 10","true","51.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Demos at the very least have one full, playable level.  This is like pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha and should never have been released to the public.\n\nFourth, the main problem is is that there's so little to actually give feedback on.  Graphics, awful, turn-based gameplay with cards, OK it's... whatever.  Difficulty is quite high to begin with (and mostly because you don't really know what you're doing) but that's fine... the rest doesn't even exist.  It's like trying to give feedback on a piece of white paper.\n\nYou have a long, LONG way to go before this is in any kind of respectable state and you have a lot of gall asking people to pay for this...  and as such, there's no way I'd recommend the game as-is.","March 14","false","1.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

Unique concept!\n+: The game's graphics & what music is there all feels very AAA and not very indie.\n+: The game is optimized very well even this early, and runs perfect even on poor hardware.\n+: The developers are very responsive and active on the state of the game and what they are working on.\n~: More details on the business model in regards to card/hero/boss unlocks remain to be seen on how consumer friendly they are.\n-: The "fluff" of the game - the feel of how the attacks and spells feel is not perfect yet. Some of them just don't feel like they are really hurting the enemies in how the enemies react/how they sound.","May 13","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although i agree with certain players that it feels very unfinished, we got to realize that it has yet to come out with all the possible content and we have yet to see the final product.\n\nIf you're interested in CCG games or Turn base Strategy ex: X-COM/Tactics. This would be a great game to give it a try. It has a vintage feel and it doesn't take much to get used to the game mechanics, however the tutorials were a bit weak perhaps because is early access.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great Potential for PVP\n- Good game mechanics and strategy\n- Characters design such as heroes and bosses look pretty good.\n- Can customize basically everything from hero decks to boss decks\n- Relatively fast matches 10-20mins averg.\n\nCons:\n\n- View control is very rigid. WASD makes it a bit easier to control\n- No options to calculate how many steps enemies can take and how is their range of attack, is something you must learn by feel/experience after dealing with them.\n- Not very noob friendly, it really needs a throughout tutorial where it explains movement/windup/cancels and so on.\n","May 24","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a little light on content but that's to be expected in Early Access and there appears to be a lot of content in the works. Gameplay wise it's simple to learn but hard to master and quite enjoyable. Graphics are great and stylized and it's not too demanding of your hardware and should run on a pretty low spec PC. The devs are super active and actually got in touch with me after I streamed this game on Twitch and was disconnected during a match to let me know they were going to look into it, haven't had a disconnection since.\n\nIf this game keeps going the way it's going and it's done right I can see this one day becoming I competitor to Hearthstone.","May 26","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
