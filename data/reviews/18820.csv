This is a fast paced, balanced game which has alot of different game modes (stunts, traditional racing, sports, arcade). You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers.

I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c it’s worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....","July 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: "EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA<3" (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!\n\nUnfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.\n\nBuy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.","November 25, 2013","true","1.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.\n\nThe game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.\n\nLike all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.\n\nPerhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.\n\nIf you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.\n\nIn terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.\n\nAs for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.\n\nThere's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..\n\nThen there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.\n\nWhile a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.\n\nThere is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.\n\nZero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.","September 21, 2015","false","2.4"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","28","46","2","3"

There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag.\n2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.\n\nIt's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with.

You can't exactly say it's a racing game because it is a lot more, you can race, play soccer, play tag, play pachinko, play basketball, hockey, a weird game where you punch other players in a precipice. Yeah, the usual stuff. Oh, and you can do all that with a completely customized car,  in fact, you can customize it the way you want, no need to pucharse anything.\nThe game is really awesome to play with friends, don't even consider playing alone, bots suck and online community is dead, only buy this if you have friends. Zero Gear is full of OMG moments, it is simply incredible to play and provides lots of fun. The game don't try to be realistic, it takes a Mario Kart style aproach with items and stuff.

Steering is terrible in the game, and the physics are a bit off, causing issues when racing. The item box things don't really give you anything useful to use against your opponents. A lot of the stuff cannot even be used as a weapon to interfere with your opponent unless you're literally right up against them. There's also not many weapons in those item boxes. I think I noticed four. Do not expect large games either. There seems to be no single player mode, and it just randomly sticks you into multiplayer with just one person. It gets extremely boring and the challenge dissipates easily. You also cannot pick the game mode you want to play. You randomly either end up in a racing game, or a remake of that carnival game where you throw a little ball down the lane and try to get it in the holes, but you play as the ball. Making characters can be a bit fun, but you're still limited to a select few base designs. There's a custom color editor though, which is a nice touch. This game is a stinker though. Pass on it, believe me. You're better off getting a Wii emulator and playing Mario Kart Wii than wasting money on a wannabe.","December 25, 2013","false","1.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I want to say before I review this I am a straight non white male and I have checked my privilege . Ok now that we have that out the way let's start the review. Zero Gear Solid: interplanetary Global Warfare is a multiplayer racing game with a strong single player that has layers of depth that I've never seen in a video game before.\n\nTHE STORY: There is two factions the blue which fight for equal rights for all races, genders, and sexual orientations. The red fights only for the white straight privilege and for political freedom for the panda race which has recently been discovered in a secret lab in naughty Korea. The pandas have superior brain function and can rationalize thoughts before we can and they have decided that we settle the war in a test of strength and will power. THE ZERO GEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Zero  Gear is the missing link between kart racing games and Gone Home because you either win the series a hero or go home a lesbian CIS scum.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY: The game play is superb, the combat is a mix between counter strike and the CQC from Metal Gear Solid 3: The Twin Snakes. You start out with 2 weapons a gun and a knife, the gun is dependent on your rank and which team you spawn as. If you have just started red will have a 1911 with a switch blade while blue will have a glock and a Ninjatō. They both have their pros and cons but blue is a bit stronger in my opinion with their strong CQC take down. The driving is really like you're driving a kart!  The turning is tighter than a 3-year-old and the drifting is like real-life  You can't  .\n\nTHE SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack was produced by none other than Aphex Twin! unfortunately they could only afford one full length song so that's what you get. There is shorter snippets and those produced by my homie Madlib. On the soundtrack I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one, if you've heard the soundtrack what did you think of it? Love it? Hate it? Why? The Soundtracks for the Zero Gear over the Court of the Crimson Trout Mask..............................Forever.\n\nOVERALL: I think this a pretty fun game for 99 cents but anything above that is kinda eeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh. This game is fun with the mates and LANing it would stop the lag issues. I'm feeling a solid 7 on this one.\nPROS:\nFUN WITH MATES\nDEEP STORY\nCAN MAKE A PANDA DRIVING A SHOE WITH SHOE WHEELS\nCONS:\nLAG SPIKES CAN PUT YOU FROM 1ST PLACE TO LAST\n♥♥♥♥ING DEV ABANDONED THIS GAME ;_;\nONLY A COUPLE MAPS AND NO MOD SUPPORT","July 1, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can basically assure you that unless someone specifically tried to, you would not have two avatars that looked exactly the same. With a wide range of colorful and fun accessories, karts, wheels, racers AND hats, you're sure to have a blast with it!\n\nMulti-player can be a blast with this game and your bound to lose track of time. Each track this game has to offer has the replay value X1,000,000 and there's a little bit of something for everyone! A few even have shortcuts, so keep your eyes peeled! If you haven't guessed by the "About the game" section, there's more than 1 gamemode to enjoy! So if racing isn't your cup-of-tea, there's other things to enjoy.\n\n10/10 would GREATLY recommend this game to ANYONE!\n\nHappy racing.","June 19, 2014","true","64.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WARDEATHFUN/recommended/18820/","WARDEATHFUN","Rex Draco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WARDEATHFUN/","839 products in account","This game has so much potential to be great, unfortunately it has just a few flaws that do enough damage to ruin the game.\n\nYou'll see a lot of people give positive reviews without actually playing the game often. I don't know the origin behind this, maybe they got the game really cheap or free and decided it was worth it and that's all that matters. I bought the four pack for $2, but I won't let that impact my review at all because I see the bigger picture that I'm probably not going to play the game a whole lot, no matter how much I want to try and play the game.\n\nThe game's positives are many. You have a variety of levels that all have their unique game modes associated to it. Think of it like Mario Kart but much more variety.\n\nYou have this unique take of Tag where sometimes the person it loses points rather than gains, which is closer to the traditional sense of tag (the person "it" would want to tag someone) and then sometimes it gets "flipped" where the person it gets points, thus wanting to run away from the other players. If the player reaches zero points, the ability to become it is then in the middle of the map. Additionally, there is weapons in the middle of the map you can gather as well. First player to get a full bar of points wins.\n\nYou also have this cool soccer ball mode where you obviously got to get the sockerball into the goal using either your own vehicle or a boxing glove to act like a kick. You have racing and probably numerous more. They're all great ideas and were well thought out.\n\nThe game has a garage menu option where you customize your character and vehicle. Not only do you get to select the stuff your character wears or your vehicle style and its wheels, but you also get to customize everything's color with all colors possible using this box and its slider that adjusts brightness (color grid or something, forgot what it's called). The vehicle styles range from your typical vehicle to a tank, my favorite is the skull vehicle. The wheel options are good as well, some are goofy and some are less goofy. I picked the tires with spikes on them to match my skull car. I have the skeleton character and I made him wear the bugging out eyes and a top hat. Yes, you can even customize the color of your character.\n\nThe game has an alright soundtrack. It isn't good, it isn't bad. It's just fine. No complaints from me. The graphics style is cartoony, but it's enjoyable for all ages despite it.\n\nNow for some of the negatives that absolutely ruins the game, thus its low price and obscurity. The items the game has does have a healthy variety, not to the scale of Mario Kart or even Jak X: Combat Racing, but the variety is fine. I would have liked to have seen more variety however.The items, however, can also ruin the game for the player using them.\n\nIn the game mode, Flipped, you gotta tag people, remember? Well, with the force shield, nobody can touch you and you cannot touch anyone, so how do you tag people when you need to? Flawed design. The force shield also doesn't protect you from everything but rather the players actual vehicle, so bombs and stuff appear to still hit you... unless that's a bug.\nAdditionally, some weapons help the player you're using them against more than yourself. Bombs, for example, can blow the player forward and they have a fast enough recovery where you still wont catch up to them. Mario Kart did it right where you, despite it being unrealistic, fly upwards more to slow you down. This, I imagine, can be even more frustrating in a racing game where you push a player ahead of you rather than help you. The items could use a bit of a revamp, perhaps even a filter for specific maps. For example, the Kickit map only has punching bags, perhaps flipped should only give the shield to players that can use it for their best interests or not have it at all.\n\nThe second worst thing about the game is the camera. I use a controller because mouse and keyboard just doesn't make sense for some games, racing being one of them (wheel>controller>mouse and keyboard). However, both mouse and keyboard have this same issue, the camera is just too frustrating. You could reverse and it IMMEDIATELY snaps backwards but sluggishly continues forward. It should be a bit faster snapping towards the direction you're driving. You could try to turn and the camera feels a bit off, it's hard to see where you're going, especially when chasing someone on an open map. You can use the mouse to move the camera, which is actually good. The controller, however, is painfully useless. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing racing game and they somehow made the camera horrible for controller players.\n\nThe absolute worse of the game that just ruins it entirely, no matter how many positives, is the controls. The controls make the game so unplayable that you'll have to relearn everything you have ever gotten from driving games. The turning specifically. The turn isn't imemdiate, there is input lag. This input lag is frustrating. It makes timing really hard. You know what's worse? The way the turns work. You LUNGE left or right. There isn't a good system of turning because there isn't an easy way to turn slightly left or right, you'll probably zig zag around stuff you're trying to get because of it. There is jumping and *kinda* drifting that *kinda* makes things easier, but not by enough. You'll have to invest a lot of time to get used to the game and even then I don't think you'll fluently be able to drive to what you are targeting.\n\nOnline community doesn't exist. No players online. That's probably because of the turning controls and what not.\n\nWhen hosting your own game, I notice that, even as host, I lag with my friend. I only had problems with him, so that suggests that maybe there is some type of connection similar to Super Smash Brothers Brawl. That's not a good thing, especially since it causes not just me but my friend to teleport, reset all over the place, or go under the map. That's not something the host should go through.\n\nIf the developer would invest the time to, at least, fix the camera and controls to be less frustrating, the game would be able to get sales, easily, without having to sell a 4 pack for $2. However, the game seems to be dead both online and the developer side. I really like the idea, but I refuse to say it's worth buying no matter how many laughs I had with my friends because I was more frustrated with the controls than I was having fun. Not to mention the laughs my friends and I were making were more related to how bad and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the game is.\n\nIf you're adventureous, you might wanna try buying the game on sale to experience it yourself. If you're looking for a good PC Mario Kart or something, look elsewhere because this is not it.","December 26, 2014","false","8.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infyre/recommended/18820/","Infyre","Pyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infyre/","363 products in account","It can be better.\n\nThis is a little fun kart game with very little standout. It is reminiscent of Mario Kart games where the idea of using weapons is one of the essential keys to getting that 1st place. It's got a nice look going for it and it does have potential to be one of the best kart games out there.\n\nHowever, it definitely needs more work on it or some patchwork for it to be better than it is now. First thing to start with is definitely the A.I. While the A.I is suitably well to give you a challenge to race against, it really falls short on other modes. Notably on levels where you're playing Football or Soccer. I've watched the CPU controlled teammates do a lot of piling up with eachother and very minimal strategy involved for scoring a goal.\n\nAlso I've noticed they favor the idea of running into you and eachother a lot as well as bumble around with the ball or puck than trying to get it in the goal. Without them being distracted. Also, your team mates favor the idea of running into you more often than avoiding and focusing primarily on the opposing team with you. While the A.I does get the idea of what it's supposed to do in these modes, it doesn't really make it fun or challenging when it's more of a fight with stupidity than competing.\n\nThere's no difficulty setting for this game either so you're stuck with the A.I having moodswings every now and then. One small complaint about the goal-levels is that, why have powerups that would be useful for the racing aspect of the game in them? It makes a lot of sense to have the boxing glove powerup for areas like Sumo and Soccer. But you're really wishing it could be in Football sometimes. It'd add a nice touch if you want to score more.\n\nThere's a decent amount of customization in this game. From picking a character, what your kart looks like, what accessories you wear and to a nice color changing pallette. Although it wouldn't hurt to have more to add to the variety. Like changing the color of your character, that'd be nice.\n\nControl-wise, it's easy to get used to. Also you can change it to whatever you're comfortable with.\n\nGameplay is decent however the physics could also use a little tightening. Everything feels...loose. It's easy to lose to control, it's easy to get knocked around, it's a pain to go in reverse and that camera is awful. It's only awful when you're going in reverse, where it has to turn around and face the front of your character instead of allowing you to simply back up while facing ahead. I hate games that do that.\n\nGraphics are okay and the sound is awesome. But again I wish for more!\n\nMultiplayer is pretty much left to be desired. The community is still somewhat of a ghost town, you may find one or two friends to play with. But, getting a full server with this game that aren't bots is considerably a challenge.\n\nIn conclusion this game can be so much better. If it would add more customization, tighter controls/gameplay, more variety modes, difficulty settings, maybe add cups or a tournament mode and definitely a better A.I.\n\nI rate this game 5 out of 10. I would recommend it but however if you want more in-depth with your games like I would. Then, I can't recommend this game.","September 16, 2014","false","18.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I have never played a mario kart game in my life, due to the fact I own nothing intendo, but I have always wanted to play one. I found this waaaaaaaay back when they had a free weekend of this to promote their game, and I gave it a go. I will never regret that day.\n\nI had soooo much fun online, back when it worked, and I pooped in my pants every once in a while because I laughed so hard. Now days I don't do that so much, but i still manage a fart whenever I play this game.\n\nThe tracks are awesome, some better than others. The racing is the best. The AI is top notch. The vehicle customisation is state-of-the-art. And the PHYSICS in this game is far more advanced than the physics that occupy this world currently. I mean, how many times can you slightly nudge your friend ever-so-lightly on the back of his car, THEN HE FLIPS, AND CRIES, AND ♥♥♥♥♥ ALL IN THE SAME SWIFT MOVEMENT?!?! that's right, you can't, but this game makes it possible.\n\nNow, I dont write a lot of reviews, so, you can trust me on this. Zero Gear is where I have had most of my laughs in gaming. I used to laugh at a lot of stuff back when I was younger, now I find things relatively hard to laugh at if it isnt extremely funny. Like ducks for example, I barley laugh at those anymore.\n\nAnyway,\n\nIf you are looking for a racing game with great graphics, excellent car handling, a solid NFS story, an aboriginal, several quails, and realistic... well... realism, then LOOK ELSEWHERE.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a game with good laughs, great fun, extreme competition, rage quitting (when you nudge your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off friend because he hasn't won a race since he started playing), 10/10 -IGN physics, and a good game to play with friends, then ZERO GEAR is the campfire you want to gather around on a cold winters night. Its funny when you play, but most of all, its FUN. I enjoyed it. That guy below me enjoyed it. So why shouldnt YOU enjoy it?\n\nBuy it. NOW!\n\nLEGIT STUFF NOW:\nAs I said, the game is great, and extremely funny, but ONLY if you have about 3-4 friends to play this with. Bots are OK, but you always win and there isnt really a challenge.\n\nPROS:\n-Very funny\n-Lots of different tracks/maps\n-Lots of different game modes\n-Good customization\n-Graphics are good for the style and time of the game\n-Very quirky and fun\n-Awesome powerups\n-BOTS in multiplayer (If you would like. Personally, I enjoy having them)\n-AWESOME music\n-THE PHYSICS\n\nCONS:\n-No online play (Thats why you HAVE to have friends to play this game with)\n-Some maps are very long and boring (these are far a few between though)\n-Sometimes it gets laggy\n-No developer input\n-No community\n-Bot AI is sometimes really f*cking weird.... sometimes...\n-THE PHYSICS\n\nOverall and EXCELLENT game. Very fun but only with friends. No community or online play (Servers).\n9/10 (Because sometimes the physics can really ♥♥♥♥ you off)\n\nIf you would like to see a bit of the fun I have had in zero gear, go to the link below. Otherwise, try it for yourself, but make sure you have a few mates willing to try it out with you.
