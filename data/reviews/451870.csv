It's sort of a cross between a twin-stick shooter and a tower defence game, but with the added bonus of room-scale VR.  You can physically walk around the environment and pick up items for your character to use, or risk leaving your dessert under the care of your towers while your little guy runs for that power-up.  It also has a progression system and alternate wave-based challenges, so you'll have a reason to keep coming back.\nAnyway, the dev has been responsive to feedback from the community and has made some great changes since the initial release.  For the price, you can't beat this!","April 19","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I think there's a lot of potental here, and the art style is pretty great, but like most current VR developers, they're still working out the basic kinks.\n\nThe attempt at D-pad style movement is particularly frustrating. I'm inclined to think that using a left hard targeting reticle that you move towards on trigger-down might work better, or at least feel more consistent with the right hand control scheme. Maybe a limited-use teleport would make things easier when you fall off the table (which happens a lot.) There are also other little issues, like how coins are too hard to collect before they vanish at the end of the round, and there's not much explaination of the towers. I've only played 2 levels, but I'm hoping more action takes place on the floor, or where you can move around the field better. Sound design could use more work as well.\n\nAnyway, I'm going to keep watching this one, but you aren't missing anything amazing if you ignore it for now.","May 6","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Good music and graphics. I found the game pad to be more a curate and easier to use but you can use motion controls also. It plays like a tower defence game. Highly recommended this game.","May 12","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
