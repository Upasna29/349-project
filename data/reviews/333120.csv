Making the object touch the platform is not as easy as it sounds and will require your creativity and patience.\nThere are no options whatsoever, but I don't really feel that I'm missing something - there is no music, just the ambient sound and the occasional rolling sound of your gear, so I don't need the adjustable sound sliders, the keys are listed in the help screen and are not remapable, but work just fine and I didn't feel the need to change them. Now don't get me wrong, having those options would definitely be good, but the game gets away nicely without them.\nNow, as good as the keyboard controls are, I would love to see some mouse support implemented in the game, as that will clearly make the control of the objects more intuitive.\nOnce you complete a puzzle, you move onto the next one, out of a total of 25. Most of them will require you to fine tune your available object's position and angle, and I would just love the option to save my original and unorthodox solution, so I can easily show it to a friend, without wasting a couple minutes, trying to emulate it.\nWith the ambient sounds and the slowly moving gears in the background, surrounded by mist or in some kind of liquid, I could agree, that the game is atmospheric and I don't think, that the lack of music is that noticeable.\nOverall, I think the game delivers quite enjoyable experience for all puzzle fans, but might be quite strange / irritating for players new to the genre or lacking the patience to complete the puzzles, because it's one thing to understand what you're supposed to do, and another, to actually carefully position the objects and succeed. The price tag, the steam trading cards and the fact that I love puzzles, make this an easy recommendation!\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video, as I complete the first 9 levels of the game:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346369054","November 24, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It's pretty fun figuring out totally outrageous ideas to get a level accomplished that you would never have thought of at the start and very very satisfying when you finally pass a level.\n\nThe game did crash a couple of times (Windows XP) and froze me out but I didn't have to start the levels all over again, it saved my progress when I rebooted it. The whole game is a bit short though with only 25 levels, I completed the game in around 3-4 hours. It could be a little bit more polished but it isn't really that expensive so you can't expect everything. I didn't find the controls too bad, although some reviews have said they are rubbish and the in game sounds do get a little annoying.\n\nOverall it's a fun but short game, I personally think it's worth the money and all in all was pretty happy with it. Highly recommend downloading the free demo first with 4 levels to play, therefore if you like it you will most likely buy the complete game. 7/10","January 8, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

You have to get a little wheel onto a platform, to do this you will use various intractable objects such as cubes,planks and planks that defy gravity. Sounds easy? NO. I am not ashamed to say I didn't do the level 1 on my first try but once I got a feel for how the game works it wasn't to hard.\n\nThe game includes 25 levels all with different puzzles that will make you think, you might have to make a seesaw and launch the wheel over to the platform or maybe drop the cube to push the wheel. If you studied mechanics then that should give you a leg up on the competition but don't worry its not required. If getting something wrong annoys you and then just give up then you probably won't get very far with this game.\n\nThe game doesn't have music it has mechanical sounds to really get you to feel like you are inside a machine(everyone's dream come true, I'm sure). The game is 3D but you can only interact in 2D fortunately but you can sometimes have spinning cubes and wheels rotating and landing on their sides.\n\nAs for the looks of the game the machine is old so things are a bit rusted in there so if you don't like the colour orange your out of luck, there are some other colours though so don't worry. The game looks like an old machine as it should with big moving gears and floating platforms.\n\nObviously this game isn't for everyone, if you do not like puzzles then you probably won't like a physics puzzle game. The game can annoy you but also make you think and completing a hard level can make you give yourself a pat on the back or if you are really stuck I am sure some people will do walkthroughs/guides.\n\nThe game has no tutorial so you are just thrown straight into the puzzles there is no holding your hand here, to find the controls just look under help which the game tells you to do.\n\nto summarize I believe the game is well made as I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches, depending on your skill level the game could take you several hours or if you have know what you are doing it could take you just 1.\n\nThe game is fun if you enjoy puzzles and obviously not fun if you do not, for the price it is easily worth it to pick up. I give this 8/10 clearly a well made puzzle game with a high enough difficulty to keep people thinking.\noriginal post\nhttps://gamingmalarkeyreviews.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=37&action=edit&message=6&postpost=v2","November 22, 2014","true","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I was a huge fan of them on iOS, playing games like Amazing Alex and Stair Dismount. Inside the Gear adds another layer to the genre, with a slight amount of story and some great mechanics.\n\nInside the Gear is very hard. An hour into the game, and I was only up to the third level, out of the twenty-five available. Trial and error are your best bets for success, and trying to roll the small wheel onto the platform was a challenge that was sometimes completed by a mere fluke. Once that level is finished though, you are presented with something even more complex, testing you to your limits even further. Although these are very complex at times, I never felt like I was achieving anything, and it sometimes began to become a drag playing through basically the same space, just with different objects.\n\nThe shapes used as transport for the "wheel" are basic, from passive and hostile planes, to cubes and triangular prisms. Everything is presented in a 3D platforming perspective, and portrays itself in a whimsical mechanism known as "the Gear", an old contraption of noise and steam.  Sparks would often fly up from the ground, spraying into the space. The Gear's colour palette are mostly oranges and reds, with a few yellows and pinks dabbled with here and there. They keep the game feeling warm and inviting, but at the same time, all the levels' backgrounds looked similar in aesthetics, so I never felt like I was progressing to a new area, despite the game's increasingly difficult level design.\n\nInside the Gear's menu is also something that could use a bit of sprucing up. There are no graphics options, so playing with a slower PC is difficult when you can't change the settings. There was an informative help option, but there was nothing to help you in the inevitable position where you were stuck on a certain stage.\n\nThe wonderful sound in Inside the Gear is definitely mentionable. The background movements of gears and cogs turning and whirring parts gave it a general feeling that you are actually inside a "living" thing, and your interaction with it manipulates it in some way. My only problem was that in the menu, the same sounds were repeated and got slightly irritating when navigating through it.\n\nInside the Gear is a game that lives up to its title, delivering some very challenging puzzles that will test your ability. It is worth noting its soundtrack, which is simple but well-fitting, and the great animation used to set the scene for what is otherwise a game that will keep you interested for a short time, but after can become a grind to play through.","December 15, 2014","true","1.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Sure, people can just click random buttons to see what does what, but it'd be nice if there was on-screen help when you start.  The background/ambient  noises was okay at first, then it got very annoying. (morea about this later)  The menu buttons can only be navigated with the arrow keys, something I still don't understand,  Why make it just arrow keys?\n\nI'm terrible with them, but I absolutely love puzzle games.  I love that they make your brain work, and I love that you actually have to plan out what you're going to do before you do it.  However, that isn't really the case in this game.  Some of the puzzles were a little challenging, but most were the same thing with no real change.\n\nMoving on, unfortunately, you are unable to alt-tab the game.  This is a pretty big annoyance, especially when the game FORCES itself back up onto the screen when you do manage to alt tab.  As much as we want to, we can't have the game open all the time without interruptions.\n\nGraphically the game is okay.  Graphics aren't anything special, but they are good enough for this specific game and what it's doing.  As per gameplay, the physics are really out of whack.  For example, when the wheel rolls down hill, it loses momentum.  If the gear falls, it hops around.\n\nA struggle of this game is trying to find reason to keep playing it.  After about 5-10 minutes, it starts to get boring.  The game just isn't exciting enough, and there's nothing else going on in-game aside from you messing with the objects.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nGood graphics.\n\nGameplay is very simple.\n\nCheap, a good title just to have in your library.\n\nNegatives:\n\nNo options to change music volume.\n\nBad HUD.\n\nDefault game sounds end up being annoying after a while.\n\nUnrealistic physics.\n\nNo adapting or advance in the puzzles.  They are all identical.\n\nCan't use the mouse for anything.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","March 31","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
