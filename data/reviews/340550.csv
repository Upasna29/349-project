Also the art is good and cards are well designed in every way.\n\nHowever the game suffers from bad core mechanics. The draw mechanic makes the game very luck based. You often end up with your hand full of cards which you can't play. Currently there is no way to discard cards from your hand, although this seems to be in development for the next version.\n\nThere no multiplayer, deck building, tutorial or even main menu currently.\n\nIt seems like a demo or a prototype of a good game.\n","January 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","1"

There is no deck creation and there is no ability to choose anything in your deck. Everything in the game is a matter of pure randomness of what you get.  Maybe you get 20 action cards for 20 rounds in a row and you lose by default.  Maybe that happens to the computer.  At the end of the day in a strategy game you should feel like you deserved to win it, not that randomness handed it over to you.\n\nThe game is very limited in what it can do and has no menues.  No menues means on multiplayer, no game modes, no challenges, no achievements, and no real room for expansion.  If you're thinking that this is a risky buy, don't buy it.  It's really just a one time playthrough until you realize how loaded the literal cards are.\n\nIf you go to their website they announced that instead of implementing features people want into this game they're just going to make a new one with them.  This game will never be worth your time.","January 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

It's such a simplistic concept with the only real game mechanics being playing the random cards you get and waiting. The requirements to win are also randomly generated, but not balanced, so sometimes you'll just have a way lower or higher requirement than your opponent.\n\nIt's a nice concept, but it needs a lot more work, or at least some work in order to be enjoyable.

The mechanics of the game are relatively simple and not a whole lot of explanation is required to understand what you must do which is a good thing, because card-battling games at times can get VERY complex.\n\nThe premise is simple, you're assigned a video game project to work on, and each department needs a certain number of completed tasks, and ultimately once each task has its required number you win.  The game's cards represent these tasks, and how many turns are required to complete each one, and there are also counter-cards to make the AI opponent's life a little bit more difficult, by delaying his tasks, or throwing on more tasks for it to complete to ultimately win.\n\nI'm a card-battling junkie when it comes to PC games and I've played my fair share of them, and this fits into my collection nicely.  If I was to have any complaint at all towards this game it would be that it would greatly benefit from online multiplayer, but a minor setback when the price is considered, I'm definitely getting what I'm paying for and have already gotten my moneys worth outside of Steam.","January 1, 2015","true","2.8"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

The problem is that its only okay for a couple of playthroughs and you'll have explored all that there is to see. Most games will just consist of playing all cards that you are given, with fairly minimal chance for strategy. Not only that, but the only option is to play against the computer. It would be nice to have a 2 player mode (ANY, doesn't need to be an online one, but that would surely help!).\n\nOn top of that, from what Ive gathered, it appears that the players share a single deck of cards. This may mean that you'll never get any of the "good" cards needed. A better option would be to have two seperate decks that play against each other instead.\n\nAnd finally. As there's already been a couple of times where I'm unable to play any cards. An extra option (that is apparently already being added) would be to have the option to discard and recollect your whole hand of cards. Other than that, I can't think of too much that would improve the actual strategy side of this game that could make it more worthwhile.\n\nSOooo... whilst I PERSONALLY can't recommend it so much. It IS an okay game so long as you're not expecting too much depth with it. Then again, it IS fairly cheap and won't damage your wallet too much.","January 23, 2015","false","5.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

If you are a game developer in a large company, this game will surely make you smile.

You play against the AI and the first player to complete all of his game tasks wins. There is no deck customization of any kind which I could see. The main issue with the game is that it's extremely based on luck (if you don't draw the right card, you will never win), but at least you can get a laugh out of it.

The concept is solid, though, if you like single-player card games like Dead Man's Draw.

This is a card game where the goal is to develop a game. You have to complete your tasks (programming, design, ...) before your opponent. A fair analogy: imagine a partformer where you can not move. The design is that much flawed.\n\nFirst of all the game is too random. Completing a tasks requires you to have the right cards, if you don't you'll spent lots and lots of turns waiting for it. Even if you were way in advance, you may loose just because that silly card does not want to show up.\n\nAfter each turn, the game refills your hand. The less card you have remaining, the more you get at the begining of the game.

It has the right card at the right time and the most powerfull cards much more often than you. This is not challenging, this is a boring bad design.\n\nThis is so sad to see a good concept like this one, completely wasted because of so obvious flaws that make the game unenjoyable.

Besides the lack of multiplayer and an actual main menu, the game is frustrating to play because there is no skill involved in playing the game. Whether or not you can beat the AI player or not is entirely dependant on the cards that you get, and there are several times that you get screwed over by the luck of the draw.\n\nIn this game you try to complete a set of tasks by playing developer cards and keep them active for a number of turns for them to complete the task. There are Programmers, Artists, Sound Engineers, Designers, and Testers. There are also a set of cards that can halt certain or all tasks for a set number of turns, cards that can add tasks to your opponents game or remove tasks from your own game, cards that can add additional turns to tasks or complete all tasks on your side.\n\nThere are 2 main problems with the actual gameplay of this game. 1) There are too many OP cards. The cards that finish all your tasks that you currently have devs working on is huge, because it can complete up to 5 tasks at once, which with the number of tasks needed for each game, is a massive leap for the player. Another OP card are the ones that freeze all tasks for a number of turns that can only be counteracted by a specific IT card, and if you do not have one of those, then you can spend up to 3 turns just doing nothing, which is big. 2) There is no skill and everything is random. I can't tell you the number of times that I needed a specific developer type to finish that last task for my game, and turn after turn would go by and I would not get it, and if I finally did get it, the AI would play a card that would either incapacitate them for a number of turns or get rid of them altogether.\n\nFrom my perspective, Crunch Time is a game that needs a lot more playtesting so that the devs can get it right. If they want to keep it more of a single deck of cards card game, they need to increase the frequency of the developer cards as well as modify or remove the OP cards, and they would absolutely need to make the game multiplayer. The game just isn't that fun playing against a computer that you can't call an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing a Servers Down card. Personally, I feel that it would be better if the devs pivoted and made it more of a CCG, so that players have some agency over the cards they have and make the game more skill based. This would require a massive reworking of the mechanics, but I think the game would be better served by that change.","February 27, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As all the other reviews have said, there's no deck building or even choice of decks. That would be fine if this used a Spectromancer style system where all your cards are on the table, but instead you just have to hope you draw what you need out of the mystery deck. The only limit on cards is that you can normally play only one type of developer card per turn. There's no option to discard, so you need to play multiple cards a turn to maximize your card draw. But it's possible to end up with a hand full of defensive cards that can't be played until your opponent does something specific, leaving you stuck with a hand full of garbage while he destroys you. Very powerful cards have no resource cost to balance them against weaker cards. Some enemy attack cards can only be countered by a specific person, but all the people who work in that department have the same art. The cards' flavor text is in the same font as its explanation text. The music is awful, and you have to mute the game entirely to turn it off (the sound effects are OK). This game is so obviously broken that the only thing that got me to finish a full match was the programmer humor, which is its only redeeming quality.","July 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Neither is this game. It's been said in other reviews that it's completely luck based and they're right. No matter how many cards you play you draw up to a full hand again on your next turn so it's not a matter of what you play but how many cards you can just throw in at once.\n\nI thought it would at least be a funny game but many jokes are hit and miss. Even worse if you're not familiar with game development processes.\n\nThe biggest shock was there was no menu. I thought it might just throw you into a game for the first time you start it up as a tutorial but that's really all there is to it. No customisation. After one game you would have exhausted all of the cards that are interesting but there's no strategy to fall back on for replay value. Luckily I figured out how to quit the game pretty quickly by holding down the escape key but if you don't figure it out you're trapped playing this game wondering why pressing escape doesn't take you back to the nonexistent menu.","January 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You win by scoring the required number of points in each of the 5 categories.\n\nYou can interfere with your opponent by playing "bugs" that freeze some or all of your opponents cards for 1-3 turns, which delays their scoring.\n\nThe problem comes in that you get at least 5 cards in your hand, but there are certain cards you can't play or discard in most situations. This leads to situations where you have 4 dead cards in your hand each turn only to draw one card you can play. It leads to a very difficult situation where you're just playing every card you get and can't do anything strategic.\n\nLike I said, the game ends up not being fun because of these fundamental game design flaws. It's not a terrible game, but not something that you'll likely find yourself coming back to again and again.","October 27, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
