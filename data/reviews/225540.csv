Also like a 10 second cutscene everytime you wanted to fast travel or get a weapons drop\n-Heavy weapons that explode things in different ways\n-graphics are pretty\n-lots of collectables, one of them being audio tapes that give some backstory to the main antagonist's rise to power\n-The trains are awesome and I spent a lot of time causing crashes and derails. (WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE TRAIN MISSION? SO MUCH POTENTIAL THERE)\n-Rebel vs Army battles (only 3 in the game sadly) Fighting 10 enemy tanks in your own tank is pretty fun\n\nThe leaderboards and challegenes are pretty controversial, mainly for being psudo multiplayer. (The JC2 multiplayer mod was seen as welcome addition and left people wondering why it wasn't included in the game.)\nIt seems the devs just got bored and said "players like multiplayer so lets give them arbitrary leaderboards"\n\nCons\n-Liberating settlements is cookie cutter as ♥♥♥♥. For towns theres almost always a police station to liberate and a handfull of propaganda structures to destroy just like every other city in the game.\n-Enemy AI could use some work. For example if you hover in a helicopter near a cliff the AI will just drive off the cliff to their deaths trying to get to you.\n-Cutscenes, why not let me crash the evil missile instead of watching Rico do it in a cutscene?\n-Story missions are bland and really easy.\n-No cool landmarks like the night club balloon, the highrise cities, and the highrise towers in JC2. No diversity in what the towns and cities look like.\n-Only a handful of sports cars that go over 160 km/h\n-SAM trailers and bridges regenerate if you leave the area (more specifically when you leave rendering distance in a helicopter or jet, fly up too high and the bridge comes back)\n-Cool gameplay features like battles and the train mission are few and limited.\n-No tanks with tracks they all have wheels. :)\n\nTL/DR if you enjoyed JC2, you will feel right at home with this game. If you want a sandbox to blow everything up wait for the game to go on sale (and more DLC).\n\n*SKYFORTRESS DEE ELL CEE*\n3/10\n\n+Powered Jetpack/wingsuit is cool\n+???\n\n-A paltry 3 missions\n-Last mission is super easy with nuke launcher, like 3 shots and gg dlc over. Why even let me stand there and shoot the things if you want me to fly like Buzz Lightyear to shoot it instead?\n-3 drone types\n-4 challenges 3 wingsuit 1 drone killing\n-Entire DLC would take 1-2 hours to complete\n-new pew pew laser gun is super innacurate. spray is all over the place\n\nTL:DR\nFor 12 dollars you get\n-jetpack\n-a crap gun\n-4 challenges","December 20, 2015","true","62.9"," 760 of 887 people (86%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","86","760","887","104","27"

You can't trust him, he's abusing drugs and hits on your wife (or hubby). But he's more fun at parties than accountant-brother.\n\nThe good (what to love):\nIt's just "Just Cause 2" but more of the lovely stuff, even less serious, and even more hillarious physics\nThe new tethering-stuff is an awesome pool of crazy, twisted and even horribly mean fun\nThe wingsuit/parasuit enable for nearly endless flying\nBlowing up stuff has never been so much fun. Place C4 at the right spots, detonate them, watch all come down.\nRealism? Not in the slightest!\nLeaderboards with a very nice feature: Race the ghost of your friends (or others). You select someone else from the leaderboards, and start the challenge. It's like multiplayer but solo :-)\nMods (though not officially and only a handful right now, but some more will surely come)\nPerforms pretty well and still looks decent for 2015 (yes I know, seems I'm lucky here)\nBetter (but still not perfect) car-handling\nBeautiful italian setting\nLarge open-world fun\nCollectibles like audiotapes, cards, vintage-parts. Enough to keep collectors busy\nWant to punish your minions? Tether to feet and tower. Retract. Laugh evilish. If there would be any limb separation you could quarter them with 4 tethers :-)\nThe mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):\nChallenges. You don't HAVE to do them, but if you want all those gadgets and goodies and abilities, you'll sadly have to do them. And win them if possible (5-Star). Funny for the first time but some tend to be frustratingly hard. At least for me :-)\nAfter around 15hrs I only had one bug where the car I was driving suddenly dissapeared. Been more funny than annoying though. Beside this I only had very minor glitches with the tethering.\nStupid, unskippable lengthy intro. (Edit: Thanks to mods, you now can...) Animals are pathetic. One wrong look and they drop dead. Walked into a deer. Deer dropped dead. Walked into a goat. Goat dropped dead.\nThe ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):\nEnemies spawn. Sometimes you kill two guards on the 5m² top of a damn high tower, turn around and there they are again. HORRIBLE, ANNOYING and a real showstopper\nSeason-pass-bullcrap again. Please stop this pandemic brainfart\nKilling EVERYONE does not matter at all. Kill a dozen rebels in front of other rebels and they still yell "Yay! Rico! Make me babies! Prego!"\nThough I can't complain at all, according to the mixed reviews and general critics, it has many bugs, flaws and runs crappy on AMD\nCan't remap controller but keyboard. Half-done job\n\nRecommended?\n\nIf you liked JC1+2 and enjoy the mindless, phsyics-defying destruction-rampage: YES.\nIf you already found JC2 to be too silly, unbelievable and unrealistic: HELL NO!\n\nIt may not be perfect, it may have some problems, but beside the spawning-horror and the more-or-less forced challenges it's a damn funny and mindless ride!\nI cannot understand the "mixed" ratings except they're mostly because of the technical problems it may have (which I cannot judge). It's a worthy successor in a\nbeautiful environment and it "upped" Rico from a guy with a grappling-hook to basically Ironman without the suit. It sometimes even felt like "Prototype" :-)\n\nAs far as I am in this game: Not one crash, no annoying glitches, no game-breaking bugs. Had expected much worse!\n\nAccording to other reviews, you may wait for at least the first patch if you own any AMD-Hardware though :(","December 6, 2015","true","43.6"," 702 of 845 people (83%) found this review helpful 185 people found this review funny","83","702","845","185","60"

I would both recommend and also discourage people to buy/not buy this, but I could only chose one option so please read on to see why!\n\n\nPerformance - Does it run?\n\nAfter an initial drama with getting it to run at my native resolution - the game crashed every time I switched res and eventually I had to change it in the config file to get it to load - on my machine yes it does, and very very well.. However I'm lucky enough to have just upgraded to the following:\n\ni7 6700k @ Stock 4.0GHz\nAsus Maximus VIII Hero Mobo\n16GB G.Skill Ripjaws V 3000MHz\nMSI GTX 980Ti Gaming 6G\n\nNow I realise this is at the upper end of the hardware scale, and if you're in a position similar to me you can expect to be able to play at a minimum of 100fps (average of ~130) on 1080p with every setting on maximum, so I'm expecting 80-90 on 1440p when I get a new monitor in a couple of weeks (will update with the actual figure).\n\nThe game seems to be a bit of a memory hog and while playing it my system uses about 8.2GB with just the game and a few google chrome tabs open, so this could potentially be an issue for people with less.\n\nAs others have commented, the initial game loading times are quite slow (using an SSD), however once the map is loaded in, the missions etc load very quickly.\n\n\nGameplay / Feel\n\nI've only played 5 hours but this is my 2c so far..\n\nThe game looks jaw dropping and if I'm honest is half the reason I bought it, to see what my new system was capable of. I messed around a bit with lowering some of the graphic settings and with a lot of them the quality of the game doesn't decrease too much and you can gain a few fps by doing this, so I wouldn't be worried about how its going to look if you play at medium etc - it will still be incredibly pretty.\n\nAfter getting over the initial oooooo this is pretty thoughts, the actual game itself is fun in the respect of being able to mindlessly blow things up and fly about like a super-spider-bat-man kind of combo thing (it's bizarre!) It's fun jumping in a tank and blowing up a petrol station, or in a helicopter that has infinite spammable missiles, or planting mines on a bridge, then causing a pile up before blowing the whole thing up etc etc...\n\nRegarding the campaign / story, well to me (admittedly a Just Cause noob) the premise is a bit thin.. a dictator has gone a bit mental and therefore we need to crush him and his minions by taking over towns, then more towns, and a few more, and then a couple more after that.. you get the point. These towns are all just clones of one another and there are only so many "fun and creative" ways to shoot, blow up, or pull down yet another identical red billboard or telegraph pole in order to take over the 100000th one.\n\nI know already I wont be able to stomach completing the story as its simply just too damn repetitive. The side missions to upgrade your perks etc are sort of fun, but really not challenging enough to take seriously.\n\nThe cars in the game are HORRENDOUS to control, by either a keyboard or a controller, they just plain suck. The heli's are much more fun, but a bit too EZ-MODE. I've had the most fun just cruising around on my parachute & wingsuit (which is a good laugh when you get the hang of it) and getting up to random mischief - such as slingshotting people with the tether device combined with booster bombs and seeing how far someone can fly without a parachute! Again though, this will only last so long, and after it wears thin I probably wont log back in as it just doesn't have enough pull to keep me interested.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n+If you have some decent PC hardware (that doesn't include an AMD gpu (sorry guys!)) then the game *should* run ok, and hopefully even better after a patch. If this is the case for you, you will be treated to a super pretty game with a MASSIVE world to go mental in.\n+If you are the type of person to roam about on GTA and just randomly cause chaos you will no doubt love this game, as nothing will compare to the madness you can create.\n+If you're the type of person who enjoys a good story with engaging, challenging and varied game play too, you should probably pass at least until its in a steam sale, as you will soon find it tedious and frustratingly repetitive for the £40 price tag!\n\n\nI hope this has helped at least someone! Please comment below if you found this useful, or alternatively crap! Please feel free to let me know what I could have done to improve this, if anything!\n\nThumbs up if you like and down if you don't!\n\nCheers.","December 8, 2015","true","23.0"," 518 of 642 people (81%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","81","518","642","43","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/davoz28/recommended/225540/","davoz28","RvB Caboose #warriornation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/davoz28/","3139 products in account","Steam really needs a one thumb up and one thumb down option. I love Just Cause, so I was really excited about this release. Especially when they talked about improving the driving physics and other tweaks to make gameplay better. JC has one of the most fun open world environments, and is a great destructive sandbox. Unfortunately in my small gameplay time so far, there are a lot of cons.\n\n1) You still move like you have one leg. As you turn you spin, in a 360degree fashion, not just simply turn. This makes for awkward movement when you need to face and activate an object.\n\n2)Driving is still a negative. While DRASTICALLY improved over JC2, there is still a lot of work to be done here. Instead of fast paced and moving on ice as in JC2, JC3 is a slowed down drive on sticky tarmac. Turning is slow at first then exagerated to the left or right very quickly.\n\n3)Controller/keyboard controls. I have to use both. I use the controller for general movement and the mouse for aiming/shooting. Neither one performs exceptionally well on their own so I've found a compromise and use both.\n\n4)The map is not very informative. Also, in doing the missions, you have to be close to your objectives if they are in white. (Things you need to do to control settlements.) Yellow indicators appear from any location and are easy to find your destination. Once you are there however, they become white, and are things you need to explode or activate to complete your mission, and can be a pain to find.\n\n5)Enemies seem to pop in out of thin air sometimes. Not from a great distance mind you one time it happened from 10 feet away.\n\n6)The leaderboard function. Both a Pro and a Con here. Con is anytime logging in it takes a bit longer with this feature active, popups can get annoying.\n\n7)It seems AMD users are having problems with some texture popin and textures failing to load. AMD users need to stay away until a patch is introduced for you guys.  I did not experience this with my Nvidia EVGA 980Ti SC ACX+\nSquare_Jason has been active reguarding this problem http://steamcommunity.com/app/225540/discussions/0/485623406959941125/\n\nPros\n1)Graphics. The game looks very nice.\n\n2)Performance. Im running a single 980Ti in 4k@60 fps with absolutely no frame drops. It's a very solid performer.\n\n3)The leaderboard function. Both a Pro and a Con, it's fun seeing what your friends do in game and trying to beat them.\n\n4)Destruction. Very fun to blow things up still and very many creative ways of doing it, from grappling, grapple tether, guns, bombs, cars, planes, etc.\n\n5)Open world sandbox. This is the bread and butter of Just Cause, and with 1000km2 of open world to explore it delivers again.\n\nSIDENOTE: The airstrikes the enemy calls on you are REALLY ANNOYING...they have amazing accuracy on moving targets. Use this to your advantage! Stand next to a target, let them bomb missiles on their own equipment! Rinse and repeat to take out settlements without firing a single rocket.\n\nSPECS: i7 4930k, 32g ram, EVGA 980Ti SC ACX+ , ASUS 4k monitor @60 fps\n\n\nThese will get updated as I continue playing, and while there are a ton of negatives it is still JC and a very fun game to play.\n\nDespite all of these negatives it's a very fun game. 7/10 so far.","November 30, 2015","true","77.8"," 700 of 1,000 people (70%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","70","700","1","47","35"

In that time, I’ve done 54% of the challenges, liberated all provinces, found all collectibles and beaten the game.\n\nIt has had its ups and downs, but overall, the game works. Yes, it stutters. Yes, it’s beyond poorly optimized, but it’s still a fun, if overly repetitive, game.\n\nI played this on an i7-4790k with 8GB of RAM and a GTX 980 Ti. After about two hours, the game would get stuttery, and the audio would stutter as well. Simple solution for me (not guaranteed to work) was to alt+tab out of the game, tab back in, and it worked fine for another couple of hours. Only twice did I have to quit out of the game and restart it to clear any stutter issues.\n\nThat said, if you’re still interested in the game in its current state (as of this review), continue on. If not, perhaps come back to the game after a patch or two and decide if it is worth it for you to buy then.\n\nProsJust plain fun to blow things up constantly\nBig open world\nLots to do (races, frenzies, wingsuiting, etc.)\nOpportunity to create unique situations with physics and the upgrades available to you\nFairly lengthy, will take you a bit to finish\nThe world looks very good on max settings\nMusic and sound effects, for the most part\nLots of collectibles which reward unique vehicles or weapons\nConsStory is as bland as it can get, and been done countless times before; same goes for the dialogue\nPoorly optimized; beefy systems will stutter\nRepetitive; not much variety to the bases or towns aside from new things being added (early bases may not have monitoring systems while later ones will, for example)\nMain story and upgrades become gated behind the challenges, which make them necessary as opposed to optional\nCharacter models are bland, and enemies all look alike (regular soldier looks like every other, armored one looks like every other armored soldier, etc.)\nSummaryThe game is not without its issues. You could have a powerful system and still succumb to sub-30FPS without horrendous audio and visual stuttering. On the flip side, you could have a mid-range system and not have many issues at all.\n\nTaken without its issues, Just Cause 3 is still a fun game. It’s best played in chunks, because the repetition will tire you if you were to play it for hours straight.\n\nFinally, I recommend Just Cause 3 because when it works, it’s pure fun. There’s something to be said for arcadey games in today’s world, when a heavy focus is on strategy and realism, and with its insane explosions and aerial traversing, Just Cause 3 has arcadey in spades.","December 14, 2015","true","49.9"," 155 of 209 people (74%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","74","155","209","15","4"

From almost the start you can do almost anything and go anywhere. Wanna explore a vast, beautiful vibrant world? Go ahead.\nWant to blow blow stuff up and cause chaos? This game was made for that!\n\nWhat i really appreciate about this game, is that they have listened to the community on what worked and what didnt work in JC2. They also implemeted mods from JC2 into this game, and have made JC3 better in almost every way.\n\nThe gameplay is great. With a collection of unique weapons, you can wreck havoc on the beautiful island of Medici. Plus, the addition of the wingsuit, is now one of my favorite ways of moving around in any game.\n\nThe story is somewhat lacking though, and i feel that JC2´s story is actually stronger than this one. The story missions arnt as great as JC2´s story missions, as they tend to feel a bit samy after a while, and i remember JC2´s story a lot more than i feel i will remember this one.\n\nThe game also still have some problems, with occasional stutters, crashes and glitches, but not enough to really detract from the overall experience.\n\nAll in all:\n\nPros\n\n- Its fun to blow stuff up\n- Lots of stuff to do (Wingsuit, races, explosion-challenges)\n- Theather\n- Giant, open, beautiful world\n- Again, really beautiful world, fantastic explosions and effects\n- Music is good, nothing really special, but good\n- The physics engine opens up great possibilities\n\nCons\n\n- Story is bad, not membrable\n- Bad launch, not big problem now, still have to add\n- Can become repetetive, depends on the person\n- Minor problems, gated upgrades(can be annoying), some ocational input lag, slight popin(Depends on PC)","December 19, 2015","true","35.6"," 128 of 169 people (76%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","76","128","169","16","2"

If you're anything like me, you'll enjoy spending hours mindlessly dicking around with explosions, physics and stunts and this game gives you ample means to do so.\n\nMy impression is good so far, I'm having a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to spending lots of time messing around. If you buy this game expecting a deep and introspective work of art, look elsewhere. If you buy it and are looking for a fun game to experiment with and show your friends, this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful graphics and map design (love the vivid colors, lush landscapes and the sea is gorgeous.)\n- Very fun gameplay (explosions, flying, and killing, oh my)\n- Lots to work towards if you are a completionist\n- Non-linear so you can progress past the missions or ignore them altogether after a point\n- Lots of Easter Eggs\n- Civilian cars can be captured and then ordered via black market supply drops\n- Lots of models of cars, planes, tanks, and weapons to use\n- Super corny voice-acting (JC staple)\n- Sound effects are high quality\n- Visual effects are stunning\n- The new Wingsuit navigates really smoothly and is very fun once you get the hang of it\n\nCons:\n- Occasional bugs (nothing game-breaking for me as of yet, but I've had to restart a few missions due to bugged objectives)\n- Physics are wonky as hell (can be a pro in some cases, it's more geared towards fun than realism but mostly proves clunky and strange)\n- Driving has some of the worst physics I've come across in any game (motorcycles are nearly impossible to drive)\n- Moving rico around can be a hassle and interacting with vehicles or items can be a pain\n- Not much depth story or character wise, but this is to be expected\n- Always online can prove to be a nuisance if your connection is spotty (constant reconnection attempts)\n\nAll in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone considering it who knows what they are in for in a Just Cause game. I will update this review as I put in more hours.\n\nSpecs:\n- i7-4790k\n- 16 gb ram\n- Nvidia 980\n- Windows 8\n- 7200 rpm HD\n- 1440p monitor\n\nPerformance:\n- Stable fps around 40-50 on very high settings @ 1440p\n- Load times take around 10-20 seconds per cut scene (not ideal but it isn't on my ssd so it's expected)\n\nThanks for reading!","November 30, 2015","true","49.1"," 351 of 519 people (68%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","68","351","519","18","13"

Rico's massive open world home Medici is suffering under the typical dictator, who is oppressing his people, and threatens the whole world with his bavarium weapon production. It's obvious that the CIA is looking to get in on that too. Only Rico is in the way.\n\n\nGameplay\nIn the struggles against the dictator you must support the rebels of Medici by freeing over 130 villages, cities, outposts, oil rigs, and military camps by wreaking havoc. In addition to that, you must deal with countless singleplayer missions, challenges as well as sidequests.\nFor these tasks, you are provided with all sorts of weapons, vehicles, and gadgets. It's up to you whether you use a car, motorcycle, boat, plane, helicopter, parachute, wingsuit or your grappling hook for progression. The possibilities are endless.\n\nSadly the leveling system of Rico is both limited and almost pointless, since he is already very good at everything, but still you can unlock "upgrade-mods" through completing challenges. These go all the way from target practice to racing.\n\n\n\nPros:  Gigantic open world leaving the players their freedom of action.\nThe story mode with 25 missions is done very well, and offers a variety of action.\nLasting enjoyment in the gameplay thanks to the map's size, liberty of the player, the numerous singleplayer missions, Steam achievements, sidequests, 130 villages/camps, that are to be liberated, and tons of challenges.\nPhenomenal graphics, especially the explosions look amazing.\nIdeal handling with both controller and keyboard. You can bind all keys individually.\nVertical movement. You can fly, drive, walk, swim or dive. Great!\nA great repertoire of cars, tanks, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and planes.\nRealistic sound effects.\nFunny radio hosts, and by now bug free.\nNeutral:  The released game was extremely buggy. Some AMD graphics cards didn't work, there were problems with processors and much more. By now all's fixed.\nThe main character's supposed to be "cool", but his quotes are really just lame.\nThere's barely any music in the game, but somehow it doesn't harm the gameplay, since there are radio hosts, evermore explosions and shootouts with amazing sound effects.\nCons: Always online DRM isn't just annoying, because Steam often suffers from server issues. It also costs performance.\nNo Steam cloud\nSadly no Multiplayer\n\nConclusion:\nEven if DRM is annoying, Just Cause 3 is a gigantic open world must-have game that mustn't be missing from any collection.\n\nThis review was written as a valuation inside of its own genre.\n\n\nTotal rating: 8,5/10\n\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 25","true","48.6"," 284 of 423 people (67%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","67","284","423","26","34"

If you want a TL;DR, skip to the end.\n\nImprovements over JC2:\n-AI is a bit better than in JC2. They attempt to hide and call for reinforcement when all of his friends were killed. AI also spawn tanks now so you actually have to be slightly more aware when tanks are around\n-explosion. This is a huge improvement over JC2, no question.\n-aircraft. Instead of having 2 similar combat planes in JC2 that had a machine gun and rocket, the air combat is a bit better because there's a more dedicated bomber for those who love to drop bomb, and a fighter craft that has guided missile that hit both air and ground.\n-more traffic. driving around make you realize Medicci is more populated than Panau\n-wingsuit, one of the selling point of this game\n-multiple grappler hook that you can force it to pull. now you can just cause helicopters to crash with a tether or 2\n-a few more guns/weapon than JC2, a bit more interesting choice for weapons than JC2, but that's mostly because of the 3 super weapon(airstrike, EMP, and mini nuke) that you can choose later on as you progress through the story.\n-doge mode(look up on youtube for this easter egg). "much 2nd amendment". LoL\n\nwhat this game did wrong:\n-no minimap. Like what was this development team thinking? Often you'd have to open up you map to see where nearby things are at, this is very painful. Also the lack of minimap made the AI a pain, which lead up to my next point:\n-AI spawn, is a PAIN in the butt. Basically when they removed the minimap, they made it so you cannot see where the military reinforcement is coming compare to JC2, thus 9/10 AI spawns tend to be not where you're looking, so often when you're fighting 10 guys and suddenly you realize you were shot behind. You turn around and see a combat jeep with 4 guys just spawn, despite that behind you is actually a friendly army base.\n-air combat. Yes I did mention air combat was an improvement over JC2, but that's because JC2 barely had any air combat(not including multiplayer mod). In this game, besides the main story, where the air combats are all scripted in the story, there is no aircraft AI for JC3. Getting your self to level 4/5 heat in a fighter or a bomber, and guess what? The game decide to spawn tanks for you to blow up. The game won't spawn fighter craft to engage you. So you can keep your dream for air to air combat till at least JC4(or unless someone can create a mod this).\n-DRIVING require fixing, especially for motocycle. You cannot control the motocycle with a keyboard at all, PERIOD. Even when you're driving straight, the tiniest bump will cause havok and make you lose control. Also applying the nitro booster on a motocycle and you're asking for a traffic accident.\n-challenges. Basically challenges are just tiny minigames, usually involved with time trial/explosion highscore... etc. However they're not particularly exciting to do, and often you need to retry, but the load time isn't particularly fast, which makes challenges some-what frustrating. Also challenges are pretty much manditory to do, because you need to do challenge to unlock gear mods(gear mods basically modifies certain mechanics, like giving you stronger grappling hook, more grenades to carry, giving nitro booster to rebel drop vehicles... etc), and to get maximum fun, you need those gear mods. Challenges should have been optional. Best get a mod to give you all the gears so you don't have to do them.\n-rebel drop. Basically rebel drop is the replacement to your JC2 equipment/vehicle request that Sheldon deliver to you, and they don't cost any credit(aka free, but this game don't have credit either). However 2 problems: rebel drop require you to first pick up a beacon, and second once you dropped your favourite vehicle/plane/boat, it goes on a LONG timer until you can drop that same vehicle again. Often your plane dropped somehow ends up 99% damaged and so not only you wasted a beacon, but your favourite plane is now on a long 30+minute cooldown. There is gear mod that remove the timer, but like I said, they're not really fun to unlock and it will take you quite awhile to unlock it.\n-always online. Yep steam DRM isn't enough, apparently you need to be online all the time to update the online leaderboard(that isn't even a global leaderboard). This "always online" not only can time-to-time kill your save file(if you didn't install your JC3 to the same hard drive as your windows O/S), drop your FPS, get spammed with people beating your record, and makes your loading longer. A temporary solution require you to put a firewall around your JC3.exe.\n\nTL;DR/summary:\nAnyways this game is a slight improvement over JC2, but it still has many problems to fix. I would not recommend this game at its current state. If you really want to play this game, then get it on 50% sale at least.\n\nEdit: I like to mention this is a soft negative as in this game can probably still fixed, but until it is done, I don't fully recommend this game unless its on a good sale(or fixed).","December 24, 2015","false","55.7"," 239 of 366 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","239","366","13","29"

That game oozed character and polish; this one completely lacks either.  Optimization issues aside, it's an "okay" action game; it's not a great Just Cause game.\n\n\n2015-12-11 UPDATE: A week and a half later and patches still haven't fixed the performance issues, but having twice the amount of recommended RAM apparently helps a ton for some people. I bumped up from 8GB to 16GB and get a pretty steady framerate and the stuttering is gone. That's on a system with a GTX 660Ti, which technically is under spec, yet I'm flying around the game at 60fps on High settings (I even got JC2 and JC3 running side by side, windowed, on the same machine, with playable framerates in both after adding the RAM).  Also, user-created mods are starting to emerge that fix annoyances like bypassing the stupidly long intro video and giving you access to more supply/vehicle drops to play around with.\n\nThe frustration with the issues below was magnified by the performance issues.  Having mitigated the latter, and having sunk almost 40 hours into the game, I've started to find workarounds for the unsavory design changes from JC2 that aren't intuitive or particularly user-friendly.  You just get used to it, but that doesn't make it better.  Being essentially an enjoyable 'Wing Suit Simulator 2015' aside, the rest of the game still has plenty of moments where it feels like a Gobot when you asked for a Transformer.  However, if you never played JC2, you won't miss what you never had.\n\nI still think JC2 has more polish and replayability for me, but if/when they finally patch out the performance issues, I'm on the fence enough at this point that I might change my recommendation to more favorable.  Optimization issues aside, it's an "okay" action game; it's not a great Just Cause game.  But for now, don't drop $60 on something optimized this badly.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nPros:\nWingsuit is pretty cool for a couple of hours, then it loses its novelty.\n\nCausing huge train wrecks is kinda fun.\n\nPrettiest fire and explosions I remember seeing in a game.\n\nRetracting tethers to rip things apart is enjoyable for a while.\n\nEquipment drops have been streamlined from JC2.\n\nReprogramming SAM launchers to fire on enemy choppers is nice.\n\nThe game tells you which objects still need to be destroyed or interacted with to capture a settlement or base, and the last few will even show up on the map if you're having trouble tracking them down.\n\nThe soundtrack is good at times, especially while using the wing suit.\n\n\nCons:\nYou can't remap the X360 controls in a game in 2015.  Please.\n\nThe FOV is too low and needs to be adjustable.\n\nYou can't skip the annoyingly long intro; noticed that RAM usage ramps up while it's playing, but there's still a bunch of loading even after that.\n\nThe always-online leaderboard stuff is amusing if you're into that, but it should be OPTIONAL.  The amount of stuttering and connection problems and gameplay interruptions it causes are inexcusable. Firewall the JC3 executable to turn that off for good without crippling Steam in offline mode.\n\nIn JC2, you had a shoot button and an explosives button.  You still have that, except that selecting C4 now makes you put your gun away. If you bring it back out, you auto-switch back to grenades, which is especially problematic once you unlock Glass Grenades because it's really easy to blow yourself up if you're not paying close attention to the stupid auto-switching of explosives they introduced. Grenades should be on a different button than C4 OR using a gun should not switch back to grenades.\n\nOn more than one occasion I have intentionally disabled some of the skills I had unlocked because they were getting me killed more than they were helping. What kind of skill system does that?\n\nObjective and incoming fire indicators are small and hard to see against the background. This is exacerbated by the removal of the minimap to tell where enemies were in relation to the player.\n\nCrouch, run, dive, and the melee grapple-whip attack are gone.\n\nThe acceleration and handling for most vehicles are slow and laggy.  Makes many of the challenges a nightmare to bother with, and you need those to unlock arbitrary "upgrades" that would be standard features in other games.\n\nThere's no way to just "drop" from wingsuiting like you can from parachuting. You unlock the wingsuit air brake later, but they hard-mapped it to the same button as release tether, something you want to use to gain speed while wingsuiting. It's fundamentally screwy.\n\nRandom frame drops and game freezing (presumably while loading...something) just make the vehicle and wingsuit handling that much more of an issue.  My 120fps will plummet to 4fps for no apparent reason, whenever the game feels like it.\n\nDescriptions for challenges can be misleading. I did better on a Sniper Rifle Challenge by stealing a helicopter and blowing everything up rather than actually, ya know, using a sniper rifle and shooting the absent-yet-hinted-at red barrels.  The description implies there's an intended way to do some of them when in reality you can just sort of screw around until you find a better way.\n\nLoad times for some challenges take longer than the challenges themselves. This makes retries really annoying.\n\nEverything feels so generic and soulless and half-hearted. The missions are lame and boring and the challenges are repetitive and uninspired.\n\nThe prerelease game footage is borderline bull-shots.  So many people are having massive performance issues compared to that produced footage.\n\nThe gunplay feels stale and boring. Bullet impacts don't feel significant, and enemies just sort of slump over.  Some even get back up unexpectedly.\n\nI still don't know how to tell how many beacons I have for supply drops without simply trying to initiate one.\n\nYou can drop C4 while parachuting, but you can't throw it while standing on the ground.  You have to literally be touching whatever you want to use it on.  Also, you can't set it off if you're inside a vehicle.  What?\n\nFinding tapes and shrines and stuff isn't as interesting because (IMO) the detector for those seems less sensitive and responsive than the one in JC2. I've circled entire city blocks looking for one more bar of "you're getting warmer" to just see it sit at three bars.\n\nCapturing every civilian car isn't interesting because the car handling sucks and why would you want to capture an underpowered Honda Civic to summon it for a mission?\n\nI miss the different factions of JC2. I've only seen one in JC3 so far, and they have zero personality.\n\nThere is so little story leading in that I don't even really care why I'm here. JC2 had you hunting down an arms dealer and rescuing a dork from a casino in high explosive fashion. In JC3, I guess I'm just here to overthrow a regime.\n\nThe damage model feels inconsistent.  I can take sustained fire from a chopper and walk away with minor damage, but take a couple shots from some random grunts at the wrong time and it's insta-death.  Similarly, you can wingsuit into a brick wall at full speed and shake it off, but if you zipline into barbed wire, insta-death.\n\nThere are so many moment-to-moment annoyances in the game that it makes me actively angry to play it. There's a good game buried in here somewhere, but big fans of the finer points of JC2 will have to suffer to find much fun here.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe whole thing is just such a disappointment after a) How great JC2 was, and b) The pre-release footage looked amazing and refined and polished.  The final product is none of these things to me.  Some of the more glaring issues might be fixed in later patches, but I don't know that I care to wait around to find out.  Give it a year of patches and about an 80% price cut, then maybe reconsider it.","December 5, 2015","false","74.4"," 647 of 1,036 people (62%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","62","647","1","48","48"

This translates itself to "We feel justified in what we did and we've, like, you know, made the greatest gaem evurr and gamers should just shut up"\n\n- loading times are awful even on SSDs\n- for a quite large player base, the game is simply unplayable due to the inefficiency and bad optimization\n- story is rather short. About 4 hours (with cutscenes) when you leave out the "chores" of having to liberate a certain amount of provinces. Cutscenes are fun, the missions themselves are boring\n- way too many challenges that are the exact opposite of chaos. Better yet, for 100% completion you need to do most of the 112 infuriating challenges twice, because you need upgrades to reach 5 gears. Hurray for repetition\n\n\nI'll give them kudos for a) the beautiful world, which is often quite accurately resembling a mediterranean environment and b) the fact that collectibles and destruction objects are completable this time. In Just Cause 2, the amount of collectibles and destructables in villages/bases was just far too ridiculous.\n\nAll in all, another AAA title released in a very sorry state, even if this isn't affecting all users (but a large portion of them). What do we learn? Business ethics in the gaming industry are still plummeting and a great part of that goes out to us gamers who time and time again spent money on darn pre-orders or day #1 releases for no reason.\nTo clarify, I was gifted this game free of charge by a very, very kind person.\n\nEdit: (Dec 17th)\nIn conclusion, it's a fun game. I kind of like it, enjoyed most of it, as I did with Just Cause 2 (over 50 hours there)\nWhat some people don't seem to get is that I simply won't give a thumbs up for pure mediocrety. Yeah the game's ok. But it's downright mediocre. And the poor release state, the excruciatingly annoying DRM and the fact that I'm expected to pay some 75€ for the complete experience - if I were such a customer - doesn't make me want to recommend this game. I will never support mediocrety and give it a thumbs up. And honestly, the reason gamers have put up with mediocrety for so long and have given their thumbs up to anything that was broken, uninnovative but well-marketed is one of the key reasons most AAA publishers are just declining in quality, support and simultaneously expect customers to spend more and more money.\nI can see some people disagree with me, but they're as entitled to do that as much as I am entitled to express my non-recommendation at this price point and state of the game.\nGet it for 15€ / $20. Then it's a good deal and worth a recommendation. Also, most bugs will probably be gone then, so it's an even better deal.\nAs an AAA title asking me to invest 75 bucks? Nope.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unfrared/recommended/225540/","Unfrared","Cryomagma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unfrared/","141 products in account","Summary\nJust Cause 3 has all the gadgets and exploding objects necessary to be a fun game, but it's been made into a frustrating experience. All of the fun stuff is hidden behind tens of hours of completing infuriating challenges and liberating repetitive military bases and villages.\n\nReview\nJust Cause 3 lacks any enjoyment during the first 50 hours of gameplay in my experience. It is not worth paying for such frustration, especially at full price. It took me 50 hours to lift the limitations placed on the player at the beginning of the game.\n\nAt the start of the game, I wanted to try exploding things in new ways, particularly with the new tethers, but they were disappointingly underpowered. The only way to improve tether strength and to get more than two of them was to liberate an ungodly amount of land. Eventually I unlocked the frustrating tether challenges. That took many boring hours. Although I now have fully upgraded tethers, I do not have the ability to enjoy them.\n\nAnother way Just Cause 3 stifles enjoyment is the fact that the player never has time to set up crazy destruction. The player will be killed by Di Ravello's army before they are able to successfully set up some elaborate, insane way to explode a statue using a car, tethers, and rocket powered C4. The number of potential ways to explode things are brilliant, but the number of opportunities to are not.\n\nWhat really destroys the game's fun are challenges. They are how all gear mods are unlocked, from rocket powered C4 to multiple tethers. Gears are awarded based on the player's score, from one gear to five gears. The player needs a pretty high average score (3-4 out of 5) to unlock all gear mods in any category, such as car modifications.\n\nWhat I first search for in every challenge is a way to complete it ASAP with a better vehicle or weapon, but that's not always possible. Fortunately, most challenges don't take too long. Unfortunately, there are some that seem impossible to score highly on, even with all weapons and vehicles unlocked. The wingsuit and destruction challenges are particularly infuriating. The former requires the player to fly perfectly through the center of several rings, without missing more than 1-3 (depending on the course length). The latter sometimes limits the player to weapons that are not suited to blowing s#!& up in 90 seconds, such as sniper rifles. Being somewhat of a perfectionist, attempting to unlock all gears felt like a waste of my life. That's a horrible feeling to have in any video game, and especially Just Cause.\n\nThe final modifications that can be unlocked for vehicles are the elimination of their cooldown timers, which is essential to have much of the fun in the game. Even the beloved wingsuit, an incredible method of transportation, has much of its functionality hidden behind challenges. The story and its individual missions are negligibly short, so it's up to the player to make their own fun with whatever Rico has. Without all of Rico's enhanced gadgetry, liberating the islands is a grind.\n\nOne instance when I was actually having fun was actively discouraged by the game, another time when the game annoyingly told me what I can play with and when. I was trying to liberate a base before disabling its bavarium nukes, and unsurprisingly it was taking a long time. I was enjoying getting constantly blown up by nukes while trying to fight an army and destroy their infrastructure. Suddenly I was spawned kilometers away, at the nearest base I liberated, rather than by the fun nuke time. I flew back a couple times only to get nuked and transported a few kilometers away. I was livid.\n\nBy the time I could use all of my gadgets and weapons with as much freedom as the game would offer, I was already 50 hours in. By that time, I had enough Just Cause 3. I did not feel like spending more time in its world with only a handful of different types of things to blow up that are arranged in many different ways. Maybe one day I will come back to this game and play it the way it should be, doing crazy nonsense.\n\nI thank whoever reads this review and recommend them to play Just Cause 2 instead. It's much cheaper and has most of the same explosions and non-physics, plus it never made me frustrated. I could mess around all day there, without making any progress in the game.","December 24, 2015","false","56.6"," 194 of 315 people (62%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","62","194","315","14","9"

There are some MAJOR problems that need to be addressed, but if not for them the game would be excellent and probably have a much higher average review rating. Since my experience with the crashes and problems that other users have been complaining about have been fairly rare, I'll be rating it positively, but considering how frequent they are among the playerbase in general I almost feel bad for doing so.\n\n-Pros-\nThe explosions please my idiot monkey brain\nSome parts of the environment, such as walls, now crumble when exploded\nThe new grapple/wingsuit etc mechanics are nice\nThe game is very pretty, especially underwater (as long as you don't look too closely at anything, it's pretty jarring in cutscenes to see every thread on Rico's shirt while the fence he's leaning against is blurry and pixelated)\n-Neutral-\nCar handling is different than in JC2, but arguably not for the better- cars aren't slippery TNT rockets made of paper mache any more, but they're also much slower and their turning feels somewhat unresponsive until you're suddenly pulling a hard turn that almost flips you (or just does)\nI'm conflicted on Rico's new design for some reason. The change in his facial appearance, attitude, and way he talks- even though not changed on any fundamental level- feel like they've gone and replaced the original with a lookalike halfway through the film and expect us to not notice. Nothing meaningful, it's just a slight nag at the back of my mind during cutscenes that I just can't shake.\n-Cons- (starting from arguably the worst)\nPeople have been complaining about explosions crashing the game. This doesn't happen to me- instead, it crashes my entire PC every 10th time I throw a grenade. Even if nothing else is going on at the time.\nI have 2 GTX980s in SLI and even I can't run this game on Ultra at a smooth 60fps. Have to turn most of the post-processing things (motion blur, depth of field, bokeh, SSAO, etc) off-- and all of them at once, not just one or the other-- in order to jump from ~40fps to ~120. That's... not good optimization. EDIT: The game apparently doesn't even support SLI, hence the unexpectedly poor performance.\nThe Online features can make it take AGES for the game to load at the start, in ADDITION to the annoyingly long intro video every time you play\nThere seem to be cutscenes every five seconds (at least at the beginning), and the directors have apparently never heard of changing camera angles without a complete fade to black between shots followed by a loading screen once the cutscene is actually over\nThe auto-snap on the grapple line is... annoying. It gets in the way and makes you frequently grab things you don't mean to.\nYou don't have very fine control over your movement, turning around and around in order to get a context action to show up (get in car, press button, etc) is more frequent than I'd prefer.\nFor a game all about explosions, they don't give you anywhere NEAR enough room to carry explosives.\nI'll update this review as I play more & depending on how frequently the developer updates the game. Hopefully the devs fix the game-breaking problems quickly so I won't feel so bad about leaving a positive review.","December 2, 2015","true","39.4"," 91 of 141 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","91","141","6","6"

That game had a fantastic PC version, and on my PC, I could run it at 1080p at 60 FPS with most settings maxed out.  It only took about 30 seconds from launching the game to playing it, and whenver the framerate would dip below 60, it would be clearly apparent why.\n\nWhile Just Cause 3 is a somewhat more demanding game on a technical level (as shown by the slightly higher requirements), the game is nowhere near as well optimized.  On my PC, it would take about 15 minutes to make it to the main menu, unless you used some unofficial workarounds (putting Steam in offline mode, running the game as Admin, etc) that narrowed the wait down to about 5 minutes.  Once in the game, performance was ridiculously inconsistent.  I could manage about 30-40 FPS with most settings on low at the best case, with frequent game-breaking instances of slowdown to framerates so poor you could count the frames.  And while large physics events predictably had an impact on framerate, the worst instances of stuttering and slowdown were for seemingly random reasons.\n\nWhile my machine is closer to the minimum specs than the recommended, there are plenty of people who have far better machines than mine who have reported similar issues.\n\nAt some point, this game will hopefully be the great game that it should be, but as of December 2015, I cant reccommend that someone pay $60 for a game that very well may have performance issues that are far more extreme than they should be on your machine.","December 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 161 of 262 people (61%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","61","161","262","16","8"

Now me and 15 of my friends bought this game and not a single one of us has yet to have any problems. Two of us got the stuttering, but that's because they had their settings too high (they have quite a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GPU) and once they changed those they had no problems either.\n\nIf you try to max out your graphics with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GPU you shouldn't be complaining here and try some lower settings first!\nNow I heard some people who had good specs also got the stuttering and crashing and stuff. And you seem to see those a lot.\nMy experience is that most reviews written are negative, since people can't really be bothered to write a positive review anymore because they're probably too busy playing this marvelous game.\nSo there might seem to be a lot of these reviews, but that's just cause (pun intended) people mostly only write reviews when they have a complaint or are mad.\n\nNow if you have an AMD you should probably not buy the game yet, since it seems that activision hasn't done a lot of testing with these GPU's and the game is probably badly optimized because of it.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the performance problems aren't nearly as big as they seem like.\nYes a lot of people have problems and yes they should be helped out soon with a patch. But the game is just simply amazing and is certainly worth buying. I've been having a lot of fun with it so far and the possibilities are just endless. The game is simply too good to just not buy, because you are affraid you might have issues with it (unless you have AMD, than you should probably not buy it right now)\n\nHope this review was helpfull for you :)","December 19, 2015","true","23.1"," 105 of 169 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","105","169","12","11"

I'm running on a very good spec computer (see my profile for my full specs) and with lowered settings I average at about 50fps, but it's not consistent, it drops all the time or shoots up high which makes it really hard to play. Also putting on vsync (which is a must for me because of screen tear) causes the game to lock at a low fps if I dip under 60 which is really annoying.\n\nThe game itself is just horrible to play. The car handling is awful and the physics system is completely broken, everything explodes for no reason and things will flip about and act completely unnaturally. If you tether two things together then pull them in they will flip into the air, and the effect is seemingly worsened if one car is on fire.\n\nThe NPCs are useless. I don't even know how to describe how bad they are but just watch gameplay, you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe voice acting I've experienced so far is not what I would expect from such a big title, it is very amateurish and doesn't sound like it's from a professional game, it's quite immersion breaking when the game itself looks so good.\n\nLoad times are insane. I'm running the game on an SSD to try and speed it up, but it still takes ages to start for the first time and load into the level. It's really annoying that when I actually can be bothered to try and get my money out of the game and put up with all the problems it has to play for an hour or so, I have to sit in loading screens for ages to get there.\n\nFinally, there is no official mod support, at least that I've heard of, so I'm not sure what they were on about when they mentioned modding before launch. Were they just implying that they were making the files easy to crack into to modify? If that's the case then that isn't exactly official mod support, that's just making a game using common formats.\n\nPlease fix this game, it has such potential but at the moment it's a mess. I would really not recommend buying until it's fixed, if it ever is.","February 3","false","11.1"," 81 of 130 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","81","130","0","8"

The artillery of a whole nation seems to be focused on my annihilation, while I fire rocket after rocket at the ground below. The deafening roar of the engines and the air-sucking booms of coutless explosions are my soundtrack. If this was a film, it would be the movie’s climax, when the hero does the impossible. In Just Cause 3, Avalanche’s latest destruction-obsessed action romp, it’s the opening scene.\n\nFor Rico Rodriguez, the game’s handsome, bearded protagonist – a professional racer turned tyrant-toppler – it’s just another day at work. He blows up military bases for breakfast, and for lunch, he tears down bridges while the army of an evil dictator – moustachioed cartoon villain Di Ravello – drives across. He’s a one man army, a superhero in jeans, and he’s done this all before. But this time, the explosions are bigger, the toys are more varied, and everything has just become a little bit more ridiculous.\n\nI don’t call Rico a superhero lightly. Avalanche’s third destruction sandbox is as much a superhero game as Rocksteady’s Arkham series, at least when it comes to the action. Our leading man can take down entire armies, fly across islands, and even survive the explosion of a grenade. Once, while minding my own business, gliding across a mountain range, I was hit by a missile. I got back up again and stole a helicopter, which I then dropped on top of a tank. I’d like to see Batman attempt that.\n\nWith Just Cause 3, the writers have leaned directly into its b-movie comparisons. The story is a simple one, and is led by a host of zany, off the wall characters. Mario comedically  brings about numerous terrible ideasand spearheads one of the funnier missions in the game. Di Ravello is a compelling, but also by the books dictator. He hates everyone but himself, kills innocents, etc. For the most part, any type of cutscene in Just Cause 3 is forgettable. But I don’t think anyone is expecting a philosophical masterpiece from a game that begins with its main character hanging upside down from a helicopter.\n\nWhile little may have been expected of the story, it would be nice if the game built its story missions around using the strengths of the game. Missions often call for you to use your parachute/wingsuit combination in a variety of ways , but as the game went on, I found myself tiring of being forced to perform certain objectives. It felt as if I could do them by myself, without the help of the story, so there was no real reason to interact with them. The story feels like an afterthought to some of the more exciting stuff than can be found within Just Cause 3’s world.\n\nPossibly the largest thing you will spend your time doing in Just Cause 3 is liberating the many cities of Medici. These areas of interest will typically contain a list of things that must be destroyed or taken over, such as a generator, billboard, radio tower, or police station. Though numerous, watching them explode is never tiring. It’s clear Avalanche Studios wants Just Cause 3 to be the kind of game you can sit down and have mindless fun with and these cities are good examples of just that. There were numerous times where I would get in the rhythm of taking over Medici and completely lost track of time. It’s just a great way to have fun watching all sorts of things explode into flames.\n\nWhen you are not freeing the people of Medici, you will be probably be taking part in some of the many challenges strewn throughout the open world. These challenges are very reminiscent  to other open-world games and consist of car races, wing suit challenges, and the popular “blow everything up around you” objectives. For the most part, these side challenges are just another way to kill some time and relax. They never become too difficult or complex, they simply exist as a way to focus the player on one of Just Cause 3’s mechanics. These missions can be easily overlooked if you want, but they do provide mods that can be helpful at times.\n\nJust Cause 3’s new modification system adds some excitement to some areas of the game, while doing very little for others. As you earn more modifications for your grenades, you can have them explode on contact, or explode only when they connect with a certain object,be that an enemy, destructible object, etc.. The game also hides the ability to zoom in with weapons behind these modifications, but it is earned rather early on. While the mods available can provide some thrills, it does feel like there is some unexplored potential within the system.\n\nThe controls are basically fine. I didn’t have any particular issues playing through on mouse and keyboard once I got used to the way everything worked, with the exception that vehicles (planes and the wingsuit, in particular) are a bit finicky on the keyboard because they really demand analogue controls. You might get a bit confused by the number of keys you need when swooping around – right-click to grapple, Space to open/close parachute, Shift to accelerate your grapple, CTRL to disconnect your grapple, E to activate your wingsuit – but I suspect that’d happen on a gamepad anyway, and I got used to it pretty fast.\n\nThe graphics and physics of this game are what gives form to the carnage that Rico unleashes upon his enemies, and they are impressive. At max settings the PC version is stunning, with an enormous draw distance and incredible detail at distances both close and afar. The physics engine is remarkably stable too, considering the shenanigans that you can instigate with the grappling hook and tethers. It also allows for some amazing destructibility, although when things get too crazy, the frame rate can take a dive as a consequence.\n\nThe game had network problems at various points in the time I was playing it. While an online connection is not required, you will always be logged in to Square Enix’s servers at startup. When the connection is lost to these servers, the game comes to a crashing halt for 30 seconds as it tries to reconnect, regardless of whatever it is that you were in the middle of doing. Also the game has horrendous load times. Just Cause 3 has the worse load times of any game in years.\n\nGunplay in the Just Cause series has never been anything to brag about. That continues with Just Cause 3 as you never feel totally in  control when using a weapon.As for the actual gun selection, your options are varied. You can obtain all sorts of assault rifles as well as side arms. You constantly roll with a special weapon, which can range from your standard RPG to a gun that calls in airstrikes on whatever location you point it to. The variation in weapon sets makes destroying the many statues satellite dishes immensely satisfying.\n\nWhen you’re not waiting for it to load, Just Cause 3 is an incredibly fun game. Crisp visuals and a clever soundtrack bring all the explosions to life. Even with the violence and destruction, it manages to maintain a lighter tone than the Far Cry games, without sliding into the outright silliness of Saints Row. But, it’s still silly enough. Dropping boats on satellite dishes, tying enemy soldiers to exploding gas tanks, and grappling, wingsuiting, and parachuting the length and breadth of beautiful Medici, just to blow the crap out of it. Just Cause 3 is an absolute blast.","April 6","true","70.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","20","25","4","0"

Even with my quite good build, I hemorrhage ram like crazy unless I turn everything down. As of right now it wont even SLI correctally. So basically, I play on low-medium settings so that I don't experience framerate issues, but even then I get sometimes some drops, and whats the fun in having a HIGH end computer to play a game (you havto pay moneys for) to play on medium.....\n\nAnyways:\nPros\n1) The game, even if I play on low settings, looks good. It's colorful, bright, smooth, and the explosions are incredibly enjoyable\n2) The sounds are ok, and the voice actors are really funny and well done.\n3) I liked the music, even though they are quiet and you don't really hear them.\n4) The gameplay is fun and addictive. I love the wingsuit, I enjoy moving through the mountains with my gears, the shooting is fun. Though I had to remap a bit my controls because I wanted it to feel like Just Cause 2, it plays well, and it is fun.\n5) The explosions and the grappling hook... Nothing else to say, it's just well done. The game become somewhat a physics-based game with the ability to use your grappling.\n6) Huge map, a lot of places to blow up.\n7) The leaderboard thigie is neat (i dont care if im not as good as my friends)\n\nCons\n1) You won't give a crap about the story/missions, as for Just Cause 2.\n2) The map is too big. Yes, I said it was a pro, but my main problem is when you try to go from an island to the other. If you don't have a jet, it'll take forever to crosse the water.\n3) I still don't get how the chaos work for this episode - might change this point once I figure it out.\n4) As stated above,\n5) the optimization,\n6) IS\n7) ABSOLUTLY\n8) POSITIVELY\n9) HORRRRRRIIIIIIIDDDDD\n10) Having to log into Square Enix servers for everything, so if their down the game props you every few minutes, or every time you open the map\n11) Initial Load times, the main menu--game start is dreadful, and yes i've heard of the SSD vs HDD\n12) Gets repetitive quickly\n\nConclusion\nOverall, this game is a fun experience, if you like blowing things up and killing people like there is no tomorrow (which is my case so...). If you want deep story, dark intrigue, multiplayer mode or realistic gunfight, just ignore this game. I think that if you liked Just Cause 2, you'll like this one too. It's no where near perfect, it surely isn't as good as JC2, but it's fun, and it gives you explosion, so it's nice.","December 31, 2015","false","41.1"," 81 of 137 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","81","137","10","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spellchamp/recommended/225540/","spellchamp","Spellchamp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spellchamp/","49 products in account","Just Cause 3 is great if you love Bollywood style action, a lot of freedom, and the ability to be creative with your explosions. I've sunk a lot of time into this game, roughly about 20 hours by my estimate (it's all been offline, more about that later) and I always find myself starting this game with another idea for something stupid to try. Like take a boat down a mountain and feel like you're in cool runnings, or try and build a catapult using the tether and some cars.\n\nThe game is fun to explore, the movement system feels great, especially the wingsuit. The game is massive, and scaled appropriately to how fast you're going to be travelling most of the time. You could argue that the world is a little empty compared to some other modern sandboxes, but I think 'Spread out' is a better term. There's a lot to see in Just Cause 3, and if you find yourself driving a car at 200 km/h in a random direction, you're not ever going to have to backpedal to find something to do when you inevitably crash. The game is spread out in a way that you're constantly going "ooh what's that on the horizon?"\n\nPerformance-wise, I have trouble with v-sync only. Everything else runs like a dream, and that's with a GTX 960. I get almost constant 60fps, with the occasional stutter, though it's very rare. I'm always suprised at how well the engine deals with having hundreds of physics objects hurtling around at once.\n\nThe story is there. It's funny in places, with some cool scripted missions. But all of the scripted missions do have the option to put your own flair onto them, nothing is set in stone. You need to blow something up? How you do it is generally up to you.\n\nThe side missions are sometimes dull, sometimes excellent. The flying and boating eventually get very samey. Especially since you're always in one of the small selection of planes/boats that appear in the game. The frenzy missions are complete garbage however. You basically get 90 seconds to run around with the game's weapon of choice, and blow up parts of an enemy base (generally one you just finished blowing up.) There are never any enemies in this mode, and it's often boring. The difficulty scale is all wrong, some involve a sniper rifle trying to shoot down radio towers, and another might be destroying fuel tanks with a helicopter equipped with missiles. It's just a dumbed-down version of what you just did, except a lot less exciting. This game mode could have easily been fixed if it had been about killing enemies however. Generally in the main game you're not spending most of your time fighting bad guys, you're picking off a few that are in your way and then you're getting away speedily. But having frenzy be about fighting waves of bad guys with a specific weapon would be a lot more fun IMHO. It would make you try out more weapons rather than just going for the biggest kaboom. Plus it would be a good reason to fight the varied array of types of enemies in the game. rather than just whizzing past them on the way to the nearest generator.\n\nThe wingsuit missions brilliant are on the other hand, often showing off some of the most beautiful parts of the game while you get to really hone your wingsuit skills. (This will come naturally, by the time you're an hour in you'll be using the wingsuit a lot!) And the Speed missions where you drive an exploding car towards a group of soldiers then bail out before it explodes are a more fun version of the driving missions. Which aren't races for some reason, just a time trial.\n\nThe always online aspect is annoying, I would recommend starting Steam in offline mode to play this since there doesn't seem to be an option to switch it off. If you play online it WILL get in the way of you playing the game.\n\nOverall, the game is lacking in some respects. There aren't enough types of vehicles, or weapons, or missions. No submarines or scuba gear ( that I've found) despite a beautiful ocean just screaming to be explored. No multiplayer, which was one of the best additions to JC2 although it was a mod. And I can't help but feel like this is all being held back for future DLC.\n\nMy conclusion:\nJust Cause 3 is fun, a lot of fun. The game feels great and looks great. If you enjoy making up your own challenges, having a beautiful world to explore and watching things explode and fly around, then this game is for you. I love it to bits, and I can play for hours on end and always have some other insane thing I want to attempt right before I switch off.\n\nBut do I think you should buy it?\n\nYes.\nBut in a year's time. Wait for the DLC, see if the game is more full of content, see if they add multiplayer. See if they manage to optimise it a bit better! Next Christmas you'll pick up the full game much cheaper then you will now, and you'll have a blast with it. But right now, there's a bit too much missing content for me to recommend it for the price. If you can stand waiting, then by all means do.","December 14, 2015","true","6.9"," 41 of 65 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","41","65","7","0"

Do allows me to outline my issues in a nice list below:\n\nMajor Issues:\n\nGarbage Performance -- I, like many others have had absolutely atrocious performance in this game. To clarify, I do not have an AMD processor or graphics card and have been able to run JC 2, Minecraft, CS:GO, and Far Cry 4 on full settings without any lag excluding minor and infrequent occurences. On lowest performance this game will launch and can run, however, FPS is always pretty damn low, fuel tank explosions almost stop the game from working, and sometimes certain towns and bases give random unexplained lag in addition to the random crashes and unstable exiting of game\n\nRepetition and tedious chores -- The repetition of towns and whatnot was a major issue in JC 2, something we all thought would be addressed in "3." While this game has more variety and beauty, it is hard to enjoy with the combined lag and I am forced to complete almost the same exact missions for Dimah to disable these ♥♥♥♥ing FOWs. After the first few missions on Insula Dracon the game becomes completely repetitive. Not to mention we are forced to complete missions to get certain equipment.\n\nSoldiers and AI: The AI is absolutely atrocious seeing as though it will drive flaming vehicles, think it can drive a tank on a cliff, and fly a heli with a minigun directly in front of a heli with missiles. The AI is absurdly bad at finding Rico and doesn't really do much but pat people down and stand around staring at Rico. The soldiers do eventually become absurd and prevent the player from really doing much with the resources they are given.\n\n\n\nPros of the game:\n\nNew weapons and tools: The tether, wingsuit, and variety of guns and vehicles are immensely helpful and more interesting than JC2\n\nPotential in story: The story has a huge potential, include the Bavarium nonsense, but I still feel that it was relatively unexplored and made to be highly cookie cutter and repetitive. Something interesting could have been done with the story, but instead the devs oped for the typical "we cannot let most glorious resource into bad hands, must kill bad guy and destroy. ALL YOUR BAVARIUM ARE BELONG TO US, SO WE CAN DESTROY AND HELP HUMANITY!" Nevermind the potential benefits of such a material.\n\nDestruction potential: With this game, we are given the tools to do absolutely amazing things and to have great fun. Unfortunately, the cons that I outlined above make this very difficult.\n\nBetter AI than JC2: Although sub-par, the AI in this game makes an effort to call reinforcements and is reasonable. In JC 2 killing any enemy or shooting anywhere got heat. Here, if you kill all enemies and prevent reinforcements calls, nobody comes and heat disappears. It is also apparent that I can shoot on a mountain now and not have the enemy airforce deciding that random trees are in need of protection.\n\nThe game appears, at first glance to be open and expansive, and it appears that the player can destroy anything, but it quickly becomes clear the player can only destroy certain bridges and chaos items. Only new items to be destroyed are fluorescent lights, speakers, billboards, and bridges. That being said, I appreciate the hard work of people at square enix, this game is a blast when it runs correctly. That being said, the performance and obvious shortcomings of the game must be addressed eventually. It performance alone were fixed, I would give a positive review, but the other minor issues combined with performance make this experience far less enjoyable than it should be. Still, I have faith that the dev team will attempt to solve many current problems and perhaps issue some updates addressing lag and perhaps adding more towns, items, destruction, and maybe even multiplayer.\n\nEDIT: I need to make note of several things: Military bases make no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. Surely each base should have some radar system for early warning, but bases have random stuff and aren't specialized. There are no giant radar arrays, or fuel refineries, or naval bases, or even major airfields, just bases with a random AM antenna and three identical doppler radars so close to eachother that they wouldn't benefit whatsoever. In addition, it still makes no sense that random distillation towers and fuel tanks are just sitting in military bases -- nothing is specialized, just random stuff. This game also seems to lack the ability to properly handle the objects it creates as RAM usage shoots up through continued gameplay. If I wanted stuttering and slow response times I would have turned on the presidential debates.","January 2","false","43.7"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","34","53","7","5"

A fun game? A boring game?...  If these were statements instead of questions they'd all be true of JC3. This is a game of systems and mechanics and what is there works great, however I think sadly there isn't enough mechanics to keep the game interesting all of the time.\n\nA typical play session of JC3 would be travel some where and blow everything up, then rinse and repeat. It doesn't matter why you're there and the context of your destruction, that is what it boils down to, explosions. Now nearly every game ever made could be described in such over simplified terms and I know that, but what JC3 fails to do is disguise this fact in a way that you don't realise that is all your doing.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, how you go about exploding everything around you is immense fun. Grenades, rockets, grenade launchers, high jacking Tanks, combat Helicopters, fighter jets, using grappling hooks to pull down structures, topple fuel tanks etc etc...  it goes on and on and it also looks really good too, the explosions in particular are something to behold. They have made this a spectacle and it is awesome to see, at least for a while.\n\nLike with any spectacle, it has a shelf life, you can't watch fireworks for 30 hours straight and not get bored, but in small bursts here and there... fireworks are great! That pretty much sums up the game for me, good in small bursts but it does get tired quickly over an extended play period.\n\nDoes this make it a bad game? Not in my book, but it does make it a shallow game and sadly an imperfect experience. Difficulty isn't high (which I am fine with by the way) so the challenge will come from destroying things in the most spectacular way or efficient way you can think of.\n\nThe story missions are ok and the final boss is an expected anti climax, but there is a narrative if you're interested. There is loads to do, upgrades to unlock, challenge missions that test your skills and collectables, you aren't short of content but like me you might find yourself asking if you *want* to do it all...  as I said,  you'll be more or less doing the game thing over and over again in a very noticeable way which at times felt like a chore.\n\nIt is what it is, it never advertised itself as anything other than a fun explosive romp, so no complaints that it delivered on it's promise, but whether that will be enough for you or not, will boil down to own personal tastes.","February 22","true","27.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

To the level/game designers & game programmers: thanks to have really f@cked up this just cause title :,)\n\nremember the lame and horribly boring races we had in just cause 2 ? now you need to do them to unlock special abilities, i'd say the wingsuit ones are made to break your pc. Why, try to have the 5 "gears" to it, if you do, welcome in the hardcore try harding gamezone.\n\nlet's talk about the races, the ones with cars... I had one with a freacking dead and rusty middle east type of cars... You'd tell me it's for the lulz, no, the level designer found it funny to have 2 huge laps with a car that can only go to 10 mph, GOD! so lulzy!\n\ni paid 50 euros for that and i played too much to get a refund... Dear lord what have i done? :,c\n\nalso you have the destruction minigame, anything is going ok BESIDE the one you have to do EVERYTHING with your grapping hook... Level designers = genius.... Why? try to take down everything with your grapping hook under 2 minutes and without your grenades, well it's almost impossible (after i didn't upgraded my grapping hook... but i believe it doesn't really impact it since the levels just lack of barrils :) )\n\nthen you have the shooting range which is ok... But please, again, let's make this boring as f-k, seriously, they make horribly hard wingsuit races ♥♥♥♥ and then shooting ranges needing 0% of skill to get all the gears...\n\nAlso i love competiting with guys i haven't in my friendlist "xX_♥♥♥♥ITER_Xx took the 1st place" it's like we're on facebook, you don't talk to them, you don't know them but they remind you they exist somehow... Competiting with my friends is ok... But please... Not random stanger with dumb as f@ck usernames...\n\nWell i think this will be final but... it's a just cause... 50% ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n\nI still wouldn't recommend.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------first critic-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell what to say about this...\nEager as ♥♥♥♥ as usual for a Just Cause video game, once again i'm shocked how the video game industry is turning a video game that was used to be released glitch-less to a video game that is now released full of ♥♥♥♥.\ncome on!\n\nhuge drops of framerate on an Nvidia 980 4GB.\nlike how is this possible, it looks like ARK survival evolved on its realease... OH WAIT!\nSquare Enix & Avalanche studios done that!\nseriously... Also multiple horrible sound glitches when you click on a button in the menu, when you open the menu, when you quit the menu.... Well a UI coded with the ♥♥♥ GG WP!\n\nanyway, let's get out of the "Day one" problems (and i'm waiting the update so move your @-ss SE.)\n\nSeriously about the game itself... It... Rocks? i can't tell with  all the glitches, the time Rico takes to get up, the difficulty of the game sometime, the loadings taking around 1-2 minuts, connecting to SquareEnix.♥♥♥?, the horribly annoying ranking system that they added attemping to make it multiplayer...\n\nHoly s--it multiplayer... Why did they bothered to create this dumb ranking system if you can't play with your friends!! it's like: "look we can't do that, and since we are useless let's create an innovative multiplayer experience... Push notifications of your friend's action, so smart! so fun!!"\nIt looks like they don't learn from their mistakes. Again we'll have to wait 3 years until some talented developper creates an online mod ("look we are so lazy we have to let the community create its own multiplayer, now brb i need to bang in my money pool")\n\ni have to say i'm really disapointed, i'll kill it off, after all it's a Just cause, i'd lie if i hadn't major lulz in this... Yet i'm not impressed and i'm disapointed about the general looking of the game, 36GO, it's like i'm playing with 15GO which are corrupted.\n\nanyway, for now i wouldn't recommend it, seriously save your dollars, wait few weeks then buy it.\n\nps: wingsuit, really? they tried in far cry 4, and look in third person it' still horrible to control.","December 1, 2015","false","22.9"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","26","40","2","1"

After 43 hours and almost completely liberating everything in just under a week, I have to admit I like it and it's a ton of fun. It's everything I wanted from the next instalment in the franchise.\n\nI have heard some people complain that there's not much content beyond liberating bases and completing challenges. This is true, but then I think that Just Cause 2 was exactly the same, and everyone loved that.\n\nNext thing is complaints about stuff being locked behind challenges. Personally, I do not mind this, I already get more than what I got in vanilla Just Cause 2 (unlimited explosives, multiple tethers). So getting more is technically optional (although I do recommend it, it makes the game significantly easier). Just try to do the challenges. They may seem repetitive but each one is just about fresh enough in my humble opinion.\n\nThere is *one* thing that bothers me to no end though and that is the  always online feature. It often disconnects me from the servers, making me often have to reconnect, sometimes it won't reconnect and I have to go into offline mode where it will try to reconnect me every 5 minutes when I pause the game as well. I know you want to keep your game out of the hands of those pesky pirates and I respect that but at least make sure that the people who do purchase it are not inconvenienced by your measures.\n\nThat said, the game runs fairly well on my set-up with I7-4790K, GTX 770 and 16 GB of RAM. Running it on high and maintaining 60 FPS most of the time. FPS drops are present but rather rare.\n\nI personally would give this game a solid 8.5/10.","December 30, 2015","true","45.5"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

The game itself is brilliant, it just runs like a pig. I don't have a high spec system, but I can run SW: Battlefront on High at a solid 60fps. This turd is so unoptimised and poorly coded that it ran at 60fps on high last night, then tonight it ran ok but crashed. After restarting it cant even reach 20fps with the same settings. Even with everything on low or off it's still EXACTLY the same frame rate.\nThe lip snch goes out on every single cut scene, then catches up, then goes again.\nThe frame rate goes from 60 to 20 randomly for no reason, but during massive explosions and shed loads of chaos on screen, it mostly copes fine. I'd expect with this amount of stuff going on it will drop of a few frames when things hot up, but it doesn't do too badly. It just randomly slows down with no obvious reason.\nSo dissapointed as it seems like a really good game.\nJust cannot recommend it until they've fixed it. But then I thought that about Arkham Knight...\n\nJust to clarify on a few points -\n\nMy system exceeds the minimum specs. Why would I complain about a game that runs badly if I dont meet the minimum specs.....? As I said, I changed everything to the lowest settings and it still ran the same, whereas the day of release it was on high and ran fine.\n\nI do know whats involved with coding a game. What I also understand is that money men get int he way of deveopment and demand the game is released before its been fully bug tested. It happens all the time. A few games are managed really well and make it out the door brilliantly - SW: Battlefront being the best example I've ever seen. And no, I wouldn't say JC3 is any more demanding specs wise than Battlefront. Yes, JC3 has more explosions and is a tiny bit more CPU intensive, but have you seen Battlefront on high settings? It's flippin beautiful. But more importantly, this is a AAA game made by experienced devs a good few years into a console's life, and with previous PC experience, I expected more.\n\nAs for the running like a pig similie - i'd look up the word first if I were you. It's a figure of speech. And yes pigs do run quite quick, but when did you last see them running consistently for a long period? Hence the fairly accurate simile....\n\nAlso I never said it was easy to make video games. But DICE managed it without lousy code with Battlefront. Yes lots of games are released these days with game breaking bugs - I still cant play Fallout 4 in my native resolution due to a bug and Arkham Knight still isnt fixed. But this will keep happening if we all just keep accepting it and saying, "Oh well, it'll be fixed at some point I suppose..."\n\nI did also say that the game itself seemed great. If they do fix all the bugs quickly I'd recommend the game wholeheartedly - I'm really enjoying what I can play of it.\n\nAnd lastly - no game should be released with this many bugs. Yes I understand that many arent having problems - but many are and it seems to be the code at fault - not many complaints can be put down to rigs not meeting minimumspec/driver updates etc.","December 2, 2015","false","41.4"," 142 of 255 people (56%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","56","142","255","16","24"

Thought ‘what the heck, I had so much fun with Just Cause 2’ and bought the game. There are some things that felt better with 2, there are some things that feels better with 3.  It’s not a big difference. This one feels easier and personally for me I would have liked it a bit harder. But maybe it’s because I have a lot of hours in 2 and I know what’s expected of me.  All in all it’s fun blowing up things, shooting the bad guys and completing the missions.\n\nI really like that you can compete with your Steam friends in a lot of challenges. You see their scores when you do them and they get a notice when you beat their scores. And there are a lot of them. It makes you retry them and it’s really satisfying after trying and trying again to beat their scores knowing they get a notice they’ve been defeated…….losers!.....  : )  Lots of hours of fun ahead and I just started.\n\nSo in short. If you liked playing Just Cause 2 and felt sad when you ended it ‘cause of all the fun….here’s your treat.  By the way, I have no problems with crashes or gameplay with my Nvidia card.

I have to disable steam overlay, go into offline mode, start EXE as admin even though my account has admin privileges, disable vert sync ingame because it locks at 30fps, enable vsync in control panel as well as triple buffering, and THEN I get stable game performance, if you could call it that.  The first town you liberate was a ♥♥♥♥ show, the planes on which the smoke is generated became solid at certain angles, so I couldn't even see below the roof I was standing on.  Considering how buttery JC2 runs, this is really unacceptable.  Almost wish I had paid full price from steam instead of 50% off from ♥♥♥ so I could get a refund.\n\nEven with motion blur and faded edges turned off, when you look at Rico's textures as he moves it's a blurry mess.  It looks like more than one Rico is being rendered and they're all overlaying.  Vehicles even 100ft away, while in motion, look like there are 100 of them copy/pasted on top of eachother.  I dont' know if the engine has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ native AA so they tried this weird blurring technique to remedy it, but it looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing BETA build in this state.  A really really polished BETA build.\n\nDon't buy it yet.  Wait for people with Minimum listed requirements to have a decent plug and play experience before you drop the money.\n\nAlso, no SLI support, which is a huge slap in the face [yet again, thanks 2015] to consumers who opted to purchase 2 cards, is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t since their last 2 engines had fantastic scaling.\n\nThis year is the year I purchased the most preorders after GTA released so beautifully.  Never again, I don't care how many pip boys it comes with.\n\nEDIT 1:  Here is a video upload showing what I mean by "planes on which the smoke is generated" being solid:  https://youtu.be/xvSapGxPiBs\n\nYou can also see, as Rico takes the chopper, what I mean by the textures looking all weird and blurry while in motion.  Never finished JC2, probably go back to finishing that, hoping a patch comes out in a day or two.\n\nEDIT 2:  First of the new year, and they have yet to release a patch addressing any issues other than stability ones, which considering the types of CTD issues the first patch addressed it's arguable they should have been fixed BEFORE release.  Alas, nothing done to fix the nauseating FOV, which I've found a fix for here on the forums.  I believe user named Derp created it, haven't been notified for "hacking" since the program works like a hack, intercepting game data while it's in RAM.  Game is absolutely awesome with the FOV scaled from a verticle 35 [how the ♥♥♥♥ can anyone stand that???] to 55-64 degrees.  I can finally see vistas in a wider format, I can see the helicopter 10 feet above my head as well as the 3 dudes standing to my left right and slightly behind me, and when I parachute into a base there isn't a tower guard 5 feet out of view sniping me to death, because I can see the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI still will have to restart the game in the middle of overthrowing a town because of the weird visual ♥♥♥♥ups like in the video I posted above weeks ago, but I've only had to do that maybe 5 times in the 40hrs I've apparently played this game [I spend a lot of tiem staring at the pretty].\n\nSo, as it stands?  Get it on sale at green man gaming and apply the FOV fix.  For $30, I'd say it's just barely worth it, as it does become monotonous and finding out the only reason my skills haven't leveled up is because I haven't played minigames and devs refusing to add sprint to the empty binding that it used to be bound to [clicking L3 does nothing now, you used to run.  Now?  Nothing.  So stupid.] and regressive gameplay design is the bane of a good game.  Making things different just for the sake of change, or to FORCE you to use other means [devs say they want you to grapple more, so Rico can't sprint?] infuriates me.  The precedent has been set in the industry, Avalanche, so take note:  People who play open world, especially action games, like to have choices in their approach to problem and puzzle solving.  Also, the grapple sound gets a little annoying, would be nice to not have to rely on it to traverse a 20ft catwalk faster.  And, oh whoops, I accidentally missed the catwalk and grappled to a spire, GAWDARNIT!~!  Pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥os telling us how a game should be played, fudgin go tickle yourselves.\n\nAlso, MANDATING that I liberate 3 Provinces in Insula Striate sounds all find and dandy, but those things are friggin' HUGE!  I've been pecking away at them the last few days because I get so bored after a couple hours of just constantly liberating town after town after outpost after military base.  It's tedious, I'd just like to progress through the story at a decent pace [like I said, 3 days pecking away at this stuff without getting to play any story line in that time] without having to feel like I keep coming to road blocks.\n\nSo many frustrating aspects to this game, but it IS a lot of fun.  I mean, blowing stuff up from your wingsuit and tethering cows to windmills, how could you not have a blast?  Once I ran over a light post and my tank flew 200m in the air, so glitches can be fun or annoying, depends on you rmood I guess.\n\nEDIT 3:\nSky Fortress DLC came out, picked up the season pass for cheap, so I figured why not.  The jet pack is dope, but the cursor is fixed and the camera control doesn't move it like with the jets and helicopters, which is strange.  FPS is suffering with latest update and latest drivers.  I now get 35fps while driving through the country, maybe 120kmph.  The dips are still prevalent, and it's still only fun for maybe an hour or two at a time, and the FOV is still not adjustable without mods, and the CINEMATICS of the DLC are this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cell shaded comic art, like borderlands.  Completely random and stands out agains the rest of the cinematics and art style of the game.  I mean, the art is pretty, but it isn't even as dynamic as Witcher 3 intro, which is of a similar approach.  It's really disappointing and lazy.\n\nDon't be like me, keep waiting for it to be $30 with everything and by then MAYBE they will have fixed the performance, thus making it a viable purchase.","December 2, 2015","false","75.1"," 103 of 184 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","103","184","7","11"

My issue is that the game lags like INSANITY.  Less than 20 fps no matter what.  Let's see what I did:\n1. Download all the new amd drivers\n2. Verify integrity of game cache\n3. Disable steam overlay\n4. Uninstalling and reinstalling\n5.

And before y'all come at me with torches and pitchforks saying "IT'S BECAUSE YOUR CARD IS BAD..." well, I have a radeon 6970, which isn't *quite* the reccommended minimum.  However, because I can run almost any other game maxed, I have a pretty big problem with the fact that this game, even at ALL MINIMUM GRAPHICS SETTINGS (yes, even including putting the resolution to 640x420p), the game runs at a frame rate that far surpasses the "unplayable" mark.\n\nI've been looking forward to this game since 2011.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfzM/recommended/225540/","rfzM","rfzm ↑","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfzM/","626 products in account","UPDATED!\nSo while my initial reaction was that this game was fully broken on release (and it kinda was) its been, partially, fixed now, at least when it comes to some of the direct technical issues. The game is running much smoother and i'm getting a almost stable 60 fps at everything maxed, for the most part, at certain times  (seems kinda random)  it will drop to unacceptable numbers (25-40) but for the most part its a steady 55-60. It still needs some work though.\n\nThe game itself looks great at times, but also quite bad at times. Overall the graphics are good, the environment is nice and colorful, but then at certain times (such as during night and during rain weather) it will look quite bad, as if there was some kind of blue/grayish filter applied. Water looks good up close, but quite poor at a distance.\n\nThe good parts of this game, from what i've played so far, is definitely the improved parachute and wingsuit. This is well made and enjoyable to use. The grappling hook could definitely use an improved reach though, as you cannot grapple that far. I was sure that this was one of the unlocks (as you upgrade your equipment) but turns out it wasn't. Thats kind of disappointing, i guess i'll have to wait for a modder to fix that. Wingsuit and parachute are fine though, and are an improvement over Jc2.\n\nWhats not good, in fact very far from good, is the driving. The cars and bikes handling is very poor. The controls feel awkward and sluggish, and the physics are really terrible. Those of you who, like myself spent quite some time in Jc2, know that it wasn't exactly praised for its car handling back then either, but its actually a big step down from there. This is quite sad, as i'm pretty certain that this is not something they will work on. The devs have acknowledge that the game isn't perfect and they've said they will be working on improving certain things. As of know we don't know when the next patch is coming, and while i do trust that the developers are looking to solve certain problems (such as the lack of fov & camera options which is a huge problem atm), i just do not think that there is any easy fix to the handling & physics of cars, it would probably require a complete overhaul that will not happen after the game is released.\n\nI'm not very far into this (and usually i do spend more time before writing a review) so i'm not finished with the story, but from what i can tell its pretty much the same as Jc2, ie its not good at all. The voice acting and characters are maybe not as cringe as in Jc2, but they are still pretty bad. In a wider sense, the gameplay is very arcady, possibly even more than it was in Jc2. Some will like this, some will not. Personally i think they could've had a little more serious tone to it. I don't mind that its arcady and unrealistic, its just a tad bit too much for my taste.\n\nThat doesn't matter too much though, since you are most likely getting this for the open-world sandbox experience. Speaking of the world, the map seems to be huge, i'm not sure if its bigger than the map of Jc2, but its definitely bigger than Gtav.  I've spent some time flying around in high speed aircrafts (which sadly also handles very poorly) and i've not yet even seen half of the entire map.\n\nSo, am i recommending this or not?  I do wish that steam offered a third option, other than just yes and no, because my answer is yes & no.  The game definitely has potential. However, it seems its still not running well or at all for a lot of people, and even if you get it running, the experience is not as good as it should be. I think they should've polished it more before releasing it. I suggest you wait  a while for them to patch it, as well as some mods to come out. Therefor i'm not changing this review to positive, yet.\n\n\nOriginal text:\n------------------------------\nUnplayable at release.  Unstable fps (will go from anywhere between 60 to 25) as well as stuttering.\nSeems to have no options to change camera zoom & FOV, which by default is very, very bad, limiting your visuals significantly.\n\nThere is also talk about some nasty DRM.\n\n\nJust don't buy this yet, 42% negative reviews on steam, as well as the ongoing ♥♥♥♥♥torm on the forums should probably tell you enough already.\n------------------------------","December 1, 2015","false","38.8"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","24","38","6","0"

Ridiculous loading times, even on an SSD - and I must be missing the option to skip the intro. Watching Rico blow up the boat in the distance was nice the first time but I don't want to wait a minute every time I start the game to get to the actual gameplay. I think this may be something to do with the "online" element of the game as it seemed to take a long time to login after this.\n\nI've been informed that the studio that made JC2/Mad Max (Avalanche Studios Stockholm) didn't make JC3 (New York) - so that partly explains the rift in performance.\n\nIf you lose connection to Square Enix servers while ingame a big annoying message interrupts gameplay, asking you to retry connection or go to offline mode - why couldn't you just automatically go offline and periodically retry and just notify me in the corner?\n\nRico feels like an OAP when he isn't in the parachute or wingsuit. No rolling or sprinting.\n\nSome elements of the HUD are poor - waypoints/objectives are hard to see sometimes (tiny white markers and text blend in with the background). What happened to the minimap?\n\nAI effectiveness seems to vary a lot - some are capable of sniping you out of a full speed helicopter, but get close and they can barely hit you. Enemies have tendancy to spawn right next to you without warning.\n\nOn the upside - voice acting is a lot better (no BOLOOOO SANTOSIII), driving is slightly improved over JC2 (though still a bit iffy) and the writing gives you a few laughs. The improved tethering is a welcome addition and the wingsuit is great. The game also tells you what you need to do to liberate areas now which is a helpful addition.\n\nThere is a good game in there but these issues are spoiling it for me.","December 1, 2015","false","4.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

The graphics are just plain bad.  It looks like it would be at home on PS3, which was great...eight years ago.\nThe character's movements, especially in combat, don't feel very up to date either.  It's one of those things where you can run around too easily while taking heavy gunfire from several enemies that don't move or take cover or act at all like actual people.\nDriving and flying are also quite poor. It's basically identical to Just Cause 2, which was good in its time but that time has passed.\nAlso my pc surpasses the recommended specs yet I still run into choppy gameplay at times.  I play several other games that were released recently on the highest graphical settings with no problem and they look a hell of a lot better than this, so I'm inclined to believe it's either poor programming or a collection of bugs.\nTo throw some positive light on this poorly executed game I must say that the gameplay is enjoyable.  Who doesn't like an open world where everything can be victim to exploding?

I'm no real particular fan of the just cause series, but I do enjoy sandboxes in general, and well my friend coaxed me into buying the game so I could play alongside him! As such. You can trust that I didn't have any 'hype' or bias to the game. I've had a vague interest in the game and initially didn't even want to consider buying it. Well, I did, and here is my review of it. I'll have to note that it gets ridiculously detailed, so I'll give the best shot at a Tl;Dr I can, then below I'll put the full details! I advice any developers who are reading this go through that section. I have a...lot to say.\n\nTl;Dr - In general, the game is fun. It is "Good" but it has not impressed me. Perhaps the strongest part of the game is not exploding things, not blowing up entire bases or causing chaos. Nope. It's the wingsuiting. And I love that, I do, I spend most of my time wingsuiting. But unless you feel like doing lots of tedious challenges and doing the same repetitive takeovers of bases, then don't get this game. If you're into that stuff, if you're great at finding ways to blow things up in the next greatest way? Go for it. But I'm 40 hours in, and I felt like I've seen most of what the game has to offer. Save for 1 weapon, a couple of vehicles, and trains. I recommend it if you're buying it on sale, not for full price.\n\nDetails here! It wouldn't fit in Steam![www.dropbox.com]\n\nSo now the conclusion. And yes, the positives weren't as long. But eh. Honestly I don't have much more to say, I'm sure you already know about the better tether and the better explosions already and I don't have much to add to what most trailers and people already say. So...Is it a good game..? Yes. Does it compare well to JC2? It's a fine sequel, but that's all it is. As much as I'd like to say the slight improvements to the tether and bombs are all you need, and as much as I'd like to say that the wingsuit is a fantastic innovation that sells the game. But it's not. It's a great transportation system that occasionally leaves me just flying around idly, but I can't say it's the thing I've spent most of my time on. I personally think they took JC2, made a few improvements in some of the areas, prettied it up, then added the wingsuit. And that's about it. It's a better JC2 (Except for the driving) And that's the thing. I'm judging it so harshly because while JC2 was very unique and thus attracted lots of people despite the flaws. JC3 just feels like another iteration, only making 'safe' steps forward. "Oh modders did this and it was super popular, we'll put that in" It doesn't feel like any real risks were taken, and it doens't feel like they've added anything real worth it content wise to the game.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Yes. Get it on the cheap. I got it for half price. $40 compared to Australia's regular $80. If you can get it in your regional equivalent for that price, go for it. It's a nice game for that price. I can't say it's good for full price though.","December 4, 2015","true","46.3"," 49 of 86 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","49","86","4","2"

I have a Fury X (latest beta drivers) + a i5-4690k @ 4.1 Ghz and at 1440p, global illumination off, water tesselation off, med shadows, and no AA I still can't maintain a solid 60 fps... and that's in general gameplay, don't ask me how explosions fare. This year I've played MGS V, FO4, and Mad Max fairly comfortably at 4k, so to have so many performance issues with this game is just a straight up disappointment.\n\n-No multi-GPU support. They're hiding behind the "engine won't allow for it" excuse, which is just baffling considering Mad Max could manage just fine.\n\n-ALWAYS ONLINE (which causes stuttering). No option in menu to play in offline.

That is, to a degree what this game is but there are also some negative points below.\n\nJust Cause 3 is essentially a waste of time, its only selling points are its new desired game mechanics, vehicles, and weapons. The map is artifically made to look bigger but in the broad scheme of things its actually very small and under-populated with content.\n\nDRM, not only the name of the games antagonist (look at us we're meta!), but also the fact that it almost routinely forces you to go online in order to launch the game. I have almost no recorded time in-game because I try to run it in offline mode whenever possible. Ive actually beaten the game and put in at least 40 hours. Being online slows down the game and it's already a poorly optimized lump of crap. (I run a GTX970 btw).\n\nThe Story itself. Meh, okay. I didn't expect a mastery of story-telling with a series like just cause. What I also didn't expect was a game with only a short afternoon's worth of actual story missions. In JC2 there were other missions that were offered between "Agency" missions, which gave the game a lot of content since these varied in type and depth. Perhaps stealing a car from a private island, or blowing up a satelite array, or hijacking a car with someone in it to kidnap them! NOT THIS TIME AROUND! No! Just LIBERATING TOWNS, over and over and over....and over. Far Cry 4 must have made a lot of money I guess, since its the common architecture for current games. Liberating towns in JC3 is fun the first maybe 15 times you do it, but it begins to get old quick. Then you want to return to the story and... HM NOT YET, GET OUT THERE AND GRIND BY LIBERATING MORE THINGS. Don't do a variety of missions that are almost equally as engaging as the story ones, no! Just go do whatever! It's your game remember!?!?\n\nConsidering I couldnt even get into the game because "square enix servers are not responding"\nI'm not so sure it is my game.\n\n\n","March 22","false","1.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I really want to love Just Cause 3, but I can't. It's probably my most regretted purchase of a game. The multi grapple is great, and the more detailed destruction physics are a blast. Aside from that, it is a much worse game than JC2.\n\nThe controls are an absolute abomination, the vehicle and movement physics are atrocious, and the game has one of the worst cases of multiple-bound controls ever with no way to fix it despite having plenty of buttons on PC. Avalanche clearly knew this, because they made everything very sticky and semi-automated to try and compensate for it instead of fixing the underlying problems. The result is the most frustrating experience imaginable, spending most of your time stuck in animations or an out of control vehicle wishing you could do the simple, cool thing you want to do. Just go watch some youtube videos of someone blowing up a few bases and you'll get 95% of the fun of this game without any of the frustration.\n\nPossibly the single worst thing is that the one thing that does work right, the wingsuit, is deliberately gimped. Pitching up is extremely weak compared to all the other inputs, which eliminates the possibility for skillfully skimming just above the ground - especially combined with another "feature", where if you get REALLY close the the ground, you instantly dump your velocity and slow to a crawl. You wind up just taking easy routes higher up where you can't really maintain much speed, and just resorting to fast traveling everywhere since traversal is no fun.","December 26, 2015","false","42.9"," 39 of 69 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","39","69","2","1"

It's so enjoyable. If you are an action game lover than you should definitely try this game. This incredible thing is full of epic actions. After all, i got a super game as my own taste. I bet you'll sure love it. Such a vivid colorful environmetal game. Mostly sea area which covered with shiny sunlight. The aqua blue color of sky just scattered on the water which makes environment more tasty. That was hella fantastic feeling when i was flying like a bird in the sky above blue water.\n\nWell, There is nothing to explained about combat in this game. Just shooting with tons of skills you earned and you learnt. They featured so many types of weapons and vehicles. Those are badass. Especially blowing up vehicles and machines seems stunning tho. But the sound of explosion was so much real and remarkable. We can use grappling hook for stunning epic actions as always. I use it all the time for better action which makes it beyond epic scene. There is many more things about to explain. But it would be better if you try it yourself.\n\nWait wait wait, there is one more unique thing i have got that is Rebel Drop. Well, it's a app what we can use by collecting Beacon. We can choose our desired weapons and vehicles for Rebel Drop. But it depends on your Rebel Drop slots. It can be applied by just throwing beacon on any place. Then after a boom blast, you will get your gears. You can find those Beacons around the Medici.\n\nThe open world map of this game is 4X bigger than the map of Grand Theft Auto V, They just putted the entire world in this game. Every state of it's map is full of side missions for unlocking story missions. You can't play story missions if you don't conquere the world. Fina Story Mission gonna be unlocked after conquering 100%. So you can't ignore it. By the way, you have to unlock fast traveling way by completing few tasks. Then it's gonna be bit easier than before for traveling the world far quickly.\n\nI have to say Just Cause 3 is quiet optmized game. Um playing on Ultra High settings smoothly as hell. My rig's Intel Core i5 4690K, RAM 8GB DDR3, R9 Vapor-X 290 4GB GDDR5. Also um not getting any kind of Lags, Bugs, Errors and Crashes. But sometimes it took so much time on loading screen when i start the game. But after that, everythings perfect as hell.\n\nPros :::\n1. Best action and epic game ever\n2. Massive open world map with tons of side quests and activities\n3. Remarkable graphics quality which shines gorgeously at day time\n4. Quiet amazingly optimized\n5. New amazing unique features for better gameplay experience\n\nCons :::\n1. Sometime takes high time on loading screen when i start it\n2. Graphics quality seems bit disappointing at night.\n\nQuestion you may ask :::\n1. Is it well optimized ?\nAns : Yep it is\n\n2. Did they fix the vehicle driving physics in this one ?\nAns : well, it's still bit hard to control cars but it's far better than before\n\n3. Can i just play story missions then i will complete side quest time by time ?\nAns :  Nope, you have to complete side quests to unlock story missions.\n\n4. Did you get any crashes like JC3.Exe stopped working ?\nAns : Nopps. it was fresh and clean game for me\n\n5. Do i have to stay online all the time to play this game ?\nAns : No, you can play this offline also. But it's quiet enjoyable to play online for your gameplay record and scores\n\nRatings :::\nGameplay : 10/10\nActions : 10/10\nGraphics Quality : 8/10\nStory : 7/10\nOptimization : 9/10\nOpen World Activities : 10/10\nLocations : 10/10\nFeatures : 10/10\nOverall : 9.2/10\n\nSo this is what i can say for now about it. Will provide you amore infos time by time. Thanks to all.

I would rarely give such strong criticism but on a technical level this game is broke as f*ck.\nI've been a huge fan of the Just Cause series for 6 or 7 years now, and JC2 was probably some of the most fun I've ever had in a game. JC3 takes everything that is great about the series and in most cases IMPROVES on it, with one catch: the game runs like absolute crap. Look at the thousands of other reviews here to see this is far from an isolated issue. I'm running on a GTX 760 (would be two if SLI was even supported...), getting a little dated now but by no means a terrible card. And yet with all graphics on the lowest settings there's still stuttering and FPS drops into the single digits every few seconds.\n\nIt's such a huge shame because on the rare occassion that the gameplay isn't destroyed by FPS drops, horrible stuttering, or just flat out grinding to a halt, there is clearly an amazing game with dozens of hours of explosion-fuelled fun hiding underneath.\n\nI will update this review to positive when the devs actually do their job and release a game that actually works (I thought that was their job to begin with...?), however long it may take for patches and drivers to fix this broken game. Just another example of the sorry state of modern video games: release a sh*tty, broken game now; patch later.","December 6, 2015","false","40.0"," 112 of 209 people (54%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","54","112","209","16","9"

This is a honest review.\n\nIf you don't want to read the whole review, here's the quick version of my review:\nIs this game worth $40? YES, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.\nOnly took me 5 seconds into the first mission to realize this game is directed by Michael Bay.\n9/10.\n\nRatingDescriptionGameplay: 9/10The gameplay is purely amazing and really fun. The devs are like, "♥♥♥♥ real life physic, we will create a game with bollywood-physic.". There are so much places to explore, freedom, destructions, creative way to kill enemies, and chaos. The map is waaaay bigger than GTA V[www.gta5cheats.com]. And holy ♥♥♥♥, it's so amazing that i can't describe it with words. If you wanna experience the gameplay, play the game yourself. Don't watch others play. As for multiplayer, currently, there are no multiplayer yet but the people who made JC2-MP are currently working on JC3-MP[www.jc-mp.com], so the multiplayer will be available soon (and it's free! ). You only need to wait.Performance: 8/10.This game runs smooth 60 fps on medium-high setting on a GTX 960. Only crashed once in 24 hrs of gameplay. But i've heard AMD users got a terrible performance in this game. Honestly, this game deserves an Overwhelmingly Positive review. Almost all of the negative reviews are about AMD poor performance. So, if you are an Nvidia user, this game is massively recommended. Graphic: 8/10The graphic is quite good, it's a bit photorealistic. Sometimes, the graphic feels so real and it's easy to immerse yourself into the game thanks to the graphic and soundtracks. The explosions are amazing, probably this game has one of the most beautiful explosions. But there are only 3 (Correct me if i'm wrong ) Anti-Aliasing method in this game. FXAA, SMAA, and SMAA T2X. But the aliasing can be easily ignored since this is a high action game.\nStory: 7/10.The story is about an evil, cruel, and oppressive dictator. The story is ok, But you don't need a The Last of Us grade story in Just Cause, trust me.Soundtrack: 9/10.The soundtracks are amazing and even matches the quality of movie soundtracks. It matches the atmosphere and mood of the game very well. It makes every high-action scene in the game really ♥♥♥♥ing epic thanks to the soundtracks. It also makes you feel like a real hero.Overall: 9/10 The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Do you like explosions? Do you love to cause a chaos in a video game? Do you love to blow ♥♥♥♥ up for ♥♥♥♥ n' giggles? Do you love grappling hook? Do you love flying? Do you like epic action-movie-like game?\nIf yes, then i HIGHLY recommend you to get this game.

While this doesn't make it an outright bad game - many games are worse than JC2 and still quite fun - there's a real sour taste of lost opportunity about it.\n\nAlso, I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with the "how it looks vs how it runs" ramp on this - whoever messed this up so badly that RTSS's frame rate OSD didn't work is a real genius.  It's NOT just ATI people running into problems.  I'm running it from an 840 EVO on a 4.5ghz 4690k and an oc'd 970 (359.06) and I think it absolutely stinks performance wise.  Just look at it - turn off the blending SMAA mode, set up a frame rate log and watch this thing choke to way below 60fps doing ... nothing.  Absolutely nothing.\n\nBetween the pervasive stutter, mysterious performance drops, horrible mouse acceleration/negative acceleration (with everyone's favorite - mouse movement proportional to frame rate) double digit seconds loading times only to be placed right in the same spot after an in-engine cutscene or failing a challenge, it's hard to work out what it's burning cycles doing.  Barely capable of locking 60fps with most of the fancy effects turned off, and in doing so the overall image quality seems inferior to JC2.\n","December 1, 2015","false","6.6"," 49 of 89 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","49","89","3","8"

SEEMS TO BE FIXED\n- key bindings system is annonying as f***, because some actions share the same key, e.g. reloading your weapon on the bike and firing the secondary weapon in your plane/chopper\n- you can't run\n- you can't go directly out of wingsuit mode, you have to open your parachute first, in order to land... I WAS WRONG...YOU CAN.. YOU JUST HAVE TO UNLOCK THIS ABILITY\n- have you ever tried to drive a truck or bus? you have to constantly hold you 'a' or 'd' key for a couple of seconds to turn your wheels, which makes its almost impossible to effectively use those vehicles\n\n\nPROS\n- map is huge\n- game is fun (as long as you don't HAVE to use vehicles, as in races)\n\n(don't know if the following arguments are PROS)\n- boat handling is ok\n- chopper handling is ok\n\n\nEven though there are many CONS, the game still is a lot of fun!\nBut I hope that the negative reviews might get the developers' attention and cause them to fix some points.","March 9","false","62.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I've spent a little time with the game and I like some of the core functions of the game. It looks beautiful and almost every core function is an upgrade over Just Cause 2. Driving is much improved over the last game, but still doesn't hold a candle to the driving in something like GTA and I don't feel like there is a huge variety for land vehicles like there were in JC2. There are a lot of tacked on things that I don't enjoy: namely the whole gear and upgrade system. I feel like some of the game is essentially locked down until the player does all these gimmicky challenges that are pretty much bs. The rebel drop system has issues too, there are too many restrictions on it; you need to have a certain amount of beacons and on top of that, each vehicle has a cooldown. The developers should have implemented one or the other seeing as it's very common for dropped vehicles to just self destruct. The game also has some unsatisfactory performance on my system. I'm running an 8150 and a 780 which should more or less satisfy the requirements, however my gpu is under-utilized (running 60-70% gpu usage as shown by MSI Afterburner) and I get framerates anywhere from the low 30s to high 50s. My settings are mostly set to high, with shadows on medium, no AA and motion blur off. My advice would be to wait until someone makes a mod to bypass the challenges and maybe then consider the game. Personally I will keep playing it because I can't refund it at this point and the game is ok. If you see it anywhere for less than 40 bucks I think that is a worthwhile price, but I can't recommend this game at the full 60 dollar price.\n\nEDIT: I'ver found some mods that adress my issues with the gameplay: http://justcause3mods.com/mods/unlock-all-gear-mods/ http://justcause3mods.com/mods/no-rebel-drop-timers/ http://justcause3mods.com/mods/no-intro/ http://justcause3mods.com/mods/infinite-beacons/ . Game is still isn't perfect and I'm still getting some notably iffy performance, I still think it's not worth 60 dollars, but these mods make the game so much more fun to play.\n\nEDIT2: A ton of mods were broken last month including some of the ones I linked. Game performance is still meh at best.

In a way, it’s the happy-go-lucky sibling of Metal Gear Solid 5, with both games following war-weary, bearded freedom fighters catching up with old friends, revisiting past glories and attempting to save the world just one last time. There’s no stealth, of course – Rico Rodriguez only has one volume setting, which is LOUD – and Just Cause 3 has no pretensions to art or cultural significance. It just wants to p.a.r.t.y. and cause a few big bangs along the way.\n\nThis is GTA 5 without the clever script and social satire but with the destruction dial turned up to max. It’s the game Saints Row wishes it could be. It’s also the game that has more fun with physics than any game since Portal 2, and quite possibly the silliest, most overblown, most downright entertaining game of late 2015. It’s the Just Cause that you knew a Just Cause could one day be.\n\na few words:\ni'm aware there is some big Fps drops in the game with AMD card specially, but if you have a good RIG, let's say a 980GTX, the game runs smooth at 50 fps ultra settings in 1440P.\ni had a lot of fun playing that game, i'm nearly at the end of it, i think 53 hours and the 100% is accomplished.\n\nPros:\n- Hudge openworld game with endless possibility of Physic fun\n- New Game + , you can re-oppres outposts for endless destructions.\n- many Weapons, vehicles.\n- The world of JC3 has been put alive with animals and encounters.\n- Mutli-tethering with the grapple\nCons:\n- FPS drops\n- no SLI support atm... couldnt get the game run at 4K with the other 980\n- no outfits for Rico\n- handling of cars and choppers.... are bad... very bad for mouse and Keyboard..especially Choppers, maybe a good  Xbox One Controller will do the trick ( the game itself has been badly and simply ported to PC without changing some controlls...)\n\nI must say, i had a lot of fun in JC3, one of my favorite games in 2015 and i'll continue to play it just for fun for some amazing stunts.\n\nGreez\n\nDeacon\n\n\n\n\n","December 8, 2015","true","49.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The scenery looks beautiful, the weapons look and sound better than in the previous games, the vehicles actually handle much better, and even the aircraft no longer have that stupid left banking tendency like in the last game. However, performance seems to be the biggest issue here (you better be watching, Avalanche). It still takes far too much just to get the performance to be smooth. You can't even run max settings on a stable FPS unless your PC build has something like an i7-5820k and an NVidia Titan. Most people don't have that kind of cash to dump into the game. I strongly recommend removing the DRM anti-piracy system for starters. Yes, it's good to prevent piracy, but the game and the sales are now suffering even worse because of that hungry system, all in an effort to prevent the studio from losing sales (ironic). Furthermore, I think the leaderboard system is something that no one really pays attention to. Avalanche, please remove that too and allow the third party devs of JC2MP do their work. And please help them if you can. Do this, and your sales just got a whole lot better. If you have a decent enough build, I would definitely recommend this game.","April 27","true","46.1"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

If you take that on board you'll have more fun!\n\nI really like JC3 although it does have flaws. The wingsuit is amazing, exploring the map is an enjoyable experience and experimenting with the mechics is endlessly hilarious. There's plenty of things to do and I found the game easily ate up 50+ hrs while liberating all the settlements, completing the storyline and getting all the collectables.\n\nOnce you've done all that you're kinda left to your own devices. Unless you actively enjoy experimenting with the mechanics of the game, or happen to enjoy stunts there's not an awful lot left to do. You can reinstate individual locations and liberate them again but it's a little bit of an empty process with no goal. As a single player open world game this is a huge mistake not to add some kind of value to the game after it has been completed (DLC is on it's way but we don't have any idea of what content it will provide yet)\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to flaws. There's design decisions that leave me baffled: no FOV slider or choice of camera angles (I think they ran out of control pad buttons to use lol), assigning boost to different buttons depending on the type of vehicle you're in. The weird delay you get between stunt jumping on a vehicle and being able to grapple. The main island being virtually empty. The dumb AI. The crashing. The list goes on and on. The lack of keybindings. Jeez I could talk about the flaws for a LONG time as there are so many and they really do effect the expereince negatively.\n\nHaving said all that, I'm a huge fan of the Just CAuse franchise and the possibilities the game yields. As such I'm ok with overlooking the flaws. I spend a lot of my time stunting or creating silly experiments in JC3 and it's easily been worth the money paid. Will you enjoy it as much? I'm not sure... I suppose it depends how you play games. If you follow the missions and complete the story before moving on you may miss a lot about what makes JC3 so unique and enjoyable. However if you're more creative with your gameplay then you'll likely get a lot more from the experience.\n\nEither way I'm looking to the future now as the DLC shall be here soon (hopefully with more map content) and the JC2MP Team are working on a multiplayer mod for Just Cause 3.... which will change EVERYTHING!","January 30","true","296.8"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","28","50","5","0"

Dunno why but I found the gamedesign, phantasmagoric (ab)use of grappling hook in particular very entertaining. I spent dozens maybe hundreds of hours just flying across San Esperito or Panau if you like, setting on fire anything which could have been set on fire, destroying anything which could have beed destroyed. When JC3 was announced I was happy and was looking forward.\n\nI was very surprised when I noticed that reviews of JC3 are mixed mostly due technical issues, but it is understood. To be honest, there are no technical problems for me, I am the lucky one. After 60 hours of playing I have got just one single crash, that is it. Everything is smooth and rock solid. But I do not deny there are some issues just because I do not have one.\n\nJC3 story is bland but c'mon, JC has never been about the story, it is pure madness full of explosions and silly travelling across the huge map.\n\nGameplay is what a fan of JC franchise could have wished for - grappling hook, explosion, some racing, shooting explosion again, grappling hook, missile ride, shooting, grappling hook, explosion, shooting, explosion, grappling hook... Oh, did I mention the grappling hook?\n\nI am not disappointed, this game is true JC as I remembe and love. For the fans of JC it is must have. For the others - well, I would say try JC2 first, if you love it you will love JC3 too. If not then hands off, there is nothing new except some small but handy improvements (wingsuit!).\n\nI hope there are still some nasty dictators in the virtual world who need to be overthrown by Rico in the future! :)","December 19, 2015","true","65.7"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","0"

JC3 has some ok driving, it will seem fine and ok, but the racing challenges are when you will notice how bad the controles are especialy for the motorcycles. In some of the racing challenges they want very precise movement, but when you hit the turn button, even for a millisecond it has a 50 50 chance of either you not moving an inch or doing a 90 degree turn off a mountain and having to redo that whole 3 minutes again and again.\nAnother problem some will find is that the enemy bases tend to have the same copy and past layout, now this isn't that bad because of all the ways you can destroy everything, but its still something that is very noticable if you go base to base liberating everything.\nThe story also isn't very new or amazing, can't say much else about that.\n\nI would recommend this game to either diehard fans or people who can overlook these small issues, but I would really not untill the controle in the cars are fixed if you are the completionist type.\n\n\n","December 21, 2015","true","69.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","17","29","2","0"

There are a good variety of weapons and vehicles ranging from mortars to nuke launchers and tanks with energy shields, there are plenty to fuel your destruction.\n\nCompared to Just Cause 2, the weapons and vehicles are better (although lack of a Tuk-Tuk Boom is disappointing) and the grapple and wingsuit add new dimensions. As a base game, Just Cause 3 is just Just Cause 2 with a new map and more to play with, unlike how Just Cause 2 was a complete makeover compared to the first Just Cause.\n\nIs it worth full price? I don't think so, although I bought this game off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for £17 and got a free game as a bonus. For £17 this game is definitely worth it.\n\nThe upcoming DLC including Sky Fortress certainly looks fun, I'll make a review for the DLC when each is released.\n\nOverall, if you are expecting a game completely better than Just Cause 2, then this is not it. If you are a person who hasn't played a Just Cause game before, then this is a brilliant game to play. For a price like £39.99 it is not worth it for any interested party, although considering I got it for £17 off from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it is best to get it from there and the price is getting cheaper all the time.","February 23","true","15.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

With my quite good build, I ram like crazy unless I turn everything down. So basically, I play on low-medium settings so that I don't experience framerate issues, but even then I get sometimes some drops.\nEDIT:\nSince the recent patch it's much better, as I can run it in full-medium settings (and 1080p) without any framerate issue, so that's a big plus.\n\nNow let's review itI'll do my usual thing, a pros and cons list.\n\nPros1) The game, even if I play on low settings, looks good. It's colorful, bright, smooth, and the explosions are incredibly enjoyable\n2) The sounds are ok, and the voice actors (for the french version at least) are really funny and well done.\n3) I liked the musics, even though they are quiet and you don't really hear them.\n4) The gameplay is fun and addictive. I love the wingsuit, I enjoy moving through the mountains with my gears, the shooting is fun. Though I had to remap a bit my controls because I wanted it to feel like Just Cause 2, it plays well, and it is fun.\n5) The explosions and the grappling hook... Nothing else to say, it's just well done. The game become somewhat a physics-based game with the ability to use your grappling.\n6) Huge map, a lot of places to blow up.\n7) I don't have any problem with this leaderboard thing, I find it fine and a good thing, to compare yourself with other people.\n\nCons1) You won't give a crap about the story, as for Just Cause 2.\n2) The map is too big. Yes, I said it was a pro, but my main problem is when you try to go from an island to the other. If you don't have a jet, it'll take forever to crosse the water.\n3) I still don't get how the chaos work for this episode - might change this point once I figure it out.\n4) As stated above, the optimization, it's still not great, but they are working on it.\n\nConclusionOverall, this game is a fun experience, if you like blowing things up and killing people like there is no tomorrow (which is my case so...). If you want deep story, dark intrigue, multiplayer mode or realistic gunfight, just ignore this game. I think that if you liked Just Cause 2, you'll like this one too. It's not perfect, it surely isn't as good as JC2, but it's fun, and it gives you explosion, so it's nice.\n\nBEFORE ANYONE ASK FOR MY CONFIG:\nIntel Core i7 4970k quadcore 3.6GHz\n16Go DDR3 RAM\nNvidia GTX960 with 2Go GDDR5\nAnd I run on Windows 10","December 11, 2015","true","22.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

First off I would like to say that it is a great game and despite the many performance and technical issues people are having I believe it is a really good game. I myself have no had any issues to speak of besides the occasional crash, which is to be expected in a game less than a week old. In my setup currently I have an R9 290x with the latest drivers an FX 8350 and 16gb of ram. I run this game maxed out and get 60fps most of the time except during explosions which I believe is due to my CPU. When buying this game I had hoped for a game that was similar to Just Cause 2 but just had more features and was overall a better more polished game. It did not disappoint, the addition of the wingsuit is enough for me to want to buy the game. Nothing beats soaring through the skies or gliding across the ground in a wingsuit.  This game brings all the great things that we all loved from Just Cause 2 and more, I cannot reccommend it enough.  Although the story may not be great, for me the game isn't about the story I play it for the free roam and base liberation, the story to me is more or less just a side mission. Overall this is a great game and has many amazing features that solidify this game as my favourite game of the year even taking top spot over the Witcher 3: WIld Hunt. Even though many people have had performance issues my game runs as smooth as butter. All in all a fantastic game.

The game is awesome, improvements over JC2 all over the place, but, now this is a huge BUT, it is a beta.\n\nOk they have released it as a full game but there are still way too many little things and bugs for it to be a full game, don't get me wrong, I have maybe been luckier than some as I haven't seen any game killing bugs, such as memory leaks and severe artifacts in the graphics like what some players have said, the game runs fine, although I do have a fairly high spec system, i7-4770k(OC4.2), 32Gb RAM and a GTX980Ti, the problems I see are really obvious beta issues.\n\nFor instance; after completing a section of the game a street band starts to play, I know they are a band as I can hear the music and indeed see them playing their instruments, but hold on, they are really, really good instruments because they are invisible, they much have cost a fortune. Yep they are going through the motions, playing a harmonica and I see someone playing a guitar but the instruments are just not there.\n\nI have shot someone, they are dead, I know they are dead because I shot them in the head, I even got a "Head Shot" counter. But after a few seconds, he got up and started shooting again, hell, zombies get everywhere these days.\n\nI was driving up a winding road, when there was a bit of a traffic jam, I over took, as you do, to find a bus reversing down the mountain, he crashes in to a car and knocks the car over the side, of course the car explodes, this is Just Cause after all, but then the bus then drives forward, on the wrong side of the road and just continues like that. Now I'm english so I'm used to driving on the left but I thought we were meant to drive on the right in Medici.\n\nYou will also see other kamikazi type manoeuvre, in other words, although it is very funny it is quite poor AI.\n\nSo as you can see, although the game is completely playable, well is for me, it is far from finished. I assume it was rushed out for the holiday period to get the sales. I fully expect some huge patches not far over the horizon.\n\nLastly I would just like to say that even though it has some bugs, it is still very enjoyable and it is also huge, the map is absolutely massive and with lots of small expansions already coming, it really is worth getting, just maybe give it a little while for the 1st patch.\n\nHope this helps, thats why I wrote this. Now I'm off to drive my car backwards all over town. It's the way its done on Medici after all. :)","December 7, 2015","true","40.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

After loading in and seeing a world made of floating triangles, I updated to beta drivers for my graphics card. The floating triangles were fixed, but now I was stuck constantly firing my weapon. Turns out having a gamepad plugged in was causing that, which was a shame because I like to drive with the gamepad. After finally fixing all these issues, I finally got to play a bit of the game. After driving round a few corners, the game crashed to desktop.\n\nAbsolutely horrendous for a game that is supposed to be finished. I've played day one early-access games that work better than this.

It might not win an Oscar for best screenplay, but it works for the game just fine.\n\nGRAPHICSAMD users are currently having serious issues with this game. I recommend waiting for a patch before buying it.\nAvalanche knows how to make a good looking open world: the islands and mountains of Medici look gorgeous, and each town and base is beautiful to blow up in an orchestra of explosions. The physics are also improved and both more realistic and fun, and more objects can be destroyed, including bridges. The performance was mostly pretty good (45fps on an average laptop) and the game crashed only once while recording with Fraps. It's mostly been a stable experience.\nThe character model of Rico finally looks badass, especially because of the beard. The only real complaint I have is related to everyone else: the NPCs are not very detailed and can get repetitive pretty fast. Still, it looks amazing and it was very relaxing to wingsuit from a mountaintop into the ocean.\n\nGAMEPLAYWhen playing Just Cause 3, you must know what you are getting into. It's a game that wants to deliver an open world filled with enemy bases and cities in which you must destroy propaganda billboards, fuel tanks, antennas and radars. And the game completely delivers in that.\nThis is basically an improved version of Just Cause 2: the shooting feels smoother, you can actually walk on vehicles even while driving, you can pull tethered objects, the driving is (slightly) better, and the missions are a bit more fun. They even got completely rid of QTEs, and you can call Rebel Drops with vehicles and weapons without using any money. To move around the environment you have cars, tanks, jets and boats, as well as the grappling hook, parachute and a really fast and useful wingsuit that makes running away from bad situations very easy.\nOther than story missions, you can destroy outposts or complete Challenges. Each Challenge is related to a different gameplay area (shooting, driving, destroying), and you get Gears that unlock new modifications to improve Rico: carry more grenades, tether more objects, fast Rebel Drops deployments... Thus you get rid of annoying weapon and vehicle upgrades, making the game just less frustrating to play.\nThe game is as boring as you want it to be: you can just shoot rockets and bullets at everything, or try to tether a car packed of explosives to a sphere tank and watch it all blow up in glorious fashion. You make your experience fun or boring.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is mostly challenging while trying to get an high score in Challenges or in some bases with tight security. The AI isn't all that polished, and sometimes might shoot at nothing, but they did manage to kill me a couple of times, especially when I was trying to look cool.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is fairly good and the sound effects are as always top notch. The voice acting is also the perfect blend of cheesy and self-aware, and I laughed a couple of times during the cutscenes because of some delivery (especially from Mario).\n\nREPLAYABILITY1000 km² of playground, 47 Steam achievements (mostly about Story missions and 100% completion), plenty of challenges and endless possibilities to cause chaos will keep you entertained for many hours to come.\n\nOverall, I find this to be a vary damn fun video game. If you enjoyed Just Cause 2 and open world games, the game is pretty much the same and there is plenty of content to keep you hooked. However, some of you might find the whole experience repetitive and tedious. But adrenaline junkies and fans of over-the-top action movies will feel fantastic, going from base to base blowing everything up.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 4\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","December 5, 2015","true","43.0"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","30","55","4","0"

I would recomend it for all who love games that you can have freedom to use weapons of mass destruction and enjoyable vehicles in an open world.\n\nThe game holds the same aspects of openworld exploration, explotion physics and masive destrcution.\nThe new added mods you can give to vehicles, weapons and other tools like your new grapple hook and explosives make the game ten times more exitment to your gameplay.\n\nNot only do they create more storyline capeabilitys, but they also create huge possabilitys for what you do after you finnish the 10-90 hour long storyline. The storyline itself is very well placed, it continues on the life of Reco Rodreges and links in very well with the first two games. It incloods very important parts of Recos first game and links them to the present. This works very well with the main protaganist of the story, Di Revelo...... The game also uses collectable diry tapes to give the gamer an inside knowlage to how Di Revelo became the dictator he is and how he thinks.\nThis effect is very good because it creates an imersive way to collect a charicters backstory.\n\nThe grapple hooks new capeabilitys are at first challenging to grasp, however after about a few minutes of learning the controlls and getting into them, the use becomes natural. The new grapple hook creates millions of new possible options for the player to explore, for example I made a line of airplanes and few them of as they where linked, I then few them down and dropped them on to create a masive bomb. Like i said, you can have fun in the mass amoundt of exploive choices.\n\nMy only bad part of the game I expirienced was the hellping of people in the game, this could be rebbles or civilians. The number of setblements on the map where a lot less in numbers to the 2nd games numbers . I personaly belived it did not fit in and was no imersive. However compared to the great qualitys I have already talked about these two points are not that much of a problem.\n\nMighty_Magnusson\nPS: Sorry about spelling errors, I try my best.","February 25","true","63.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Depends how well your computer can perform, and how much money you want to spend.\nThis is a great game, very stunning, this includes the vehicles, Rico himself and just the world.  The weapons are great, flying around is fun, pretty easy to get used to the controls. Some downsides to this game is that it is very short, it is easy to finish and liberate all of the areas.

There are many fun and practical additions to the game, however, it cannot top its predecessor in terms of scale. Rather, it focuses on a more dense, vivid and varied world located in the waters of the sunny mediterranean with another despot for Rico to topple.\n\nSadly, it is plagued by performance issues that keep many players from enjoying the stunning visuals of an otherwise good game.

I love anything with an engine and this games (to me) is only let down by the absolut jank way anything with an engine handles. Cars? yeah some are ok, others are the ♥♥♥♥. Motorbikes? I love motorbikes, I ride one my self. Well forget having fun on them in this. By far the worst thing within the game. They should  have just left them out. Planes and helicopters? yeah they're ok. Dislike using keys for flying but there's no yaw (that I could figure out) on a controller so I manned the hell up and delt with it. Boats, yeah they're alright. Like boats in other games really. A bit floaty though.\n\nNow. The good things.\nBeautiful. Cannot comment on the janky performance 'cause I've had solid 60 through out. I dropped to 55 once, in the big city but I hear a lot of people have issues there (?).\nIt really is pretty.\nThe explosions are.. yeah the best I've seen in a game. upclose... a bit less so, but from a safe distance (lol wuts that?) they're proper good.\nWingsuit. Awww yeah, that things awesome. hard to learn but blooming enjoyable and a much prefered way to travel.\nWeapons. not a huge selection but they're ok. the specials are all nice and veried. the rest are soso.\nThe story, I'm yet to finish it but from what I've seen its pretty good. Standard quality for todays triple A titles.\nDestruction. yeah top notch.\nCollectables and challenges. some real challenges, others are a cake walk. The collectables are ewsy enough to find as they're all marked on the map >.< but they each reward things. Shrines do some fast travel stuff. the acient parts give you new toys. and the tapes offer an interesting listen to the rise of Mr. Mustacheo evil bugger.\nThe maps huge. Well, it looks and feels huge. You can cover 5Km's with the wing suit in about 2 to 3 minutes or less. I think its at least 10 to 20 minutes from top to bottom using only the wing suit which I think is about ~130kmh","February 22","true","66.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The voice acting of most characters is done with an italian accent and sometimes they sound funny. Even the PSAs that you hear on the radio after liberating a base are hilarious.\n\nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously. Story is generic, just as expected, but you are here for the action and to blow stuff up - and that is where the game shines. Explosions look awesome with nice particle effects and Rico Rodriguez, the one-man-army, has a lot of creative ways to make things go BOOM. You can use a wide variety of guns and vehicles, but some of your best and most fun toys unlock later in the game.\n\nThe open-world is filled with optional activities and collectibles, but there is some grinding involved if you want to unlock all the mods. Although the open-world is huge, there are a lot of useless green areas like forests or fields that make for long travelling times between objectives (until fast travel is unlocked).\n\nUnfortunately the game is not very well optimized for PC and the physics engine acts unexpected sometimes. If you are hoping for another Mad Max then you'll be disapointed because this game requires a high-end machine to run smooth. There is an always-online component that makes the game stutter. Also, found one game breaking bug in a main story mission so I would suggest to wait for further patches that will hopefully improve optimisation and fix all issues.\n\nOverall: I had a fun time with Just Cause 3 and I recommend it if you like open-world action games.\n\nViva Medici!","January 13","true","47.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That said, hopefully the patch, when it comes, will address some of these...\n\n1) If you're used to the parachute controls in JC2 and the JC2MP mod, you're going to find the parachute handles very differently in JC3. Whilst it feels a lot more realistic, it's a lot slower and less responsive in its handling in JC3, so I find myself having to crunk my way around, which is tedious by comparison to JC2's parachute handling. I know there's a wingsuit, but try flying very tight turns between city buildings in the wingsuit and staying aloft.\n\n2) The land vehicle handling has been commented on by other posters - slow to start turning, then turns very sharply. I know JC2's vehicles had very sensitive handling, but at least it was fairly linear, so you could get used to the sensitivity after a while. The overall handling in JC3 is also less responsive, less fun as far as I can see.\n\n3) The failure to respond to control input which dogged JC2 and the MP mod is still apparent in JC3. Some of it is because Rico's busy doing something else with his hands (reloading, etc), but I've had plenty of times where Rico's just completely ignored the first two or three button presses while doing absolutely nothing else. The worst instance is when trying to place C4 on the underside of a chopper that's airborne - on one occasion, I had to hit the mouse button about 10 times to get him to finally place the explosive.\n\n4) Some of the missions are really quite badly put together. Again, maybe a patch would add a bit of polish, but as one example, having to push one of the NPCs 25 metres to persuade them to get onto a chopper so the mission could end isn't hugely impressive.\n\nOn the plus side:\n\na) Even on my crusty rig (i5-750, GTX 750Ti, 8GB RAM and an SSD), the game looks pretty good with some of the settings turned down, and it runs well in terms of frame-rate (though there are occasional slowdowns and the odd crash to desktop).\n\nb) The wingsuit has a steep learning curve, and the handling still needs work IMO, but it's a lot of fun :-)\n\nc) There's a good choice of weapons, and the tanks are great for shooting up bases from nearby hillsides without even being detected :-)\n\nI like JC3 a lot, and I'm optimistic the patch might help improve things further, but after more than 400hrs on JC2, and more than 900hrs on JC2MP, I still think it could have been better.","December 9, 2015","true","66.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Since the first trailer I was overwhelmed with hype, however, here it is.\n\nIll start by saying, this game is beautiful, graphically speaking.\nAgain, HOWEVER, the pc port is porely optimised, and I was getting huge frame drops, on a  GTX 970.\nThough the wingsuit is a GREAT feature, I found myself getting bored, as the story missions are locked behind repetitive liberations, where you blow ♥♥♥♥ up. BLOWING ♥♥♥♥ UP IS GREAT, especially in a game about blowing ♥♥♥♥ up, you'd expect it to be. sigh, HOWEVER, the novelty of blowing ♥♥♥♥ up quickly wears off, and the story becomes increasingly stale.\n\nIt lacks an FOV slider. cmon, guys, there is also no ability to remap gamepad controls. wtf?\nI decided to go for keyboard+mouse, and remap the controls to jc2's. big mistake. for the controls to properly function you need to dive into the games files, and remap them there, otherwise there is overlap, that can't be changed. (I'm looking at you, "F" key.)\n\nThis game has, without a doubt, the prettiest explosions, and prettiest world, in pc gaming for this year. (excluding GTA V), props to avalanche for that.\n\nAiming in requires an unlock. And spriting is gone aswell, I'm going to overlook this, as the game has a lot of controls, and it is supposed to be a console game, at heart, but seriously.\n\nLike i mentioned at the start, I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS, but it's fallen flat on its face, compared to Just Cause 2.\n5/10. perhaps a patch can solve a few of the issues, performance wise, if so, ill bump it up to a 6.\n\nVerdict: Buy it, play it for a bit, see if you like it, if not, refund it, like I unfortunately did.

You aren't misleading people.\n\n-Game hasn't been out for half a year and ALREADY, the store page is STACKED full of DLC bonus content. $2.50 for a weapon that doesn't stand out to the other rifles in the game? A game bundle? A vehicle that is equivalent to a golf cart? That isn't any different to the other DOZENS of sweet sport cars, trucks, tanks etc. How is this unique? All this is fine with me, DLC and all I am usually fine with it, but these DLC SUCK! And CLEARLY there is still Mixed reviews about this, and although 15% are trolls, the majority actually have problems with this game and the fact that they aren't stabilizing the game and instead just shoving all these bonus content down our throats is insult to injury. FIX YOUR GAME SO THAT IT EQUATES TO THE $60 USD PRICE! Right now, it's at $30 USD I reckon. With 8GB of RAM you have to stop playing after a few hours or it still start stuttering like it has Parkinson's Disease.\n\n\n-You can have a PC that is just below the min specs and still have a blast. You can have a super strong PC over the recommended specs and still have a blast no problem. But it is vice versa. 980 ti? Peforms horribly. R7 200 on all lowest settings? Peforms well, so long as you have more than 8GB of RAM. Every computer has millions of different things going on that makes this game a gamble to play on. Thank god I got this for only $20, but I am leaving this as negative to ♥♥♥♥ off fanboys and that I'm a bit salty they have so much DLC trash already in less than........December........now it's March........4 MONTHS! Without even looking into the major issues of the game and also not updating the specs to 16GB not 8.","March 21","false","6.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

So even if you are online, but games are filted by a firewall, forget it.   I was on the fence about recomended this game or not, that DRM kills it.\n\nPro:\nExplosions\nFlying\nGrappeling things to things - You cannot have more fun than hanging enimies in a jeep from a cave roof. grappling a helicopter to a huge rock\n\nCons:\nLimited varity - every town liberation is the same basic thing.\nNo reall stand out locations.   There is some varity of terrain, but nothing to say you are in X city or Y port.  Each city and port could be swapped out and no one would  notice.\nNo challange - Rico is a god among men, with a pistol and using none of his other abilties he can take on an army.  Add in the grappler, wing suit and drops, the enemy should be giving up.   I tend to die most often from SAM sites respawning or de hacking themselves more than the actual AI.   In fact the time I am most at risk is trying to take a helicopter, as for some reasons SAM's aim at you while hanging outside of one too.\nUnlimited flying - Seriously between the parachute and the wingsuit you never have to touch the ground.  it is faster than a car, and always availbe... outside of long trips over the ocean all vehicles in this game are just toys with no purpose.\n\n\nTL:DR - If you truly enjoyed the random explosions and chaos of JC2, this game is worth a look (I'd wait for a sale).   If you want anyting at all more than that, keep playing JC2, this game is a mild upgrade to it.","January 6","false","31.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

If you buy this game expecting a deep and introspective work of art, look elsewhere. If you buy it and are looking for a fun game to experiment with and show your friends, this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful graphics and map design (love the vivid colors, lush landscapes and the sea is gorgeous.)\n- Very fun gameplay (explosions, flying, and killing, oh my)\n- Lots to work towards if you are a completionist\n- Non-linear so you can progress past the missions or ignore them altogether after a point\n- Lots of Easter Eggs\n- Civilian cars can be captured and then ordered via black market supply drops\n- Lots of models of cars, planes, tanks, and weapons to use\n- Super corny voice-acting (JC staple)\n- Sound effects are high quality\n- Visual effects are stunning\n- The new Wingsuit navigates really smoothly and is very fun once you get the hang of it\n\nCons:\n- Occasional bugs (nothing game-breaking for me as of yet, but I've had to restart a few missions due to bugged objectives)\n- Physics are wonky as hell (can be a pro in some cases, it's more geared towards fun than realism but mostly proves clunky and strange)\n- Driving has some of the worst physics I've come across in any game (motorcycles are nearly impossible to drive)\n- Moving rico around can be a hassle and interacting with vehicles or items can be a pain\n- Not much depth story or character wise, but this is to be expected\n- Always online can prove to be a nuisance if your connection is spotty (constant reconnection attempts)\n\nAll in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone considering it who knows what they are in for in a Just Cause game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzbucket/recommended/225540/","fuzzbucket","Dr.Sanders","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzbucket/","50 products in account","So, i've been waiting years for this game to come out. I was a huge fan of JC2 and went all in on JC3. JC2 did a lot of things well, and JC3 looked to build off of that. But there are definetly issues, and I would not recommend this game to anyone until they are addressed.\n\n1. The game takes forever and a day to start. and THEN it has to "login", which also takes forever. I clocked it at 1min30S to get to the ACTUAL menu that lets you start the game.\n2. they want you to submit support issues to a terribly designed, unusuable support portal. what a joke. I'm happy to communicate issues instead of write a bad review, but their support portal is truly terrible and is more a hommage to support, like its an obligation, than a portal that is serious about fielding support and feedback. Needlessly beurocratic and specific, when all you should be giving me is a big textbox. That raises questions for me about how serious they are about making this a great game and listening to user feedback; because it's the same kinda ♥♥♥♥ you'd expect from EA.\n3. Its 'E'  to get into a vehicle, but good luck figuring out how to get out of a vehicle. maybe it's apce? maybe it's W, or A? one of them seems to do it eventually, but it's not at all what i would normally expect or do.\n4. the tutorial system, meant to clarify how to use the game, manages to be confusing. JC2 had one too, but it was a good one. It's unconnected from what you need to do, not clear, and more annoyance than helpful. really really wish this was better, because they've done better in the past; which makes it so frustrating. I don't know how you could create this and use this and think its overall a good idea.\n5. can't `esc` to exit map. MUST hit tab again. boo. can't 'esc' to exit menu, have to hit...CTRL??? who designes this nonsense?\n6. 'F' used to be grapple in JC2, now is explosives. have made that mistakemany many times. Perhaps more an annoying learning curve, but equally its annoying that keybindings would change so much between versions; makes going between JC2/JC3 painful. But, its not like the change is illogical; grappling is now considered a primary action, in place of the weapon switch.\n7. GET RID OF THE SOCIAL. I want MULTIPLAYER not some nonsense leaderboard against people I don't know or care about. If I can't play with my friends, it's a single player game. Who thought this was a good idea? Really? because they should be fired.\n8. No way to start the game in offline mode, or skip login, or anything. i never want to be online with this game!\n\nIf/once the above issues are fixed, I can recommend the game, because it is otherwise a good game. They focused on fun and not restrictions, and it shows. There's lots to love, to be honest. But, the above issues are not nothing, sans #6. They improved the drops so you can airdrop a few things, which I definetly wanted in JC2. So, they aren't just making a JC3 to milk the fanbase, but they are going to need to release fixes and patches to make this game better than JC2. Which, it can be, if they address the issues. If/when they do, I will update my review/recommendation.","December 3, 2015","false","3.0"," 24 of 44 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","24","44","0","1"

In my opinion, this is an entirely different game. Of course it has elements from JC2 but I like to believe that the developers wanted to give a completely different angle. JC2 was awesome but in my opinion, JC3 is too.\n\nThe environment is absolutely incredible. It gives a real feeling of being in a Mediterranean country and I have been playing this game for around 25 hours now, and haven't even been to ~3/4th of the map.\n\nThe vehicle system is a lot of fun. The fact that you can bring cars, motorcycles, boat and even freaking planes to a garage so that you can drop them anytime you want is awesome. I have to agree that the handling of some vehicles can be troublesome, but it makes me love the variety in vehicles even more.\n\nSome say the hate the fact that there is no sprinting, no crouching etc. Forget about that. The possibilities are endless with the amazing upgraded grappling hook you get right from the start. And lets not forget that you can use a two handed weapon from the sky with your parachute and pull yourself towards enemies to stomp their faces in. No need for crouching or sprinting.\n\nThe detail, on almost every part of the game, is extreme. For example, I was driving an F1 and a small rock hit my front axle, what made the front wheels shiver a bit. You may call this stuff a pre in a game, but I can see a lot of effort went into it in this game.\n\nDid I mention a modding system INSIDE the game? You can complete challenges to get gears and with gears you can upgrade everything. Literally everything: Plane, Car, Boat, Weapons, Grenades and even your grappling hook. You hate repeating races, destruction etc? Not with this feature ill tell you that.\n\nNow the last part I am going to discuss are the graphics. Which are of course, amazing. I know there have been some optimization issues, but if you meet the minimal requirements you will most likely be able to run the game fine. I use a GTX 780 combined with an FX-8320 AMD processor and 16gis of ram, and I run the game on max, max and max without any optimization issues. If you are worrier about all the loading times everyone has been complaining about, it was fixed last patch.\n\nSo if you are actually still reading this right now, whats the matter? Just ignore the freaking 64% positive reviews and buy the game to find out for yourself!\n\n","December 19, 2015","true","81.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Sounds exactly like Just Cause 2. in Just Cause 2 theres an island that you are trying to take back from a dictator and tyrant called President Panau, pretty much the same game. No, its not.\n\nThe level of destruction and freedom in Just Cause 2 is tiny compared to what you can do in Just Cause 3. You see a helicopter, grappling hook it to the support of a bridge and reel it in, this not only blows up the helicopter it will blow up the bridge, if you are lucky enough to do this to a railway bridge as a train goes over it, the train will fall off of the bridge and explode, honestly its great!\n\n","December 3, 2015","true","25.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

In my opinion, this is an entirely different game. Of course it has elements from JC2 but I like to believe that the developers wanted to give a completely different angle. JC2 was awesome but in my opinion, JC3 is too.\n\nThe environment is absolutely incredible. It gives a real feeling of being in a Mediterranean country and I have been playing this game for around 25 hours now, and haven't even been to ~3/4th of the map.\n\nThe vehicle system is a lot of fun. The fact that you can bring cars, motorcycles, boat and even freaking planes to a garage so that you can drop them anytime you want is awesome. I have to agree that the handling of some vehicles can be troublesome, but it makes me love the variety in vehicles even more.\n\nSome say the hate the fact that there is no sprinting, no crouching etc. Forget about that. The possibilities are endless with the amazing upgraded grappling hook you get right from the start. And lets not forget that you can use a two handed weapon from the sky with your parachute and pull yourself towards enemies to stomp their faces in. No need for crouching or sprinting.\n\nThe detail, on almost every part of the game, is extreme. For example, I was driving an F1 and a small rock hit my front axle, what made the front wheels shiver a bit. You may call this stuff a pre in a game, but I can see a lot of effort went into it in this game.\n\nDid I mention a modding system INSIDE the game? You can complete challenges to get gears and with gears you can upgrade everything. Literally everything: Plane, Car, Boat, Weapons, Grenades and even your grappling hook. You hate repeating races, destruction etc? Not with this feature ill tell you that.\n\nNow the last part I am going to discuss are the graphics. Which are of course, amazing. I know there have been some optimization issues, but if you meet the minimal requirements you will most likely be able to run the game fine. I use a GTX 780 combined with an FX-8320 AMD processor and 16gis of ram, and I run the game on max, max and max without any optimization issues. If you are worrier about all the loading times everyone has been complaining about, it was fixed last patch.\n\nSo if you are actually still reading this right now, whats the matter? Just ignore the freaking 64% positive reviews and buy the game to find out for yourself!\n\n","December 19, 2015","true","81.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I wish I could.  I want to . . .\n\nYet it is clear that while prettier than Just Cause 2, this is really a major setback, in lots of ways.\n\nFrom the much smaller map to the lack of compelling things to do, to the horrible voice acting . . .\n\nFirst off, the acting really bothered me.  Never mind that our intrepid hero looks less like Tony Montana in Scarface and more like Nathan Drake in the Uncharted games, they seem to have found a different voice actor that for whatever reason can't seem to hit on Rico's vibe.  The voice acting is so terrible and flat that one cannot say "it's so bad it's laughable" because it isn't.  It is just horrid. It sounds tired and worn out, the one-liners stilted and about as light as a helicopter with a missing rotor.   You to will be if you go through the motions in this lifeless game.\n\nI am not going to comment on the memory leaks or the stutters or even the flickering textures.  Plenty has been said of that elsewhere.  What I will comment on is how lazy the writers got with this game, or how poorly Avalanche seems to remember who Rico was from the first two games.  My feeling was that Rico was a from Central or South America and was a graduate of the School of the Americas . . . replete with exploding cigars for Castro and brutal interogation tactics.  In the previous game he reminded me in look and sound of Al Pacino's Tony Montana, espeically at the end of the film when he yells out, with abandon, "Say hello to my L I T T L E Frriend!!!".  Now he is apparently the "Most Interesting Man Alive" and selling beer, while wearing Nathan Drake's face . . .\n\nThe game feels off from the get go.   There seems to be no cover mechanic.  I think it's time he had one, you know, in this day and age.  At the very least give us the old fashioned CROUCH back.  Even worse still, Rico cannot run, Stunt Jump is gone, and his dive move is also missing, leaving the player nothing but strafe as a gunplay option, which blows.  I cannot believe that Avalanche could mess this up so bad.  Such a basic thing!  EDIT:  Recently Avalanche expressed to the community that crouching, sprinting and any sort of cover mechanic was INTENTIONALLY elminated from gunplay to "encourage" players to use Rico's Aerial Moveset.  That's like telling someone that is behind a shipping container to instead run out into the open and take the RPG to the chest because "your aerial moves are freaking cool!"  Come on!\n\nThe bad acting is apparent right from the beginning, so that sorta lent to that "huh?" feeling.  And then Rico's relationship to this island feels completely off too.  He talks with such gusto about destroying the place that I actually said, out loud mind you, "what about the civilians?"\n\nEarly on, other problems become apparent:  In the middle of a mission to complete the capture of a town, I recieved two different, apparently random, protection objectives, one including stealing a car . . . while I was attempting to raise the flag and capture the town.  One would think that in a main storyline mission, random missions wouldn't just pop up requiring your attention.\n\nI am not having most of the problems others have with this game, so I cannot comment on those, except there are curious texture issues and some stuttering.  Everything else looks very pretty.  It just doesn't play that way.\n\nI am so frustrated with the performance issues and the attitude of the developers that I am no longer interested in Avalanche's future projects.  Last time I get burned by a developer.\n\nWhen it comes back on sale, grab Just Cause 2.  It is more than worth anything that you pay for it, I just cannot say the same about 3.","December 9, 2015","false","6.1"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

I've been waiting for this game since it was announced and was happy to purchase the game with no problems. This is where the trouble begins. Let me preface this by stating my system specs, and I've tried this game with multi GPU setups as follows:\n\nIntel Core i7 2600k @5.0 Ghz\n8Gb DDR3 Ram\nMSI R9 380 in Crossfire\nWindows 10\n\n2nd test system:\n\nIntel Core i7 2600k\n8Gb DDR3\nEVGA GTX 970 SSC\nWindows 10\n\nSo upon release and unlocking the everything went smoothly if you can get over the fact that it has DRM up the wazoo and it asks you to sign up your email for an account, the typical 2015 move game devs do. All of that aside the menus and everything were smooth and jumping in the game was a breeze. My first setup with settings on High to very high results were terrible. Frame stuttering, frame rate drops like crazy and everything was just unplayable. Let alone the frame rate issues but there were bugs and part of the map were invisible and didnt load.\n\nI installed the "beta" drivers everyone seems to be doing but with no results. The AMD beta drivers have done nothing and pretty much gave me the same results. The game DOES NOT use crossfire so I disabled that and got the same crap resutls. It was time to move onto the Nvidia system.\n\nJumping on the nvidia system and playing the game proved that this game was incomplete and broken. I was getting higher frame rates but everytime I shot, got shot at, or blew something up there was huge frame drops. This affirmed my decision to refund the game after about 20 minutes of play time and fiddling around with graphics settings, details, driver updates and so on. Avalanche really messed this release up and it looks like hard working customers are punished yet again. Don't buy this game until its fixed and honestly its not even worht pirating. Dont give these people your money and put it towards an indie developer who really cares about a game. Buy Rocket League, give Psyonix your money and not these plebs over at Avalnache and Square.

Will still play it to beat it but will be done after story. I can not recommend this game due to poor AA(jaggies are almost appearent on many shapes),frequent crashes, poor graphic options that do not work(resolution change for me), and to take the cake..they clearly did not care about AMD users. Check my profile for my specs..I use Nvidia and intel but they seriously dropped the ball on this one. It is not fair for developers to be able to release broken games or games that detract from a users experience. Not to preach for Fallout 4 because it does have its problems being a massive game but with many many many more users had a succesful launch while Just Cause 3 boasts that there was a lot of users in the world but the person count is extremely low compared to Fallout 4 or even Black Ops 3. I only added those games to make a point on what Just Cause 3 developer said.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illusionyary/recommended/225540/","illusionyary","Illusionyary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illusionyary/","50 products in account",""That looks fun, let's blow it up!" - The Game.\n\nJust Cause 3 is an openworld sandbox game set in the beautiful mediterranean environment of the fictional nation of Medici. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a former mercernary for the Agency returning to his homeland after many years to discover it has been completely taken over by an evil dictator hellbent on terrorizing the people and ruling the world! Rico meets his childhood friend Mario, who explains to him that a local rebellion is fighting back and needs his assistance.\n\nThus, Rico and his newfound friends within the local rebel militia must liberate towns and destroy military bases to free the people from the grip of this evil dictatorship!\n\n\nJust Cause 3 adds new mechanics and physics to the Just Cause series such as the ability to tear specific pieces off vehicles and the ability to destroy scenery in your own way. You can now tether your grapple to anything and reel it in to rip down just about anything piece by piece without firing a shot. Want to demolish half a bridge but leave the rest of it standing? Want to rip off a car door with your grappling hook? You can do that. In addition to this new content, Just Cause 3 takes all the good points of Just Cause 2 and improves upon them while taking away all the bad things that drove us all mad (such as quicktime events) to create a wonderful game experience.\n\nWith access to unlimited explosives, new gadgets, a huge arsenal of weaponary and vehicles on an absolutely massive map, Just Cause 3 takes the openworld genre to the next level. While the story itself isn't particuarly long nor very good, the dialogue, humour and the insanity of the missions you take on just make you want to keep playing them.\n\nThe graphics and sound design is stunning - the game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful. The characters and dialogue are humorous and entertaining and the driving/flying mechanics have had a huge overhaul from Just Cause 2. No longer will you have extreme difficulty trying to get anywhere in a car. Whether you choose to take a vehicle or simply your wingsuit, grapple or parachute, the game feels wonderful to get around. The controls are responsive and fluid and make sense unlike Just Cause 2's awkward controls.\n\nExplosions, a huge part of the Just Cause series, feel extremely satisfying and a massive improvement over the last two games. The combat is complete insanity with a seemingly endless supply of bad guys coming at you at a given time, I even ran out of ammo a few times because there were simply too many bad guys coming at me. Luckily when the situation turns bad you can always make a quick getaway with your grappling hook.\n\nAs of writing this, I am ten hours in and so far I've only liberated one section of the map and am having a blast doing so. There are three main islands in total (excluding the secret island I haven't got to yet), one of which is at-least four times as large as the island I've currently liberated, meaning there's at-least 50 hours of content to this game. And you'll want to keep playing it once you're finished.\n\nThe game isn't free from bugs though, sometimes you'll find government forces still stationed outside of a liberated military base, you'll sometimes grapple to thin air (this seems to mainly occur under bridges) or your heat level will become locked and the only way to fix it is to restart the game.\n\nSo what are the downsides? The game is always online DRM, I freaking HATE always online DRM, if you don't have a stable internet connection (or say you're downloading something in the background and the game connection keeps dropping) the game will constantly try to connect to the Square Enix servers EVERYTIME you open the commlink or pause the game. This is extremely frustrating when you have selected offline mode and simply want to view the map.\n\nThe game runs perfectly fine on high settings on my system (1080p, GTX 770 4GB, 8GB RAM, i7 4770K) without dipping on framerate no matter how much insanity is going on, however a lot of users have said it runs poorly for them so this seems to be system specific. Many users have also reported crashing a lot, however this has not been an issue for me as in ten hours of gameplay I've only crashed once (excluding the times the game has frozen when I've quit out of it). New patches are being rolled out every week or so however they seem to be hit and miss with some users reporting that the patch has made the game stability worse while others saying it's been made better.\n\nI can completely overlook these issues due to how much fun this game actually is, however if you're crashing every five minutes, have an AMD card or are only getting twenty frames per second, I totally understand where you're coming from. I wouldn't want to play it if this was happening either.\n\nTo summarize,\n\nPROS\nVisually gorgeous\nGreat sound design\nSilly but entertaining humour\nDriving/flying feels much better than JC2\nNo more quicktime events\nFun to get around\nMassive map\nHours of content\nControls that actually make sense\nInsane missions that keep you entertained through the story\nUnlimited possibilites to create chaos\n\nCONS\nHours of your life lost to this game\nPoorly optimized on some systems\nAlways online DRM\nIt's buggy in places\nStory is short\n\nOverall, this is the funnest game I've played since Just Cause 2, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves openword sandbox action games or for anyone who just wants to screw around and have fun in a massive, beautiful world.","December 28, 2015","true","22.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Hilariously fun to explore, spectacular combat with explosions, beautiful landscapes and lots more what I have not yet seen. I haven't encountered any bugs or even minor glitches yet, which has been bit surprising.\n\nThe handling of vehicles, which many other reviews have been complaining: comparing to Just Cause 2, it has been made partly better. Handling air vehicles is way more entertaining, whilst land vehicles haven't given same great feeling as on JC2. Time shows, will this change slightly, or not.\n\nAbout performance, it's really easy to understand that many gamers have been suffering from bad performance, but even with my partly really old setup (see my profile) I'm able to have pretty stable 45-60fps on maximum settings, except using FXAA and models on normal (Low/Normal/High/Very High -scale). It consumes my 2GB VRAM almost fully then, and it stays there even on heavy gunfights with explosions.\n\nJust as a example of optimization, I firstly tested with lowest possible settings and had 30-40fps, while dipping into 20'ish on gunfights.

I must say I wound up lowering my expectations towards the released date of the game as I had stumbled upon mixed impressions and some harsh criticism from some reviewers.\n\nNeedless to say, the game was brilliant and was an improvement over an already decent Just Cause 2, however there were a few niggles, some of which annoyed the living daylights out of me.\n\nThe game brings an impressive load-out of playable missions, objectives, side challenges. It's a vast open-world, with a hefty sequence of campaign missions that will span over the four peninsulas. The physics are brilliantly done. Tethering a chopper and an enemy soldier is somewhat amusing, or putting thrust grenades and watching him disappear into thin air.\n\nAll I can say is that being Rico for a bit is a load of fun, the wingsuit, grappling hook and parachute combinations are arguably one of the strong points of this game and provides something unique.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nExplosions on tap\nA grappling hook, need I say more?\nDestructible terrain, the usefulness of the grappling hook becomes evident when you need to pull a chaos object to the ground\nLeader boards - There is no multiplayer, Avalanche has included an in-campaign challenge leader board, certain objectives are compared with those on your friends list and globally. You can also choose to invite others to compete in challenges. It's not something I've seen before, but it works.\nVisually an impressive game. But not quite GTA V level, but close.\nRico is a badass. The wingsuit, grappling hook and parachute can be loads of fun, and an easy way to traverse the terrain\nLarge open world divided into peninsulas. Provides an array of different terrains from seaside villages to mountainous military zones.\nWide variety of military hardware at your disposable. Most of which is obtained as you progress through the campaign, in turn reducing the monotony of the missions.\nMediterranean / Italian themed - It brings something a little different to the table.\nVintage weapons, achievements and collectibles strewn throughout the map. Good luck picking it all up though. There is a lot.\nMods are available\nThe Bad:\n\nI'm so sick of liberating\nVehicle handling - Cars in particular have handling that can appear sluggish at first, then suddenly whoops you're on your roof. A controller would probably fix this, but for those stuck with keyboards, car handling is not a strong point. GTA V nailed this.\nIntroduction skits that are unescapable. The number of times I've been pulling out bits of my hair waiting for the cut-scenes to end definitely can be counted on more than one hand.\nEnemy spawns - Countless of times I've wiped the enemy towers and command posts in front of me, only to discover additional enemies have respawned in them. It's game tech from the noughties.\nStupidity - My goodness, the AI bots are incredible thick, I'm partly thankful for this as the reason I actually managed to finish the game. They get stuck behind walls occasionally. They are often dumbfounded by carcases of vehicles/choppers and seem to get stuck. Pedestrians have very little road-sense, often not stopping or aimlessly walking around infront of your vehicle, this makes car based challenges borderline annoying.\nLocating enemy bases and outposts can become a tedious task later in the game as you head to larger sections of the map, guessing where they may be becomes frustrating especially when it takes you 5 minutes to fly a jet (at 350kmh, very fast) to the other side of the peninsula.","December 13, 2015","true","61.9"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","30","56","0","1"

If in 2 you enjoyed rooting around locations for the hidden boxs, that is all gone in this game, which have been replaced by unlocking mini missions when you liberate a town, these mini missions aren't fun either. the expoltions in the game are amazing and are awesome to watch every time they happen. The problem in that after a short amount of time there isnt anything new to blow up, each town has simular layout with the same looking buildings to take. Also a side note, dont know if this is just me, maybe some one could shed some light but the camera movement during flight is super amazingly slow, making fighting from a helicopter more frustrating than anything else. im going to put some more time in to it and try to like it but at this rate im going to go back to just cause 2.","December 2, 2015","false","4.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

The main island has almost nothing on it, the vehicles handled terribly and the menus still have controller icons on them in places.\n\nDev's have said they'd address what the community has said - well I'll believe it when I see it.\n\n----\n\nDay of Release Review:\n\nI'll continually update this in the coming days but for now, day 1, the game is pretty below par. Why are we not allowed good day 1 releases? Where was the QA/testing? You don't sell me a car on release and then tell me the stero doesn't work until you patch it in a few days, or a toaster that will burn my toast for the next week because you couldn't work something out in the thermostat controls. Common Square Enix, I paid you $70 NZD for a game and I can't even get a stable day 1 play!\n\nCons:\n- Driving, while better than JC2 still feels like you're driving a concrete block with wheels. The cars do not feel any better, sure they feel different than JC2 but not by much. This is my biggest dissapointment to be honest.\n- Motorbikes, they have like a .5 second delay between when you hit the key to turn and the bike starts turning - its horrible and means you overcompensant everything and spin out... just wrong.\n- Helicopters, from what I can tell feel okay but theres something wrong with how they move too ... maybe that concrete block just grew rotors?\n- Jetski, try holding the reverse key and watch yourself spin in circles! For added nausia, hold the reverse and left or right key to make yoursellf projectile vomit in all the directions. This pretty much just makes you spin really fast in circles - bloody weird.\n- Story, again Square Enix manages to do the whole 'throwing you into something with no backstory or character development' just take this gun, shoot those guys grapple here and drive here and meet her - sweet, heres the black market oh I mean supply drop grenade. Have fun. While Rico might know these people I certainly didn't see a familiar face from JC2 (except Sheldon). SE I thought you would learn from JC2.\n- Derp eyes on Rico during one of the first few cutscences when you're having supper and talking on the fence. Just saying.\n- FPS, oh how it hurts. VSync off and spin around - watch your frames go through the floor. Blow that building up? Heres you 0fps for 5 seconds reward! Yeah, the FPS is stable when you look forward... without any sudden movements (so forget keeping it stable during combat or driving and shooting!)\n\nPros:\n- When the frames are stable, the game looks good; even on medium everything it looks really nice.\n- Crash models are vastly improved over JC2.\n- Wingsuit is fun (when you get the feel of it)\n- Still has that JC2 feel in a new location (huge map!) and lots of cool explosions and shooting and stuff. If you liked JC2 like I did I think you'll like this - but that damn list above the pros needs fixing ASAP.\n\nAgain, I will update in a few days after some patches come out - but unless it improves on these points this review will be sticking negatory :\","December 1, 2015","false","46.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The wingsuit is an absolute treat to fly around in and the new grapple mechanics give you an incredible toolkit for destruction. However, several of the notches are undoubtly placed backwards. Vehicle handling is questionable at times; you can hit a pebble and spin wildly out of control (this is even with a controller). Motorcycles are terrible compare to their counterparts in the previous game and are not worth using at all.\nMedici is a vast and gorgeous place but portions of it are completely devoid of content. For example, the entire upper half of the largest island is nothing more than scattered villages and outposts.There's no awe inspiring capital city to speak of and a complete lack of more interesting and unique locales like the previous title. The game tries to pass it off as part of the backstory but it honestly feels more like a rush job.\nUnfortunately the game is also riddled with constant crashes and memory leaks. Hopefully these get resolved in due time.\n\nRecommended but with some reservation. There are some performance problems and some questionable design changes but they don't dampen the core gameplay that is Just Cause. Blowing stuff up and creating chaos in a sandbox is still some good, chaotic fun.","December 11, 2015","true","59.2"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

Then go play Just Cause 2.  Just Cause 3 is a bait and switch.  Pure and simple.

The controls are very weird for a third person shooter, the physics in the game seemed bad and i also did not like the characters. However when i played some more i noticed that the problem i had with this game is that i took it seriously, that was my mistake. Just play the game to have fun, create chaos using the unrealistic physics and fly/jump around the map. That is where the game shines.\n\nAlso the graphics and the sounds are great if your pc runs it well. This is probably the biggest problem of this game, alot of people seem to have trouble running this game on their pc. This is not the case for me, i run it perfectly on max settings 1080p at minimum framerate of 90 and average around 110 fps. (on a 980ti, i7-4770)\n\nAll in all based on the experience i currently have with this game i would rate it an 8/10 (this is if your pc runs it well).","December 1, 2015","true","34.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Latest nvidia driver as usual (no update after the game yet, way to soon, people are sleeping now everywhere hehe)\n\nIt is awesome, super fan of jc2,and this is what i expected and much more than that. Looks gorgeous, sound amazing, runs well, good story so far, laughed a lot, characters are very funny, dialogue is funny, it actually reminds me of far cry 4,specially Hurk hahah. So far so good.\n\nLoving every aspect of the game, yeah maybe the cars handling would be a bit faster, but that kinda made jc2 handle fast cars kinda hard.\n\nGreat shooting, great parachuting and sliding, the grapple opens up sooo much creativity it's crazy.\n\nLove the supply drop menu and everything that has to do with that.\n\nAi is better in a way that is a bit less self aware than jc2 i guess, maybe o haven't played enough, cause i didn't yet :).\n\nI will post my experience here as a play more of the game.\n\nMind that im a big fan, i only play this game, that's it for me. So i might be a bit biased, or maybe i dont care about random bugs or stuff that doesn't affect my gaming experience. Game crashed just once in 3 hours of play.

Unfortunately, the poor optimization and stuttering during firefights, or explosions completely ruins the experience. three or four enemies shooting will make the game stutter every few seconds, for a second or more. This is after I spent literally hours changing settings (underclocking card, admin mode, compatability mode, and every other fix i could find online) so the game wouldnt crash during the opening scene (which i attempted to play through no less than 2 dozen times). My rig isnt the best (I5 3570K with 8 Gigs Ram and a GeForce GTX 760 with updated drivers) but i easily surpass the "minimum" Recommendations for the game.

Basically everything in this game is repeated from Just Cause 2. Just Cause 2 was fun because of the innovation it added to the gaming community, Just Cause 3 on the other hand is just a copy with better graphics, and a different story line; basically JC2 with some graphics-improving mods installed. Maybe worth $20 IF you don't already have JC2. If you have JC2 and are expecting something that's $50 better than it, then I'll assure you that you're wrong.

Going to  the high preset doesn't drop frames tremedously but, the vsync will lock you at 30 fps if you go below 60 fps. Despite this, the game still looks incredibly good even at these settings, despite some unavoidable pop-in which is slightly annoying. The gameplay is an improvement over JC2 in general, especially with the better world and addition of the wingsuit and upgrades. The driving especially motorcycles, (at least on keyboard) is pretty bad in my opinion, even worse than Just Cause 2. But the planes and helicopters are much better than the driving. Fortunately driving is avoidable if you just want to wingsuit and parachute around in classic Just Cause fashion. The gameplay is somewhat repetitive, but there is more variety than in Just Cause 2. The main story is negligible, and is really only a distraction to the main gameplay. Overall I would give this game a 8/10 so far, but I did enjoy Just Cause 2 tremendously, so there might be some bias.

The story isn't great, which it really isn't supposed to be. The online connections suck and you can't turn them off as I can tell. The Air land and sea pass doesn't even give you all the weapons, or the special wingsuit and parachute. Hell you can't even change his outfit! Customization is minimal to none, and the weapons are either weak, or too powerful. The controls, made by Helen Keller, are barely usable, hell you cant even zoom in for sights until you unlock it! Not like it would help anyway the camera doesn't even ♥♥♥♥ing work, especially with the wingsuit and parachute. The skyfortress DLC is too damn short too and has no ♥♥♥♥ing content. except the wingsuit, the fortress, and the drones. The story has a few short missions. That's it! That's all! Not like the wingsuit is even fun to use. The camera ruins it and you can't use the weapons on easily because the camera is drunk and the weapons go off of the angle Rico is at. The is stupid considering that the camera is usually pointed at his side. Good Job on that one! Again with the wingsuit if you fall, you can't get back up until he is done ♥♥♥♥ing hurling, because he looked at the damn camera! The bavarium wingsuit's evade is ♥♥♥♥ too, you have to press whatever the hell you have it set to, with w,a,s, or d, at THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING TIME! and you barely have a warning sometimes and it takes a while for it to actually work. Same with the take off from the ground. Hold E for 30 minutes and you might take off! The gear collecting isn't as good as collecting the boxes full of parts in the second one. Then you basically have to do them for some things you should already have!

The game is based around the grappling hook, wing suit and parachute, and these mechanics alone allowed me to sink hours into it. Just flying around is very satisfying and relaxing. The gameplay apart from that is crazy, you blow stuff up in different locations, which pretty much describes the entire game and its plot. The game doesn't take itself serious (only briefly in the end for some reason), and that's what I like about it. It's just one big pile of explosions and flying around.\n\nThere's also cool challenges that you can complete around the world. What I liked about these are that they integrate with the massive open world nicely and smoothly. Speaking of the world, it's beautiful and colorful.\n\nThe game is not too challenging to complete, although it gets harder when you progress in the story (or by liberating more settlements?). Only when I tried to liberate the central commands had I any chance of dying.\n\nIn my eyes the game is perfectly enjoyable, except for a few issues: The game tries to promote the use of vehicles a lot, but there's no reason to use them as flying around is faster and more flexible. I only ever stole jets for blowing up bases more easily. The other more serious flaw with the game is the framerate. I have a decent setup (120 fps in GTA V), but for whatever reason the fps never really reached 60. At times the fps looked like it was capped at 30 too, and dropped frequently during that period. The game could do with some optimization in that aspect.","January 18","true","27.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

JC2 is polished, well designed, the controls are sensibly mapped out, and it runs like hot butter.

Basically everything in this game is repeated from Just Cause 2. Just Cause 2 was fun because of the innovation it added to the gaming community, Just Cause 3 on the other hand is just a copy with better graphics, and a different story line; basically JC2 with some graphics-improving mods installed. Maybe worth $20 IF you don't already have JC2. If you have JC2 and are expecting something that's $50 better than it, then I'll assure you that you're wrong. Again, good game, not good on the innovation side of things.","January 2","false","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, this short review will be from MY experience alone. How i have experienced it on my set up, and everything else for ME.\nLet's begin.\nStory (9/10) - I haven't completed the story yet and no its not an oscar winning story, but when you buy just cause games you don't buy it for a rich story line with emotional backstories and stuff. If you want that, go buy Mass Effect. So far however, i am enjoying the missions and the story line is a huge improvement over just cause 2's. Also, im rating it highly simply because all of the missions are explosions. Which i love <3 Dont hate me ;_;\n\nGameplay (10/10) - This is the best game i have EVER played. No question. Everything from just cause 2 has been improved dramatically. The wingsuit mechanic is the most amazing idea ever created and whoever came up with the idea to use a wingsuit and a grappling hook, deserves a medal. It is extremely addictive and i could spend hours on end just wingsuiting around in the beautiful environments. There are Red Dead Redemption style side quests every so often, like hijacking a limo to kill the informant in it, or to deliver supplies to rebels. All of them are fun as hell and whenever i get one, i always attempt to do it.\n\nPerformance (8/10) - My PC set up will be at the end. So far i have encountered very little in the way of performance issues. For me, 99% it runs as smooth as butter, however you can sometimes experience small fps drops of about 2-5fps when huge explosions occur. Overall, i am extremely pleased with the performance of the game and definitely recommend it if you have a good enough PC, that is not AMD (well, it could work on an AMD card, but from what i've heard, less so than Nvidia cards.)\n\nOverall (9.9/10) - No there is no logic to that rating, but it is my opinion, and it not being 100% perfect, but also being my favorite game of all time, i felt like it deserved a 9.9.

It's a con, people, look it up!\n- Destroyed bridges de-spawn within 5 seconds of falling. Seriously, why is this?\n- Motorbike handling. Don't even try.\n- Capturing bases does get a little repetitive after time. So does completing challanges.\n- There's very little nighttime outside of missions. (Not sure what's up with that)\n- The AI isn't very smart at some places.\n\nPros:\n- Grappling hook, and infinite parachutes.\n- New wingsuit that is super-fun, and you get it within 2-3 missions in.\n- Driving. I don't know what all the fuzz is about, I think it's improved a lot over JC2. (That's not to say it's perfect)\n- No more Sheldon.   Uhh... at least not as the black market dealer. The replacement of that is the Rebel Drop system. You can drop in basically any vehicle.\n- Stunt jumping is vastly improved over JC2, now you can walk around on top of the vehicles. Heck, you can even walk inside a huge-♥♥♥♥ cargo plane and store cars in it. (In freeroam!)\n- Up to six tethers at once. They can also be retracted at once. This is just the best thing.\n- I'd be stupid if I wouldn't list explosions! There's a lot of those. They look/sound spectacular.\n- Monorail trains that carry tanks/planes. Aand they can be derailed. You can even detach individual cars and watch other trains crash into them! Heck, you can even tether the cars to the ground ahead of them, retract, and they'll move. Choo choo! (NOTE: They can't be controlled/have no horn.)\n- You can capture all the bases/towns from the beginning. (Not sure about this, might be a few exceptions)\n- Speaking of which, you can make Di Ravello retake them so you can recapture again!\n- Lots of vehicles this time. Air/land/sea.\n- Huge map that is populated and open from the beginning.\n- Easter eggs.\n- Nuke launcher.\n- Homing grenades.\n- Very good sound design, and great music. (Didn't expect to have this as a pro)\n- The game itself looks decent even on lowest settings. Bravo, Avalanche.\n- Mods. I must list this here because with mods you can have all the good stuff from the beginning. Seriously, who wants to complete tedious challanges for just 4 more tethers when you can have them instantly?!\n\nOverall, I recommend the game. I'm having fun with it despite all the cons. And even with the fact that I can't progress the story.\n\nI'm waiting for Avalanche to fix the crashing issue in the mission so I can move on. I'll update if they do, or if they don't.\n\nTL;DR: Great game, Awesome mechanics, graphics is pretty good. It's stuttery even on lowest and the forced online services are crap. Recommend buying when it's on sale.\n\nCurrently a 7/10.","December 29, 2015","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game itself is quite poor, completely soulless with tons to do but none of it enjoyable. It seems like they couldn't decide who Rico is, the one thing the character gets across consistently is being annoying. Voice acting is questionable across the board, including the lead, which I think is part of why I find the character so unlikable, though make no mistake the writing is dreadful too. Just Cause 3 is too self-aware, it lacks all of the effortless fun of Just Cause 2. Even causing total chaos just isn't fun like it should be. It all feels contrived and pointless with few interesting moments.\n\nEnvironments are bland, graphics are disappointing with dreadful antialiasing options that keep it from looking as good as it should. I didn't have optimization issues like some people, at least, but my rig is also pretty new. Bugs and glitches abound even six months after release. Shooting is unsatisfying, the weapons don't have any punch to them. This is the point where I'd usually insert some token positive point but I can't think of one. There's nothing that Just Cause 3 does well other than maybe not being entirely broken. No single part of it is good. I put sixty hours into Just Cause 2, this has none of its charm.","June 5","false","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agentelrond/recommended/225540/","agentelrond","Blizzard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agentelrond/","679 products in account","I liked Just Cause 2 and wanted to support Just Cause 3 -- a singleplayer game (a dying breed?) with no DRM, no forced social network interaction, and a good PC port.\n\nUnfortunately, it instead turned into my first ever Steam refund request.  The game has 3rd-party DRM, and even worse, it's hidden in the EULA linked from the Steam page instead of advertised on the Steam page itself.\n\nThe game also apparently has some forced social / leaderboard messages that cannot be disabled.\n\nLastly, it is not even a good PC port as far as I can tell.  Performance seems to be poor across a variety of machines, and there is not yet a performance patch that I am aware of.  It runs poorly for me even at the starting area(s) of the game after adjusting settings down.\n\nOne last note -- the game starts with a long, unskippable menu screen.  No loading even appears to happen during this (no hard drive activity), AND since this is a PC game, restarting the game multiple times is to be expected while adjusting settings.  Having a huge unskippable menu screen is very painful in this regard.\n\nJust Cause 2 was a very pleasant experience in the above areas, and Just Cause 3 is one of my saddest disappointments I have ever purchased.  Hopefully the refund goes through.  *edit*  The refund went smoothly through in 1 day, kudos to Valve.","December 15, 2015","false","0.1"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","29","55","6","3"

It has some significant quality-of-life improvements over Just Cause 2, reducing or eliminating the frustrations and slowdowns that interrupted the game flow of it's predacessor.  If you take the easiest approach to every scenario you will be disappointed with this game.  If you are willing to experiment and get creative, it can be a lot of fun.  There's no real consequences for failure, so there's no need to play it safe.  Some of the structured side-misisons can be a bit of a drag.  The destruction missions involve blowing up an empty enemy base that you've already destroyed once with a single weapon, and range between repetitive and frustrating.

However the game does have some bad points, the challenge system i feel is unneeded and repetitive, the weapon parts from the previous game were fine\n\nTL:DR... 7/10\n\nTechy Stuff...

However I am right now getting very strange frame drops(my guess is it has to do with the lod or explosions taxing my graphics card to much... I have a 770 for those asking and for most of the game I get around 80 frames a second, but then sometimes at random, sometimes when I make half a base go boom in 1 sec I get a frame drop to about 7 frames or less for about 10 sec. Needless to say this is making the game unplayable right now.\n\nPlease note I have tried turning all the settings to off and low to try and fix it, but all that does is increase my frames... I still get the random drops in FPS[to about 10 fps and bellow instead].(which I think is linked to lod and particle effects) When this is fixed its a 10/10 until then its more like a 3/10.","December 1, 2015","false","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main gameplay is centered traveling from base to base with your grappling hook, parachute, and new to the series; a wingsuit. The traveling is superb, and nuanced. It's not just fun, it's something you learn to get better at as you play. After you liberate a base you unlock challenges that unlock new toys to play with, which creates a cycle of gameplay. Fly to a base, liberate it using your arsenal of weapons and gadgets, unlock challenges, complete challenges to unlock new weapons, gadgets, and upgrades.\n\nIt would be a perfect cycle if it weren't for the challenges. The infernally designed, boring, at times controller-breakingly-frustrating challenges. Some of them are just fine. Not fun, but not frustrating. Others, such as wingsuit challenges, can be so incredibly strict that IF you happen to get all 5 gears (the equivalent to a score rating, and more importantly the way you unlock upgrades), it winds up feeling more like luck than skill.

Neither instance was fufilling, neither instance felt like I got the score I did due to my personal skill. There is so little room for error, and certain challenges feel outright broken. One wingsuit challenge has you choosing what paths to fly through, each going a seperate way, which I thought was a brilliant way to solve the issue of how strict these challenges felt, until I went through one pathway perfectly, and still didn't get a high enough score to unlock all 5 gears. Was I supposed to choose a different path? Is there a specific combination of paths that is correct? Even if that is the case, that sort of trial and error gameplay is hardly compelling.\n\nThis all may seem nitpicking, I mean these little distractions are hardly why anyone plays sandbox games, but this is HOW you unlock upgrades for rico's gear and vehicles.

When launching the game my aspect ratio was set to 16:10 and I ran a insane high resolution an after setting it back to 1080p almost all my desktop icons were placed difrent.\n2. When I started the game it seemed fine and then I went into a cave and only half of the textures loaded, but this was easily resolved by downloading the latest AMD beta drivers.\n\nBut after that the game was a blessing. I have a I7 4770K, 16GB RAM and a R9 290 VAPOR-X and the game runs butter smooth. I get no hickups and I also didn't really notice any framedrops while I'm running the game on max settings. I didn't even have any long loadingtimes while I'm just jusing a 7200 rpm HDD.\n\nThe movement controls are great and shooting is pretty good to, but driving and boathing felt a little out of control when stearing. But after all "Who is actually driving and boating a lot?", you have an awesome wingsuite and parachute. And combined with the grapling hook you can cross some great distance in a short amount if time and it looks just F*cking amazing. I mean have you seen this game? It looks great while I am still playing at around 50 FPS on 1080p.\nThe grapling hook seems to have some kind of last aimed spot selecter, so that if you aim over a ridge very fast and you aim in the sky and you start to grappel it will automatically grappel to the last possible grappel location. This is pretty cool, because you don't have to aim for exactly the right spot, which makes the game way more fluently.\n\nConlusion:\nI had a few problems at the beginning, but they were quikly resolved and after that I just had some much fun. Why you may ask? Well, "JUST CAUSE baby!".\n\nI would really recomend this game, mayby wait for a patch but I think that the problems that you will have are easily solved and that it is not worth waiting for a patch.\n\n9/10 Would really recommend!","December 11, 2015","true","16.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kidamo/recommended/225540/","kidamo","Kidamo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kidamo/","411 products in account","This game was a bit like the Star Wars prequels for me. I went to the midnight screenings of all 3 movies, hyped to the hilt with Star Wars fever, ready to love it as much as I loved the original trilogy when I first discovered that as a child back in the early 90s.\n\nComing out of the theatre my initial impression was always a positive one. But on the drive home, away from the jedi cosplayers, away from the thunderous cheering when "A long time ago etc" first came onto the screen and the opening score kicked in, when I finally had time to myself to gather my thoughts, I started seeing flaws. At first a few minor things that annoyed me. Then a few more. Within about half an hour I was already starting to realise that it wasn't a good movie at all, that I'd just been caught up in nostalgia, no matter how much fun I had at the time. It made me a little sad the first time I realised just how badly those movies actually sucked (yes, even the third but if you like it that's cool :D ) though by the time the third one came around I had a healthy dose of skepticism to go with my hype so it wasn't as surprising. It even happened a bit with the new one. Hindsight can sometimes ruin what was a great initial experience.\n\nAnyway so Just Cause 3 is sort of like that.\n\nI LOVED JC2 when I got it. Loved loved loved it. It's one of my top 10 favourite games of all time. So you can imagine my hype coming into this one. I even got a new video card just to play this (and it's run smoothly the whole time thankfully so I can't comment on the performance issue stuff).\n\nIt had fantastic gameplay combined with that B-movie/not taking itself seriously at all storyline that just made it entertaining as hell. I couldn't put it down and I still hop on from time to time to liberate a few more bases or towns.\n\nReally all JC3 needed to do to succeed in my eye was more of the same basically. And in some ways that's exactly what I got but in others it dropped the ball pretty badly. I guess I should just list the pros and cons for ease.\n\n\nPROS\nIt's more Just Cause. All the liberation and explosions you've come to expect.\nSpeaking of explosions, they look sensational. Michael Bay eat your heart out.\nThe wingsuit is a fantastic addition\nThe new grappling system is great. Being able to tether multiple stuff is really neat.\nThe storyline has some of that B-grade humourous feel of JC2. Some at least.\nBringing up the map to find those last few things to blow up in a base/town! That could be so annoying in JC2. Liked that this feature existed although most objects were fairly easy to find so I didn't need it too often but it was handy on those massive bases when I only needed 1 or 2 more things.\nCONS\nThis one might be a bit spoilery so I'll hide it.  Medici itself. It just lacks the density of Panau. This is maybe a good and bad thing. Panau can sometimes be a bit ridiculous with just how many places there are to liberate etc. but it's really noticeable how sparse Medici can feel at times. Especially the final (and biggest) island. I know the storyline explains why it is this way (if you collect the Di Ravello tapes anyway) but it still sucks. I couldn't believe how little there was to do when I finally reached that island. Was a big let down.\nThe story. It's sort of tried to recapture what JC2 had but it just sort of fails this time. None of the characters are particularly likeable, not even in a so-bad-it's-good way like Bolo Santosi and Baby Panay were. The cutscenes were all kind of bad really. I didn't mind Mario I guess.\nMaybe spoilery again.  Trying to out-do the last game. It just didn't work. "Oh you rode a missile toward the end of the last game? Well you get to ride one right near the START of this one!!!" Ugh. I know partially the problem is the first one was sometimes mind blowing with some of the crazy stuff you ended up doing so it's hard to top that now but it felt like they barely tried. Oh and the very last final showdown is just pathetic. Disappointing.\nLast lot of spoilers I swear!  The final two missions for each act are basically exactly the same. Seriously? Laaaame.\nThe parachute didn't control as nicely this time but this is super minor as the wingsuit sort of makes that gripe a non-issue.\nThe vehicles. They just didn't feel like they controlled as well this time around. Motorbikes were especially bad. I tried using them with mouse + keyboard and controller and neither really felt that great.\nThe challenges. I didn't mind the challenges themselves. It's nice having more things to do and I would sometimes do the ones in JC2 if I happened to be near one. The fact that all of your upgrades are locked behind them is the real problem. I know the collectible system in JC2 was a little clunky as well but yeah, forcing you to do challenges to upgrade everything is stupid.\nThe Di Ravello tapes. I like collecting stuff and did all of that in this game but it sucks that a lot of the back story behind him and why Rico hates him so much etc. you can only find out if you collect these. I guess this sort of tacks on to my storyline gripe. I wasn't after some amazing story but I still feel like they could have done way more with what they had.\nThe online stuff can be a bit annoying sometimes. Always online DRM is never a great solution. The leaderboard stuff is a bit annoying too. I switched it to friends only which is far better but you still get bombarded with a bunch of strangers who beat your whatever score every time you log on.\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast and I still recommend it and am looking forward to the upcoming DLC but every time I take a step back and think about my time playing it, I seem to only see mostly negatives.\n\nSo yeah if you loved JC2 then you should still like this, just don't expect to have your mind blown this time around. If you never played JC2 and you like the sound of basically being a superhero blowing ♥♥♥♥ up then you should like this as well. Just try not to think about it too much :)","February 2","true","66.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

My own fault for pre-ordering, I'll soon learn; otherwise STAY AWAY from this game if you have an AMD card or any 2GB< GPU because this game will be unplayable.\n\nUpdate*\nI can now play it, but still loses a lot of frame rates at times where there's not even much going on, memory leaks I suspect.\n\nOpinion still not changed on the game; although it was still somewhat fun completing it and taking over territory, causing explosions etc. I stopped playing about half way through just because it got really boring and repetative; I only really finished it just to get it done and out of the way, considering I had paid so much for it.\n\nPro's:\n\n•New and more variety of vehicles, finally a bomber jet!\n\n•Wingsuit is new and fun at times, although hard to get use to.\n\n•Good graphics, explosions more enhanced and guns/gunfire seem more realistic and alive too.\n\n•Finally don't have to collect stupid crates and stuff to complete a town, base or outpost etc.\n\nCon's:\n\n•For the love of God I do not care if XxxLoverboy97xxX has just beaten my top score, go away!\n\n•Constant disconnection from said leaderboards hinder gameplay and brake immersion.\n\n•Controls are extremely clunky, and I almost wept at how poorly designed the controls were for cars, helicopter or.. heck just about everything! I thought JC2 handled like a walrus, this game slapped me across the face and said 'hey I've revamped the controls for you and now everything handles as smoothly as dfjcjuxvhxulnvxjs'.\n\n•Physics, and playing around with them, I don't know, everything just seems so.. clunky; it just doesn't work! JC2 handled as smooth as a baby's bottom when it came to the grapple and attaching things for some serious fun, this however is so painfully awkward to handle; I don't care if I've got multiple grapples and some boosters when they don't work! Too much trial and error trying to play about with the physics took away all of the fun in it.\n\n•The landscape. It is obviously a lot less diversified, and you can tell as soon as you step into the game, it feels smaller, and yet just as lifeless as the JC2 landscape was. All just grassy land, plently of islands and a snowy mountain that doesn't hold much. The big island in the top left corner was very dissapointing, at least in JC2 it had something to shoot your aircraft down. The promised 'caves' are far from caves and are more like a small arch or tunnel to go under; dissapointing map.\n\n•Story is lame, bland, stereotypical and forgettable characters *SPOILER ALERT* I had no feelings when that old woman died in the story mode, she annoyed me anyway.\n\n•Ragdoll physics are annoying and tedious as hell! I'm sick of getting knocked down by something or failing wingsuiting, only to then spend the next half hour for Rico to stand back up.\n\n•I attempted to do some of the challenges to unlock more cool stuff, to try and make the game more fun; could not do it, just couldn't. Far too many to do, and some are far too difficult to achieve the 5 cogs, so I can unlock what I need, not to mention they're so so boring. Races were sometimes impossible to do, due to the cheer clunkiness of the controls, besides the wingsuit making even the fastest cars obsolete.\n\n•Multi-player, where is it? If some modders achieved it in JC2 then surely you could, actually scratch that.. it's barely playable in single player, never mind multi; two players would make the game melt, along with your PC.\n\nI don't know what happened here, the Just Cause series was on a winning streak, and then this thing comes along; not to mention the fact that I physically couldn't play it for two whole months because it was so broken. Maybe the higher ups took over the game and churned it out through their own ideas from a sweat shop of developers, and engulfed it into the mess that it is, who knows?\n\nStill somewhat enjoyable, but a shell of what JC2 was; not to mention the fact that this game single-handedly has stopped me from pre-ordering games completely. If you really dig explosions and destruction with a big sandbox landscape, then go right ahead, just don't expect it to be much like Just Cause 2.\n\nGraphics 8/10\nPhysics 6/10\nControls 2/10\nStory 5/10\n\nLeaderboards -1/10\nExplosions 9/10\n\nMake of that as you will","December 3, 2015","false","46.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Just Cause 3 offered me 51 hours (as of the publishing of this review) of pure enjoyment and entertainment. I deeply enjoyed the massive open world that the game has to offer, and its beautiful landscapes -- whether they be tropical Mediterranean beaches, beautiful rock formations and archipelagos, pine forests, or snowcapped mountain ranges.\n\nThere are many people who have enjoyed this game as I have, and there are many who experience technical difficulties and feel as though they should refund their game just because of flaws that the developers are actively working on to fix. For them, I say to wait. This game is WORTH the wait. Unless your computer is actively unable to play this game, because you bought a game that your computer truly cannot run -- well, that's on you.\n\nPros:\n•A massive open world. (over 400 square miles/1,000 square kilometers)\n•Beautiful explosions. (A very large portion of the game is meant to be all about action, and nothing says action like big, fiery explosions)\n•The tether system. (This game has gone into new territory since Just Cause 2, with the addition of creating tethers between destructible objects, thus allowing more creativity for the player in how they conjure up their destruction. I can personally vouch for this, as I made a Di Ravello statue facepalm himself into rubble)\n•The Wingsuit. (The addition of the wingsuit has allowed Rico Rodriguez to become even more aerodynamic and powerful)\n•A large variety of weapons and vehicles. (From simple assault rifles, shotguns, and pistols to homing cluster missiles, handheld EMP cannons)\n•Easter eggs. (This is not normally a big deal to most gamers, and especially me -- but I really enjoy the easter eggs in Just Cause 2, and was really looking forward to what JC3 had to offer -- and I was not disappointed.)\n•Bigger and badder bases to 'liberate'. (In Just Cause 2, you never really 'liberated' places. You explored the nation of Panau and collected items in specific settlements, and then it was completed. In Just Cause 3, however, you 'liberate' towns and bases and when they are completed, the rebels are actively within it and you KNOW it is now under your influence.)\n•Interobject stability. (This is also something not many gamers may care about or take into consideration, but Just Cause 3 does an amazing job at keeping objects within objects stable. The landing boats are sturdy as they carry an armoured car within. They then hit the beach and let down their ramp to allow their contents to move forward. Another example is how the cargo plane can hold stuff within and still fly smoothly. Most games simply do not take this into consideration, and thus do not have it as a feature. I applaud you for this, Avalanache Studios.)\n\nThere are other pros, but these are the the most important and interesting to point out. The graphics for the game are amazing, but you can already tell that unless you're blindly cynical, or just simply blind.\n\nCons:\n•The technical difficulties. (This is by far the biggest con of the game, and it is not JUST the fault of the developers. There are many variables in dealing with the technical difficulties of JC3's launch. As I am an AMD user, I did indeed experience technical difficulties, resulting in laggy gameplay -- and later, graphic errors. However, once I had updated to the recommended beta driver, my game played smoothly (which proves my gaming computer is in fit shape for the game, it is just that it was poorly optimized at launch, but the driver basically helped it cooperate.)\n•The ending of the story. (There are no spoilers here, so do not worry, anxious reader. The story, in my opinion, was very nice. I enjoyed the new characters Mario, Dimah, Teo, and Annika. I also enjoyed the revenant Tom Sheldon (and in fact, he is my favourite). Di Ravello was an amazing villain; he is actually intimidating, unlike that weirdo Baby Panay. However, the ending of the game was extremely quick and did not wrap up various plot points left unanswered. HOWEVER, this game is moreso about the adventure, itself -- and thus the story's quick ending can be somewhat excused.)\n\nThis game is by no stretch of the imagination perfect. Nothing is perfect. However, I simply cannot think of any other cons that I would consider negative. With this, I conclude my review -- and hope that this helps anyone who is weary of buying the game in making a decision.","December 10, 2015","true","73.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

Just cause 2 was great and was not broken, Just cause 3 is a disapointment.\nThe game story is hard to follow, in fact i very quickly lost the thread and gave up. The map is confusing to use and has become over complicated. If it had been a new story based on Just cause 2 with some minor improvement tweeks then this I am sure would have been the another great game. As it is i have spent about 5 hours on it and most of that has been randomly jumping off cliffs in order to use the wing suit (which is a great addition).\nPlease remember in future just because something is new it doesn't mean its better and story and game play are more important than amazing graphics and detailed cut scenes, (which it seems many cant even view anyway).\nI am saying i would not reccoment this game but if you are only interested in runing around and blowing things up for the hell of it and dont care about anything else then you may well enjoy it.","May 22","false","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you hated Just Cause 2, then you will hate this aswell. The two games are completely similar in most ways, and that can both be good and bad. I really liked the previous game, but with this game i feel they didn't add enough new stuff, and some things annoys me a lot as you can read below, included with an 1 hour long spoiler free video i uploaded. I still recommend the game, but not at full price. If you can get it for 50 % off, then go for it!\nI won't be buying the next game in the series unless the developers really step up. There's already a huge pile of open world games to choose from, so it's not like it's special in any way.\n\nGood Things\n- Nice graphics as expected. You won't be blown away, but the game looks good\n- The story is better than in the last game, with a lot of humor\n- The new wingsuit is awesome and fun to use\n- Good looking explosion effects and more destructable things in the world\n\nBad Things\n- Not enough new features (Too much the same and too repetitive)\n- Lame and boring challenges that you HAVE to complete to unlock all the fun stuff (Gear mods)\n- The side missions are not worth your time. (Deliver a car, free a hostage and stuff like that)\n- Even though the story is better than in the last game, you don't feel emotionally attached to any of the characters, or care about them\n- Some say that the map is bigger than the one in Just Cause 2, but i'm pretty sure that it's smaller. There's also less bases and towns than in the last game.

I loved Just Cause 2 and had always gone back to playing it to goof around in and I'll definitely do it in this. I played Just Cause 2 right before playing Just Cause 3 to get a good comparison and the gameplay still feels simular but with so much more. I don't every preorder games anymore, but took the risk on this game and it was definitely worth it. But between Just Cause 2 and Just Cause 3, Rico and Tom Sheldon are the only reoccuring characters. The story and dialogue is better than Just Cause 2, but it isn't greatly story driven. Also when it comes to boss's and commanders, Just Cause 2's are tougher, though Just Cause 3 has tougher enemies. Another thing I noticed is that when it came to weapon choice, I prefered Using twin pistols in Just Cause 2 so that I could get a bunch of headshots in, but in Just Cause 3 I almost purely used a burst assault rifle.\n\nThere's a lot you can do in Just Cause 3, especially being able to have multiple grapples, being able to pull them together, having explosives that can upgrade to have jet propulsion, and much more. I abused the grapple so much for destroying things along with goofing around. It's a lot of fun grappling random vehicles and pulling them together and seeing what can happen along with occasional glitches that absolutely launch them. The wingsuit is a bit difficult to get used to, but is really awesome once you do (Watch out for trees though). When it comes to graphics, the game is absolutely gorgeous. The models and textures are absolutely amazing, and I personally think it looks as good, if not better than GTA 5 at max settings. I heard some people complain about the explosions not looking too great, but going from Just Cause 2 to Just Cause 3, it was a huge WHOA in difference. The only disappointing explosion I had the entire game was a story mission of dropping a "huge" bomb into the water.\n\nSome changes that I would prefer is to be allowed to zoom in and aim right away instead of unlocking it along with being able to do some sort of multiplayer besides having a ghost doing challenges. I also wish that it got a bit more ridiculous like Just Cause 2, such as the story mission where you have to take down the 3 bosses atop the Three Kings Hotel. It would also be nice for shotguns to get more ammo. I used to use the shotgun a lot in Just Cause 2, and I'd run out pretty quickly. The dual wielding shotguns are awesome, but you run out really quickly and there's no other ammo lying around anywhere.\n\nOverall, Just Cause 3 is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. Just Cause 2 was one of my all time favorites, but this sequel greatly improves upon everything it needed.","December 27, 2015","true","61.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Did this less on later in my playthrough so perhaps that was fixed\n- Bugs that the game did have were severe, relating to the load times, sound playable, alt tabbing. Keeping the menu open too long caused audio to start to glitch out and freeze, which could only be fixed by disabling fullscreen mode, alt tabbing out, alt tabbing back in and reactivating fullscreen\n- Shorter than JC2\n- Lacklustre finale compared to JC2\n- Finding/freeing all settlements appears to have no reward, making the action of doing so beyond the story unsatisfying.\n\nRecommendation: Still good, worth playing.

You want to jump from heli to heli mid air while getting shot at? JC3 is made for it. Your gf broke up with you and the only way to release your rage is by blowing up a bridge? Though that may be a bit disturbing, do it Just Cause. This game is a work of art. This game is a substitute for a physics class. Buy it if you have patience.\n\nFor those who have graphical issuses:\n\nIf you have a Nvidia card:\n\n1. Update your driver\n\n2. Use Geforce's recomended settings\n\n3. Turn off V-sync.\n\n4. Turn off screen space reflections. This renders the visible game world multiple time on reflective surfaces.\n\n5. Enjoy!","December 24, 2015","true","24.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

When it works the game is one of the best of the year with amazing visuals, awe-inspiring physics and fun gameplay but the issue is it rarely works. There are major performance issues. Stuttering and frame-drops are extreamly common even on lowest settings (and I have a decently powerful gaming PC). AMD seems to have been hit a lot worse than Nvidia and even with the beta drivers the game is still unplayable or extreamly laggy. As soon as these issues are fixed I can whole-heartedly recomend the game but in its current state it really isn't worth the hassle.","December 2, 2015","false","41.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Weather it be challenges, liberating or finding secrets. The game is pretty fun but does tend to get old (For some reason it hasn't quite yet for me)   Story wise its not terrible but not great and isn't too long IF you rush through it. They have added a new system called "rebal drop" and you can drop in supplies  just like in JC2 but without the annoying cutscenes and you don't need money. The graphics are pretty good but nothing super next-gen. Now the bad things are, its quite buggy for some people (mainly AMD users) and has optimisation issues such as stuttering, memory leak and low FPS. The DLC "Sky Fortress" adds a really nice boosting wingsuit and adds weapons onto it so you're pretty much a fighter jet. The story on that is only 1.5 - 2 hours long and you can't re-opress the airship like you can other settlements after beating the game. The combat really makes you feel like an action movie hero. Mowing down attackers one by one with bullets (or using an RPG like a true action hero) and other things like helis and tanks. The A.I is dumb sometimes but they did that so you can feel like a badass. Don't get too ahead of yourself though because they can overwhelm you . My score? 7.5/10  May seem a little high for lots of people but honestly I love this game.","March 4","true","207.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adais/recommended/225540/","adais","Mythirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adais/","212 products in account","Just Cause 3 is the fairly decent successor to JC2; in which most JC2 fans will enjoy. I'll be discussing what makes this game decent, as well as things that aren't so good, which will hopefully help you decide whether or not you wish to invest in this game. As a preface here's my PC specs so you can relate to my performance and such:\n\nCPU: AMD 6350 6-core @ 4.1GHz\nRAM: 8gb Corsair Vengeance @ 1600MHz\nGPU: Sapphire AMD 270x 2GB TOXIC Edition @ 1190MHz Core & 1540MHz Memory\nGame is installed on 1TB WD Black\nOS: Windows 10 Pro\n\nSo, this game takes place on the beautiful Mediterranean island(s) of Medici, which just so happens to be Rico's homeland. A crazy, power-hungry dictator has taken over the island and you must fight to take it back (similar plot to the prequel, I know). When I say the island is beautiful, I really mean it. Even on the Medium/High settings I'm playing the game on, it's absolutely stunning, and usually get around 60FPS.\n\nThe loading times have improved since launch, still a bit slow so if you're considering installing the game on an SSD, do it!\n\nPros:\nPretty decent performance, hear it's not good across all PCs, however.\nAmazing graphics, probably around the same sort of level of JC2.\nUnlimited C4! It's explosive!\nLots of things explode, and the explosions are big, loud and pretty.\nPretty fun weapons unlocked from certain missions, including an RPG that is almost like a mini nuke.\nGenerally a pretty fun game, if explosions and death are your thing.\nLots of collectables (nowhere near as many as JC2, however)\nVery big map\nWingsuit!\nThe grappling hook has been hugely improved from its predecessor.\nNo cash!\n\nCons:\nYou can have missing terrain if its not close to you that looks hugely ugly. This was fixed for me by installing the Beta AMD Drivers.\nThe car handling has been changed from JC2; it's now absolutely awful. The handling is so sensitive and God forbid you hit a rock. This is 500x worse on motorcycles too.\nIf VSync is on, you're stuck at 30FPS. Come on Avalanche, what is up with that?\nAmount of collectables has reduced compared to JC2 (both a blessing and a curse)\nDoesn't feel much of a living world, like there's towns and military bases, but nothing of importance in between.\nChaos is now pretty much a pointless currency.\n\nOverall:\nI rate this an 8.5/10; I loved JC2, and even though it isn't considered a huge step up, JC3 is still a hugely fun game to play, and there are QoL improvements such as the wingsuit that really make it shine as a sandbox game. I feel if the vehicle handling and control was fixed, it would certainly push my rating up. I highly suggest buying the game, however!","December 21, 2015","true","27.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I, personally, think this game is great and was hooked instantly.\n\nSo let me start. There's a story, there's side-quests. But it's all about explosions. Goat jumps in front of your car? Explosion. Barrel of wine in the road? Explosion! Just a regular woodden box? Explosions. I'll add my specs last to the list (it's also visible on my page) but mainly the game runs at 60fps. Mainly. When driving, it's 20fps and in some explosions the fps drops to 10. I don't see it as a problem though and otherwise the game runs smoothly with no loading screens or shuttering.\n\nBut to the game. It has a story. You have to liberate cities. With explosions. Lots of explosions. It's basically Michael Bay: The Movie feat Mooch puns. No seriously, there's lots of puns. I've gotten into the game in a way and have still cities to liberate before my work here is done. But it has a story: it's just easily forgotten behind the explosions, wingsuiting, parachuiting and grappling-hooking. And the missions are pretty easy and basically always the same.\n\nThe controls are much more easy than most other games in terms of flying or driving. Shift, wasd and occasionaly the mouse. Not much of a problem here, when some games have wasd, numpad + mouse.\n\nOnly thing I'd want to complain about is the cutscenes. In a mission there's like 70% cutscenes and 30% actual mission. But yeah, it's the only con I could figure out.\n\nI'll admit, with every setting on "high" you don't expect the framerate to be so high when the game looks absolutely gorgeous. I had problems on my GTX 660 to even run CS:GO (Faulty hardware) so I'm pretty used to shuttering, lagging and otherwise FPS-frops so they don't bother me. But I see how it can bother people. Though, as I said, the game looks absolutely stunning and pleases the eye.\n\nAs someone said, this is like pr0n. You'd expect a story but it doesn't matter.\n\nI also like this game and recommend it. Some small problems but otherwise it's explosively great.\n\nMy specs:\nMotherboard -- ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.

I tell you why: Because Just Cause 3 is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥! A Metacritic-score of 74 is not acceptable for such a disaster.  Every time I try to play it I feel agonizing pain just by thinking of the lost potential.\nI absolutely loved the first two games, especially the second one. It had everything, fluent gameplay, an acceptable story, a ridiculous villain, a big, diverse map, cool missions and lots of explosions. All part three has are the explosions.\nPart one sure wasn't perfect, but even though the map was just as dull and plain as in part three, the gameplay was a heck of a lot better than the everlasting same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t we get served in Just Cause 3.\n\nThe best thing about the first game is, that you don't have to upgrade anything. Everything just works the way it is supposed to work, as soon as you unlock it. Simply by playing the game.\n\nIn Just Cause 2 they introduced the Black Market, since every game has to have upgrades for almost everything nowadays. And guess what, it was still okay, due to the fact that you were able to collect all the money and parts you needed to upgrade Rico to a decent warrior while you were playing the story.\n\nAnd in Just Cause 3 they absolutely ruined their formula by locking even the tiniest upgrades behind dull and repetitive side missions, which are only there to stretch the overall playtime.\nPlaying Just Cause 3 doesn't make you feel the freedom of doing anything you want, like the previous parts did. It makes you feel the misery of doing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again, just to unlock stuff that should just be part of your equipment from the first hour of gameplay on.\n\nAs a video-game-critic I give Just Cause 3 a 2out of 10, because it took my desires and flushed them down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the same way the whole industry seems to be heading.","April 22","false","23.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

A lot.).\n+ Tethers and explosives provide excellent new toys for creative destruction.\n+ Upgrades for gear that can alter the behavior dramatically - really fun to experiment with stuff.\n+ Challenges are mandatory to unlock gearmods, but fair and fun.\n+ Characters are great, even if there's only a few of them.\n\n- ish: The by far largest of the 3 islands is destined to be reached in the last third of the story. I would have liked to spend more time during the story there, but there's always free-mode.\n- The driving-physics feels very clunky. Had the wingsuit not been there, this would have been a major turn-off. But instead I spent the whole time wingsuiting, which is a much more adequate way to get around for Rico anyway ;)\n- Liberating of towns becomes repetitive after a while. Especially in the first half of the game, the cities are pretty similar regarding the tasks you need to complete in order to liberate a town.\n\nConclusion:\nWorthy successor and in my oppinion best part of the series.

This game lets you destroy about 85 to 90 precent of anything you see in the game, including trees (Take that, GTA!) You're set off in 3 main islands and one island I still didn't figure out what it is, and your goal is to annihilate every existance of the dictator Di Ravello and his military, and you have unlimited fun ways to do so.\n\nThe AI is fairly decent, it's not the type of AI you see in games like Metal Gear Solid V, where they go on alert for every small thing, cause of course, this isn't a stealth game. The AI isn't impossible and it's not too easy, and 95 precent of the time it works fantastic (I ran into a couple of really small bugs with the AI like them going in circles and walking straight into walls, but that's not a big deal).\n\nWeapons are just perfect, there's not THAT much of variety, but trust me, you'll have a lot of fun with what you have and there's a weapon for every approach to this game. If you're the spraying type, you have an LMG, dual wielded SMGs with an insane rate of fire and pretty neat rocket launcers and other exsplosive weapons, and if you're the sharpshooter type you have two sniper rifles and a very powerful dual wileded pistol that can take heavy armored foes with 4 shots.\n\nMost vehicles are pretty good, choppers have really good controls in my opinion, plane controls are a little bit annoying when you're new to it but you slowly get used to it, but land vehicles are hard to control and their handling and physics is pretty odd. I found myself driving a car while free roaming or while doing a race challenge and it would bump on something and start rolling, even if the road is completely flat. Also, as you've read, the game has challnges that give you "Gears" to unlock "Gear Mods" that give you new stuff like more grenades and more ammo, but in some challenges it just seems like you can't even get a 4 gear result (max is 5), and in my opinion it should be possible to get a maximum of 5 on every challenge, but even with hours of practice I couldn't even pull a 3 gear result on some of the challnges\n\nBut the biggest issue I had is stability, and I'm not the only one to say so.\n\nBefore you say: "Then maybe your PC can't handle it", I can run GTA V on Very High and get 60 FPS (45 in mountain areas) so I should have been able to handle Just Cause 3 pretty fine, but even on the lowest settings I couldn't even get to 40 FPS. I got the latest drivers, tried to verify game cache and even reinstall the game but I just can't seem to solve this issue. The game is just reaching the point where it's unplayable when you play with 19 FPS and have freezes every 10 to 20 seconds.\n\nSo to sum it up, this is by far one of the best games I have ever played and I loved every second of it, that is, every second I didn't have lags. I really want to give this game a recommended review but the current state of the game and all the stability issues just stop me from doing so. When the stability issues will be fixed on the patch the first thing I'll do is change this review to recommended.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10, 10/10 without the stability issues","December 8, 2015","false","87.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

(JC2 and 3, possibly 1)\nGet on top of a jet and rain down your RPG rounds. (JC3)\nFreaking get a bubble blaster weapon! (JC2)\nOver time the series got more and more upgraded.\nIn JC1, it's... well, JC1. It was fun at it's time.\nIn JC2, you get a few upgrades. Grapple Hook, better Grenade Launchers, and a better parachute.\nIn JC3, you get a wingsuit, an even better parachute, and better grappling hooks. plus better driving mechanics xpxpxp\n\nBut here's the thing, some people have issues running JC3, even though they have top tier hardware. From what I think it's something AMD related, haven't looked into full detail about it. So if you have an NVIDIA card like me, you SHOULD be fine assuming you have the right specs, but if you're an AMD user, you should think twice about buying this.\n\nPROS:\n1. +Better driving mechanics - JC2's driving mechanics felt very, VERY, slow. Almost to the point that parachuting is faster. Now you can parachute/wingsuit/fly/drive your way to anywhere, and still feel fast!\n\n2. +The Wingsuit - The wingsuit is very tricky at first to master, but once mastered... it's well worth it. It's very fast, and with the right upgrades I believe that you can go almost 300 km/h.\n\n3. +Explosions - I personally enjoy the explosions, blow a massive object up and feel satisfied for blowing it up.\n\n4. +Grapple Tethers - This is a new feature that I enjoy. Basiclly it pulls two objects you grapple onto eachother together. It's very fun, and sometimes you can use this to destroy everything without needing a gun.\n\n5. +The Cargo Plane - This probably SHOULD be a joke, but I'm serious. You can go inside the cargo plane, open the cargo door so that you can insert some vehicles, heck even just crash the massive plane into a massive object.\n\n6. +Gunplay - It has been very much improved, almost to the point where I wish that the Multiplayer mod would come out soon!\n\n7. +Easter Eggs - There are plenty of easter eggs to look for, which can be very entertaining sometimes!\n\nThere are probably a few Pros I missed, forgive me I haven't played this in 2 days so my memory is a bit off.\n\n\nThere are a few mehs here and there, lemme just list them.\n\nMEH?:\n1. +-Story has gotten a little bit better - I think this game has the better story out of all 3 of them. Then again, why would you buy this game for the story?\n\n2. +-"Useless" features - Let's be honest, they got rid of some useless features. (crouching, only one grapple, etc.) But I kinda miss sprinting. Hopefully they can make it so it's actually useful again, I miss it D:\n\n3. +-The DLCs - Now with the upcoming DLCs, it sounds like it's going to have missions. Which gets me thinking that if you want more story, you are gonna have to pay more money. I am fine with spending money on this game, the game's treated me well and the developers seem nice enough (Even though they need to work out some issues), so I'm ok spending money with the DLC. Although with recent games coming out almost wanting $100 for the full game, I am a bit suspicious of that.\n\n4. +-AMD Users - Hold up this is not directed at you assuming you have an AMD card, but it's more that you MIGHT have some problems. Not sure what's going on, but from what I hear the game does not work with AMD cards.\n\nSadly the game comes with cons.\n\nCONS:\n1. -Challenges - A good concept made into a VERY bad way. To get the good upgrades for your gadgets, you need to complete challenges. They get tedious VERY easily.\n\n2. -More "liberating" missions. - Minor-ish spoilers coming At the ends of Act 1, 2, and 3, you get this BIG mission, where you have to liberate the islands. You go all around the islands to help the rebels defeat Di Ravello's forces, and all in all I wish there was more than just 3.\n\nAll in all: I give the game a 9.5/10, and I elect this as my GOTY 2015.","January 25","true","130.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I write this after the Nvidia driver was installed that was released when the game was supposed to be. Day one it was an unplayable stuttering mess of tearing and artifacts that was Batman: Arkham Knight look good. Now it actually loads up and I can give my review.\nPros:\n+Massive map: This map is big. VERY big. Makes  GTA V look small.\n+Dense map: This map is littered with collectibles and outposts in between town for you to explore...or destroy.\n+Blow sh!t up: Need I say more? You have UNLIMITED Bavarium C4 and plenty of rockets, grenades and powerful guns at your disposal. One special weapon shoots a homing laser that calls in an AIRSTRIKE. All the cool stuff from Mercenaries 2. Of course, you can just use volatile environmental objects to blow up other objects just as well.\n+Tether and Physics: You have a grapple gun that can chain together and reel in objects for just about anything. Sling an enemy onto a wall, pull a car off a cliff, launch an explosive barrel into a more explosive fuel tank, etc. Physics are a bit loose in this game, but that is needed to pull off some of the terrific chain explosions that make this game what it is. Gravity always seems to be at Moon level just when you need it.\n+Graphics: This game does look pretty at max settings. Textures are usually solid and water is realistic.\n-Explosions: Best looking explosions of any game, ever.\n+Wingsuit: Defy a bit of gravity and pretend to be superman. You can even use your grapple while flying to keep pulling yourself along without ever touching the ground. So much fun and way better than driving or flying a helicopter.\n\nCons:\n-Game still can crash randomly without warning.\n-Some textures can "pulse" or flicker.\n-Game starts stuttering with gamepad input. Unplugging and replugging it fixes the problem...for a few minutes.\n-Game is far more intensive than necessary. Explosions and mayhem will tank the framerate on lesser machines. I occasionally drop below 60 fps with a 6700K and a 980ti. Bad. This is not Witcher 3.\n-Story is goofy and predictable, but a B movie parody may be what they were aiming for.\n-Cheesy voice acting.\n\nOverall, this game is a 8/10 from me. This is an explosive sandbox game that should be in your Library next to GTA V. Just be sure to look at the requirements to run this thing. At the time of this review it remains a glitchy resource hog that requires some serious hardware to max out. Hope you found this helpful. Time to go do "something subtle"....\n","December 2, 2015","true","55.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roquen22/recommended/225540/","Roquen22","Roquen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roquen22/","653 products in account","This game is great! It's a true successor to Just Cause 2 with many improvements. Here are some highlights:\n\n-Graphics are amazing! They are just as good for today as the graphics were in Just Cause 2 for its time. It's not quite the Witcher 3 level of graphics, but very, very good!\n\n-Optimization: I'm getting a solid 60 FPS with absolutely no dips so far at 1200p and with maximum settings. Given, I am running a Titan X paired with a stock i7 4790K, so maybe it's not completely fair to say that. I'll try on my wife's computer with a GTX 770 for comparison soon and will update with the results from that.\n\nUPDATE: I installed on 2 more computers: 1 with a GTX 770 and one with a 750Ti. The 770 one gets 55 average FPS with very few dips at max settings. Adjusting a few settings yields 60 FPS with no drops and the graphics are still amazing. On the 750Ti at medium settings, I average 40 FPS with a few small dips here and there, but nothing major. So my conclusion based on MY findings is that it is optimized well. I can't explain why others are having issues, but I wish them well and hope they get everything fixed soon.\n\n-Mission Layout: This is a big improvement from Just Cause 2. The missions are spread out nicely and the pace is so much better. The raw production values within the missions are also great. They are very Michael Bay-ish, which is a good thing here!\n\n-Chaos & Destructable environments: This is what made Just Cause 2 so great for me, and Just Cause 3 does not disappoint! They kept everything 2 had, and made the physics and destruction itself even better! Blowing up a bridge with a convoy on it is SO satisfying and a joy to watch. I also knocked over a large ball thingy with gas in it and it rolled down a hill, caught fire, hit a road, banged into a car, blew up, made the car go flying into another car, which then also blew up, and then that explosion alerted some nearby enemies at a checkpoint and they proceeded to attack some rebels passing by (I guess they assumed the rebels did it since they didn't see me do it?). And that is all just within a few hours of gameplay. I can't wait to see that else will happen!\n\n-HUGE open world. The same size as 2 which is huge enough! Just Cause 3 has 1000 square kilometers to explore. And it's in that same beautiful tropical setting we all love (ecept the snowy parts in the mountains which are still damn beautiful!).\n\n-Shooting, ziplining, and parachuting are all streamlined and feel so much smoother than 2 did. Gliding is new and a joy to play around with!\n\n-Underwater is beautiful and fun to swim around in. Another big improvement.\n\nI'd say this is a solid 8.5/10, maybe 9/10 if the story shapes up to be very good.","November 30, 2015","true","39.4"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","21","40","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raikors/recommended/225540/","raikors","Straika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raikors/","352 products in account","Background: I didn't play the first Just Cause. The second one I purchased from sale and played through a few times with a good amount of time spent collecting things and doing random sandbox stuff. This third one I bought on launch day and just recently reached 100% completion with around 45 hours of playtime.\n\nThe game really shines in its audiovisual department with explosions having a decent amount of low frequency sounds and flaming visuals to make them feel impactful and blowing stuff up is just as fun as it was in the previous game. The wingsuit is a nice addition to the movement techniques once you get used to it and how it is different from the familiar parachute gliding.\n\nYou now have more tools at your disposal to wreak havoc with, most of which you have to unlock doing challenge missions and a few that come with progressing in the story. To me, the most notable addition to the core gameplay is that the standard grapple hook tether wires can now be retracted between objects to make them crash together. You start with being able to shoot 2 wires, but with full upgrades you can have 6 with pulling force strong enough to lift cars. There are also rocket booster explosives that, along with tether wires, are the main tools for doing sandbox-y things.\n\nHowever, there's not a lot of variety in the general gameplay at moment. The enemy AI doesn't really pose any threat so you kinda have to enjoy the core mechanics and be good at figuring out creative ways of causing destruction. The challenge missions could've used at least a few more different categories. Though technically optional, the challenges are scored based on completion time, amount of destruction, accuracy etc. depending on the type and you can get 0-5 gears from each one. The gears unlock equipment of the specific challenge type, but once you have seen all the different types they start to feel a bit of a chore to complete especially when going for 5 gears.\n\nThe random collectibles seem a bit tacked on as well, though I'm glad that compared to the 2nd game there is a reasonable amount of them and, unlike in some sandbox games, they actually unlock stuff like access to unlimited fast travel or additional weapons and vehicles. Unfortunately the guns don't have a lot of differences in feel between them and some of the vehicles (especially the motorbikes) are really wonky to control.\n\nLike most of the other reviews have pointed out, there is a forced online leaderboard system that tracks your efforts in various different feats such as longest headshot distance, highest elevation gained with a parachute or longest distance drifted in a land vehicle. It's a cool idea on paper, but it should work more seamlessly in the background and include an option of opting-out of it or at least hiding the displayed messages that pop-up when someone manages to best you at some feat.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is pretty much what I expected from the 3rd installment; It has the same campy feel to the story missions, base "liberation", stunt driving, vehicles that explode like a pile of gasoline and matches from smallest of bumps and so on. Although the list of negative things I listed is long, there really are only a few major annoyances that could and most likely will be patched out in the near future. I'm hoping there'll be some worthy DLC packs to expand the list of available activities currently in the game.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but with an asterisk that in its current form you might find it repetitive and thus not lasting long enough to justify full-priced purchase.","January 1","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is weighed down by a at this time spotty online leaderboard system you can't turn off and forces a recheck (30s+) everytime you open the map. You are forced to play dumb challenges to get upgrades most of which are useless or worse kill you. The game looks great but is still riddled with small glitches and just plain won't run on most systems. Where JC2 had a ♥♥♥♥ ton of collectibles this game as much less, some might like this, I liked collecting them while listing to podcasts though. The story is also just utter trash with nothing interesting happing. The map is nice looking but lacks some of the interesting locations that made JC2 cool, no milehigh club, casino towers, or huge cities, not even a crazy japenese island with a super weapon.\n\nDispite all that I managed to have some fun so if it on sale for less than $30 give it a shot","January 1","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So you'd think that just playing it offline like blocking it in your firewall would be fine? Nope. If you do that it comes up with some thing asking you to verify a code online so you do that and then guess what? AUDIO GLITCH! >:( The audio glitch also seems to happen more often when offline too.\n\nOverall this game is great, all the developers need to do is fix the bugs i've outlined and i'd have been happy to recommend this.

Performance is awful and dialing down the graphics settings doesn't work as well as it should. You'd think that a GTX670 and a 3770K with 16GB ram ought to at least hold 30fps at 1680x1050 with the settings at medium and all the fluff (like tesselation, motion blur) turned off but you'd be wrong. Not sure if I got the new patch got installed or not. Probably? Isn't Steam supposed to do that sort of thing automatically? Ah, I miss the good old days. Gaming is officially dead.\n\nBtw.

The goal of them game? BOMB THE F**K OUT OF EVERYTHING. Just Cause 2 remains better, but JC3 is definitely rivalling it, and definitely better than the original.\n\nTake this scenario: You're back from work, tired and stressed out. You're angry at the communist muslim reptile man Obama for taking your money and spending it on mexicans so they can steal your job. What do you do? Carpet Bomb civilians, because ya know, freedom.\n\nBored with nothing to do? Carpet Bomb civilians.\n\nHomework you don't want to do? Carpet Bomb Civilians.\n\nWant to enjoy a good storyline?

It is weighed down by a at this time spotty online leaderboard system you can't turn off and forces a recheck (30s+) everytime you open the map. You are forced to play dumb challenges to get upgrades most of which are useless or worse kill you. The game looks great but is still riddled with small glitches and just plain won't run on most systems. Where JC2 had a ♥♥♥♥ ton of collectibles this game as much less, some might like this, I liked collecting them while listing to podcasts though. The story is also just utter trash with nothing interesting happing. The map is nice looking but lacks some of the interesting locations that made JC2 cool, no milehigh club, casino towers, or huge cities, not even a crazy japenese island with a super weapon.\n\nDispite all that I managed to have some fun so if it on sale for less than $30 give it a shot","January 1","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raikors/recommended/225540/","raikors","Straika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raikors/","352 products in account","Background: I didn't play the first Just Cause. The second one I purchased from sale and played through a few times with a good amount of time spent collecting things and doing random sandbox stuff. This third one I bought on launch day and just recently reached 100% completion with around 45 hours of playtime.\n\nThe game really shines in its audiovisual department with explosions having a decent amount of low frequency sounds and flaming visuals to make them feel impactful and blowing stuff up is just as fun as it was in the previous game. The wingsuit is a nice addition to the movement techniques once you get used to it and how it is different from the familiar parachute gliding.\n\nYou now have more tools at your disposal to wreak havoc with, most of which you have to unlock doing challenge missions and a few that come with progressing in the story. To me, the most notable addition to the core gameplay is that the standard grapple hook tether wires can now be retracted between objects to make them crash together. You start with being able to shoot 2 wires, but with full upgrades you can have 6 with pulling force strong enough to lift cars. There are also rocket booster explosives that, along with tether wires, are the main tools for doing sandbox-y things.\n\nHowever, there's not a lot of variety in the general gameplay at moment. The enemy AI doesn't really pose any threat so you kinda have to enjoy the core mechanics and be good at figuring out creative ways of causing destruction. The challenge missions could've used at least a few more different categories. Though technically optional, the challenges are scored based on completion time, amount of destruction, accuracy etc. depending on the type and you can get 0-5 gears from each one. The gears unlock equipment of the specific challenge type, but once you have seen all the different types they start to feel a bit of a chore to complete especially when going for 5 gears.\n\nThe random collectibles seem a bit tacked on as well, though I'm glad that compared to the 2nd game there is a reasonable amount of them and, unlike in some sandbox games, they actually unlock stuff like access to unlimited fast travel or additional weapons and vehicles. Unfortunately the guns don't have a lot of differences in feel between them and some of the vehicles (especially the motorbikes) are really wonky to control.\n\nLike most of the other reviews have pointed out, there is a forced online leaderboard system that tracks your efforts in various different feats such as longest headshot distance, highest elevation gained with a parachute or longest distance drifted in a land vehicle. It's a cool idea on paper, but it should work more seamlessly in the background and include an option of opting-out of it or at least hiding the displayed messages that pop-up when someone manages to best you at some feat.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is pretty much what I expected from the 3rd installment; It has the same campy feel to the story missions, base "liberation", stunt driving, vehicles that explode like a pile of gasoline and matches from smallest of bumps and so on. Although the list of negative things I listed is long, there really are only a few major annoyances that could and most likely will be patched out in the near future. I'm hoping there'll be some worthy DLC packs to expand the list of available activities currently in the game.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but with an asterisk that in its current form you might find it repetitive and thus not lasting long enough to justify full-priced purchase.","January 1","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So you'd think that just playing it offline like blocking it in your firewall would be fine? Nope. If you do that it comes up with some thing asking you to verify a code online so you do that and then guess what? AUDIO GLITCH! >:( The audio glitch also seems to happen more often when offline too.\n\nOverall this game is great, all the developers need to do is fix the bugs i've outlined and i'd have been happy to recommend this.

If you doubt me, check the support forums and see the plethora of people having similar or worse issues with the game. Apparently if you use AMD products you just plain doomed.\n\nThe forced online serves only to further drag things down without adding any meaningful content to the game, and DLC on release is always a negative (Regardless of being almost standard practice, DLC on release is a practice that will always any me and I'm sure i'm not alone in that sentiment).\n\nIf this game had all or even most of it's performance issues removed, it would be fantastic and I would happily change this review.","January 1","false","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did experience a somewhat bland, but somewhat hilarious, sandbox game that fills a unique niche in the sandbox universe.  To be fair, I can't even remember its prequel to compare it to, because it, too, must have had the same flaws.\n\nThis game is all about the grapple and stunts.  You can do a lot of fun, memorable stuff.  But, because of some design decisions and flaws, the gameplay doesn't feel spectacular or worthy of re-playing.\n\n1. The controls are not polished enough.  This is something most open-world games have a problem with, but when you're gliding and grappling around it's a huge pain point.  I found myself swearing as I flew into walls or got stuck under ledges.\n2. When you die, you just respawn where you left off. So you can basically liberate the whole map before doing any missions.\n3. New enemies spawn behind from all sides, making battles chaotic and not strategic in any way. This negates any use of the sniper rifle.\n4. Because of the lack of battle tactics, Rico is almost invincible, and so they didn't include crouching or cover because of this and the above point.\n5. Upgrades (or 'mods' as they call them) are mostly optional. They help a little, but not enough to make the game easier or feel rewarding.\n6. Most of the time, it was easier to glide/parachute/fast-travel rather than find a vehicle. Traveling got to be quite a shlep in the mountains.  The vehicles and attention to their detail are amazing but mostly superfluous.\n\nThese points together contributed to a loss of enjoyment in gameplay.\n\nA typical attack on a military base involves parachuting around haphazardly and shooting missiles at targets.  This could have been much more fun if there were a stealth element, or 'level up' health/abilities before attempting, or both.\n\nThe story has a lot of interesting characters who are never fully fleshed out.  Some side-missions with them would have been fun, or at least some more back-story.  I think maybe I was supposed to remember them from a previous game?\n\nOverall, the game is beautiful and fun, to an extent. The story isnt bad, but there's not enough of it to be fulfilling.  There is little replay value and gameplay gets repetitive quickly.  I'm left wishing I could go back into sandbox mode and have a good romp, but everything's liberated, and the battles weren't that fun to begin with.","December 31, 2015","true","52.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you even remotely enjoyed Just Cause 2's openness and ability to let you create wanton chaos (or you just like sandbox, open-world games), you will ADORE Just Cause 3.\n\nThe best part of the game:  the tethering system.  The tethers are the star of the show, allowing you to do ridiculous things like tying people to cars, pulling helicopters into the ground, pulling cars into helicopters, pulling enemies into each other, destroying chaos objects, destroying full bridges, pulling your character to locations or into enemies... there's just so much you can do with them that even after dozens of hours, I was still blown away by how useful and fun they were.  You actually have control of them now, too, so you can connect multiple things and pull them all together with the pull of the left trigger.\n\nThe physics are very well done and play a huge role in the game along with adding to the hilarity of whatever chaos you can create.  A lovely addition is the 'satchel charges' which you basically have an infinite supply of but can only have a maximum of 5 out at a time.  These can be modified to have a rocket effect which you can imagine can create some hilarious moments.  They're also very useful if you've run out of ammo and your tether might not be strong enough yet to take down bigger chaos object.  Attach a few charges, activate, and you're set.\n\nMany people gripe about the challenges to unlock mods but honestly, the tethers are what I recommend maxing out (which is easy to do).  The other mods really just give you a few additional grenades or other things that, to me, weren't worth the effort.  Honestly, I think some of the mods were actually worse than the default (I preferred to NOT have homing grenades).\n\nDriving in the game is horrible but I spent about 90% of my time traveling through the air either by helicopter (which control fine) or by tethering and parachuting/wingsuiting.\n\nMap is HUGE but only the towns and bases are interesting.  I would wager that about 80% of the map is just filler with absolutely nothing interesting to do or see.\n\nDespite my gripes, the game is an absolute blast.  If you enjoy physics in your games combined with a buttload of tools to create satisfying, non-stop destruction and explosions, this game was made for you.  The developers succeeded in creating an incredibly fun sandbox that lets the player use their intuition and imagination to create their own fun.","March 23","true","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fun.\n\n2. Story line is complete and makes sence in my opinion.\n\n3. Easy to understand gameplay.\n\n4. Has random prop dialog (rebel and DRM dialog).\n\n5. Has a lot of random things to collect.\n\n6. Is a little cheaper than other new big games out there.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Some glitches, here I am with a lower AMD grahpic card update because of the whole world have dorito sized chunks missing...\n\n2. Few weapons for a game like this.\n\n3. Little to no rewards for freeing towns unlike military bases.\n\n4. Could use a bit of background on the characters if you haven't played the previous games.\n\nThings that could be added:\n\n1. More weapons!\n\n2. Attachments to weapons would be a cool addition.\n\n3. Different types of grappling hooks either from rebel drop or storyline.\n\n4. More things that can be destroyed, I found a statchue that looked like something that needed to be blown up while I tried and it didn't...\n\n5. More story line along the way for General Di Ravello (I think is how you spell it).\n\n6. A leveling system might be a cool addition.\n\n\nOver all I love this game so far and the fact that there can be so much more added in the future!

Sometimes it stutters for 20-30 seconds in the middls of high action gameplay making the game COMPLETELY unplayable.\n\nThe sound will stutter and freeze at times yielding a long buzzing from the speakers before finally coming back to just 1-2 frames per second for 1-2 minutes...

Very fun.\n\n2. Story line is complete and makes sence in my opinion.\n\n3. Easy to understand gameplay.\n\n4. Has random prop dialog (rebel and DRM dialog).\n\n5. Has a lot of random things to collect.\n\n6. Is a little cheaper than other new big games out there.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Some glitches, here I am with a lower AMD grahpic card update because of the whole world have dorito sized chunks missing...\n\n2. Few weapons for a game like this.\n\n3. Little to no rewards for freeing towns unlike military bases.\n\n4. Could use a bit of background on the characters if you haven't played the previous games.\n\nThings that could be added:\n\n1. More weapons!\n\n2. Attachments to weapons would be a cool addition.\n\n3. Different types of grappling hooks either from rebel drop or storyline.\n\n4. More things that can be destroyed, I found a statchue that looked like something that needed to be blown up while I tried and it didn't...\n\n5. More story line along the way for General Di Ravello (I think is how you spell it).\n\n6. A leveling system might be a cool addition.\n\n\nOver all I love this game so far and the fact that there can be so much more added in the future!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beysaan/recommended/225540/","Beysaan","Zelrala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beysaan/","206 products in account","While this is by all means a sequel to Just Cause 2, it feels more like a experiment of ideas they couldnt put into JC2 for various reasons. As entertaining as it is, this is one of the situations where i wish there was a "meh" recommendation. If you already own and have played Just Cause 2 extensively, you may likely find this is not worth the purchase. Due to a lack of interest to keep playing after about 15 hours (as seen above) i will not recommend this, however.\n\nPros:\n+Visually its beautiful. Hardly mindblowing, but rather good looking for how well it runs. (i5 4690k, GTX 970, 8gb RAM)\n+The Addition of unlimited explosives and extra grapple lines (as well as grapple retractions) makes it clear they understood where Just Cause 2 sat as a sandbox Michael Bay simulator.\n+Towns are not copy pasted, unlike a decent few in JC2 which felt the same but altered to fit the terrain around it.\n+New and improved cars allows for some amusing and fast travelling chaos to occur in various forms, much like in JC2, but on drugs.\n+Upgrade tree which allows you to enable and disable upgrades whenever you want after unlocking allows for an even larger freeform of destruction.\n+Addition of the wingsuit means you can travel around the world a bit faster than you could in Just Cause 2, with a little more sensation of the actual speed.\n+Introduction of the 'new and improved' vehicle purchase system allows you to access what you want wherever, at a small cost of an item easily replenished at any nearby fuel station.  You can access any weapons and vehicles you have unlocked prior, with the upgrades you have unlocked for them (only accessible on the vehicles you acquire via this supply drop system).\n+\n\nCons:\n-The Map and towns in the game are rather uninteresting. While unique to one another they lack pretty much any remarkable features to them, a majority of the objectives being on the rooftops and leaving little reason to explore them other than to pull up the settlement flag (to capture the settlement), and to eliminate the police station there.\n-Story is pretty... well... its a story. Thats about all i can say for it. Its hardly remarkable and it doesnt make a whole lot of sense compared to what Just Cause 2 offered (JC2: Cause chaos to unsettle the tyrannical government. JC3: Blow some more stuff up, because thats how you liberate towns apparently). Thats about all i can say for it though, since, as you can see, i had difficulty motivating to finish the game.\n-Driving. Its bad. The cars seem to be designed to ♥♥♥♥ the player over with the exception of the high powered cars which seem to be the only ones capable of not spinning out. For instance, when turning, the car barely turns at all until it reaches about 10 degrees of an angle upon which it typically then goes all the way at once and spins out. Drifting is poorly concieved as while its not too hard to slide around a corner, ending the drift typically results in your car attempting to reangle back a huge distance the way you came. Not helpful in the least.\n-Driving Pt2. Motorbikes, while previously a menace to use in JC2 due to how often the wheels left the ground, have become even worse somehow. Clearly designed by someone who has never actually ridden a motorbike (i do, before anyone calls me out), the damn things tend to barely turn, or not even turn at all, until Ricos knees are just about touching the road. Which of course makes driving a huge pain since it basically means you have a 100ms latency on turning. Plus going over a bump means hell for you.\n-Flying (or Driving Pt3) has been... more or less untouched. Its still the most efficient means of getting around should you find yourself in easy reach of a jet or plane. However, its slightly ruined by them using the same button for Accelerate as Turbo. For anyone who hasnt played the game yet, what this means is that NORMALLY, you have a 'flight speed' which for this example shall be 200km/h. Its about the area your speed 'maxes' out at if you arent accelerating constantly, and slowly drops from if you arent. Pressing the accelerate button boosts your speed past that max about 10% (so, lets say to 220km/h) but letting go off accelerate quickly dips it back to 200 again (much faster than your speed drops below 200). This is alright, allowing you to accelerate out of curves, and stop during them to make tighter turns. All good. All fun.\nAnd then theres the turbo. Bound to the same button as accelerate (which you CANNOT unbind when i last played it, due to switching one button automatically switching the other) it basically replaces your accelerate. You dont accelerate up the runway, you turbo up the runway. You dont regenerate turbo while accelerating either, so if you want to regenerate turbo you have to let your speed dip again down to 200 (which ends up at about 180 or so by the time turbo has fully recharged). This might seem like a small issue, but the amount of time you spend below 'max speed' almost entirely removes the benefit you gain FROM the turbo itself. Kind of questioning the purpose of the boost when you spend almost all of it taking off anyway.\n-The wingsuit, while a great idea, was not worth the cost to the parachute itself. They changed the parachute so that you cannot move nearly as fast as you could in JC2, and its movement is far heavier, resulting in a far more awkward tool to use. Ive said it before, and ill say it again, if you have to screw up one mechanic to make the new mechanic have a purpose, maybe the new mechanic isnt worth it. The chute was inconic to Just Cause, and this game doesnt do it justice at all.\n-You actually have to do a fair amount before you unlock most of the more entertaining mods, but due to the map haveing an obscenely small amount of settlements (compared to Just Cause 2) its unlikely youll have too many left to do by the time you acquire them. Kind of ruining the sandbox feeling. Itd be like giving the player explosives on the final mission.","March 16","false","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a very enjoyable open world game that defined the current generation of sandbox games. So when Just Cause 3 was announced last year, I was genuinely hyped. Even though these days you can't get hyped about a game without worrying about how it'll perform on launch day, I didn't care, because Just Cause 2 was a very optimized game and Square Enix has a decent record of games with good optimization.\n\nThat being said, I was getting ever and ever more doubtful, how the pre-release coverage of the game showed so little as opposed to other AAA titles, how no one was talking about the map, performance or anything. Hell the biggest feature of this franchise, the map, was shown only a week eariler before release. And when it did release, I couldn't play the game because of the horrible optimization. That being said, after a few patches and buying more RAM, I finally got to play it. Now on to the review.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics in this game speaks for itself. You can see farmlands, sunflower fields and scattered villages for miles. The spires of big bases have a very significant apperance of Di Ravello's oppresive regime. Beautiful sea beaches merge with coves and scattered cliffsides. At night the cities and bases light up and provide a beacon for it be discovered.\n\nSOUND\n\nThis game is a treat for the ear as much as the eye - guns sound powerful, sports cars sound ferociously fast and explosions give that great sound of satisfaction that you may not find in any other game.\n\nMAP & GAMEPLAY\n\nNow on to the part which I found most controversial. The map of Just Cause 3 seems much more lackluster compared to JC2. There aren't any more landmark locations like the Mile High Club, the Radar Dish, or the Radio Tower. Instead there's just a lot of villages and bases. Sure they look unique from each other, but it's a step back from JC2. Also half of the biggest island is literally walled off and abandoned, where in a similar way in JC2 there were  a lot more villages, bases etc. Roads look like masking tapes put on the floor, the highways have no hoardings above them, there are no dividers and the biggest city - citate di ravello, is as lack luster as it can get.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit cumbersome. Auto aiming is gone, so expect a lot missed shots. The health meter is gone, though now it's the same as not getting health pack like in JC2. The minimap is gone, so you won't know where are the enemies and you won't notice the remaining chaos objects without pausing the game and looking up on the map.\n\nSure they changed the driving model, cars tend not to swivel out of control, but bikes on the other hand will behave realistically and just won't go straight. I wish  the Sleeping Dog's driving model was implemented here.\n\nThe biggest change this game offers is the wingsuit and in the sky fortress dlc, it turns into a ♥♥♥♥ing jetpack. Though it's quite fun. It is only one step forward from the last game.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nJust Cause 3 behaves similarly to Just Cause 2,the map has been stripped to just bases and cities. As if the developers played a lot of Far Cry 3 and added it's wingsuit and nothing much else. There is much more accesibility, and the game is still jolly good fun. I'd recommend buying now. Because once this goes on sale, it'll just be another $5 game that you'll never play , another entry in your untouched game library.","March 11","true","90.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"
