I often play this while watching a stream or Netflix on my second screen. Although my steam says I haven't played it for that long, it had a free demo on kickstarter (you could play untill wave 4, which took me a long time to reach) which I played for approximatly 3 hours before it got released.\nIn my opinion this game is already worth the price of 3 euros, and it's still developing!\n\nPS bear in mind that this game is still in beta\nPPS if you can beat my highscore of 217069 I'll give you a cookie\n","June 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","19","23","4","0"

But what I've seen it is a very nice pixel art game.\n\nWhoever is into zombie wave survival and likes to slice, spray and blow zombies open with axes, guns and grenades.  Than this is surely a game for you to check out. The abilities are also a nice addon to the game. You can freely choose out of 6 different abilities which help you fight of the zombie horde. Sometimes you find those abilities quiet usefull against some mini bosses.\n\nBut remember this is still a EARLY ACCESS game this means it is still at its roots of being developed. So you may find some bugs, things that aren't entirely smooth and things that aren't balanced yet.\n\nIn my opinion Forest Warrior lives up to the content it gives for an EARLY ACCESS game. Yes it still needs more content, tweaks and balancing but that's why it is early access. I would recommend this game if you like the things as I said above and if you want to support the developers further in their work to make a awesome game.","June 25, 2015","true","0.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","1"

I couldn't get myself to play more.\n\nThe controls don't feel quite right, the range on your axe (melee weapon you start with) as well as the range on the zombies is farther than what feels is right. You get hit by surprise a lot.\n\nThe pistol has limited ammo and needs 3 shots to kill a zombie (one-hit with an axe), that feels unbalanced. A very limited ammunition, very low damage, ranged weapon.\n\nI'd rather restart from the beginning of the last wave when dying, instead of the very beginning. Replaying wave 1 is not very compelling, the limited continues do not help.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRWxSxWUvvg&list=PL3gilQXLG8aDbeSGGUENLz-knPJWUAbGE&index=3","May 3","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyper445/recommended/378590/","hyper445","Hyper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyper445/","287 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nForest Warrior took me completely by surprise. I looked at no reviews, videos or screenshots before I played the game, and I thought it was simply just a platforming 8-bit game. Forest Warrior is a 2D action-survival game. You fend off zombies, birds, and wolves that are attacking you in the forest. The game has great visuals and animations, wonderful and relaxing music, and interesting gameplay.\nGameplay –\nYou start off on the first night with just your hatchet, and many zombies attempting to kill you. You have to fight to survive and each wave has increasing difficulty. As you progress through the game you get more weaponry to fight off the enemies. The game is challenging, as you only have 3 hearts, but the game is still enjoyable. The only issue I had with the gameplay is that the range on the axe is very long, and seems to be a bit buggy, as the animation plays and the hit registers after the animation is completed. The birds are a huge pain, as they move extremely fast and you can’t seem to roll out of the way of them. You have special abilities that charge up by getting kills, which you can then activate to provide a huge advantage against the enemies. If you charge up all 4 bars, you unlock your rampage ability, which lets you spin around with your axe and destroy every enemy in your path for 20 seconds. I was unable to make it past Wave 4, but there are bosses in the game, as well as other weapons like grenades. It is very challenging, but I had lots of fun playing it.\n8/10\nGraphics –\nI always gush over 8-bit or pixellated games, as it reminds me very much of many classics I love. The visuals are pretty and detailed, with the puffy clouds drifting by in the background as you slaughter zombies. I was very surprised by the animations however, as they are quite spectacular. The pause menu is very beautiful; it zooms out and has a lovely blue shimmer around the screen. When you swing your axe you feel the power in the swing, as the screen pulses and the enemy reacts very well to the axe hitting them. During the swinging animation there is a trail of blood falling behind the axe from the enemies you have killed. You can see the kickback when you fire the gun and it has a big flare from the bullet exiting the barrel. There is a blood splatter animation when you hit an enemy and when you kill them they shatter and pieces of them get blown away in the wind. Overall the game is very beautifully crafted with wonderful animations.\n9/10\nAudio –\nThe music in Forest Warrior is spectacular. It is very relaxing and enjoyable. For example, I have been listening to the menu screen music for the entirety of the time I wrote this review. The enemy sound effects, like the caws of the birds and the growls of the zombie are wonderful and sound very nice. The sound of your axe hitting the enemy is very satisfying, as you can hear the axe embedding into the enemy, and the splatter as well. The gun sounds very similar to a real gun and the sound of the bullet hitting is also satisfying. The soundtrack in Forest Warrior is amazing, and the sound effects are great.\n8/10\nConclusion –\nForest Warrior is a beautifully crafted 8-bit indie game, and I highly recommend it. It is difficult at times but is very enjoyable. There is no real story to the game, but that is usually common in survival games like this, and a story in a game like this might not appeal to some people who just want to kill some monsters. It is a great game to play when waiting for time to pass or you just want to hop in and slaughter some zombies. However, I don’t believe the game is worth the whole $3.99, as there isn’t much gameplay, even though there are many waves to conquer. Nonetheless, it is still a great game and if you manage to catch it on sale I highly recommend that you snag it and have some fun killing monsters!\nOverall – 8/10","May 31","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It ramps up fast, and you really need to switch between weapons, and rolling at the correct times to try and survive. Especially when it comes to boss fights, you only have 3 hearts, which means 3 hits and you're dead.\n\nYour special abilities that you select at the start are crucial and it takes some trial and error to try and get the best combo that suits your play style. I would strongly recommend you always pick the one for full health though; it's so very useful.\n\nOverall, I've been enjoying the game in small bouts. It's not something I would personally play for hours on end, but it's doing well so far.\n\nPC Gameplay\n[ur]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQQIh5d-eDA[/url]","July 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
