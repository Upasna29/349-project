After all, hundreds of them come preloaded in even the simplest word processors, allowing for uninhibited freedom for formatting whatever we might need. But what most probably forget, is that it didn't use to be like this; those fonts came from somewhere, each a painstaking creation designed with a specific use in mind, which have nonetheless endured for generations and are now being put to use for far different purposes.\n\nIn many ways Type:Rider acts as a sort of mini history lesson to the legacy of fonts, a subject far more interesting in execution than on paper. From the earliest known texts to modern computer code, it's surprisingly fascinating to see the evolution of printed text and how various fonts came into being. There's a special place in my heart for games that can be both entertaining and educational, and this is certainly among the best I've played to date.\n\nIf you're shaking your head thinking there's nothing you'd rather not do than read over history descriptions while playing a game, it's worth noting that it's entirely optional to do so. It's never in your faced or forced upon you, but if you are planning to dismiss this side of the experience you'll be left with an otherwise rather bland and clumsy platformer. I was able to look past many of the weaker aspects of the game because I found the artistic and academic elements to be interesting in themselves, but those looking for even an average platformer are likely to come away disappointed.\n\nThis falls solely on the controls, a terribly clunky lesson in frustration as you attempt to maneuver a character that seems to like nothing more than to flip wildly out of control at the worst moments. Most levels make up for this by being relatively simple to traverse, but on a handful of occasion more precision is required which proves truly aggravating. The secret level being the most difficult and featuring no checkpoints only adds insult to injury, making me wonder why the developers chose to add such a challenging segment to a game that seems designed to be a relaxing an accessible experience.\n\nType:Rider is far from a perfect game, maybe not even a good one, but it is a unique and interesting endeavor to give a little background on a subject I'd never have bothered to look into otherwise. For those who can appreciate it more as an art piece than a traditional platformer, it's an intriguing slice of edutainment the strength of which lies in its excellent aesthetic and nontraditional source material, and not its gameplay. Anyone already bored reading this review should go ahead and pass on it, as there are dozens of other games that will be a far better fit for what you're after.\n\nIf nothing else, I doubt you'll ever look at comic sans quite the same way again.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","54","63","2","0"

The music fits, spot on. I was surprised on how everything works so well together. Each world has their own theme that reflects the font (and the era it's from). For someone like me, who didn't really know anything about font history, Type:Rider was truly informative.

It’s a platformer that has you play as a pair of dots who jump, swim, and solve environmental puzzles to progress. It’s also an educational game that teaches you about the history of typography as you play.The game plays out as a series of side-scrolling levels that hinder your progress with puzzles and obstacles instead of enemies. The usual platformer ingredients are on display here, like spikes, lava, water, and moving platforms. It might not sound terribly original, but the developers have pumped tons of creativity into the game’s design. Each world is based on a particular font, and the environments are made up of giant letters in that font, plus whatever new printing technology became available at the time.The controls aren’t as precise as they could be, but checkpoints are closely spaced so you never lose much progress. Every good platformer has collectibles, and here they’re the letters of the alphabet. A number of asterisks are also scattered throughout the levels; grabbing them unlocks sections of text that teach the history of writing and typography. The history is fun to read even if you’re not particularly interested in fonts.Like in Limbo, the graphics are silhouetted and stunning, set against abstract pages of text, drawings, and photographs. The music is pleasantly atmospheric, changing with the timeframe the levels take place in.One problem– and it’s a minor one– is that stopping to read the text sections as you collect asterisks in the game does a disservice to the gameplay. It’s far better to play the levels without stopping for the history lessons, and then read the texts you’ve collected between levels.Despite the somewhat mushy controls, Type:Rider is an incredibly fun, unique platformer. It manages to entertain and inform in equal measure, which is more than most games try to do.","November 4, 2014","true","6.8"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","41","45","3","0"

So it comes as no surprise that the actual theme of the game is all about history: in the course of ten levels, the player discovers the history of ... typography, of the different fonts used from the earliest printed books back in the Renaissance right up to the newest developments.\n\nWhile this may sound boring and very school-alike, it isn't. The development studio, Ex Nihilo, has managed to transform this theme into an interesting and original game. The actual gameplay is rooted in the tradition of the platformer: you control two dots, who travel through a level filled with letters and other items related to typography. There are problems to be overcome, gaps to be jumped and letters to be collected. Played with a controller, the game let me control my dots quite accurately, and even as a platform-noob, I didn't encounter too many difficulties in finishing all the levels (only the bonus level took me quite some time). Besides jumping and controlling the dots' speed, there is no other action, so no firing or whatsoever.\n\nBut there is more to this game than some simple and well-known platform mechanics. Traversing through the levels, you'll unlock a lot of historical information on the different fonts and the context in which they were developed and used. The presentation of this is very well done, with short to-the-point texts and a lot of visual information. Graphically, the game is a gem: every level is transformed into an evocation of the period of its particular font, with sounds and music increasing the historical feeling. The game does have trading cards & achievements, some of which are challenging and encourage you to discover every corner of every level.\n\nHighly recommended to everyone with some interest in history and/or arts. Those looking for an exciting and challenging platform-game should probably go elsewhere though.","September 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","3"

This game, with its subject matter and beautiful style, was easy to take a chance on.  In the end: Is it informative?  Very.  Is it beautiful both in terms of audio and visuals?  Extremely.  Is it fun?  Not really.\n\nFor me, the control (especially jumping mechanics) just never felt quite "right".  That is easily the biggest source of frustration in the game.  While some sequences are downright inspired, others are grit-your-teeth annoying.\n\nThe informative nature of the game and the actual gameplay seem at times to be at odds with each other.  For example, unlocking an informative page gives you a prompt to view it immediately - while I recommend doing this since the visuals and audio in the portion of the level you are in will be tuned towards this piece of info, it halts the gameplay and can break the pacing.  In addition, occasionally the game will destroy you as soon as you return to the gameplay and cause you to have to replay the small sequence again.  It feels like a punishment for doing what the game is designed to have you discover.\n\nIn the end, I just can't recommend the game.","January 21, 2014","false","3.0"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","49","61","0","1"

As the aforementioned educational experience it's really interesting, purely as a game it can be frustrating.\n\nYou control two balls, a colon(?), inexorably linked across 10 levels, one intro, 1 hidden and 8 main ones representing the various ages of typography each with a font theme appropriate to the era.  From Gothic to Time, Helvetica to Pixel, each level has it's own unique idenity and all are very different, thankfully never feeling grindy.\n\nOn each level the goal to collect the entire typeface, A through Z, 6 or so asterisks' and a hidden ampersand.  Apart from the sort of hidden ampersand, you really won't have to go out of you way to collect anything.  None of the levels are difficult, you are meant to experience this game, not be challenged by it and with the fine ambient music, levels are a joy.  Each main level is split into 4 parts, two collectable platforming sections and 2 puzzle areas.  These puzzle areas range from Arkanoid and Peggle clones to shifting a third ball around through typeface to open a door, all doors requiring a third ball, key, to open.\n\nAs a game it is let down by frustrating controls, the wall jumping doesn't quite work right.  Jumping is also an inexact science and once you get to the final level there are sections that really deserve better controls.  This game isn't Super Meat Boy, but a little more time was needed to finesse the gaming.\n\nIt's definitely worth your time, a couple of hours, at a decent price, but I can't help the feeling that if they had made the control and physics more predictable, it would have made a better game.","April 8, 2014","true","4.3"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","0"

I have taken my fair share of typography courses and I figured it would be fun to see another spin on things in a fun educational style and at the same time enjoy a challenging puzzle game.\n\nThe good: The visual style and the music are both fantastic. I enjoyed the choice for the main character. The level designs are fun and each one uses the font you are currently in as the level building blocks. The slight variation of the jumping/swimming/riding carts was interesting. The end level puzzles with the white dot were fairly interesting as well and the most challenging part of the game. If this is all you are looking for then I recommend you try to get this in a sale at some point.\n\nThe bad: The game prides itself in "experience and uncover the history and secrets of Fonts and Characters" in the main description, yet all you get is a series of afterthought slides as a background as you are trying to go through each level. There is no narrative or even text, explaining, why you are going from Didot to Clarendon. When you onlock asterisks, you can read more about specific fonts, a short narrative could have elevated the game so much more than a wall of text here.\n\nEach level you ride/jump from A to Z, some letters are for you to collect, some are for you to jump on to complete the level. Overall the main puzzles are fairly simplistic. Another big question mark moment in this game, is when, the colon you are playing, for no obvious reason but to try and add unimaginative difficulty to the game, starts getting shot at by a sniper somewhere. Thankfully this only goes on for one level. Overall somewhat shallow execution of an otherwise promissing concept.\n\nGame is fairly short, finished it in 1.5 hours not even enough to get all the cards.\n\nAgain, this might be a fun play if you can get it during a sale, the graphics and audio are great, but the game is somewhat short and not very challenging.","January 28, 2015","false","2.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

(To clarify, i don't mean that the controls are unresponsive per se, it's rather the slow-moving and slowly-reacting behaviour of your character.)\n\nAnd then there are the "usual" issues many indie games suffer from these days: No way to skip past the opening titles and no options menu (you can't even change the display resolution, and the in-game language is set to whatever region your OS is set to).\n\nAs much as i would like to recommend this game, i can't because these issues weigh it down too heavily.","October 24, 2014","false","1.0"," 45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","45","66","0","3"

There's quite a few pages about typography history. But as with any games, the gameplay is the most important part and it's where this game has many issues...\n\nFirst of all, the controls. Your character is a colon. Sure, it allows for some tactics with lines and such, but it also makes it hard to control. Also the gravity and acceleration are so wacky... It just doesn't feel right.\n\nThen you get into bugs, a game breaking bug where a letter (letter are obstacles and platforms in this game) is facing the wrong way, making the level impossible to finish. In case it happens, you have to restart the level all over again and hope it's fixed. Sometimes the music/sounds go away and sometimes when you pause or alt-tab, the controls doesn't work anymore and you have to Alt+F4 out of the game. Also i've had an issue where my character got stuck in the middle of a letter and I had to restart the game...\n\nSome more issues: the maximum resolution is 1600x900, there's no 1080p, there's a few frame drops throughout the game and the last achievement is really frustating. Also you need to modify your computer settings to change the language of the game (It's in your natal language or pc language by default).\n\nI didin't enjoy playing through this game very much because of all the CONs i've listed.

However, the level design throughout the game is pretty good, particularly the last few levels.\n\nThe Knowledge\nSpelling and grammatical errors are much more prevalent than you would expect from a game teaching about writing and texts. Interesting subject matter, assuming they used reputable sources.\n\nMy Thoughts\nEverything is mediocre. The gameplay is just good enough to be playable, the writing is just good enough to be understandable. Because they didn't do any part particularly well, it is hard to tell what was the makers focus. It is a shame though because had they tested the game better, fixed the controls a little or made you control a period instead of a colon and proofread the books, this could have been an excellent game. This is why I have my doubts about what I learned through this game, hopefully that historical aspect was their focus.","January 4, 2015","false","5.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It was first sold for Android and iOS but you had the possibility to try the first five levels online, which I did.\n\nI fell in love with the game. I was considering buying it for my Android device when it was released on Steam. My reaction was "Take my money". I bought it. And I managed to get through the rest of the game.\n\nLet me explain you the mechanics of the game: you're two dots travelling through levels concerning a font and its history. You have to gather all letters and & without forgetting the * representing a page of history. Indeed, as it's labeled first as a serious game, Type:Rider's aim is to "educate" you in that field. For example, you'll learn stuff about the monks who were copying documents during the Middle Age in the world Gothic.\n\nType:Rider is more a platformer/puzzle game than anything else. You jump, you make sure that the white dot appearing every two levels goes in its hole to open gates or finish the book (representing the world you're currently in).\n\nFirst of all, the graphics are beautiful and adapted to the world you're currently exploring: the world Gothic contains gothic letters as "ground". Or the Ancient Greek part of the world Origins has a ancient plate background (the archaeologist in me is very happy to see Red Figure pottery used) from which water is coming.\n\nSecondly, the soundtrack is very enjoyable to listen and very relaxing. It's also matching the world you're exploring. Even the two dots have their own sound when they're jumping.\n\nI didn't really find some defaults in the mechanics. While it's true that sometimes, commands take more time than it should to answer, it's very rare. My major grief about the game is some letters or & difficult to reach and making my fingers ache as I'm trying to reach them by jumping and jumping and jumping.\n\nFor the texts, they're very well written and very understandable, at least, in my native language - I don't know how it was translated in English.\n\nMy conclusion is that the game is worthy of your time if you like that kind. You can try it before on the official website of Arte. But if you can, the mobile versions are cheaper than Steam (and I suppose that there is a valid reason behind that difference - Monster Loves You, another game, is showing the same pattern).","November 6, 2013","true","5.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I enjoyed the content.\n\nI did not enjoy feeling like I was trying to manage an erratic slinky falling down a pit without knowing what end I was holding onto. You're controlling a pair of dots. I'd say it's a colon, except there's some physics going on with them, so they more separately. I use the word "physics" here lightly, as every time I try to jump (which is required a lot, this being a platformer and all), I never know what's going to happen. Oh, and 9/10, if you want to stop moving after you've started, you can't. So good luck not hitting the thing that will insta-kill you that's moving that you can't see until after you jump.\n\nNeedless to say, all of this makes Type:Rider extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nWhen I say I never know what's going to happen, I often mean that I'll be pushing right and jumping... and I'll jump to the left. Sometimes it'll seem like I'm moving one of the dots as "lead," but then lol nope, it's the other one and guess what I'M DEAD.\n\nOne of the levels also glitched out on me; a not so apparent glitch, so I didn't know the area I was in was now basically impossible. A piece of the map was supposed to move. It didn't. I wasted about 45 minutes before rebooting the game and having it work perfectly fine. I've also had buttons randomly stop working in the middle of levels (fantastics when it's ESC, which pauses/brings up the menu).\n\nThere's also the issue of this game being far more expensive than the exact same version that you can get on Android or iOS. I'm wondering if the touch controls actually work better. This feels like an extraordinarily horrible port half the time. Probably because it is.\n\nIt's pretty. I learned some new things. But I have never been this angry at a platformer. I love brutally difficult platformers. But when it's just pure luck that's getting me killed because there's no way to tell what will happen if I dare to jump, no.\n\nIf you want to learn about fonts, head over to Wikipedia.

I was expecting a mere platformer but I found out it to be something more. I actually had no clue what this game was about and that's why I decided to play it on a hunch. I'm glad I did so. Type: Rider offers you basic and simple platforming gameplay, you move and you jump and that's it. However this game introduces you to the history of typography. The history of typography is told by books, each book refers to a certain font and a certain timeline and each book represents a different level which is then divided in 4 sublevels. By acquiring asterisks, and by this I mean ingame collectibles in the form of asterisks which can be found on each level. Besides that you can also collect each letter of the alphabet on each font that is told on a specific book. The books range from the early  writing of the cave men, to the egyptian hieroglyphs, to the medieval times and then to first languages that were introduced in computer programming. One thing I found particularly detailed was that on each level the music is adequate to the timeline in question. Visually I found Type: Rider to be really appealing but that may vary from person to person. It is certainly not your average game and you should only play it if you have any interest in history, otherwise it might get boring.

You play as a colon, exploring the history of written language (primarily Latin script with a brief introduction on the origins of written language,) fonts, and related technology.  Gameplay is pretty simple but rather clumsy physics platforming.  Overall the game is not very difficult though the clumsiness of the player movement really gets in the way and makes certain sections much more difficult than they should be.  In addition to this there is an achievement to complete a particularly annoying chapter without dying which is much harder than it should be for the same reason.\n\nThat said, the information the game provides is very interesting and something I had very little knowledge of previously.

It's especially fitting for people who like learning something new on the side while playing a game for relaxation. As purely a platformer, the game is quite low on the difficulty. There are a few collectibles here and there but they don't necessarily pose a challenge. I admit though that there were 1 or 2 achievements that required me to redo 1 or 2 levels a few times but other than that, the game itself was a breeze. Despite the low difficulty, the game is great for entire different reasons. It has great ambient music (which unfortunately is not sold separately on Steam), interesting aesthetic level design, a rich amount of information to impart, and an overall good feeling for completing each stage/level.\n\nI recommend this game if you want a casual platformer to be immersed in for relaxation.

It's not even a term that's used anymore, despite a rise in indie games that actually make good on the promise of being educational AND fun. Which brings us to Type:Rider, a physics platformer based around what really should be the most boring subject imaginable, the history of typefaces. Instead, we have a beautiful, challenging game that manages to make its topic more engaging than any textbook could ever hope to.\n\nYour avatar in Type:Rider is either a plucky umlaut or an alignment-challenged colon, two dots that roll along the landscape like wheels on an invisible car. I know the jump from one ball to two doesn't sound like much innovation in the crowded physics-platformer genre, but this allows for some really clever maneuvers like cartwheel flips, wheelie jumps, and dangling under platforms. You'll need all of these tricks to navigate across the giant letters and silhouettes that make up the beautiful, otherworldly levels. Each level is themed after a period in the history of the written word, everything from primeval script to printing presses to HTML, with gimmicks befitting the era. You'll ski down cursive curves, float on classical notes, hop across postmodern art, and bounce on blinking cursors.\n\nEach level has six asterisks to collect along the main path, 26 letters of the alphabet that require some platforming to nab, and a hidden ampersand (that & thingy) that's quite a challenge to reach. The collectable symbols are a nice touch to keep you going but it's the asterisks that really make the game, because each unlocks a short article about the history of typefaces from that period. You would think that breaking up gameplay with educational passages would ruin the flow of the game, but each is short, interesting, and well-written enough to make for a welcome interlude. I honestly knew nothing about Claude Garamont[en.wikipedia.org] or why sans-serif[en.wikipedia.org] fonts are called that, but I was delighted to learn within the context of the game. And even if you aren't, the articles are entirely optional to even open.\n\nThe actual platforming is a perfect match for a game of this nature, challenging but without ever reaching frustrating levels, and with several relaxing segments and thoughtful puzzles. The different periods are visual joys to traverse, and an generous checkpointing system makes it easy to revisit your favorite parts. There's even a secret level in everyone's favorite love-to-hate font that hits the perfect tone for the game. All of these elements make Type:Rider an unexpected gem from a dormant genre, and a very strong case for its return to boot.","March 26","true","2.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Type:Rider is the former and not the latter.  If one were to call it a game, one would have to admit that it is an extremely frustrating game due to the unresponsive controls, especially when jumping.  Making the problem worse is the "wall jump" mechanic; pressing towards a wall and jumping will let you wall jump the other way. . . but the nature of the controls is such that you'll often wall jump to the left when trying to leap a single step to the right.  There is a Tetris-inspired level that is especially terrible because of this.\n\nOn the other hand, the game is extremely beautiful.  Stark iconography on top of distinctive level design mixed with an environment-specific soundtrack make for a pleasing experience (except when you have to jump).  The exploration of the history of typography is also fascinating; and for me, a little sad.  Seeing the thousands of years flit by with ideas replaced by ideas causes one to both be humble and to reflect.\n\n--- Two Circles ---\n\nThis is the story of two circles that rolled together through time. One always rolled on the ground while the other rolled in the air above, floating directly above the first. Which did which?  It does not matter: sometimes it was one, sometimes the other. What is important is that they were two that went everywhere as one, for together they formed a Colon.\n\nHow they met I do not know. All I know is that it was during a time of great experimentation and exploration. Renaissance :  the period of rebirth, when beauty and the civilized soul were discovered once more. Chiaroscuro :  the bold contrast between light and dark. Sfumato :  without boundaries, edges like smoke. These words and more defined a new world that seemed to dawn brighter than the sun. And as a Colon the circles delighted together :  in the hope, in the glory, in the splendid possibilities of the coming future.\n\n"Shall we keep going?" asked one. "Of course!" the other said excitedly. The two circles rolled forward together with eagerness and ease.\n\nTime passed - as it does - and the world changed - as it does. What did not change was the demand for a Colon, for there were always new lists to enumerate, new words to define. But for the first time a darkness fell over their service. Heretic :  an individual whose beliefs run counter to those approved by the authorities. Inquisition :  a tribunal with widespread powers and prerogatives to root out undesirables. Auto-da-fé :  the public penance of apostates prior to the execution of their sentences.\n\n"What is this?" one asked. "What is happening? Has the world always been thus? Have we been blind for all this time?"\n\n"It will pass," the other said, hiding the uncertainty in its voice. "It must. But only if we keep rolling forward. Together." So they rolled onwards through a world that seemed increasingly unkind :  colonization, conquistador, pandemic. But instead of retreating, the shadows lengthened even further :  guillotine, coup d'état, manifest destiny. And the circles found that they no longer rolled as easily as before.\n\nThen came the decades of constant war :  the Somme, the Marne, Stalingrad, Dresden, Hiroshima, Auschwitz. Blitzkrieg :  a bolt strike whose electric speed throws the opponent into panicked disarray. Ethnic cleansing :  the destruction of a group of people based on racial or cultural criteria. Unrestricted warfare :  a strategy conducted with the understanding that civilian targets and military targets are one and the same. And the lists of the dead, a  :  followed by a series of graven names that never seemed to end, a list incomprehensible and nearly meaningless by virtue of its very scale.\n\nThe circles rolled on, together still, but now in silence, slower and slower.\n\nThere came the day when the circle rolling on the ground stopped and realized that something was different. Confused, it looked all about, and the change was so obvious that it could not understand it at first. The space above was empty, suffocatingly empty; and what did that mean?\n\nRecognition came slow, but once it did the circle felt half-drowned with terror. It quickly retreated, searching behind until finally found the other circle. The other circle was motionless and sunken into the ground.\n\n"Up," the circle urged, "up."\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n"Up," it said again, "up!" and now it could not hide a quaver, the crack that revealed fears it did not dare voice.\n\nFor agonizing moments, silence. Then, a whisper: "Leave me."\n\n"Leave you?" The circle could only laugh, the idea was so ridiculous. "How? I cannot."\n\n"You must. I am too tired to go on. I have seen too much and I do not wish to witness any more. I want to stop. A Period marks an ending, does it not? Very well; leave me and let me become a Period. Let me end."\n\nThe frightened circle was left speechless. It wanted to plead, chastise, cajole: Did you not once say that this would pass, if only we keep rolling forward together? You cannot ask me to go on, not now!\n\nBut it could not. For in truth it understood how the other felt because it, too, felt that way. And the exhaustion it had denied for so long suddenly descended like a shroud. "I, too, will stay then."\n\nThe tired circle laughed. "Two circles on the ground. One too many for a Period, one too few for an Ellipsis. What will we be?"\n\n"We will be two circles waiting together." The circle's voice, hesitant at first, started to grow bold. "Perhaps someday we will be a Colon again; perhaps someday a third will join us and we will continue as an Ellipsis. But I do not intend to let us end. I do not intend for either of us to become a Period. If, that is -" The circle stopped, scared to say the next words. But it was necessary. "If you will allow me to stay by your side."\n\nFor long moments the other circle said nothing.\n\nThen it rolled over to the circle and touched it once, ever so slightly. And that was enough.\n\nI do not know what became of the two circles. I hope that they found their strength eventually and rolled onwards through time. I hope that they found new beauty to celebrate, new wonders to lighten their souls.\n\nBut hope is less than a shadow of a dream.

There isn't much else to say, go look at those screen shots and you'll agree.\nThe way the game behaves ruins the whole experience. From getting stuck in minecarts (to the point where you have to reset and play the same part over and over again just so you can perfect not getting stuck) to the world not resetting objects that have moved (such as objects not rotating the right way for you to pass from one to the other in order to finish the level). There are puzzles in the game where your character (I know its a colon) has to interact with buttons or switches to move objects around during which the camera is pulled back so you can see whats going on, but if you spend more than a minute or two on these sections the camera pulls back in and you can't see more than a character length or two around you making the puzzles nothing more than several minutes of you trying to guess what is happening.\nAnother issue I have is how you don't ever really feel in control of your character. In parts where you have to keep moving forward so you don't die you will struggle trying to keep control of your character and will start to notice that only one of the dots on your character is taking the lead while the other is only causing you problems.\nI was hoping for a lot more variety in the level design but this game ended up being a below average platformer in a gameplay sense.","June 28, 2014","false","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controlling your character is sluggish; the physics is clumsy; the camera is sometimes zoomed in so close, you have to decide whether to make a leap of faith or attempt to stop and wait; and there are too many instances where it's impossible to tell whether something can be traversed or is just background.\n\nOutside of actual gameplay, the game seemed utterly confused by my controller and couldn't consistently give me instructions for either gamepad or mouse and keyboard, but what's worse is that the menus wouldn't respond properly, either. It was easier just to use my mouse to get anything done, but then when trying to read through the typography lessons, mouse input was ignored, and I had to switch back to left analog to scroll as slow as humanly possible through text.\n\nOther issues: Clarendon. Everything about Clarendon.\n\nIf you're looking for a similar style of game, I would recommend you just go play NightSky instead.

The only time it really starts to be a problem is during a hard-as-nails "secret" level as you're pressured for time there. But outside of that, it is incredibly well-made, savepoints are abundant and some of the mechanics are really really well-made.\n\nLevels deliver not only some story, but also mood of the era, from bleak and depressive Gothic and heavenly renaissance Didot to hectic 20th century with Times and Helvetica. And you can guess what Comic Sans MS has for a level mood and structure...\n\nMany, many games arent even as good as this mechanically, let alone visually.

Each era is divided into 4 levels. In each era you can collect the letters A-Z (and Ampersand as hidden letter) of the historical font like the cuneiform script. The other collectables are 6 stars in each era which will unlock book pages of your current era your in, to read what the progress of typography and typesetting was in this epoch.\n\nPros:\n+ interesting game concept (Warp Door: "Typography was always this cool you just never realized it before.")\n+ amazing realization of the concept\n+ to each era through and through fitting soundtracks\n+ awesome sound ambience, each object/era/scene has it's own unique, clean and melodious sounds\n+ unique character fits to the unique concept, concept fits to the topic typography, soundtracks fits to the environment - in this game really everything fits together perfectly\n(+ yes, play it with headphone as the game will tell you always at its start, it's overwhelming!)\n(+ 4h of play time for 100% is short but it feels like much more)\n(+ steam achievements)\n\nI've plitted the cons into two sections, because there is one major problem and the rest are really knickknacks (complaining about first world problems).\n\nCons (main):\n- no demo\n- if somebody is making a game about typography and typesetting, he should concentrate in typesetting that it will be brilliant - but it isn't! In these few book pages you are able to read many mistakes in typesetting and spelling. It's forgivable, but shouldn't happen!\n:: Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4\n\nCons (knickknacks):\n- if you are dying and the death scene (fade to black) will be presented you are not able to pause the game or to get back into the menu (ESC key), sometimes the game will do something confused like restarting the level\n- sometimes (what ever this problem causes) you can't navigate in the menu and sometimes you are not able to enter the menu via the ESC key\n- the scene which will bring you back to life at a savepoint (fade in) doesn't pause the game, means: you will be inserted, the scene is still running and you can also control your character BUT you can't see anything\n- often after the respawn the level will not exactly reset to its default. It's feeling like the game sometimes saves the level at your death instead of having always a default scene of this certain savepoint\n- in the level 'Futura' the moveable objects (yellow triangles, ..) won't reset to their origin location if you respawn\n\nSuggestions:\n~ fix the translation/typesetting/display/misspelling problem, fix the little knickknacks, what mostly sounds like crosstalk of some variables, a timer problem with the menu and a maybe not consequent implemented respawn system and it will be a really really brilliant game.\n\nRecommended, even if it's not on sale, because it's a fantastic journey through the time of tyopgraphy colored in an amazing artwork and cased in an overwhelmingly convincing sound ambience.\n\n8.5/10","September 16, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you can see the game is heavily based on typography, something I've been hearing a lot about recently but never really sparked my interest. This game does a beautiful job of taking us through some of the most iconic and recognizable fonts throughout the course of written history. In a way, it also gives you a history lesson because many fonts developed in response to certain technological innovations or cultural moods of the time. The way it was done was very clever and from the very first level I was hooked.\n\nThat being said, the platforming in this game is some of the most frustrating I've ever played. It's not that long, I clocked in about 2 hours to complete, but by the end I was sick of it, and the only thing keeping me going was the fact that I just wanted to finish this game and be done with it.

Throughtout the game, you learn about such things as the emergence of the printing press and the birth of fonts. The art style and music are absolutely amazing, the intensity wrapping is perfect, and the levels are beautifully made.\n\nThe art style is refreshing, reminding me of Limbo. It's simple (black on a white background), yet elegant enough to captivate. In my opinion, the idea the having not just one, but 2 dots to play as adds more depth, as if one dies, the other does too. (It's almost like a romance.) The music is extremely atmospheric, giving this particular game a "feel" that most other games rarely do. It also fits in with the part of the chapter in which you're playing in (puzzle level - slower music than others). The music may even be the best part of the game. My regards to the developer.\n\nThe intensity wrapping (how the game gets harder the further one gets into it) is perfect. It's slow enough so that one can get the "hang" of it quite quickly, but fast enough so one doesn't get bored. The Gothic chapter, the first chapter after the tutorial, is an easy level, yet still hard enough to allow the player to learn what one can expect. On the other hand, the Times chapter, one of the last chapters, is hard enough to be frustrating, but by this point one who played through the material before that would've already gotten the "gist" of everything and the chapter would still be enjoyable. My only suggestion is to shorten the respawn splash screen. Enough said.\n\nLastly, the levels are extremely well designed. You have these puzzle levels which are difficult enough to make you scratch your head mixed in with these action-packed levels which require you to spam the spacebar (or to simply rely on pure luck). The variety of level design and such is also astounding, from the mine-carts and bullets of the Clarendon chapter, to the industrial grinding of gears in the Times, to the blood-red sky of the Helvetica. The hidden ampersands (&) are placed well enough to require one to explore, but exposed enough so one wouldn't spend 20 hours searching for one just to get an achievement.\n\nType:Rider has a bit of everything. Good story? You got it. Puzzles? It's got you covered. Guns? Hell, yeah.\n\nAnd hey, you just might learn something.","December 14, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Not that I’m complaining, though having sat through a five-hour game drilling fonts in my brain kind of makes me wish we had covered this to some extent.\n\nSTORY & GAMEPLAY\nFirst and foremost: The campaign is not story-driven.\n\nYou assume control over two colon circles as you play your way through the nine font styles, serving as chapters: Gothic, Garamond, Didot, Clarendon, Futura, Times, Helvetica, Pixel, Comic Sans MS. Chapters 1-8 break off into 4 sections. Chapter 9 is a single-section bonus chapter. In order to progress through the chapters you will need to collect letters of the alphabet for that particular font; including asterisks and ampersands scattered throughout each section. Collecting these characters will uncover facts about the history of typography from the age of Gothic font and Latin influences in the 11th century right up to Pixel font of our time. The game does an excellent job in teaching information relating to the origins of each font and additional information of interest. The array of sources used only becomes evident once you complete the game and sit through the credits.\n\nI pulled off just under 5 hours of game time, including going back and achievement hunting after completion. There isn’t much in terms of replay value. Once you complete the base campaign of 9 fonts that’s pretty much it. However, you can go back and replay missions and read through pages for that individual font at will.\n\nIn terms of controls I experienced no difficulties whatsoever: A to move left, D to move right, SPACE to jump and ESC to bring up the menu. The game will teach you additional controls to navigate through pages you’ve unlocked during the game. Several reviews on the store page complained of “awkward controls” and “slow game speed”. Neither of which I experienced during my playthrough.\n\nGRAPHICS / ART STYLE\nAlthough the art style may seem fairly simple, there is quite a bit of detail added to convey the era for individual fonts. Clarendon font takes on a Wild West approach - corresponding to its time of discovery - with the use of tumbleweed and a Salon. The Times font shows off a more industrial point in time with the use of construction poles, gears and machinery. You will occasional see typography related art-work being showcased in the background which further aids in understanding past methods, technology and era.\n\nAUDIO\nProgressing through the game not only changes the art style and era of typography discoveries, but also the music. I thought this was a really nice touch. All the tracks were satisfying.\n\nOVERALL\nQuite possibly one of the best educational videogames I’ve played. Learn as you play, play as you learn: A mutual relationship.\n\nPROS\n+Pick-up-and-play approach.\n+Progressive difficulty.\n+Excellent art style and soundtrack.\n+Plenty of information scattered throughout the game + wide range of sources used.\n\nCONS\n-Limited in terms of replay value, though not a major complaint on my part.","November 22, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You must navigate through a variety of worlds based on a different typographical fonts.  This game offers a bit of history on printing and fonts if you are interested in reading it, but it is more a passive history offering rather than a must for you to go through.  You are a colon, rather than a marble, and must not get disconnected from each other.  You must go through the platforming levels by collecting the alphabet, 6 asterisks and an ampersand.  There are four levels to each world and eight total worlds giving you a total of 32 levels to go through.\n\nIf you are quick, this game shouldn't take much longer than 2 hours, but if you want to obtain all achievements it will take a bit longer.

Because of the sound design and the unique visual representation of each level, I feel that this is an example of "video games as art". If you remove the sound and visuals, not to mention the educational content about the history of typography, what you have is a casual, sides-scrolling platformer with a short duration. Gameplay consists of navigating two dots (you play as a colon?) across levels that have hazards and simple puzzles themed based on different typographical fonts. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, there are some sections that can be repetitive and frustrating, but overall, I felt the physics of controlling the two dots to feel "right". If you are at all interested in the subject matter, you should definitely pick this game up when there's a good sale on it. Other gamers who are looking for a casual few hours of platforming need not apply.","June 25, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So rather than paying for the full price I waited for a discount and grabbed it then.\n\nI was right about my doubts but I think it's not a bad game. Levels are well executed in relation to each era of typography. Environment keeps changing in each era. In addition to that, considering that you have an interest in the history of the typography, its rewarding system gives you a summary about the events in the history.\n\nThe whole book thing could be designed better. Blocking the whole text creates big gaps in the text and makes it less appealing/readable. I wouldn't mind this in any other platformer but if you are making a game about typography, you should be careful about things related to it. Though information you achieve by collecting the asterisks is well arranged and original if not well designed.\n\nType:Rider is a platformer focusing on giving information and I think its faults like bad typography and terrible physics could be forgiven for that if you are a typography ♥♥♥♥♥. But considering its full price ($10) you can buy a better designed and more informative book about typography with that money.","March 1, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/recommended/258890/","bonnup","bonnup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/","264 products in account","The difference between common edutainment and Type:Rider is integration, and what a difference it is! This game offers fascinating information and easy fun. Not too difficult of a platformer, Type:Rider will make you learn, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nNtK Before Review:\nVideo games are educational by nature, a byproduct of introducing someone to a new universe. Level one in many games serves as the first lesson in a line of explicit interactive lectures which often extend to the final level of a game. And those games which don't explicitly teach its students how to play often demand players' innovation in learning to play. It would make sense then, gaming and learning being so closely related, that games would make excellent educational tools. The truth is, however, that most educational games a more boring than a dump being flushed. And many popular games are just as boring in their in-game "lectures" on how to play as the boring lecturing teachers whom we accuse of not connecting with the students who play these games. What's the problem here? Why do games educate incorrectly and educators incorrectly apply games? It all boils down to gamification. I know that's a loaded topic, but I'll describe the essence of it in brief: Somewhere along the line that we call time, someone else caught on to the fact that games were awesome. They wanted to bring the appeal and motivation that games offered to the real world, so they extracted the elements that they perceived to be the essence of playing a game and applied them to business, education, research, and many other domains. Some say it works and others say it doesn't, but that's not the point. It's stupid regardless. People enjoy collecting the coins in Mario because that's what Mario does. But if you were told to write an essay and then, upon completion, you see a blip of a coin with a retro sound effect on a screen, that is not a game. Because that's not what Mario does and, in that moment, you are not Mario. The content and the task are dissociated. Dissociation was the problem from the start when the elements of gaming were separated from the game. Now take this issue to edutainment. Edutainers take what a game would be and add unrelated tasks, like math problems or multiple-choice questions, and expect students to learn more from it. They make no effort to immerse the players (in fact, these games often acknowledge that the players are external and claim that the main character "needs their help to solve the problem!"), they follow the poor practices of game design that the "lecture-y" games have, and they make the game about things that the subject is not about.\n\nThe Bullet Dodged:\nNow these are the bad things that intentionally educational games tend to do. Type:Rider fantastically avoided such problems. It begins by telling me to move the colon (as a typeface character, not a large intestine. Also, the player is occasionally the first two dots of an ellipsis.) in a cave to navigate my way out using my thumbs (I played through the first time on a mobile platform). I see cave paintings, and I question the nature of my environment. There is a star nearby, so naturally I grab it and my questions are answered. A book zooms around the screen to reveal my environment are the pages of a book (makes sense why I'm a printed character now), and the page turns to inform me about cave paintings as communication and that the painting I saw was a real one. I am now rolling, on my page again, and I find myself struggling to make it up an incline. I find this incline to be triangularly shaped and an elongated pentagon hangs loosely-attached to the ceiling just beyond. I grab the asterisk at the top to learn that the background of crude carvings behind me were hieroglyphics, which make sense now because I was on a steep pyramid and the now-fallen pentagon actually resembles an obelisk, a monumental structure common to ancient Egypt. I'm not gonna blandly talk through the whole game, but the idea is that the content (learning about the "font" at the time and culture in which the pyramids were built) and the task (making it up a pyramid) were integrated. For the entirety of the game the environment is the subject material. My incentive to learn about the effects of the Catholic counter-reformation on printed works is that, immersed in the game, I am threatened by a firey stack of books, which also teaches me about history. Certainly, Type:Rider uses gamification in requiring the player to collect all the letters, ampersands, and asterisks, but recall that gamification isn't inherently evil, merely inherently dissociated. The incentivization is seamlessly integrated into the environment and content that collecting the items is part of the learning.\n\nThe Verd:\nThe art in this game is beautiful and reflective of the defining typefaces and printing machines of each era, and the music is subtly blended as well, so as to create some awestriking atmospheres. The only negatives to this game are suboptimal controls (uncoordinated at points, which is hard to ignore in the platforming genre) and the storyline is told in history, so I guess no insane plot twists (sorry ): ). There is a certain population that will refuse to find this good, and that's logical, just as not everyone will enjoy science class. Either way, the appeal or repulsion is caused by the scope of the content and not a lousy integration of otherwise crowd-pleasing content. An easily recommendable [7.5 / 10], Type:Rider is a surprisingly enjoyable roll through a side of history that tends toward banality under other presentation methods; it's an ideal model for what education-based learning should look like. This will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea, but I find it to be one darn great Earl Grey.","July 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So rather than paying for the full price I waited for a discount and grabbed it then.\n\nI was right about my doubts but I think it's not a bad game. Levels are well executed in relation to each era of typography. Environment keeps changing in each era. In addition to that, considering that you have an interest in the history of the typography, its rewarding system gives you a summary about the events in the history.\n\nThe whole book thing could be designed better. Blocking the whole text creates big gaps in the text and makes it less appealing/readable. I wouldn't mind this in any other platformer but if you are making a game about typography, you should be careful about things related to it. Though information you achieve by collecting the asterisks is well arranged and original if not well designed.\n\nType:Rider is a platformer focusing on giving information and I think its faults like bad typography and terrible physics could be forgiven for that if you are a typography ♥♥♥♥♥. But considering its full price ($10) you can buy a better designed and more informative book about typography with that money.","March 1, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeWelch/recommended/258890/","MikeWelch","ID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeWelch/","658 products in account","A beautiful and informative game about a fascinating subject? Well, technically, yes; it certainly is very pretty, and highly informative - not much of a game to be spoken of, though.\n\nOK, you'd have to be an idiot to look at the screenshots and expect complex gameplay mechanics - but the clumsy movement controls which underpin everything you do and the overwhelming simplicity of the minor puzzle elements leave this a good distance from being genuinely entertaining.\n\nBut, if it's beautiful and informative, is that enough in itself, despite not being entertaining? Well, to put it bluntly, no.\n\nAdmittedly, it would be difficult to relate the history of typography and printing without heavily depending on the player simply reading through pages and pages of information - but the way the information is gradually fed to the reader is desperately poor for 2 reasons.\n\nFirstly, the way in which these pages are unlocked. In each of the different themed zones, along your way to collect all the letters in the alphabet you will also come across 6 asterisk signs. When you collect one of these, you have about a second to hit the enter key - upon doing which, the game is paused and the new page presented. If you miss the tiny window of opportunity, you need to wait until you come to the next asterisk, and then read through 2 pages. So, if you're in the middle of a precarious situation (as will very often be the case) you feel forced to pause the game, knowing full well that when you return you will have to desperately wrangle to avoid tumbling to your doom and having to restart the level. Does enter have any other function throughout the game? No. But it's inexplicably disabled outside of this tiny window, so you can't roll on to a safe location before you stop to read the text. Of course, you could just unlock all of the pages and read them from the main menu afterwards - but the connection between the interesting information and the threadbare game is already so weak, to completely seperate the two begs the question why you're bothering to play in the first place.\n\nAnd then, the second problem with the way the information is presented - and the absolute killer blow. The frequent clumsy translations and outright mistakes in grammar and punctuation are unforgivable. I got through about 30 pages, and nigh-on all of them included at least one error. I recognise that the developers don't speak English as a first language - but to release a product that expects players to read through several dozen pages of text, and not have a competent native proofreader go through it is ridiculous.\n\nIf you think this game might be for you, I'd urge you to reconsider. Get one of the many excellent comparable indie games such as NightSky, and pause it every 30 seconds to read a few lines from Wikipedia articles on typography. The game will be infinitely better, and the articles not so jarringly crammed with obvious errors.","June 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because of the sound design and the unique visual representation of each level, I feel that this is an example of "video games as art". If you remove the sound and visuals, not to mention the educational content about the history of typography, what you have is a casual, sides-scrolling platformer with a short duration. Gameplay consists of navigating two dots (you play as a colon?) across levels that have hazards and simple puzzles themed based on different typographical fonts. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, there are some sections that can be repetitive and frustrating, but overall, I felt the physics of controlling the two dots to feel "right". If you are at all interested in the subject matter, you should definitely pick this game up when there's a good sale on it. Other gamers who are looking for a casual few hours of platforming need not apply.","June 25, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, it sounds boring on the surface, but if you give it a chance, it really ends up impressing.\n\nYou play a colon (not the body part) that can roll around sideways or flip around. You have to navigate through various levels, which are separated typically into 4 parts each. The whole level is focused on a particular font and timeline, ranging back from the beginning of time, to the most recent fonts. You collect letters as you explore, from A to Z in order. Also strewn across the maps are asterisks - each one presents a 'page' of a book that introduces a couple of paragraphs of interesting information. You don't have to read them, but for a game of this nature, it would make sense to spend the time learning a little about the fonts of which you are reading at this very moment. I'm no history buff myself, but I definitely got some neat information out of it.\n\nOn top of the learning experience lies a robust and intricate platforming game. As you travel onwards, collecting letters and asterisks is fairly straightforward, but there are also some ampersands lying around that are somewhat hidden. Nothing too elaborate, but enough to make you pay attention to the levels. That said, the level design for each timeline is very well done - lots of various jumps and platforming mechanics abound. Some may say that the controls aren't that tight, and that is true - at times it can be frustrating; I found a few moments where the colon just didn't want to make it over a ledge or out of the way of something - but I have played much worse. For a game that charges less than a typical meal, its nothing to really complain about. The music in this game is also pleasant and fits the tone of each timeline.\n\nThe game features a few achievements, most of which are standard fare, but one of them is downright evil ('Desperado'). It will make you work for it, but the relief afterwards is worth it. Surprisingly enough, this game comes with trading cards, so if you like those, then that's a big plus. Overall, the game took me a little over 3.5 hours to finish - but that was with getting every single achievement, and I did skim the history pages a little.

As platformers go, this one is extremely easy. As a work of interactive visual art, it is gorgeous (as befits a game about typography). As an educational presentation, it presents the history of several significant fonts, as well as a condensed history of typesetting in general.\n\nFor each font, there is a set of levels as well as a book explaining its origins and historical significance. Scattered across the levels are collectibles which each unlock one page of the history book. While you are given the opportunity to read a page immediately after unlocking it, all of the reading material is entirely optional.\n\nIf you play the game as intended, your time is spent alternating between gameplay and reading. Aside from teaching you a history of typography, the pages also provide context which clarifies the meaning behind the various objects and images that form the in-game terrain and backdrop.\n\nPersonally, I think the educational aspect could have been improved by using voiceovers during gameplay to present the information from the pages. Using voiceovers would avoid breaking the immersion of the platforming gameplay, while still allowing the player to review the information later via the pages if s/he so desired. (Therein lies the idea for a Let's Play or longplay video...)\n\nOverall, while I wouldn't call this a "gamer's" game, it is still an enjoyable experience, especially for the amateur typography enthusiast.","March 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its gameplay is that of the standard platformer with elements of a lecture/slideshow's worth of information about the history of typography (or fonts). Aesthetically the game is polished, smooth frames and no visible hiccups visually. Environments are enjoyable to look at and nothing feels trully bland. As far as soundtracks go, it would certainly behoove anyone to play this game with ear-phones as the intro recommends.\n\nHOWEVER: as the game progesses one may find the (literal) character design choice of a colon irksome, primarily for the disagreement such an avatar has with the game's layouts. Having the additional half of your character makes for awkward jumps, unpredictable physics and unintended demises. The last to levels are a testament to this flaw as the game expects you to traverse platforms smaller than your character, while being waylaid by hazards.\n\nTL;DR= Type: Rider starts with lovely intentions but may leave the gamer with frustrations in its last half hour due to goofy platforming synergy with your character.","April 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an educational platformer from the European television network ARTE. In the game you play as a pair of dots, traversing levels that tell the history of type fonts, starting with the earliest forms of written human expression in cave paintings and ending with internet memes. That's quite a lot of ground to cover and Type:Rider does it elegantly, with each level showing you the art and sounds of the culture creating each font and providing you with encyclopedic texts of the font's history. Type:Rider often feels like a virtual museum of sorts and I am sure that anyone interested in type fonts or history will get a lot of enjoyment out of this aspect.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the actual gameplay to be quite lacking. Controlling the two dots together doesn't work great, as one dot sort of drags behind the other one. Jumps and momentum just didn't feel right and the game as a whole felt very floaty. Luckily, there is no real punishment for death, as you just respawn to right before you died. There are some basic switch and timer puzzles in some of the levels and I found these to be a lot more fun than the platforming. Other than that, there isn't much to do. Levels are fairly straightforward. There is an aspect of collecting where you can find all the characters of a font in each level but it ultimately doesn't serve a purpose besides padding out the game. The whole experience only lasted us a little over 2 hours and it's definitely a case of style over substance.","March 31","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The most ironic one is that my French AZERTY keyboard isn't properly recognized, rendering me unable to use my dear ZQSD (equivalent of QWERTY's WASD) for direction and use arrow keys instead — why isn't there an option to modify key bindings? The visual quality isn't as good as I thought and a lot of game elements look more or less blurry or degraded, but maybe this is because my screen native resolution (1680x1050) isn't supported; the game only allows pretty low resolutions, going as low as 640x480 (!) and with no full HD option, which given the release date, is quite surprising. Finally, the fact that there's no V-Sync is quite sad, as it makes the scrolling (especially horizontal) often look stuttery and twitchy.\n\nIt's still a good game, though. The gameplay is impeccable (it reminds me a lot of an old shareware game I loved where you played a dirtbike, and also the famous game Line Rider), the difficulty is well adjusted and perfectly progressive, and the fact that you learn while having fun — one of the many things that everyone hated as a kid but loves as an adult — is enjoyable, and the fact that itis optional makes it even better. The music feels cheap but still adds to the atmosphere, especially when you turn it low. The visuals are very cool.\n\nOne warning for future players: the sounds, although quite good, are INCREDIBLY LOUD. The first thing you want to do before starting the game is turning the volume down! My ears are still ringing...\n\nNot perfect but original and pretty fun, 6,5/10.","April 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Straight up frustrate you.  At first it's no big deal, and seems rather simple in the first levels.  Sort of ho hum even.  Then it gets a little harder toward the last few levels and I kept complaining about the controls.  After some time I realized it was not *really* the controls.  It's the fact that it's a rolling object.  Certain physics come into play such as driving a car in a GTA game - it's sorta hard to control things.  You have to take acceleration and corners into account quite a lot.  By the last levels you are not really playing the level so much as fighting the controls and practicing them over and over.  It's got a forgiving checkpoint system, but it seriously sucks the fun out of the game when you realize the levels are only testing how well you can adapt to the wonky controls of a rolling object.  Art is awesome, visually stunning yes.  Informational as well.  I learned quite a bit about typography.  But, I usually prefer my games to have challenging levels with tight controls and this may be the opposite for a lot of people.  I begrudingly give it a thumbs up, only because I wanted to enjoy the game more instead of being frustrated.  I can't in all honesty give it a thumbs down because I enjoyed the style, art, and concept which is a good chunk of why I play games in the first place.

None of the letters or ampersands glitched, and I had no problem moving my dots character to the left as well as to the right.

I had little difficulty understanding the game story and in my opinion everything was connected in a extremely smart fashion, but I do realize that people without "education" towards typography/printing history might not link the things as I do;\n\nNow, to claim "historical" as a tag to describe the game, a little bit more of in-game action, other than reading the chapters about each Type, would also be requiered.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSimple commands are okay, but sadly, very simple and short levels.

Adding a little extra of content to each level and making it a little bit more challenging / long would be a perfect modification to the game!\n\nTHE SOUND:\nIt is okay.\n\nMy overhall thinking is that the game could:\na) have a major update;\nb) have a TYPE:RIDER 2 to prove everyone how talented the devs are really ;)\n\nCheers","July 2, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dynamic and diverse SOUNDTRACK also greatly contributes to the game's atmosphere and perfectly matches each historical period you get to explore.\n\nGAMEPLAY-wise it's nothing ground-breaking, but what's there is reasonably well done. There's a good variety within the levels, and platforming frequently trades places with simple puzzles, timing minigames or action sequences. However I do wish there was a bit more of the latter, as most of the game is slower-paced and encourages careful advance, while fast action is somewhat of a rarity.\n\nCONTROLS AND CHARACTER PHYSICS have a pleasant amount of weight and momentum, although it was condemned by some as "slow and unresponsive". Your jumps are always perpendicular to the surface you're on (think games like Trials Evolution or Elastomania) which allows for some fun tricks and jumps. Sadly, the level design didn't seem to adapt to character physics too well, so their potential is mostly wasted. Occasionally the game throws you segments that require more precision than your character can muster, making the completion of such segments more a matter of luck than skill. Thankfully, the game is very generous with checkpoints so getting past the problematic bits is easy enough.\n\nMy biggest complaint, perhaps, is the EDUCATIONAL ASPECT of the game. All the historic info is something you collect throughout the levels and access by pausing the game. Whenever I found a new piece of text - I always stopped to read it because I wanted to better understand the level's context, but I absolutely hated how having to do it through a menu completely interrupted the flow of the game and had me sitting in some boring screen with a wall of text.\nI feel the presentation of texts would've been much much better if they were done in shorter paragraphs with easy-to-understand diagrams placed in level backgrounds, accompanied by illustrations which are already there.\nI also found some texts to be rather difficult to understand due to many unfamiliar words and terms taken straight from history lessons which I've long forgotten. I feel the writers could've done a better job breaking down the educational material into something less overwhelming.","December 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Each chapter offers a new twist with a new mechanic, and it will take all of your platforming skills to get through them. Because let me tell you, this game is hard. Maybe it's just me, but I found Type:Rider to be extremely difficult. Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure this was all intentional. The nature of your character, so to speak, means it's very easy to get hung up on corners and serifs. Have fun with the Pixel chapter. Jumping is also infuriating at times because of the wall-jump mechanic that's perhaps just a bit too touchy. And yet despite my rage I had fun playing this. Here's the thing. I love typography. I had fun scrambling across fonts, and I had fun learning the history of font. It's certainly not a game for everyone, but if this sounds like the kind of experience you'd enjoy then I definitely recommend this.","December 14, 2013","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Each level covers an epoch in written language, and the visuals and music come together gorgeously to convey the feeling of the era.\n\nUnfortunately, the game-ification of it all feels tacked on. Type:Rider would be better served without fatal platforming sections, traps, and 'puzzles' that are less about solving them than about making mechanics work correctly. Is it fair to expect players to weave through a deadly field of Tetris blocks when your jumping physics don't seem to have predictable, repeatable results? You can convey the excitement of the Helvetica level's ski-jump aesthetic without making players dodge icicles with a pair of dots subject to a bizarre, fickle sense of gravity.\n\nIt's also a shame that a game that is necessarily as much about publishing as it is about typography does so poorly in laying out its encyclopedia entries, missing the odd punctuation or word here and there and lacking any fine tuning in the letter kerning, leading to ugly spread-out lines to meet the full-justify layout.\n\nSo it's not perfect. But you'll learn something and be really impressed by the design work. Art and publishing nerds should definitely give it a go.","September 19, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Dynamic and diverse SOUNDTRACK also greatly contributes to the game's atmosphere and perfectly matches each historical period you get to explore.\n\nGAMEPLAY-wise it's nothing ground-breaking, but what's there is reasonably well done. There's a good variety within the levels, and platforming frequently trades places with simple puzzles, timing minigames or action sequences. However I do wish there was a bit more of the latter, as most of the game is slower-paced and encourages careful advance, while fast action is somewhat of a rarity.\n\nCONTROLS AND CHARACTER PHYSICS have a pleasant amount of weight and momentum, although it was condemned by some as "slow and unresponsive". Your jumps are always perpendicular to the surface you're on (think games like Trials Evolution or Elastomania) which allows for some fun tricks and jumps. Sadly, the level design didn't seem to adapt to character physics too well, so their potential is mostly wasted. Occasionally the game throws you segments that require more precision than your character can muster, making the completion of such segments more a matter of luck than skill. Thankfully, the game is very generous with checkpoints so getting past the problematic bits is easy enough.\n\nMy biggest complaint, perhaps, is the EDUCATIONAL ASPECT of the game. All the historic info is something you collect throughout the levels and access by pausing the game. Whenever I found a new piece of text - I always stopped to read it because I wanted to better understand the level's context, but I absolutely hated how having to do it through a menu completely interrupted the flow of the game and had me sitting in some boring screen with a wall of text.\nI feel the presentation of texts would've been much much better if they were done in shorter paragraphs with easy-to-understand diagrams placed in level backgrounds, accompanied by illustrations which are already there.\nI also found some texts to be rather difficult to understand due to many unfamiliar words and terms taken straight from history lessons which I've long forgotten. I feel the writers could've done a better job breaking down the educational material into something less overwhelming.","December 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

And you can read it whenever you feel like, even skip it entirely if you want. It's pretty mellow like that, but I think it's engaging just enough with the challenge factor while still managing to be a pretty relaxing experience. It's a pretty short game if you're just looking to blast through the levels, but I got some extra time and enjoyment out of it by reading all the material as I went along and collecting everything. Finding all the ampersands should prove to be a particular challenge, since there is one per level and they are quite hidden.\n\nI am proud to say that I like this game enough to have gotten every achievement, including that dumb Facebook/Twitter post one. I don't even have Facebook or Twitter, so this sort of achievement is dumb and irritating to me. But hey, I just borrowed my sister's account to get it. I still really like the game, but this sort of thing annoys me. A video game's achievements should never have anyhting to do with external social networking sites. This is nothing significant in terms of the game, but it's something that stuck out for me and I though it was worth mentioning, since I know there are others like me who aren't really into Facebook or Twitter, even if we may seem few and far between. We anti-Facebook people gotta stick together, y'all! We should totally make a Facebook page for our kind.\n\nAnyway, this being a game about ♥♥♥♥ing fonts, it's a very niche sort of game. But I happen to really like font, so this game appeals to me, that very specific sort of person who enjoys graphic design and history and delicious, glorious fonts. Gameplay-wise, it's nothing new or groundbreaking; it's a very simple platformer and there isn't much to it. But, again, if you like art, history, or art history, this is a fun (and educational!) trip. And I commend any game that can be fun AND educational, and also be centered around something as esoteric as fonts.","May 18, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/recommended/258890/","Futurato","Futura&!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/","610 products in account","Type:Rider is a beautiful game about the history of typography. It is obvious that much love and care was put into its visual aesthetic. Each level is a collage-like smattering of gigantic letters, mixed in with the imagery and visual artistry that we associate with that era in history. For instance, the Clarendon level explores the evolution of slab serifs in the 19th century, throwing you into the Wild West among mine carts, wanted posters, and a bounty hunter’s roving crosshair, out to end you. The Futura level explores the “function over form” design of the Bauhaus School and the experimental typography of many modernist movements, littering the level with the colorful deconstructivist shapes of Malevich and Arp. The music and sounds of each level are also lovingly composed on top of that. There’s a great deal of visual and auditory pleasures to enjoy while playing this game; it’s just too bad that playing it for the gameplay is an experience that starts with disappointment and ends with frustration.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of type, your player character is a colon (:) that rolls and bounces about each level to collect the 26 letters of each font’s alphabet and asterisks which unlock different facts in that level’s book. It’s a creative idea and the colon was probably the best choice of punctuation mark around which to design.\n\nDespite the strength of the idea, the bottom falls out of the entire execution very quickly. Sometimes you will just not roll fast enough, weighed down by being awkwardly long and flat. Jumping can be a nightmare as the colon’s physics can seem random and capricious, causing you to restart certain sections over and over again because it decided to bounce this way instead of that way or jumped from the wrong end, sending you backwards into a hazard.\n\nThe levels seem to have been designed and tested with a placeholder player character instead of this unwieldy one. Sometimes you are expected to land flat on the dot of a giant “i,” but the square is simply not long enough to hold you, dropping you to your death over and over until you land it just right. Some of the more challenging sections in the game involve passing moving hazards in a rhythm – certainly possible for a character that takes up a square hitbox, but infuriatingly difficult with the character you have. Neat level design such as rogue pixels in the Pixel section or the smashing pistons of the Times section are regrettably remembered as design flaws because of this shortcoming. The game consistently presents you with a nice amount of “game” for what is basically an edutainment title, only to immediately give you too much “game” and ruining the flow of something that should have been enjoyable and relaxing.\n\nIt’s also disappointingly evident that the game half and the educational half were worked on by two different teams. I’ve already mentioned the easily recognized love and care in the visual design. However, the facts you pick up about each historical era of typography read, at best, as lazy rehashes of a Wikipedia article. The worst are the entries that just throw a bunch of names and dates at you without truly looking at the importance and influence of those people and events. There’s a distinct lack of discussion about the design benefits of each font. Typos are almost ubiquitous and most are glaringly obvious. Did no one proofread this?\n\nType:Rider is such a beautiful game to look at and listen to; it’s a shame that I can’t honestly recommend it since all that looking and listening would have to happen while attempting to play it. The game design is not lacking in interesting ideas, but they could have been less lazy in testing them. The first line you see in the credits sequence tells you that the game was created by Cosmografik, with their company name kerned incorrectly. Surely there was room to try harder.","April 6, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now, if that doesn't interest you, so be it. But if it does, everything about this game is wonderfully crafted.\n\nType:Rider is beautiful, historically appropriate, and surprisingly challenging at times. Maybe all three aren't so important to you but surely one of them is. The levels are very well designed, both in layout and aesthetics. Because you control two spheres as opposed to one you have to get used to that odd dynamic (this can be difficult and frustrating at times though). The game teaches you about each type and related typography facts--but not forcefully; you can skip that altogether if you're not interested. And some levels are just plain hard. Clarendon (if going for the achievement) is one. Pixel is definitely another. (The secret level Comic Sans is also a little tricky.)\n\nIs it worth the full price? For me, yes. But for many, I would suggest to wait for a sale. If you enjoy the game Nightsky, I'd say it's worth it. Also, if you want to play the hilarious Comic Sans level at the end: worth it.","January 25, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The level design in some places is like a gift to any student of art or design (the constructivist inspired sub-level in particular blew me away), but even if you're just an amateur designer with little training, you will get some crucial tips here about the kind of fonts that are most appropriate for your work.\n\nUnfortunately, I have decided to reluctantly recommend the game because of a few problems towards the end.  For the most part, it seems like a relaxing, educational platformer for those who want a bit of fun while learning about something that interests them.  But on the last ("Pixel") level, the difficulty spike is insane.  Some of the pixel-precise movements required to progress can get absolutely infuriating, and those in it for the learning are likely to give up at this point... which is a shame because it would be like getting to the end of a book only to find the last few pages missing.\n\nSo yeah...  if you're a gamer with an interest in design, I say: Get it. If however you're not much of a gamer and only had your interest piqued in Type:Rider due to hype in graphic design circles, I say: Be cautious. If you don't have much experience with platformers, you may feel compelled to chuck your computer through the window towards the end.","March 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Collecting asterisks (*) in the levels reveals a different page on font history from the Stone Age to modern computer fonts (as well as a bonus level for Comic Sans).  The gameplay itself is a platformer, devoid of enemies (save an off-screen gun trying to kill you in Clarendon), but having you navigate platforms and hazards.  Each level is based on a font, and has a distinctive style like a water level for Garamond, an artsy theme for Futura, and 1920s for Times New Roman.  It's not for everyone, as some wouldn't be interested in the history of fonts, but I got it because I began to notice things I took for granted growing up (namely Helvetica, and on that, see the documentary of the same name).

How more boring can you get? Plus it's an android game so it's probably crap." But while some might find Type:Rider boring I certainly found it entertaining.\n\nType:Rider is a 2D puzzle-platformer, where you travel through the history of typography. You play as a colon, and believe me that's not as discusting as it sounds, rolling through different puzzles, in the form of different styles of lettering. Along the way you'll come across different locations with icons that will tell you the history behind the font the puzzle stage is made up of, which you can choose to read or not. It sort of felt l was playing through a museum exibit about fonts. And while that may sound boring to some, I learned a lot of interesting things about the history of typography that I didn't know before, and I still had fun with the game.\n\nOne other thing I really liked about Type:Rider is the style of it. Being that it's about the different types of fonts it should have a sense of style to it. The way I could describe the look of this game is, imagine an idea for a PIXAR short film got mixed with Limbo with just a dash of Element4l mechanics. I just found myself getting really sucked into the game, the great soundtrack especially helps.\n\nOne downside of Type:Rider is that I was expecting the puzzles to be a little harder. I mean most of them are still challenging, but the only rediculously hard level was the secret one you get at the end of the game. I have to admit I was a little disappointed in that regard.\n\nOverall I liked Type:Rider. Even though it has it's downsides I thought it was a really creative and original idea, and they executed it well. If you'd like to learn something new, or like puzzle platformers, you'll probably like this game. If you're just looking for a puzzle platformer that's a bit more challenging like Limbo you might be disappointed and want to give it a pass.","January 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, this accommodates players seeking a casual experience.\n- Giving the player access to the encyclopaedia slows the pace of game for those inclined to read (though, you can just choose to read later).\n- The game shamelessly advertises itself and satisfies those that share their every activity by allowing players to tweet and post their accomplishments on Facebook.\n\nPersonal Opinion: Indifferent - The game's informative but the gameplay itself wasn't fun or engaging.","May 28, 2014","false","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

These history pages provide a reward of sorts, and I personally found them very interesting, but many people will skip them as they can be lengthy and are very dry. Unfortunately for me, I found the writing to be quite poor in many of these pages (especially the tutorial), with errors in layout and grammar scattered throughout. Given the topic of the game, this was a very big negative for me.\n\nThe music is calm and quite lovely, and the graphics are exceptional. Levels look, by and large, simple, and are made up of parts of font glyphs and other thematic elements, but some of them are actually quite tricky.\n\nOverall I do recommend Type: Rider, but it is a bit of a weird mix. The puzzle component of the levels seems to mix quite well with the literary and somewhat intellectual topic, but this doesn't quite gel with the dexterity required to collect some of the letters in the more platform-ish parts. The game is mellow, but frustrating at the same time.\n\nI plan to keep playing to completion, but I may rage quit a few times before then.\n","July 31, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Working as designer, juggling with "type" all day I thoroughly enjoyed the aesthetics of the game, it's just beautiful to look at and feels very "print design" with its vector shapes creating abstract fontscapes. The levels themselves each represent a font and to an extent an era in typography from medieval times up to the age of the internet - it is all very well realized and adds variety to the somewhat limited gameplay of, well, jumping on fonts & characters. The sound-design keeps up with the splendid visuals and adds even more layers of atmosphere to the experience, using appropriate music fitting the timeframe in which each typeface was created.\n\nAs much as it is nice to look at, I can't exactly say that it is all that nice to play - being a bit of physics platformer means that you need to build momentum to overcome larger obstacles or make certain jumps. The problem is, you avatar in Fontworld is a colon and for some reason it feels weird (not that I would know how a colon jumping on letters would feel done right ;)) since you can rotate while in midair and it's not always producing the results you would expect when you land and maybe have to do a second jump. It is a bit finnicky to say the least - especially if you break the flow and loose momentum as you hit an area in the wrong angle - it becomes next to impossible to do a lot of the harder jump-sections when you are off to a bad start like that and not to mention the super-secret bonus level where the controls become downright frustrating. That said, the game is, for the most part, hardly challenging or complex.\n\nAs education, the game more or less fails as far as I am concerned. Levels do represent certain ideas, devices and themes of each era but if you want to know anything substantial about them - you gotta read some slow-scrolling bookpages that you collect along the way. It's like, the educational stuff is completely shut off from the actual game and tucked safely away - I am pretty sure there could have been better ways to integrate some of the facts into the levels itself, the actual implementation is a bit of a disappointment.\n\nAll in all, I do recommend it based on the beautiful presentation, it is quite unique in that regard and that made it worthwhile for me. However, if you more interested in gameplay, challenge or maybe even the education-aspect you are better off with one of the many other platformers available on Steam or should just get a book on Typography. Right now, Type:Rider is lacking in these areas.","December 29, 2013","true","3.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/258890/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Type:Rider looks genuinely interesting and it had my attention back when it launched on iOS.\nUnfortunately, after having completed it, I'm afraid it fails on its two major goals: being a good game, and being a different learning experience.\n\nType:Rider is a simple platformer based around Typography. Every level is crafted from different letters (all themed according to a certain era and associated fonts).\n\nYou play as ' : ', and traverse several different time periods, learning a little bit about each one.\n\nFirst off, presentation. As you can probably see from the screenshots, the game looks unique, and there's no argument there. Despite having a very simplistic foreground, each background gives the levels a very distinct feel, and often fit the font and time period. If nothing else, the game was a treat to look at.\n\nThe music was pretty great as well, mostly fitting the rest of the levels. One big issue though, is that whenever I alt-tabbed, the music stopped (even after getting back to the game). Well, I alt-tab a lot. And that quickly became a big problem, as I was playing mostly with no music. It would be nice to see that fixed.\nNonetheless, from what I've heard, the music was great!\n\nNo complaints so far. Still regarding presentation, I must say that the interface was awful. This was an almost straight port from iOS, with big icons and way more navigation than it needed. Besides, the settings tab was almost hidden and while limited it had enough for the game it is (separate audio sliders and resolution options for the most part).\n\n\nNow that I'm done with presentation, let's see why Type:Rider fails as a game.\n\nThis game is for all purposes, a platformer. And you play as ' : '. Despite looking cool, thematically, and working well, it's still a very clunky way of doing a platformer, and it makes it very easy to get stuck in a corner between the two dots. BUT, since the game is about typography, I'll let that one go.\n\nThe game starts of waaay too easy and slow. Every level seemed just like going in a straightline, jumping above a ponctual hole. Despite getting much better as the player progresses, it's still a game that hardly provides any real challenge. It's literally a walk in the park. You're walking around looking at the backgrounds, and collecting extras (I'll get to those in a minute).\nIt's really cool that the levels are made of letters, and it contributes for the whole theme of the game, but overall, there could be anything in place of those letters, as they're simply patformers for the player to walk on.\n\nIn each level there are 3 things to collect. Letters (from a to z), another special character (&), and *.\nThe letters are acquired naturaly throughout the levels, requiring no additional action from the player. The special  character is the hidden collectible in the game, with 1 present in each level (each with 5 stages).\nBoth of these "extras" provide absolutely nothing aside from achievements and an "Aa" badge in-game. I don't even know why they're there. The only thing requiring a bit of exploration to find (and it's very little, to be honest) is the &, and even that provides you with nothing. I've only missed 1 on my playthrough, and I easily found it on my second try through the level.\n\nThen, there are  *. Each of these is also in plain sight, but they offer a page of information about the font and time period of the level. These are way cooler. I understand that they're supposed to be found by the player, but all of this makes the  levels way too linear, with no real challenge in them.\nThere are some environmental hazards and tricky jumps in later levels, but even these barely feel a part of the theme, and the challenge they provide is questionable.\n\nThe main challenge in the game is controlling the at-times infuriating ' : '.\n\nSo, as a game, this is just a very bland platformer, clearly designed for iOS with very short and easy levels, plus a transvesti of exploration in the form of collectible achievements.\n\n\nNow, the way more interesting part of the game and why it made me play it. The theme and learning experience.\n\nTypography. That's a weird theme that they chose, isn't it? And yet, it's a very visual one, making a game the ideal medium for it to be taught on.\nWell, unfortunately, Type:Rider fails as making the game itself a learning experience. Despite the levels being very unique, thematically and feeling coherent with the theme and era, they provide little to no information.\nSimply playing the game naturally will teach very little, leaving only a vague idea of the particular font's origin and timeline.\nSure, there are a couple of pictures of the style and machinery used in the background, but it's not very substancial overall.\n\nThe way they tried to make it a teaching experience, was through collectible pages. The big problem here is, after you've collected them, you'll need to pause the game to read them. And that's pretty much it. It's almost like "Hey, you've collected this *! Here, have a wikipedia article you can read! Learning in-game is fun!". Well, no, it's not. It's just like reading a wikipedia article with the advantage of having the information a bit more streamlined.\nAnd that's not the point of educational games! Not at all. The mechanics are supposed to be the learning vehicle itself, complemented by its aesthetic. Not just making a pretty game with pages of text forced into it.\n\nMaybe the point of it wasn't to be the teacher itself, but to simply plant the seed of interest. Make the player interested in typography, and then tell him to go do his own research. Then again, this is not the way to do it, in my opinion.\nI didn't become interested in typography by playing the game. I was interested in the game because it had some apparent innovation.\n\n\nMy conclusion regarding this. I think Type:Rider has an awesome concept, that I absolutely share and support. But, I think it missed its target in many core areas. The game itself felt very separated from the learning experience (visuals and music are  not enough).\nI like the idea, and I do not regret having tried it, but I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they were interested in it as a concept as well. And if that's the case, go ahead.\n\nThere's a huge gap between gameplay and information. If you're looking for a great game, pass this one up. If you're looking for a completely different and innovative experience... not quite what you're looking for.\nIt was fairly interesting, sure! And it did give me some curiosity about the subject. But I don't think this is quite what they were aiming for, and it will not appeal to the majority of people.\nCool first try, but it needs much more until it becomes something truly good.\n\n-Great  visuals.\n-Great  music.\n-Great concept.\n-Generic  level design.\n-Bad  port.\n-Clunky  controls.\n-Interesting experience, but an overall a missed oportunity.","April 8, 2014","false","4.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You play as 2 dots and travel through the 10 short levels, each level featuring a different era of fonts. It starts with the rock painting from prehistoric times going all the way to pixel art of the 2000′s. Players solve the puzzles of each level by traveling through fonts and letters of the particular time period, but there are only 10 levels plus a bonus level. It took me 3 hours in total to solve every level, but the bonus level which is incredibly difficult but also fun, took roughly 45 minutes. Each level has its own theme to go with that era of typography. The developers of this game did a fantastic job of putting these levels together; The sounds, music, photos, and the structures of the levels themselves are stunning.\n\nRead my full review here: http://realgamernewz.com/25104/type-rider-review-2","January 10, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Gameplay isn't particularly challenging so if you're looking for some hardcore platforming, look elsewhere. Having said that, for trophy hunters and completionists, you may have to open your eyes wider and explore the surroundings to get all the collectibles.\n\nThe selling point here is the experience and level design. Like I said above, the gameplay isn't challenging but some of the puzzles and mechanics involved in the level design are indeed very cleverly done. Even if you do not bother reading through the collectibles you find, you still feel like you learned something. Great visuals and music as well which mirror the setting and era of each type face.\n\nI managed to 100% the game in around 4 hours without consulting any guides, so yeah, it's not on the long side, but more importantly it doesn't overstay its welcome.

At least, if you hadn't beaten it (that's the one that made me rage quit, and I had to watch the credits again before I could make another attempt.)\n\nIn Clarendon, the crosshairs don't even line up with you, and in general, there are things that kill you when you're not even touching them.\n\nOn the other hand, being two dots, there are some interesting ways to use the physics between the two. The puzzles are interesting, if not terribly difficult, though give a nice break from being chased by a laser shooting cat.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for the game, and you should be reasonably prepared for the mechanical issues that it has, but it's still worth a single playthrough.

I would give this game a positive review if it wasn't for the poor jumping mechanics, and that's not something you want to hear in a platformer. The first half starts off really well, then the difficulty starts to ramp up and that's when you notice the mechanical flaws. It gets to the point where you need near perfect precision in the later levels to even make it to the next checkpoint.\n\nThere's also some bugs. I ran into one where I had to restart the level section because I couldn't escape or kill myself. I also hit the menu button too early right as I was dying to cause the menu button to stop functioning completely until I Ctrl+Alt+Del out of the game and restarted. The "Clarendon" 2nd level section sometimes has issues with the red-dot continuing to follow you throughout the rest of the level, but sometimes it only shows up once and never appears again after it fires the first shot. Lots of inconsistences like this makes you wonder what was actually intended in certain parts of the game.\n\nThe options are very limited, with no 1080p (max is 900) resolution supported. You can change the volume and there's three generic graphic settings on top of the resolution settings. Nothing else, like changing the controls, is included.\n\nI can only recommend this if it goes on sale for less than $3 because it's so short. I completed (100%) the entire thing in 3.4 hrs.\n\nI give this a 4/10 in its current state.","January 23, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good game, but not a great one.\n\nThe concept certainly looks promising: you guide a colon (punctuation mark) throughout the history of the written language. In that aspect, the trailers and pictures don't lie: you get what you see. The game looks artistic, educational and has some puzzles to solve. It has some soothing music to go with it, and aside from some minor quirks (like accidentally minimalising the game to go to twitter, or noticeable framerate drops in the seventies environment) I had no issues. Perhaps the unsmooth gameplay got fixed? :-\\n\nThere is another possibility, though. This game has much in common with 130, element4l and (especially) nightsky. Learning how to properly guide your character from point A to B is what over 90% of the gameplay is about. You shouldn't expect to master it from the start.\n\nThe game's main problem is in pacing. Both the backstory and the gameplay, for that matter. At first, I thought this was going to be an ultra-short game, as the tutorial guides you from cave paintings up to the Latin alphabet. The actual levels have a backdrop that starts with the creating of the press. And while that was certainly a revolution in printing, I feel like we're missing variety. Rather than have entire 'worlds' revolving about mere fonts, I would've liked it better if the Chinese or Egyptian alphabet got more than a breeze through them. There are also texts to collect about different events regarding the history of print. But these texts are barely (if at all) connected to the level, and to be honest: rather boring. And for a game that's mostly about fonts, I thought it was odd that these stories weren't even printed in the font they were about.\n\nThe gameplay pacing is less obscure. It follows the standard routine of starting with simple levels and gradually increasing the difficulty. Except the 'gradually' has some sharp edges. At a few points, collecting letters is (relavitely) much harder than the rest of the level, and some of the latter levels are still moderately easy. This is a small gripe, though. Most of the time, things followed well and my curiosity was usually peaked to keep wanting to find more and do efforts to collect that one last floating item. You know you're playing a fun game when you find yourself humming things like "cmon....c'mon, c'mon, YES! GOT IT! :D ". As said before: it takes practice to properly steer your 'vehicle'. It makes it rewarding. :-)\n\nA final gripe I have to mention is that story and gameplay hardly mix. There is no overall reason why you're playing a colon or a meaning to any of it. You're just you. While there is something there that makes you glad to have played it through, you really shouldn't be thinking of a reason why you're "forced" through this museum of typography. In the end, it's basically an interactive trip through a museum. And while it may not hammer you over the head with it (the texts can be skipped), I kinda hoped it would've been more than that... :-)","January 25, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ultimately, I felt pretty disappointed.  Below are some quick pros and cons but if you are still interested after reading - you should definitely check it out.  On sale.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe sound design is quite nice.  The ambient music fits well, and every element in the game comes to life with its own unique sound.\n\nEducational.  You earn pages of text through collectibles.  These are well written and give a good introduction on the history of typography.  I actually learnt a thing or two -so that was pretty cool.\n\nThe stages are stylistically distinct.\nThe Bad:\n\nRepetitive.  Every stage has the exact same formula.  You play one chapter and you've experienced it all from a gameplay point of view.\n\nThe educational aspect is tact on.  You don't actually learn much through gameplay.  I would have loved to play a game that taught you more through the active experience of playing it.\n\nAwful controls.  My personal opinion is that tight controls should come first.  This game was absolutely brutal to play some times.  Doing anything beyond moving forward - is an experience of pure frustration.  This is not a difficult game, but I died more than a few times because of the controls.  Perhaps the very nature of making a physics driven platformer where you are controlling a colon will make the movement inherently difficult.

You are a colon -- a grammatical one, thank goodness -- who must travel through the history of the written word, from beginning to quasi-modern times, one font face at a time, collecting letters and such as you go; perhaps to understand the meaning of your own existence. Fair warning: If you're not at least mildly interested in reading about typography, you won't be terribly happy with this game.\n\nType:Rider isn't complicated, as there isn't any combat or anything. You have infinite lives, and death from obstacles or falling down pits will just put you back a few seconds. It does however have puzzle segments, usually focusing on weight or game physics. As your character is composed of two wheels, more or less, you can stand on round things and move to spin them. Each level also introduces new gimmicks such as wind or water jets that will add significant velocity to you on touch.\n\nThis is at heart an educational, scholarly game - each time you pick up an asterisk, you receive a new article on another element of typography. They're not terribly long articles. They take up the right half of the screen and usually require a little bit of scrolling. You can instantly skip through these if you don't care, but they are more or less the entire point of the game.\n\nPlay this game if you're not averse to reading encyclopedic-style entries on the history of typography. Otherwise, you probably won't get too much out of this.","July 19, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each level is packed with historical data on typography, ranging from the invention of writing to modern typesets. I was pleased to see the inclusion of some non-Western scripts in the historical data, though its inclusion is minor as the game is almost completely focused on the development of the Latin script. It would be interesting to see more information on the development of typography outside of the West. The game has frequent checkpoints on almost all levels, and you can replay individual chapters to gather any characters you may have missed picking up.\n\nAt its worst, Type:Rider can be utterly frustrating, due to the extremely high inertia built into the playable character; it takes time to get moving and takes some effort to stop. In addition you are a colon and have to worry about both circles which makes it more challenging than playing as a single circle would be sometimes. Unfortunately the lack of control gets worse as you go on. Don't expect to have the response level of say a Mario platformer. Occasionally there can be glitches too, requiring you to restart the chapter or at least die. If you play the bonus level, expect to die over and over due to struggling to control the character and not having the time to compensate for the physics, while lacking the helpful checkpoints the other levels have.

It does not respect Big Picture's controller settings and attempting to bind keyboard keys to a controller via Enjoy2 (or joy2key or whatever) doesn't actually work.\n\nAfter several minutes of holding down the right arrow and periodically tapping 'space' to jump (notably with nearly a full second of delay between the keypress and actually jumping) and that being sufficient to pass 90% of any given level/obstacle/puzzle I became stuck on a letter C and was unable to reset myself or escape, so dangling there in frustration I quit the game and have promptly uninstalled it.\n\nThis is a very pretty, visually rich game with a lot of thought put into the visual aspects, environment, lighting, aesthetic, and the music is WONDERFUL. I absolutely adore every bit of music and every little sound effect that has happened throughout this game. This is probably one of the most beautiful 2D games I've played in the last year or two. However, a key to progressing in the game sat firmly inside of a letter C suspended in air, so I had no choice but to go inside of it, and on landing one dot went inside the C and the other on the outside and I was not able to move in such a way as to unstick myself from the bloody thing, and that is essentially how the game goes.\n\nThis game would have been amazing if it had any amount of challenge to it, and Instead of an interesting game that features the history of typography, this feels like the modern equivalent of a 90's hiphop-themed anti-drug PSA; basically a history lesson thinly disguised as a video game. Every visual element looked like it was carefully and meticulously placed, but every gameplay element and puzzle was no more than an arbitrarily inserted speed bump to make the experience more 'game-like'. Obstacles included small gaps you might accidentally fall into because of the full second delay between pressing the jump key and jumping but are otherwise impossible to mess up because they're 2/3 the width of your character, water slides that fling your character around like you've just done a spin-dash in Sonic the Hedgehog and just want to get to the end of the level, and some arbitrarily sticky thing that makes you move frustratingly slow for no apparent reason with no surrounding obstacles or way to bypass it.\n\nI really would have loved this game if it presented a serious amount of gameplay.\n\nInstead of Type:Rider try out LIMBO for a similar aesthetic or Colour Bind for a similar gameplay element, both of which are much more challenging and rewarding to play.","November 5, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it seems very atmospheric, has an educational element to it and seems like a relaxing experience with a casual platformer, there are several glaring issues that ruined the experience for me. First of all the game can be finished in a couple of hours if that much. I took the time to unlock everything, read through all the texts etc but even so it wasnt what I had hoped it to be. The info exerpts are fine but they in no way compell the player to read them aside from personal curiosity. That could have been done better if they enriched the game mechanics in some way for example. The levels are pretty distinct altough few and fairly short. The real problem of this game is the incredibly clunky controls. You play as two wheels which roll onward and can perform a slight jump. So far so good. However the rolling itself lacks the feeling of friction so you often find yourself simply sliding off slightly slanted surfaces despite being on full throttle so to speak. Add to that the affinity of the wheels to bounce repeatedly and your inabiltiy to jump while in the air and you're left with the exact opposite of a precision platformer. I have lost count of the times that after a long and well timed jump my front wheel would clear the platform but my back wheel would not and would promptly drag me back into the pit; or the times when I would try to make a simple jump onto a higher step but my front wheel will roll slightly up the wall changing my angle just enough that the jump which follows sends me backwards insted of the intended forward; or the aerial stunts (of which there are quite a few) when holding the forward key would send the wheels into a looping spin as if the air itself has some friction but only for one of the wheels. For someone like me who likes responsive, precise cotrols this was a frustrating experience. Granted, it's a casual game but the later levels require a good amount of precision in navigating wall jumps and vent glides - precision that simply isnt there with the controls as they are.\n\nThat being said the game has a good idea and aside from the bothersome control the price could be worth it if you're willing to put up with some clunky movement.","August 23, 2014","false","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just watch the trailers and you can see how much work went into the level design for this game. I have actually opted to die by falling off a platform or being crushed because I was too busy looking at the scenery to want to move onto the next stage.\nThis game makes learning quite enjoyable. I never thought different alphabets and fonts would be interesting, but this game gives you a peek at people from the generations that these fonts were developed. The weird thing is, I can actually see how the creators of a fonts opinions and beliefs influenced the curves and symmetry of specific fonts now and I have a new found appreciation for the Gothic, Didot, and Futura fonts (I'm only on chapter 6, so I'm sure there will be much more knowledge to come).\nThe game itself is really fun as well. It can be challenging and you may die a few times, but nothing is too hard. Some people have mentioned the controls being weird, though I cannot say I have had too many problems with the controls. There are some bonuses scattered out the chapters in the form of ampersands which can require a certain mastery of the controls to obtain, but for the most part, the controls are pretty intuitive and easy to use.\nI'd give this game a 10/10 so far, I've played a good 2-4 hours so far, though it only shows 0.3 as I play offline.","October 30, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a colon -- a grammatical one, thank goodness -- who must travel through the history of the written word, from beginning to quasi-modern times, one font face at a time, collecting letters and such as you go; perhaps to understand the meaning of your own existence. Fair warning: If you're not at least mildly interested in reading about typography, you won't be terribly happy with this game.\n\nType:Rider isn't complicated, as there isn't any combat or anything. You have infinite lives, and death from obstacles or falling down pits will just put you back a few seconds. It does however have puzzle segments, usually focusing on weight or game physics. As your character is composed of two wheels, more or less, you can stand on round things and move to spin them. Each level also introduces new gimmicks such as wind or water jets that will add significant velocity to you on touch.\n\nThis is at heart an educational, scholarly game - each time you pick up an asterisk, you receive a new article on another element of typography. They're not terribly long articles. They take up the right half of the screen and usually require a little bit of scrolling. You can instantly skip through these if you don't care, but they are more or less the entire point of the game.\n\nPlay this game if you're not averse to reading encyclopedic-style entries on the history of typography.

Why typographic? Well, essentially, through it you're supposed to discover the history of typography moving from era to era. As someone who has a sort of interest in the subject matter, plus on the other side I like platformers also, this seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nWell, as it happens, "Type:Rider" only looks great, but it's neither very educational nor it plays well.\n\nYou control two dots, a colon, which might've as well been a single dot for all it matters. And basically you roll your way through beautifully designed levels. And that's about it. The platforming is basic really, as you've no control over the colons jumping mechanic which is the only action they possess beside the aforementioned moving left and right. They can jump, and that's it. It will get you through the levels easily, but to gather all the collectibles - the letters of the alphabet in each level, plus additional info about the period - which require some actual platforming... it's pretty much all down to luck. Will the colon bounce as you want it or not? In the latter case you try again from a respawn point which is always rather close, but still... it doesn't feel that great when the platforming is mostly about luck rather than skill.\n\nAnd the "education"? Well, it consists of finding a condensed article about various people and types, which you read as you would any other article in any encyclopedia. This is done when you collect an asterisk (*) that unlocks the new info section. Then you press ENTER and the gameplay pauses while you read what you've unlocked. No narration, nothing fancy or exciting. Just plain old text that is, ironically, not typo-proof and sometimes oddly formatted.\n\nAt the current price of 6,99€ (which is about 9.50$) this is definitely not worth it. In a sale or in a bundle, perhaps. If you have absolutely no interest in typography, skip it regardless.","July 10, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it seems very atmospheric, has an educational element to it and seems like a relaxing experience with a casual platformer, there are several glaring issues that ruined the experience for me. First of all the game can be finished in a couple of hours if that much. I took the time to unlock everything, read through all the texts etc but even so it wasnt what I had hoped it to be. The info exerpts are fine but they in no way compell the player to read them aside from personal curiosity. That could have been done better if they enriched the game mechanics in some way for example. The levels are pretty distinct altough few and fairly short. The real problem of this game is the incredibly clunky controls. You play as two wheels which roll onward and can perform a slight jump. So far so good. However the rolling itself lacks the feeling of friction so you often find yourself simply sliding off slightly slanted surfaces despite being on full throttle so to speak. Add to that the affinity of the wheels to bounce repeatedly and your inabiltiy to jump while in the air and you're left with the exact opposite of a precision platformer. I have lost count of the times that after a long and well timed jump my front wheel would clear the platform but my back wheel would not and would promptly drag me back into the pit; or the times when I would try to make a simple jump onto a higher step but my front wheel will roll slightly up the wall changing my angle just enough that the jump which follows sends me backwards insted of the intended forward; or the aerial stunts (of which there are quite a few) when holding the forward key would send the wheels into a looping spin as if the air itself has some friction but only for one of the wheels. For someone like me who likes responsive, precise cotrols this was a frustrating experience. Granted, it's a casual game but the later levels require a good amount of precision in navigating wall jumps and vent glides - precision that simply isnt there with the controls as they are.\n\nThat being said the game has a good idea and aside from the bothersome control the price could be worth it if you're willing to put up with some clunky movement.","August 23, 2014","false","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played correctly, this game could give someone a whole new perspective on words and the ways we write them.

Consisting of infuring level gimmicks and the worst controls this side of Bubsy 3D, the game's vividly pretenious atmosphere washes over you like so much sewage. Don't mistake the terrible controls for difficulty however, as it's a simple, if depressing matter of brute forcing your way through the game with the its checkpoints every five paces.\n\nThe game tries to excuse its inanity with what boils down to a history of the written word. Rather then do anything interesting with the information (other then making you collect * throughout the levels and using fonts as level props) it simply regurgitates it in front of you. If you have any interest in typography then please, just use a search engine, or the library, or hell even Wikipedia.

The mechanics of the game are pretty straightforward, if occasionally unique and interesting. There's no real puzzles. The problem comes in at the platforming level. The game gives airs of being casual, but the insane difficulty in reliably controlling your sprites just goes from effortless to frustrating as soon as any trickiness is introduced. I finished all the way through the last 'real' level, despite the fun going out of the game several levels previous to that, but I can't finish the secret level. It's just pointlessly frustrating.

The player rides across letters and collects the alphabet in each font. It is something that I have not seen before. Also, each level has its own interactive objects that reflect the time period and font, like (Possible spoiler alert) the printing press machines for Times New Roman, or the tetris part in Pixel (End Spoiler Alert).\n\nNow here's the major issue: Everything was done well except for the platforming. The character is a colon (:), which is also unique, but controlling it is not fun. It's frustrating. It feels as if the center of balance is opposite where it's expected, which makes the character either spin when it's not intended and also make it hard to get up a ledge when one end is sticking off. In fact, when both dots aren't on the ground, it's hard to move around at all unless the player is trying to flip end over end.\n\nAs I played it, I did learn some interesting things. However, I never truly felt like I was in control, but rather the game did its own thing and when anything cool happened it was more of a fluke than me performing a stunt. The commands I input didn't  exactly transfer to what I was intending, and I felt a slight disconnect with the gameplay the entire game.\n\nI have no issues with the game being short (2.2 hours to complete all the levels for me, acquiring almost all the collectibles), but I do wish the programmers and the level designers spent a little bit more time on how the game felt as it was played. It'd be nice if the player could move and jump through the level smoothly if they knew the controls rather than jerking to a stop on most landings or falling in the gaps of the capital W because the letter's really big and the player just finished racing down a slope and just jumped when they realised the ramp ended.\n\nOverall, I do not dislike what the game designers have done, but I do wish they could have focused more on the player so that this game has everything a good game needs: good art, ideas, and gameplay. And I feel that the designers failed in the gameplay aspect, because the game makes the player wonder why it's so hard to move, and despite the extraordinary art, despite the extraordinary ideas, there is no compensation for the frustrating gameplay.","April 7, 2014","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a colon -- a grammatical one, thank goodness -- who must travel through the history of the written word, from beginning to quasi-modern times, one font face at a time, collecting letters and such as you go; perhaps to understand the meaning of your own existence. Fair warning: If you're not at least mildly interested in reading about typography, you won't be terribly happy with this game.\n\nType:Rider isn't complicated, as there isn't any combat or anything. You have infinite lives, and death from obstacles or falling down pits will just put you back a few seconds. It does however have puzzle segments, usually focusing on weight or game physics. As your character is composed of two wheels, more or less, you can stand on round things and move to spin them. Each level also introduces new gimmicks such as wind or water jets that will add significant velocity to you on touch.\n\nThis is at heart an educational, scholarly game - each time you pick up an asterisk, you receive a new article on another element of typography. They're not terribly long articles. They take up the right half of the screen and usually require a little bit of scrolling. You can instantly skip through these if you don't care, but they are more or less the entire point of the game.\n\nPlay this game if you're not averse to reading encyclopedic-style entries on the history of typography.

Each level is packed with historical data on typography, ranging from the invention of writing to modern typesets. I was pleased to see the inclusion of some non-Western scripts in the historical data, though its inclusion is minor as the game is almost completely focused on the development of the Latin script. It would be interesting to see more information on the development of typography outside of the West. The game has frequent checkpoints on almost all levels, and you can replay individual chapters to gather any characters you may have missed picking up.\n\nAt its worst, Type:Rider can be utterly frustrating, due to the extremely high inertia built into the playable character; it takes time to get moving and takes some effort to stop. In addition you are a colon and have to worry about both circles which makes it more challenging than playing as a single circle would be sometimes. Unfortunately the lack of control gets worse as you go on. Don't expect to have the response level of say a Mario platformer. Occasionally there can be glitches too, requiring you to restart the chapter or at least die.

It's a good game, but not a great one.\n\nThe concept certainly looks promising: you guide a colon (punctuation mark) throughout the history of the written language. In that aspect, the trailers and pictures don't lie: you get what you see. The game looks artistic, educational and has some puzzles to solve. It has some soothing music to go with it, and aside from some minor quirks (like accidentally minimalising the game to go to twitter, or noticeable framerate drops in the seventies environment) I had no issues. Perhaps the unsmooth gameplay got fixed? :-\\n\nThere is another possibility, though. This game has much in common with 130, element4l and (especially) nightsky. Learning how to properly guide your character from point A to B is what over 90% of the gameplay is about. You shouldn't expect to master it from the start.\n\nThe game's main problem is in pacing. Both the backstory and the gameplay, for that matter. At first, I thought this was going to be an ultra-short game, as the tutorial guides you from cave paintings up to the Latin alphabet. The actual levels have a backdrop that starts with the creating of the press. And while that was certainly a revolution in printing, I feel like we're missing variety. Rather than have entire 'worlds' revolving about mere fonts, I would've liked it better if the Chinese or Egyptian alphabet got more than a breeze through them. There are also texts to collect about different events regarding the history of print. But these texts are barely (if at all) connected to the level, and to be honest: rather boring. And for a game that's mostly about fonts, I thought it was odd that these stories weren't even printed in the font they were about.\n\nThe gameplay pacing is less obscure. It follows the standard routine of starting with simple levels and gradually increasing the difficulty. Except the 'gradually' has some sharp edges. At a few points, collecting letters is (relavitely) much harder than the rest of the level, and some of the latter levels are still moderately easy. This is a small gripe, though. Most of the time, things followed well and my curiosity was usually peaked to keep wanting to find more and do efforts to collect that one last floating item. You know you're playing a fun game when you find yourself humming things like "cmon....c'mon, c'mon, YES! GOT IT! :D ". As said before: it takes practice to properly steer your 'vehicle'. It makes it rewarding. :-)\n\nA final gripe I have to mention is that story and gameplay hardly mix. There is no overall reason why you're playing a colon or a meaning to any of it. You're just you. While there is something there that makes you glad to have played it through, you really shouldn't be thinking of a reason why you're "forced" through this museum of typography. In the end, it's basically an interactive trip through a museum. And while it may not hammer you over the head with it (the texts can be skipped), I kinda hoped it would've been more than that... :-)","January 25, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why typographic? Well, essentially, through it you're supposed to discover the history of typography moving from era to era. As someone who has a sort of interest in the subject matter, plus on the other side I like platformers also, this seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nWell, as it happens, "Type:Rider" only looks great, but it's neither very educational nor it plays well.\n\nYou control two dots, a colon, which might've as well been a single dot for all it matters. And basically you roll your way through beautifully designed levels. And that's about it. The platforming is basic really, as you've no control over the colons jumping mechanic which is the only action they possess beside the aforementioned moving left and right. They can jump, and that's it. It will get you through the levels easily, but to gather all the collectibles - the letters of the alphabet in each level, plus additional info about the period - which require some actual platforming... it's pretty much all down to luck. Will the colon bounce as you want it or not? In the latter case you try again from a respawn point which is always rather close, but still... it doesn't feel that great when the platforming is mostly about luck rather than skill.\n\nAnd the "education"? Well, it consists of finding a condensed article about various people and types, which you read as you would any other article in any encyclopedia. This is done when you collect an asterisk (*) that unlocks the new info section. Then you press ENTER and the gameplay pauses while you read what you've unlocked. No narration, nothing fancy or exciting. Just plain old text that is, ironically, not typo-proof and sometimes oddly formatted.\n\nAt the current price of 6,99€ (which is about 9.50$) this is definitely not worth it. In a sale or in a bundle, perhaps. If you have absolutely no interest in typography, skip it regardless.","July 10, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal in each level (about 8 of them, centered around the major innovations in printing), besides reaching the end, is to collect the 26 alphabet characters in each level as well as lore markers (which opens up brief articles about the specific period. There's also a hidden amperstand (&) character in each level that's more a challenge to locate and get.

The player rides across letters and collects the alphabet in each font. It is something that I have not seen before. Also, each level has its own interactive objects that reflect the time period and font, like (Possible spoiler alert) the printing press machines for Times New Roman, or the tetris part in Pixel (End Spoiler Alert).\n\nNow here's the major issue: Everything was done well except for the platforming. The character is a colon (:), which is also unique, but controlling it is not fun. It's frustrating. It feels as if the center of balance is opposite where it's expected, which makes the character either spin when it's not intended and also make it hard to get up a ledge when one end is sticking off. In fact, when both dots aren't on the ground, it's hard to move around at all unless the player is trying to flip end over end.\n\nAs I played it, I did learn some interesting things. However, I never truly felt like I was in control, but rather the game did its own thing and when anything cool happened it was more of a fluke than me performing a stunt. The commands I input didn't  exactly transfer to what I was intending, and I felt a slight disconnect with the gameplay the entire game.\n\nI have no issues with the game being short (2.2 hours to complete all the levels for me, acquiring almost all the collectibles), but I do wish the programmers and the level designers spent a little bit more time on how the game felt as it was played. It'd be nice if the player could move and jump through the level smoothly if they knew the controls rather than jerking to a stop on most landings or falling in the gaps of the capital W because the letter's really big and the player just finished racing down a slope and just jumped when they realised the ramp ended.\n\nOverall, I do not dislike what the game designers have done, but I do wish they could have focused more on the player so that this game has everything a good game needs: good art, ideas, and gameplay. And I feel that the designers failed in the gameplay aspect, because the game makes the player wonder why it's so hard to move, and despite the extraordinary art, despite the extraordinary ideas, there is no compensation for the frustrating gameplay.","April 7, 2014","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were a few instances (momentum-related, I think) where I got stuck in spots that were literally impossible to get into, let alone out of. Fortunately, the checkpoint system is very generous.\n\nFor me, most of the game was easy and short. The controls were simple and easy to master. I have been playing platformers for years, though, so my evaluation of its difficulty may be skewed. The hidden level is a massive spike in the difficulty curve, so watch out for that. Every level is based around a particular font, and each has one of each letter from A-Z and an ampersand (&) to collect. The collected letters and punctuation are all in that level's font.\n\nEnough about the mechanics. How is it as an educational game? Well ... it's mixed. Each level is broken up into chapters; each chapter has an asterisk, also in that level's font. The asterisks unlock short articles about typography, typically about influential individuals or technological advances. They are informative, and the English translation is solid. However, there are a few problems that undermine them. In no particular order:\n\n1. The articles are written in present tense. While this is, to my knowledge, a valid stylistic choice, it feels a little odd for historical non-fiction.\n\n2. There are several typos and formatting errors. There are also many lines with poor letter-spacing; this is inexcusable in a game that is supposed to teach about typography.\n\n3. There is no glossary, and important terms such as "serif" are not defined.\n\nUltimately, I think Type:Rider is worth playing for most people, at least if you can catch it on sale (it was US$6.99 at the time of this writing). If you have an aversion to educational games or platformers, you'll probably want to give it a pass.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros:\nGenerous checkpoint system minimizes frustration\nSimple controls\nBeautiful level design\nActually pretty informative\nYour Mileage May Vary:\nCasual difficulty\nMinimal replay value\nCons:\nTypos and other oversights undermine educational aspect of game\nPhysics engine sometimes misbehaves","November 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It almost feels like the programmer was mad at someone who had to test the game and was just out to spite them.\n\nSo, an excellent concept brought down by the means by which we are invited to experience it.","November 28, 2014","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’m as shocked as you would be, but Type:Rider is actually a competent physics-based platformer game that’s legitimately fun, and you don’t actually have to read the “educational” stuff if you don’t want to.\n\nThis game is similar to “NightSky,” which is also available on Steam (and is in no way educational). but for some reason I liked this better, even though I had no interest in the history of fonts. (But then again, who does???)  It turns out that learning about fonts was actually one of the best parts of the game! The compulsion to collect more chapters of the “history book” and learn more about fonts made this game strangely interesting.  You can skip the reading part if you want to, I suppose, and just enjoy the platforming, but I found the info intriguing.\n\nAs for the game itself, it’s a physics platformer that ingeniously uses fonts (of the historical period) as platforms and obstacles, with many interesting puzzles, treacherous jumps, and fast action.\n\nMake no mistake, this isn’t a triple-A game, but it is fun, and I played it to completion.

Each level is packed with historical data on typography, ranging from the invention of writing to modern typesets. I was pleased to see the inclusion of some non-Western scripts in the historical data, though its inclusion is minor as the game is almost completely focused on the development of the Latin script. It would be interesting to see more information on the development of typography outside of the West. The game has frequent checkpoints on almost all levels, and you can replay individual chapters to gather any characters you may have missed picking up.\n\nAt its worst, Type:Rider can be utterly frustrating, due to the extremely high inertia built into the playable character; it takes time to get moving and takes some effort to stop. In addition you are a colon and have to worry about both circles which makes it more challenging than playing as a single circle would be sometimes. Unfortunately the lack of control gets worse as you go on. Don't expect to have the response level of say a Mario platformer. Occasionally there can be glitches too, requiring you to restart the chapter or at least die. If you play the bonus level, expect to die over and over due to struggling to control the character and not having the time to compensate for the physics, while lacking the helpful checkpoints the other levels have.

It's a good game, but not a great one.\n\nThe concept certainly looks promising: you guide a colon (punctuation mark) throughout the history of the written language. In that aspect, the trailers and pictures don't lie: you get what you see. The game looks artistic, educational and has some puzzles to solve. It has some soothing music to go with it, and aside from some minor quirks (like accidentally minimalising the game to go to twitter, or noticeable framerate drops in the seventies environment) I had no issues. Perhaps the unsmooth gameplay got fixed? :-\\n\nThere is another possibility, though. This game has much in common with 130, element4l and (especially) nightsky. Learning how to properly guide your character from point A to B is what over 90% of the gameplay is about. You shouldn't expect to master it from the start.\n\nThe game's main problem is in pacing. Both the backstory and the gameplay, for that matter. At first, I thought this was going to be an ultra-short game, as the tutorial guides you from cave paintings up to the Latin alphabet. The actual levels have a backdrop that starts with the creating of the press. And while that was certainly a revolution in printing, I feel like we're missing variety. Rather than have entire 'worlds' revolving about mere fonts, I would've liked it better if the Chinese or Egyptian alphabet got more than a breeze through them. There are also texts to collect about different events regarding the history of print. But these texts are barely (if at all) connected to the level, and to be honest: rather boring. And for a game that's mostly about fonts, I thought it was odd that these stories weren't even printed in the font they were about.\n\nThe gameplay pacing is less obscure. It follows the standard routine of starting with simple levels and gradually increasing the difficulty. Except the 'gradually' has some sharp edges. At a few points, collecting letters is (relavitely) much harder than the rest of the level, and some of the latter levels are still moderately easy. This is a small gripe, though. Most of the time, things followed well and my curiosity was usually peaked to keep wanting to find more and do efforts to collect that one last floating item. You know you're playing a fun game when you find yourself humming things like "cmon....c'mon, c'mon, YES! GOT IT! :D ". As said before: it takes practice to properly steer your 'vehicle'. It makes it rewarding. :-)\n\nA final gripe I have to mention is that story and gameplay hardly mix. There is no overall reason why you're playing a colon or a meaning to any of it. You're just you. While there is something there that makes you glad to have played it through, you really shouldn't be thinking of a reason why you're "forced" through this museum of typography. In the end, it's basically an interactive trip through a museum. And while it may not hammer you over the head with it (the texts can be skipped), I kinda hoped it would've been more than that... :-)","January 25, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The elementary mechanics make for a game that is enjoyable, yet not too difficult for anyone who wants to play casually. Altogether, this game was quite entertaining, and it made for a very positive experience.","April 16, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly, had I not picked it up for "free" in a bundle I probably wouldn't have purchased it based on the the "cover".  However, having played it, I'm glad I got it, and that I gave it a try.  I would absolutely pay up to a few dollars for it (I'm cheap with games, that translates to about $5, MAYBE $10 for most people), had I not already played through it, and for most people there's virtually no replay value.\n\nIf you're looking for something that you can safely put your kids down in front of and let them have at it, without having to worry about what they might see or hear, this is perfect, and like I said, it's somewhat educational; teaching about the history of writing in the prologue, then little tidbits about several fonts throughout.  If you're looking for a casual game, that will at times make you want to scream at your monitor, this is good for that as well.\n\nThe game is very creative, and although the first... probably 75% of the game is incredibly easy, the creativity in the gameplay made it fun.  The music is very pleasant (save for the hidden level, you'll want to mute your speakers after the first attempt), and the artwork is well-done, IMO.\n\nThe unique physics made the game very interesting, by which I'm referring to the "character" being a colon; two round dots that are loosely attached, and can roll over each other, even going on separate sides of thin platforms at times, and slightly rubber-banding at other times.  The same physics that make the gameplay intersting also make certain parts very challenging and frustrating, like when you're trying to balance on a narrow ledge and one dot keeps pulling the other off the side.\n\nThe entire game, including the very frustrating bonus level, took me a little under three hours, and that also included a trip to get food, so it's not very long, but ultimately it was entertaining, and even at the full $5 price, that means it was cheaper (for around the same length of entertainment) than going to a movie.  I'd probably pay that, although I'm sure you can pick it up for a dollar or two on sale.","January 9","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stuck it out to the end because I wanted to see all the levels, but even after putting in a few hours, I never got used to it and routinely felt like I was fighting the controls. I applaud Type:Rider's uniqueness and style, but I can't endorse a platformer that doesn't offer good platforming.","July 19, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looked a little pretentious, but entertaining. A cute little game loosely about driving over letters.\n\nI was impressed. The look and feel of the game is quite beautiful. Each level has a different feel, tied neatly into both a typographical theme and history, providing context for the fonts we use each day. Played correctly, this game could give someone a whole new perspective on words and the ways we write them. As your small colon-shaped avatar rolls over letters and symbolically knocks the serifs from them, you start to understand how much of a break with tradition sans-serif font is (because you've been rolling around serifs for three levels' worth of history at that point).\n\nPlaying the levels is simple enough. Finding all of the pickups is a little challenging. It's worth checking out, for word nerds definitely, or for anyone who wants to appreciate typography for its own merits. There are plenty who won't really get it. Perhaps I am just pretentious enough to understand and appreciate this game.","July 25, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a platformer the game is rather standard, though the two dots (colon?) are somewhat unwieldy. Nowhere is this more evident than the in the bonus level, modeled on Comic Sans MS and some of the internet's more hackneyed tropes. The level requires a degree of precision which is hard to gauge from the low level of detail presented by the player avatar. That being said, this mostly isn't an issue, as the game is rather easy as far as platformers go, the puzzle levels are relatively simplistic, and the game is forgiving as well, with frequent checkpoints, making it suitable for more casual platformer players.\n\nAs far as integrating the educational material into the gameplay goes, it doesn't. Information about the history of type is present in snippets of text that are picked up in the form of collectables in the levels. Most collectables are rather easy to find, save one that I noticed several Let's Play videos missed. Also "missed" is the particular reason for Comic Sans's failure. As a typesetter once told me, CS was intended to be used at a 6 pt size. Unlike many other typefaces, CS is completely legible here. When made larger, it comes to look ridiculous. While I'm at it, the game misuses the word "font," which actually refers to a particular size, thickness and style of a typeface, not merely the typeface. That being said, I still found it pleasant to take breaks from the action for an illustrated slice of the history of type.\n\nIn spite of its shortcomings Type:Rider is a breezy, short game with handsome presentation that should make a nice parfait for afficianados of the printed word.","May 15, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
