If not, there is a small challenge initially while you adapt your brain and hand-eye coordination to ignore the constantly changing orientation. Always move up and down regardless of what you see.\n\nFor achievement seekers if you are into this kind of game or awesome at all genres it should be a quick. Otherwise just a little more effort while you train the muscle memory to respond.\n\nThe achievement that would require the most effort (due to real time) is accumulating 10k and 50k parsec (distance traveled).\nUpdate:\nThe Dev has eluded it could be a bug or just genius but as long as you keep the game open the parsec will not reset allowing you to accumulate both 10 and 50k parsec from multiple runs.\nTopic here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/410470/discussions/0/485624040227066354/","December 5, 2015","true","39.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanErtlov/recommended/410470/","IvanErtlov","IvanErtlov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanErtlov/","60 products in account","Expander follows the deep, slightly melancholic storyline of a shapeshifting hero (the brick) travelling through a seemingly endless nightmare of geometry, a metaphoric picture for the cold, logic-driven world we experience today. Most likely suffering from some kind of post-traumatic stress syndrom, it gets addicted to the drug "star", located in small boxes that can be found everywhere around, but in the speed of the chase and driven by the desire to get them all, brick always runs into the cruelty of the walls around it - and therefore losing more and more of his life will.\n\nAs the great German philosopher H . P. Baxxter once said in his poetry masterpiece "How much is the fish":\n\n"The chase is better than the catch"\n\nThis seems to be the case for our poor brick: Doomed to an eternal fate of chasing boxes of stars, failing, getting hurt and starting all over again.\n\n8 / 10, waiting for the movie now.","December 2, 2015","true","17.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","10","11","9","0"

This is done by left or right mouse clicks, plus moving the mouse up or down. It's tricky to get used to but it'll soon be intuitive to you.\n\nThe music is great and I love the way the screen twists around while you are moving through the 'corridor'.\n\nNice work!","December 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It can be a bit like rubbing you stomach and patting your head at times! You navigate an endless maze of varying wall widths collecting blocks to increase your score multiplier. This actually presents two strategies: ignore the blocks and just get as far as you can with a slowly increasing multiplier or go for all the blocks but risk collisions with the walls and with 3 strikes you're out.\n\nThe game seems to have very little presence, the first time I tried I bombed out almost immediately and was still just over 200 in the world. It deserves a lot more attention, I know I'll be playing more of it.","May 17","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
