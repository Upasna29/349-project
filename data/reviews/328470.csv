Instead of using Direct3D it uses something called nGlide, this means that you no longer have the bump-mapping of the original nor do you have the option of true colour textures (this being a game made back when 16bit colour was actally an option).\nOn top of this the crosshairs are noticeably off center making long-range engagements more difficult, especially now since the lock-on missiles no longer work.\n\nUntil these issues are fixed I shall not recommend this game.","February 10, 2015","false","2.6"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","77","82","4","2"

Don't take my lack of hours in steam as anything.\nI played this game and finished it years ago when it was new and was very happy when i found it on steam recently.\n\nSlave Zero is a classic mech game that i feel no one else has ever pulled off quite like this.\nThe levels are different levels of a massive populated futuristic city. when you finish the stage you either jump into a massive elevator to the next area of the city or go through blast doors.\nyou can use a lot of the environment as weapons.\nsuch as the people walking around, the cars on the highways, you can destroy buildings to get iron pipes to club enemy mechs and police helicopters. you also can replenish health and ammo destroying buildings.\nthe levels while you would expect for a game its age are a little linear you can still explore to an extent. the game is challenging in a good way as you find better weapons to fight your foes on the enemies you have already crushed.\nthe boss battles are challenging and oldschool where you find the weak spot and keep attacking it when the opportunity arises. the game is also littered with lesser bosses that you just have to be quick and deal as much damage as possible.\ni feel i should also mention the soundtrack. it is fantastic and compliments the game extreamly well.\n\nah yes, and strafe is your friend!\n\nso happy this is now on steam as i get to relive a piece of my childhood.\nif you have never played it i highly recommend it. it of course is showing its age now but that does not distract from the excellent core gameplay.\n\nOS while i can't speak for Windows 8 i can say with pure confidence this game runs exceptionally on windows 7 and as yet i have not encountered any bugs. i do think the controlls need to be remapped for the best gaming experience. however that is down to personal preference. textures are a bit blurry but that is to be expected from a game this old. as far as i know there are no texture packs available. but that does not change the fact the game itself is still incredible. please, if you run win 8 and buy this don't hesitate to drop me a comment. i would love to know how it runs.\n\nAspect Ratio its pretty much locked to 4:3 but there are a myriad of resolutions to choose from that range from 640x480 to 7680x4320\n\ni highly recommend picking it up.\n\n11/10 - glad to be throwing humans at giant mechs once more.","October 23, 2014","true","0.4"," 62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","62","70","2","1"

The game was fun then, and its fun now!  The game definitely feels easier than I remember, but a lot of old games feel that way.  Some of the graphics options are not compatible with current gen hardware but that is to be expected, they are red and cannot be selected in game.  The game still runs great on my three year old windows 7 hardware.  I would have liked to see a few updates with it, like better textures, but it's not that important.

Still have problems with the automatic language selection, and outdated files everywhere. The only really good it has an "Extras" directory with the music in FLAC and MP3, also some design drawings.\nI have the original game boxed in his CD and have installed on Windows 8 only to compare if there something new or patched, but without luck.

I still do. When I saw it on steam, I had to get it.\n\nIt's amusing looking at reviews from back in the day that were generally unfair to the game.\n\nThe game's essentially a run-and-gun game in 3D with cutscenes thrown in, and it lives up that description. Essentially you point your gun at things that shoot at you and hold down the mouse button while running towards the end of the game. It's more about taking part in the journey of getting through the game and enjoying the scenery than it is putting your skills to the test, and the game somehow still looks okay to this day. I think reviewers 15 years ago were expecting Slave Zero to be a different game than what it is -- but what it is is perfectly fine from my point of view.\n\nWell, if you like run and gun games, and you want to see how they were done around the year 2000, Slave Zero is a nice experience. It's also short enough to get through in one afternon.","November 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/328470/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WKiUOpAbEM\n\nhttp://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Slave_Zero\n\nSlave Zero is repetitive, but fun third person shooter with a lot of things to blow up. It have some flaws, but it doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nIt's 500 years in to the future. The game takes place in the capital of asian conglomerates – Megacity S1-9. The sovereign khan has taken it over with the help of giant biomechanical robots (or Slaves as they are called in the game). But not all hope is lost. An underground resistance known as The Guardians, stole one of those Slaves and now it's up to you the merge body and mind with him and save everyone, The story is paper thin. I wish for more detailed story, not just good vs evil, but this is what you get. This is a game focused entirely on action, not story and the action is good.\n\nThe released date is 1999, so of course the graphics are dated, but still it's nice too look at.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straight forward. You are in control of giant mech that can stomp, throw cars or pieces of buildings or shoot his three weapons or weapon types to be precise – rockets, energy and balistic.  Through the whole game you will find upgrades for them. Some are hidden, but it's not necessery to search for them. Soon or later you will get them. All you need to do is run, gun, strafe and not get shot. All three weapon types are useful and their ammo runs fast, so you will be changing between them constantly. But don't worry, there is plenty health and ammo packs lying around. When enemy gets closer you can punch him to death. Also you can do this to buildings.\n\nLevel design is good. Most of the times you will be high in the sky, between bulding, killing innocent civilians from time to time, but there are also sewer, inside bases and so on. This is corridor shooter, so no exploration is required. Later levels can give you some headache. Seem like the city was build so high and you can fall to your doom. This is especially annoying, when some of the enemies can knock back you with a single shot and there is no way of defending againts that. I recommend saving often on those levels.\n\nThere is one impressive thing for a such an old game – level destruction. Bridges, buildings and so on. A lot of things in the envoirment can be demolish and with the combination of constantly attacking enemies, things can get hectic, but in a fun way.\n\nEnemies are diverse. In the beginning helicopters, tanks and small mechs will attack you. Later you will face tougher with shields, armed with lazer that do tons of damage, flying robots, small annoying and fast, that attach to you and leach your life and so on.\n\nI always look for a good boss battle. Here some are good, some are bad and some even annoying. Some are just not that fun, than others. A static giant mother ship pumping out mechs is not that interesting. But there some quite enjoyble to fight, like one that have really powerful weapons and you have constantly to go up, because there is rasing acid below you. It was quite tense battle. The final boss was disappointment to me. Just shoot, hide, get more ammo, rinse and repeat. The fight was not very creative. You have to hide from him because he do insane amount of damage.\n\nBeside the bosses I have few other issies with the game. There is only three weapons. You can argue that, because with the upgrades the numbers is getting higher, but they are just that upgrades, not new weapons, although they fire differently. Let me have them all, it is action game, where you can blow stuff, you need more weapon variety. My next problem is the repetition. As much as I like the game, I can say that after the first hour you will see everything that the game offers, but still I find the gameplay enjoyable. It took me 5 h to beat it and as I said in the beginning it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Another small problem is that I took my a while to make the game run in 1080 p, but this maybe entirely my fault.\n\nThe sound design is great, especially the music. Fantastic fast techno tracks, fitting extremely well with the sci-fi setting and the action on screen. Sound fx are also great. Stomping and walking felt like i'm really in control of giant mech. And you can also distinct all weapons.\n\nAt the end of the day the question I have to answer is – does the game hold up? Yeah, to some degree. Graphics don't, but the gameplay is solid and controls are tight.  In the end I can say, I had fun playin the game. Non stop action, where you can blow a lot of things and you play as a giant mech. Whats not to like? I was impressed mostly with the level destruction. The game came out 16 years ago and I think it is an accomplishment. It have some problems, but nothing to make me quit. Slave Zero probably won't be stuck for a long in my mind. It doesn't have the nostalgia for me like Max Payne for example, but I still recommend it.","November 30, 2015","true","6.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
