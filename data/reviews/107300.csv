Don't expect a game in the scope of Chrono Trigger, FFIII and all those jrpg classic's. It is not a such a game. I would describe it as a "parody" of those games. It has some good dialogues and there are tons of references of retro games. Even the title is a reference to Breath of FIre. A feature that I liked it that when you level up, it gives you two choices of what you want to upgrade. For example it can be your defence, or you may improve a certain spellThere is also a limit in each dungeon for the rendom encounters, so at some point there will not be any more random battles. But that doesn't mean that you can't fight at will. If you bring on the pause menu, there is an option to fight an enemy if you fought all the battles in that dungeons and you want more. . The story is not anything special and the combat can feel a little bit repetitive. Later on, on the game I found that I could just skip some battles with just mushing the A key. It is about 5 with 7 hours long. There are not that many things to discover outside of the main story, so you can't enhance that time.\nBuy if: - You are a fan of the snes jrpg classics and you want to play a parody about them.\nDon't Buy if: -You expect it to be the next Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Breath of Fire, Final Fantasy III etc.\n-You have never played a jrpg before, and you to want to intorduce yourself to the genre.","January 19, 2014","true","8.3"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","41","49","0","0"

Part of the charm to this game is that it mimics the original Dragon Quest games in color, menus, maps and even the feel of the towns.\n\nAfter each battle, each party member gets restored to full health, including dead characters. Even if you escape, you get full health. This makes the game streamlined and easy even on hard difficulty. To compensate for this, the game balances out by powering up the monsters after each round. Their attack strength keep going up by 10%. It puts pressure to finish the fight fast. There is also no run, but instead its relegated to a magic skill given to one character. One of the biggest enjoyments that I get out of the game is the ability to chose one of two bonuses every time a character reaches a new level. Do you chose this spell or that spell? Do you want +20 Max HP and +20 strength or +10 Strength + 10 Willpower +10 Magic +10 Vitality? After level 30, the game runs out of choices for you.\n\nThe challenge is in your MP / mana. You will get some back after each level, but outside of an Inn or a save point (you can save on the fly too). You won't be able to refill your magic. On the surface, fighting and button mashing make quick work of enemies. Deeper into any dungeon makes fighting difficult without using magic or techniques (both cost MP / mana). While battles are random, the dungeons have specific numbers of battles before the random battles get down to 0. So if you fight 20 random battles, you won't have any other random battles to fight. This works well, because you can go deep into a dungeon, have no mana left and need to walk back out of the dungeon. Having 0 remaining random battles ensures your survival. Since there is no sort of easy teleportation. A few dungeons force you to beat the boss and walk back. Luckily there is a run button.\n\nSpells get upgraded. The heal spell can get upgraded to resurrect. Making it easy if a character dies that you're trying to heal, well they're just resurrected! There aren't items, but there are potions. You can't buy these, you need to find them in caves. They resurrect and give full health to any character. These are necessary if your lone healer dies. There is a health regenerating zombie though and a vampire sort of attack with another character.\n\nThe leader of your party is a silent (yet thinking) skeleton, a ghost princess healer, a vampire nerd and a prince zombie. They are all powerful in their own way. In battle, two of the characters can join forces for big attacks. The only problem is both need to be alive to do them. Its not a problem toward the beginning of the game.\n\nAbout 7 hours into the game, I noticed there is a combo system. Sure its always been there. I just didn't find it useful. Every attack builds a combo. There are special combo boosts and breakers that when used will multiply the damage by the combo, but reset the combo to 0. It would be more useful if these specials weren't already the highest damagers in general. You can keep using them to kill the enemies quickly without having to build a combo.\n\nWhen I played, I found normal (medium) difficulty far too easy, so I played on hard. On hard, the bosses became insurmountable. Like any RPG, grinding made any boss easier. The menu has a 'fight' command that will cue up a random battle for you! For the most part random battles are a numbers game. Not your stats vs their stats, but your remaining members against their remaining members. The party that outnumbers the other wins unless one of them balances out the numbers.\n\nBosses were a major issue on hard, which made for an hour long grind on many of them. One boss, I had literally run out of enemies to grind and couldn't beat a boss. I had to leave the dungeon by walking mind you and grind on over world enemies. Then walk all the way back to the boss with 0 enemies. It just felt unnecessary and hindered my ability to enjoy the game.\n\nFor equipment, Breath of Death is bare bones. You have a weapon and armor. No headgear, no accessory. Towns don't have more than a couple weapons and armor for your four characters. There are a few treasures here and there in dungeons. Treasures in towns get relegated to jokes, like "A true hero wouldn't steal from a person, even if there's a bazooka in there." There is no interaction with anything outside of talking to townspeople. Nothing hidden in book shelves or pots. It is sad how little effort got put into the details outside of readable tombstones in one lone graveyard.\n\nThe world itself feels big enough. There are around 10+ dungeons and 3+ towns. You won't get to travel the oceans or visit far off lands, but the dungeons are the real maps. Each dungeon feels big enough. There are mostly underground areas, a prison and the ruins of giant towns. You can tackle them pretty openly. The second area has three dungeons you can visit. Yet, with the fourth, it bluntly tells you not to go in there yet. It just seems like a cheap reason, when other RPGs would point out we need the X to continue.\n\nThe game really wants to hang its hat on comedy. There are funny tombstones and excessive references to classic lines in other video games. "Hey listen!" "Its a secret to everybody!" "Master of unlocking." "Welcome strangah! what-cha buyin" "I am error" "Motherbound" "Perhaps your prince is in another castle?" Even a reference to Bionic Commando that made me laugh, because that one was unexpected. The rest of the references have become commonplace on the Internet. Not only that, but there is a replica / parody of Zelda 2's version of Death Mountain. Other than that, the humor doesn't seem overwhelming. Sometimes less is more.\n\nI just didn't care for the game's humor like I did with Cthulhu Saves the World. Breath of Death VII feels like it doesn't have its own jokes and relies too much on your knowledge from 25 year old dialog.\n\nThen there are the game's other issues. Three years after its release, the game still has issues here and there. Enemies immune to poison, still get poisoned. Two dungeons have no music. That could be a good thing when all the other dungeons have the same music that overstays its welcome. Getting experience still seems glitched. plenty of times, I'd look at the status screen. I needed 4,000 more EXP, then beat another group of enemies earning 1,500 EXP only to discover that I still needed 4,000 more EXP. In a game where grinding is necessary, its an issue. I'm left with a feeling of knowing that I have to invest another hour into the game grinding before I'll face the boss of any area again.\n\nIf you don't want to get too involved with a 40 - 80 hour RPG, Breath of Death could be for you. With saving anywhere and refilling your HP after every battle, that makes for an easy game. Some people like easy! Some complain that the game is 3 - 5 hours, that's perfect for $3 in my opinion. For the $1 combo pack that I bought it in. I feel like I got my money's worth thanks to hard mode. As for this being a fun, entertaining game, it wasn't. I spent several hours grinding to overcome boss after boss.  Maybe I made it too hard by playing hard mode and turned a 5 hour game into an 11 hour game with 6 hours of grinding, but I can only review my own experience with the game.","December 23, 2014","false","11.8"," 96 of 153 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","96","153","8","16"

As someone with little experience playing RPGs, I found myself able to enjoy this one a lot. I imagine hardcore fans will find this game boring and lackluster, so don't have very high expectations. This game is enjoyable for a very simple reason; it's fun, the dialogue is funny, the storyline is somewhat intrigueing, the battles are cool and the soundtrack is pretty sweet. There is not much character development or a big world to explore, instead, most of my personal enjoyment came from the dialogue and basic gameplay. The characters are pretty cliché, but still feel a bit unique. They're not that developed, this always left some room for imagination, personally,  when I was imagining this game through the dialogue.\n\nA very short, but fun (and cheap) RPG is the best way to describe it in short.

Unfortunately, Breath of Death VII didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nThe one original idea I noticed in the game was the battle mechanic that builds momentum each turn of the battle. Enemies get stronger, and you can build up a combo as long as you don't heal and just keep attacking. While an interesting concept, it ended up removing most semblance of the strategy that exists in turn-based RPGs and turning it into each battle essentially feeling like a race to try and see if you can kill the enemy or boss before having to heal.\n\nThat, combined with the short length of the game and the sense of humour that seemed a bit forced, made me fairly disappointed with this title. I would sooner recommend an RPG made with RPG Maker, or that you simply replay the games whose nostalgia this title is trying to capitalize on.","July 7, 2014","false","6.3"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123412640/recommended/107300/","76561198123412640","Sam Lilly","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123412640/","306 products in account","Breath of Death VII is a classic styled RPG with some interesting improvements to the genre. In many ways, this is a very simple and standard RPG. You have a party that maxed out at four people, basic stats, spells, random encounters, leveling up, gear management... basically, if you've ever played an RPG before, you'll get this game. And even if you haven't, you can have fun with it as an introductory one. However, fans of RPGs will appreciate a few of the innovations here.\n\nOne cool twist on the formula is that, upon leveling up, you get to choose one of two upgrades. They might be new spells, enhancements for old spells, better stats, or any combination of these. This give some customization and replayability to the game. Another is the upon winning a battle, you will recover some of your MP and ALL of your HP, plus anyone who died during the fight will be revived. This makes it easier to get from place to place without having to use up MP to heal, carry healing items, or walk back to towns constantly in order to progress. An especially nice feature for those mazier dungeons. By far my favorite addition to this game is how it handles random encounters. Whenever you go to a new area, it will have a set number of random encounters in it. This means that, while walking around, you will randomly encounter enemies that many times. After you have that many battles, you will no longer have any random encounters there. This means that you can clear out an area and focus on exploring without the distractions. However, if you want to grind more in that area, you can simply bring up the menu and select the fight option and BOOM, you're in a battle. It's a beatiful way to work around the annoyance of rancom encounters while keeping the grinding aspect possible.\n\nThe whole design seems to be built around being a fast, enjoyable RPG. You can speed up your walk to a run with the tap of a button. In battles, your fight still images of monsters with sparing animations for attacks. Quick displays, combos, and a decent engine all make this game move by swiftly, even when mindlessly grinding. You are also sometimes teleported out of mazey areas when finished so you don't have to backtrack. And the simplicity of gameplay (aside from strategic bossfights or harder difficulties) blends all these things together to deliver a very fast paced RPG experience.\n\nI also liked the retro style of art and play, even though I never really played much for old RPGs. I'd comment on the music but I mostly had the sound off... watching stuff while I was grinding... so sorry I can't say. The simple display and gameplay... that retro feeling is really nice. It's much less intimidating than some other RPGs I've tried. The characters are alright, and some of the dialogue is interesting. There are a few red herrings in there as well, unless I missed something :P It's a cool little game.\n\nHowever, there are a few issues. While it is built around making the RPG stuff less annoying, it still includes those RPG things. Random encounters are limited... but they're there. Grinding is easy... but it's still tedious. Lack of a map makes the mazey dungeons and even some of the overworld more confusing than they need to be. Some of the display is a bit lacking, not telling you all the information you might want. You can probably use your head a bit to remember what enemy is low on health or poisoned or other such things, but this game doesn't have much of a reason NOT to display such things other than for the retro style.\n\nStill, overall, Breath of Death VII is a really fun game. If you like RPGs, retro games, and the simpley yet effective gameplay style, this game is worth checking out. At the time, I've only been able to find it in a two pack with Cthulhu Saves the World, a game in the same style, for 3 dollars. I would say it's worth it if you're looking for some light and fun RPG action. What do I think of Cthulhu Saves the World? Well go look for my review on that game for yourself and see if the pack is worth it for you. However, I WILL say it's very similar in style, so if you're interested in one, you'll probably like them both. Breath of Death VII gets a 7/10 for being a fun RPG that does its best to lessen the inherent burdens of RPGs while still keeping those iconic characteristics present.","January 21, 2015","true","5.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I'd played Oblivion and Skyrim, but that was really it. I had also played The Stick Of Truth and that was the only turn-based RPG I'd played. However, I had seen enough gameplay of the Final Fantasy series and Earthbound to know what I was in for. After playing The Stick Of Truth and loving it so much, I wanted to get into turn-based RPGs. I saw the price of this game and decided to get it. I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.\n\nStory:Set in the future, humanity has been wiped out by nuclear warfare. The undead remained, who rebuilt civilization. All was well until evil invaded the lands. You assume the role of Dem, a skeleton hero and silent protagonist. Dem meets Sara, a historian and mind reader who forces her adventure on Dem to uncover the secrets of the past. Join Dem and Sara on their journey as they meet new friends and combat evil foes along the way.\n\nGameplay:This is your standard turn-based RPG gameplay. There's really not much else to comment on. You roam around, a random encounter happens and battle ensues. You can use your basic attack, a more advanced “Tech” attack, magic and even use double team or “Unite” moves with someone in your party. As you advance in the game, meet new party members and acquire better weapons and armor. You'll also level up and learn new attacks. This game breaks the fourth wall constantly. You won't have to question what type of game you're playing. It will be sure to let you know that you're playing a turn-based RPG with it's constant references to the typical happenings of these types of games. That's one thing I loved about this game. It adds comedic relief to an otherwise serious genre. I mentioned that Dem is a silent protagonist. He doesn't verbally communicate, but the game allows you to read his thoughts. Sara is also able to read his mind so there is still communication, which adds to the light-hearted narrative.\n\nConclusion:Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of turn-based RPGs or is trying to get into them. This is a tribute and love letter to the classic JRPGs of the past. The gameplay is fun, the story keeps you interested and it's use of satire gives it charm. It's a short game, but for the price, I can't really complain.","August 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Zeboyd game and it's a solid 4 hour RPG that is often on sale for a buck along with the more polished CSTW.\n\nYou're certainly not missing out on anything by not playing BoDVII, but if you've got a hankering for SNES style gameplay you'd be hard pressed to do worse. The dialogue and humour are a touch predictable and can get tiresome after sometime; there's only so many times you can retread same jokes about RPG tropes and cliches that have been repeated ad infinitum elsewhere on the net.\n\nNotable features are the limited encounter rate per dungeon that still allow you to reach a decent level and the option at level ups on how you wish your character to advance. Admittedly the latter feature is not fully realised in this game as the "alternative" paths are limited in their viability by equipment.\n\nIt's a fun little game and extremely cheap and short! If you're really strapped for time though you would probably be better off with the game it is bundled with as all the features here are better implemented in that game.","October 15, 2014","true","4.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What I find is that the RPG aspects of a JRPG are usually very fun as you can play the character(s) in a variety of ways. This is what I like about the genre.  The weakness of the genre is the game progression can be shallow and it forces you from one location to the next without much choice where combat can be 'too easy'.\n\nThis one is a little different.   While it is still linear to a point, the game doesn't feel especially linear.   It feels a little more Open world which is quite novel for JPRG.  Each area has max battles, and the open terrain area counts as one so you can get rid of them all early so that you're not interrupted while moving around, or you save them up to get higher experience from later battles.  If you find yourself losing you can trigger battles allowing yourself to level up.  So while that would be grinding, at least you can never get a build where you have to start over.   From my point of view, this ability to choose and wander is a definite plus for a game in this genre.\n\nThe combat is also enjoyable.   Play the game on expert otherwise it plays too easy - you'll only need to hit enter for most battles which takes away from the game experience.  Play it on expert and you have to work thru with the skills chosen from leveling up to win many battles - much more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're reading this to compare a good JPRG vs. a bad one and why you should choose this one - see my review on Penny arcade 4 for what a JPRG shouldn't be).\n\nSummary - There is no "wrong" build, reasonable number of skills to choose from thereby allowing you to solve the game in variety of ways and combat can be fun on expert.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","8.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Great bits of funny dialogue that keep the game interesting enough to carry you through.\n\nThe battle system is simple and familiar, but you must always keep an eye on your Magic points, as they only replenish slightly between battles whereas HP is fully restored. It can also be tempting to keep mashing A to move quickly through battles, and while this works great on weaker enemies, it can be easy to get caught out and die by not planning your moves more carefully.\n\nThe ability to team up with another party member to unleash a combo attack is also interesting. There are also more powerful attacks that are 'combo breakers': the longer the battle goes on, the higher a combo is gained and the more damage you (and your enemies!) do. 'Combo breaking' moves reset the combo meter to 0x with the payoff being a powerful attack. However, I found myself not really using 'combo break' moves as I felt it was more pain than it was worth to lose a 16x or so combo.\n\nAnother great aspect of the game is the ability to have instant encounters, which can be really helpful if you need to grind a little more XP to level up, since you don't have to walk around in circles and wait for a random encounter. There's also a limit on random encounters in each area; for example, a dungeon might have a limit of 15. If you want to, you can sit in one spot and instantly fight through 15 sets of enemies and be free to explore the dungeon without encountering enemies. But also, if you run out of enemies in an area and want to grind some more, you can instantly summon some to fight against.\n\nOverall it's well worth the small price, even more so when it goes on sale. There is really no reason not to give this game a try. If nothing else, do it for the puns. The sweet, sweet puns.","September 8, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A "classic" RPG that borrows heavily from the early Dragon Warrior/Quest games as well as other games from the same period. Those looking for a nostalgia trip will certainly get their fix, while newer gamers will probably find it dull and uninteresting.\n\nThe game is fairly short and, except for a few side dungeons, very linear. I was surprised by the lack of a few features, like the ability to search every ever pot, crate, bookshelf for loot. The lack of mouse support was also odd; playing on a keyboard felt strange having played most games of this type on a console controller back in the day.\n\nCombat was simplified with very few options and little gear to play with. The one thing I did appreciate was the random encounter...er, "counter" that turns off random encounters in an area after a specified number of fights. (You can still force a fight via a menu option.) That would be a much appreciated feature in many RPGs I've played.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time in 20XX and would definitely recommend it to fans of old-school JRPGs.","January 7","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Second, I wish there were as many that came after, because this one is amazing.\nIt's built like an old Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest title: four-directional movement on a tiled plane, hub towns that are roughly the same size as your sprite on the overworld map, turn-based combat (which has a design that actually reminds me more of Mother or EarthBound than FF), retro synth music, pixel art graphics, and lots of recolored enemies.\nHowever, while it's definitely meant to evoke the old era of JRPGs in technical design and some of its aesthetics, it's not a copy/paste replica by any means. Combat is surprisingly difficult. Even just outside the tutorial dungeon, random encounters can easily spell your death until you get a second party member; speaking of which, there's a fixed limit to random encounters for each area, meaning they'll stop after a while. You can force an encounter at any time by opening the menu and choosing “FIGHT,” even after the random encounters have stopped. It doesn't necessarily force you to backtrack for healing, either — after winning a fight, your HP is restored fully, and you regain a bit of MP, assuming you spent any.\nWhich you will, more likely than not, since most characters' standard attacks are woefully inadequate for survival.\nIt doesn't take itself seriously at all, and though I personally found its brand of fourth wall-breaking comments and sarcastic acknowledgement of (J)RPG clichés and mainstays to be a bit overdone, it's also still endearing in its delivery.\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend it.","July 20, 2013","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Some of the features that make it a very easy game to just pick up and relax with is the fact that health and magic regenerate a certain amount after battle, each area has a set number of encounters that you can see from looking at the menu, and you can choose to battle at any time from the menu (even if there are no more encounters for that area).

It is a bit short, but has all the essentials of a game in this genre, such as a bickering party, annoying random encounters, romance and gold. Don't expect much more, however! The story (as well as most levels) is very linear, there is not much variety to character development and equipment, and only one combat item exists (potions). Nonetheless, the game has quite a bit of charme, as it really doesn't take itself serious on the storytelling level - this is a really good thing that actually (paradoxically) gives this otherwise rather generic and forgettable game some character and makes it somewhat memorable.","November 1, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In Breath of Death VII you have the silent skeleton Dem, which can only think, the ghost princess Sara, which possess the power to read minds (and the only member in the party which is able to communicate with our skeleton hero), Lita, a vampire girl, who lived alone in ruins and Erik, the Zombie Prince, who speaks with a kinda similar french accent. Talking about the roles, Dem is the guy fighting with a sword, Sara is using a staff to cast some magic spells, Lita is made to shoot arround with guns or rifles and our prince Erik usually fights with an Axe. The story is really awesome, not to boring and not to slow. It contains also lots of comedy and parodys about other games, so read the dialogues carefully and do not skip them, I bet you would may miss something.

The writing in this game is absolutely abysmal, relying on knowledge of video game memes and injokes instead of actually attempting to be funny. The setup to the plot is wasted; the idea of an RPG taking place after the apocalypse has been proven to be incredibly engrossing. Here, it is used as a fresh coat of paint over your typical NES RPG.\n\nThe combat is somewhat fun. Depending on your skill with RPGs, you'll either blaze through the game with no difficulty or get irreversably stuck depending on the levelups you pick. If you pick the wrong level up, you can potentially be stuck somewhere later in the game, with no way to reverse your choice. There is no feedback in battles as to what's happening.\n\nIf you are going to play one of their games, I would recommend their Penny Arcade games, or at the very least, Cthulu Saves the World.

On the surface, Breath is nothing more than a mediocre parody game, offering little in humor and even less in story. The characters are just barely charming enough to carry the player through, and while the settings can be interesting enough, only the main character serves to be anything more than 1-dimensional. The story doesn't do the genre justice, and leaves a lot to be desired in writing. Story is often the sole reason one plays a typical RPG, and its always dissapointing when that falls through.\n\nWhatever you do, don't buy this game expecting a wry and witty parody to challenge your beliefs of modern gaming. Buy it because it's a wonderful game.\n\nI can't begin to state how much I love the battle system in this game. Taking cues from Earthbound and Dragon Quest, Breath of Death implements a 1st person turnbased combat system that looks wildly archaic, but fits with the time its emulating. Like the games that inspired it, the enemy sprites are sparsely detailed, and there isn't even a backgroud to speak of. Attacks are picked from a sad little wall of text from the right, and give the damage and whatever status effects it might cause. No attacks are animated, save for the enemies flickering when being attacked. I wish I could make this sound more appealing, but the retro flavor fits the battles perfectly, allowing the player to focus on the numbers. If the thought of number watching turns you off, please, feel free to avoid at all costs, but I personally loved it.\n\nCalculating attacks and knowing when to heal your characters is crucial. There is a sacrifice for every choice you make, and the game implements an engaging combo system that can make or break the tougher battles in the game. Believe it or not, combat is extremely fast paced for an RPG, as with every turn, the enemy's attacks become stronger. This is a non-issue with the earlier battles, but becomes a deciding factor in mid to late-tier encounters, especially bosses. If your usual plans involve delicately whittling down health while keeping yours up, prepare to have your butt handed to you. Your offense is the best defense, and the streamlined item selection saves you any micromanaging you'd usually worry about in other games.\n\nAfter every battle, your health is completely recovered at no cost, and depending on how quickly you dispatched the opponent, a small amount of mana will be restored. In battle, mana is essential for getting out of a tight spot, but there is only so much, so use it wisely. Like mana, potions can be found throughout the game, and serve as an instant heal in battle, but are worth stocking up for the later battles. And as a rule with any classic RPG, save often, as you can save anywhere, so be warned; you will die in this game. Just when you think you've leveled well past the normal encounters, the difficulty spikes, so don't be afraid to grind.\n\nIn fact, the game rewards grinding, as each area offers only a finite number of encounters.  As an added bonus, you can initiate an encounter at any time on the menu, so you could get all the fights out of the way and then explore the new enviornment at your leisure. Of course, you could go the classic way and enjoy the occasional random encounter, but I found the freedom to choose a very considerate nod to the player.\n\nGrinding also opens the lovely door of the level-up, which is handled ingeniously throughout. A tiered system takes place, with every level gained offering a choice. Sometimes its statistical, choosing health over magic, for example, but on occassion, moves can be chosen. This is where the game shines in replay value, as there are numerous branching paths that expand organically as you evolve your characters throughout. Some moves only offer minor decisions, such as faster combo boosts over more power, but whenever I was challenged with taking a strong area attack over a single devastating blow, I would struggle. The amount of options are staggering and can lead character development in wild directions, but even then, I never felt the game become unbalanced.\n\nReplay value can also be found within this game, as there are multiple hidden dungeons and secret bosses that offer weapons and armor you can't find anywhere else in the game. That on top of the multiple difficulties and character customization, Breath of Death more than exceeds the measely 3$ dollar price tag. The game its bundled with is also considered rather good although I have yet to play it, so its hard for anyone to come away unsatisfied.\n\nAll in all, Breath of Death VII is worth your time no matter what you're looking for, as it welcomes both newcomers and veterans alike.

It's a call-back to all of the old school RPGs of the 8 and 16-bit days, both teasing about the ridiculous and embracing the absurd that was born out of that genre.  The mechanics are actually quite clever, not content just to replicate old methods but implementing new and clever ideas.  Breath of Death is notable for letting you choose the progression of your character, such that each character has two paths they can take, and you can pick and choose from the two.  This adds some replay value to a fairly short game.\nThe shortness, however, is a benefit.  Longer RPGs always had to rely on filler to pad the gameplay time so you'd have feel more accomplished and time to level.  The problem is, you never felt accomplished doing fetch quest #50 and getting to an area only to find your macguffin or villain had just left, of course, like always.  It's frustrating!  Cutting out all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t knocks Breath of Death down to a 5 hour playtime if you're an expert like me (hah), but that means you gain real powers at a reasonable rate and don't spend time backtracking or doing annoying quests that make no sense, except for the quests that make no sense because they're SUPPOSED to make no sense.  If we can take a lesson from Portal, it's that a game being quick doesn't mean it isn't good.  It can just mean it isn't wasting your time.\nThe game is funny, clever, and quick, and that's a good thing.","November 26, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I mean the graphic looks so dated that it can't be using too much power right.\n\nGuess what i can't play the games on my laptop because my GPU isn't supported by XNA Framework REACH!! Unsupported by REACH!! Ridiculous...\n\nBreath of Death VII is a throwback to the original Dragon Quest back in late 80's.\nIf you have played that game then youll feel right at home when playing the game. From the graphics to the music.\nOutside of nostalgia, this game also address some of features thats so annoying on that game and add some new features to keep the game up to today's standards.\n\nIf you have played JRPG back in late 80's or early 90's you must be familiar with the ridiculous encounter rate. This makes games in that era very hard and pretty bloated. You playtime is basically consists of 95% battling random enemies.\nHere you have a very low encounter rate and there is even a limit. Exp and gold drop is very benevolent. This makes the game easier to get into but also serves as double edge sword since you can basically finished the game under 6 hours.\n\nBut this is perfect for us people who works for 8 hours a day and just want to have some fun and feel some sort of progression in the game even though we are rarely playing it.\n\nThere is also a character cuztomization here. When you leveled up you have 2 choices of stats/skill growth for your characters. Adding replay values to the game and makes the game more interesting.\nThe battle system is done through 1st person view with your run of the mill command such as attack, skill or magic.\n\nTHere is also a combo system. The higher your combo count the harder your finisher will be.\nBut there is a catch, Enemy will become stronger as turn goes. SO you have to kill them ASAP.\nOh yeah you also regain ALL HEALTH and some Mp after battles depending on your performance. Making the game even much easier.\n\nOverall this is a good game. It's easy to get into. Very easy difficulty wise (i recommend playing in hard) and have good and silly dialogue albeit very scarce. All of those negative reviews about this game is basically some random kids expecting this game to have high end graphics and serious and awesome storyline of epic proportions.\n\nNo it's not. And the devs never advertised the game like that nor the tried to.\nBut if you are looking for some retro fun and that feeling of nostalgia then go get this game.","October 1, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not sure if it's appropriate to criticize level design or battle system (not to mention the story) - you don't expect "You Only Live Once" to be a good platformer, right? But it also lacks humour. I am about half through the game, ad so far, there's been not a single decent joke. Mark Leung's ROTB was way better in this (playing it was still a pain, though). What this game does, however, is repeats most common flaws of JRPGs. One can think it IS the promised parody at work, but it's done in such unentertaining way, that any good JRPG of old (not to mention modern indies) with their inner jokes and self-parodies easily beats it.\nThe JRPG tropes are widely presented - with equal parts love and criticism - in popular culture nowadays - from Eat Lead to Abenobashi to Sophie Houlden's "The Linear RPG" to Robot Chicken. To make an entertaining game, it's not enough to put in a vampire wannabe and a world map that looks like Dragon Quest's.

You will upgrade stats and unlock spells which actually spice up the game nicely.  Sadly you will need to do a WHOLE lot of grinding about half way through the game.  This game also has a neat little feature that I had/have never seen before, which is a random encounter limit.  It's basically that once you have had a certain amount of random encouters, you don't get harassed on the over world, but you also get to choose to make a battle happen so you can still level up in one area, which ties in with the grinding I mentioned earlier.\n\nThis game has no interesting gamemodes other than the story mode, but over the course of the game you can unlock some little still images that go to a bonus menu.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!\nThis game has an interesting story, basically there was a nuclear war that wiped out humanity, but the dead have come back alive, as Zombies, Vampires, etc. and started from scratch.  Throughout the game you find rements of the past and slowly peice the whole lore together.  It's a creative take for an RPG setting, and I think the game made it all work out.  The game is filled with little jokes and is clever with it's humor, it never quite feels like the game takes itself seriously which I am perfectly fine with.\n\nThe biggest problem with this and Cthulhu saves the world is that it has terrible amounts of grinding in later sections of the game, primarily once you've recieved all 4 party members, but I did play the game on expert so maybe just go with medium.\nBut if not for the grinding, I would have to give this game a 8/10.\nWith grinding a good 6/10.","December 17, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although it is fairly short, I really can't recommend this game enough.","May 22, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It takes all the best parts of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy (1 through 6) and sped up the combat system. The developer really stripped out all the 'formulas' that classic RPG system had, and reduced them to the basics. Random battles are limited. Enemies get stronger the longer the battle lasts. Hoarding items is not possible.\n\nThe story is funny too.

(players can save at any time, characters replenish their HP after each battle, the number of random encounters is limited in each dungeon...players can start battle from menu button for exp)\nBattle system has its depth to keep its tension and fun...visible enemy HP, Unite attacks, enemy's getting stronger each turn, and each character's option for level up bonus allows players to customize their own party to their style.\nThough it has its flaws, dungeon's too large and complicated and its restore points are far apart, it's still a decent RPG with its unique systems and hidden dungeon for its cheaper price.\nNow sold as double pack which contains the developer's next title "Cthulhu Saves the World", get this during Steam sale for less than 1 dollar!\nI'd recommend playing with the highest difficulty or gameplay gets too easy and boring, even the highest difficulty takes only 13 hours or so to see the ending.\n\nTips for playing:\nSave your game often especially on the highest difficulty.\nHigher combo counts deal more damages.\nUsurper is somehow vulnerable to Lita's skill "Computer Virus".\nChoose level bonus wisely (especially on the highest difficulty), or you'll get stuck.\nStick to restore points until your party grows stronger as each restore points are far apart.\n\n(Japanese translation below)\n\n==================================================\n\n元々はX-BOX Liveの配信作だった昔懐かしいグラフィックのコメディRPG、昔ながらの2D形式RPGで知られる米国Zeboyd Gamesのインディ作品です。\nRPGツクールではなく自社製ゲームエンジンで制作されています。\n第7作と書いてありますが、第1～6作は存在しませんので騙されてはいけません。\nいつでもセーブ出来る、戦闘終了と共にHPが全回復する、ダンジョンごとのランダムエンカウントの回数制限といったシステムのおかげで快適に遊べます。\n(経験値が欲しい場合はフィールド上のメニュー画面からでも戦闘を開始出来ます)\nまたレベルアップの度に成長ボーナスを選んで習得させることで自分なりのパーティーを作れます。\n更に敵のHPの可視化やキャラ同士の連携技、ターン毎に敵が強くなるおかげで戦闘に緊張感が保たれています。\nダンジョンが広すぎて迷うことが多いのとダンジョン内の回復ポイントが少ないのが難点ですが、独自のシステムと隠しダンジョンのおかげで値段以上に濃い内容となっておりRPG好きなら損はしないと思います。\n開発元の次回作Cthulhu Saves the Worldが同梱されており、セール中は1ドル未満と破格の値段で入手出来ます。\n他の難易度は簡単すぎるので最高難易度で遊ぶことをお勧めします、その場合でも13時間程度でクリアできます。\n\n役立つ情報：\nまめにセーブしましょう。\nCombo回数を溜める程に高ダメージを出せるので可能な限り溜めましょう。\nUsurperには何故かComputer Virusが効くのでLitaに覚えさせましょう。\n最高難易度では成長ボーナスをきちんと選ばないと詰みます。\nダンジョン内の回復ポイント間の距離が遠いので、強くなるまで遠出は控え回復ポイント周辺で戦闘しましょう。","August 31, 2013","true","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Breath of Death gives these same old school graphics and gameplay but also throws in some customization at level up. So your Generic Hero is definitely going to get his fireball spell, but you get to pick whether it's a high damage on a single target spell or one that spreads the love at a group. We think our nostalgia alone will carry us through this short adventure, but it's little improvements like this, coupled with the humor, that actually lets us do it. Wait until it's as cheap as you can get it - it's a dollar on Xbox Live - and then reminisce if you're older, or try to process what RPGs used to look like if you're younger.","July 13, 2011","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is pretty short; I spent less than 10 hours on Normal from start to finish, and that included exploration trying to find as much loot as I could.  Combat is turn-based; you select the tactics of each member of your party, and battle commences based on the options you selected and the capabilities of the combatants.  The game offers enough in the way of weapons, armor, and skills to remain interesting without overburdening you, and while there is certainly some level-building to do, it rarely becomes tedious before you move on to the next challenge.  The ability to choose how your characters advance in skill adds an extra dimension.  While short, Breath of Death VII is an interesting, humorous, and engaging game, and it's easy to just pick it up and play while still being more substantive than a basic puzzle game.","September 16, 2011","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even though it is short, it has unlockable difficulties and a score attack mode, which is more than you could hope for at the asking price of two bucks.

While it's only about 5 hours for a single playthrough, it's a good 5 hours full of humor, quirkiness and fun gameplay.\n\nA few of the features of the game that I appreciated most:\nRandom battles are on a counter. Most areas have 20 random battles that can be triggered by walking around or simply by choosing the fight option from the in game menu. After those battles are done, no more random battles for that area. If you feel like grinding (which I never found necessary), you can always use that fight option to do more.\nIt's not a grind. The game just flows. You never have to hang out around a city raising money to get the new best weapon or armor. You don't have to keep fighting to level up to beat a boss. It can help, but a little extra strategy goes a long way.\nThe comedy really played to my sense of humor. I found myself chuckling and laughing out loud on several occasions.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game about a 8/10.","August 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And for, what, less than a dollar?\n\nI've read that some people have a problem with the simplistic gameplay. It's a throwback to oldschool JRPG's: it's supposed to be an oldschool grindfest. The combo system was a nice change of pace, choosing level-up bonuses was fun, and while simple, the core gameplay worked.\n\nAgain, considering that I spent about $0.67 on this game, I was very impressed. I do understand that this was made for people like me, having grown up with the games this references and spoofs, but I still think newer gamers can find a good time with this game.\n\nYes. Buy this game. Be aware that it is oldschool in design, and as long as you know that, you'll be fine.\n\nOh, and pro tip: sit next to a white save circle and grind out battles until you clear dungeons worth of encounters.

Breath of Death VII knows and loves RPGs of yesteryear, and seems to have learned from mistakes of the past and delivered a breezy, straight forward, but still satisfying adventure.  Everything from the snappy (and eventually skippable/fight-on-demand) turn based combat to the ability to save anywhere makes progress relatively painless.  Humor permates throughout, and even with a few references and self aware jabs it thankfully avoids being juvenile or overly meme-y.  That doesn't undercut the staples of the genre, either: battles can be difficult unless you (quickly) do some grinding and there's a learning curve to the characters' abilities and roles.  Nothing seems insurmountable or overwhelming or cryptic; it's just a good time all around.  My only complaint is the envirnoments can be overly maze-like in same-y looking areas (the last level in particular), but that's just a matter of puzzling out the lay of the land or grabbing some graph paper if you're crazy.  Other than that I highly recommend Breath of Death if you're the least bit curious of old school console RPGs.  It's not going to steal your money or time, and will most likely put a smile on your face.","July 15, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been a fan of old school turn-based RPGs since I was a kid and this game doesn't disappoint!\n\nYou want chests full of gold and loot? This game's GOT IT!\nYou want a team of unique heroes to command and level up? This game's GOT IT!\nYou want a humorous story line and atmosphere that doesn't take itself too seriously? This game's GOT IT!\n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed the modern additions to the genre, including:\n\n- Winning battles replenishes your MP by a few points and fully restores HP.\n- Each level earned gives you a choice of two different sets of upgrades.\n- Resting in Inns doesn't involve a 20 second cut-scene or fade away\n- Each zone has a 'random encounter counter.' When it hits zero, you can explore freely!\n- Monsters have a 'momentum' mechanic. Monsters get more powerful every round, so kill them quick!\n- On the flip side of the monster's momentum, the heroes have a combo counter. Each attack adds a stacking multiplier. These are then triggered by certain powers (look for the "Combo Boost+" attribute)  for devastating effect.\n\n\nNow, I've gushed enough. So let's throw in some negative features that could have been improved on.\n\n1) Level design was particularly mazelike and seemingly spiteful\nFans of the genre will no doubt recognize a good old fashioned labyrinth, but these were particularly mean. Lots of interlinking circular corridors with no interactive items (READ: nothing pertinent to the story or game). In other words, the maps seemed extra large and complex for no apparent reason... get used to long hallways that lead to an empty dead end. >_<  Oh yeah, and the occasional chest you can't open! I think it was done for comedic purposes, but maybe I missed something?\n\n2) Limited Shops\nI think there were only 3 shops in the whole game? And they only sold like 5 items a piece. Then, whatever loot you find in the dungeons were usually either slightly better or exactly the same as what you just bought. >_<\n\n3) No Side Quests, Hidden Easter Eggs, or Map abilities (That I'm aware of)\nThe game is extremely linear, extremely straightforward and extremely to the point. Which is not necessarily a  bad thing (actually it was sort of a welcome change in my opinion!). Nonetheless, I think I ought to throw it out there.\n\n4) Only about 10 hours of content.\nAll this shortage of content... I can't say I'm really surprised it only took me 10 hours to hack and slash through it all.\n\n\nTo sum up, I recommend this game whole heartedly as a fun spoof of traditional RPGs, particularly since it was included in the $3 dollar bundle with Cthulu Saves the World!","December 11, 2014","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Did the authors ever even play an old-school turn based RPG at all - much less from start to finish?\n\nEverything is wrong.  Equipment balance is nonexistant - you barely ever get new stuff - when you do, it tends to either micro-break the game, or make no difference.  Treasure chests never contain anything of import.  Map designs are god-awful mazes.  Encounters are offensively easy (every difficulty except the super-hard difficulty) or ok-or-impossible (super-hard difficulty) - the randomizer swing, given their stupid fully-recover-HP-every-battle balance, turns the game into more of a slot machine.\n\nThe music is ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL!  Seriously.  Who could ever dream of thinking this music belonged in a finished game!?!?  I could ♥♥♥♥ out a better RPG soundtrack in a week (and have).\n\nAdd to it a completely underwhelming storyline that fails at being funny and you have an jRPG that fails at literally every single point that a jRPG should strive to achieve.  It's like the wanted me to hate the game.\n\nIn that case - well done, Zeboyd!

It's insanely cheap, and the maker of it obviously has a lot of love for old-school RPG mechanics.\n\nThere are some interesting improvements on the old school formuia, too. Random battles are there, but only a limited number in each area. Once you run that number down to 0, no more random battles. You can still select "Fight!" from the menu at any time, though. That not only eliminates the endless random battles old RPGs had, but also allows you to go almost immediately from battle to battle if you're grinding.\n\nI also liked the branching level-up system. You get to decide how you want your characters to specialize. As a hint, ALWAYS pick the +1 attack when it's there!! It literally means +1 attack, not +1 TO attack.\n\nThe game is a decent length (I think 10ish hours?), filled with satirical humor, solid gameplay, and a ridiculously cheap price.

Even though you never see your charathers in the battle, its still pretty involving, with stat buffs and debuffs as well as mana preservation, although it isn't quite as stressful as the games it's actually based on.\n\nThe game helps you along with some major streamlining, especially in the inventory and telling you where to go next, although you can sequence break if you are willing to overlevel a bit.\n\nAlthough if this is the first time you've played one of these in a while, the game will probbably seem monstrously difficult, especially with its unique health refill feature giving them an excuse to use a set monster encounter rate.\n\nIn all honesty, I think you should use PSN, GoG, wiiware, xbox arcade, ceirtain indie releases, a compilation game (I can think of several sega genesis sets that include three phantasy star games, not to mention other awesome things in other genres) to experience this sub-genre in pure form.\n\nThis game and its companion provide some light entertainment, but the gameplay "outweighs" it, so you have a system that requires a degree of commitment to come to terms with, but due to the fact that you know it's a parody, you don't really have the motivation.","November 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

You run around on a big map to get places, then you run around on a smaller map once you get there. All the while, you get in random battles and gain experience (and of course loot) to level up.\n\nFrom what I can tell so far, the story basically drives you to never need to visit the same town (or really any location) twice, which is a nice change from other games in this genre, which tend to have you based in one location for a while, completing quests nearby, then moving on to the next "base."\n\nWhile this game may be meant as a joke, it's actually fun to play.

It calls back to a lot of the same tropes and ideas that those RPGs followed, and then takes the mick out of them, all the way down to its name.\nIt continually puts chests behind locked doors and taunts you with text bubbles saying, "Somehow, you just know that there's treasure behind this door.  Too bad you're never getting in."\nOr variants of that.  Every character is undead, from the heroicly stoic but mute skeleton Dem, the cheerful talkative ghost who forces herself into your party, much like a geeky vampire and then a French Zombie prince.\nCombat is fast and simple, the majority of it you're able to just breeze past by hitting the auto attack feature every turn, however against bosses and a few of the much harder fights you actually need to think about what you need to take down first and what do to it with.\nFantastic Presentation, get it if you like old schools.","September 9, 2011","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Breath of Death is a major call back to the older Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games. The game plays out in a turn based battle system and you get an option to customize your characters at each level up. The game is very streamlined in battles because enemies get a little stronger after each turn that goes by. This makes the player try to finish battles as fast as possible, while still being efficient with MP.\n\nThe music isn't the stuff of legend, but it does a good job of keeping the old school feel without sounding like it came out of a Gameboy. The story is quite funny with a lot of neat references and it does a great job of not trying to be too epic. The game itself is rather short and can be finished in 5-10 hours depending on how often you get lost in dungeons. Most of the dungeons are pretty balanced, not too confusing and not too easy. The final dungeon is a little long though.\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially at the price they are selling it for.","February 23, 2014","true","46.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game plays like Dragon Quest/Warrior IV with slight graphical enhancements.  The story isn't particularly notable, but the writing is mildly amusing, with subtle nods to other classic RPGs that probably only fans of the genre would recognize.\n\nOverworld maps are linear, but the dungeons become increasingly labyrinthine, with chests hidden away in remote areas and dead ends.  Combat is more interesting thanks to the combo system and unity attacks, and random battles now have a quota - reach the quota in an area and you no longer have to worry about battling monsters (unless you choose to trigger a battle).  Characters have two choices of gaining abilities and/or stats per level up, until level 30 (when they just gain +10 to every stat).\n\nThere isn't much to do after you finish the game the first time.  There's a "secret" superboss that isn't difficult to find the first time around, straight out of the Atari era.  There's also Score Attack mode, which I thought might be a Boss Rush of sorts - but instead it's just another complete playthrough of the game, except that you gain "points" for taking on bosses underleveled.","February 17, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat goes fast and is very well balanced, conveyance is straightforward, difficulty curve is steady, music is okay. Everything works. The level up bonus system gives a nice, tangible way to spec out your team. The combo system adds some good risk management. Battle limits ease the tedium of random encounters while still challenging the player. The writing is good and funny, not actually laughing funny, more of a slight smile funny, but still. On the down side, the level design is abysmal. The dungeons are literally just mazes with no logic to their purpose or nature. The dungeon crawl is also very shallow. Aside from bosses, there are no events, and chests typically just contain boring junk like money or potions or things you could've just bought. But still, it's a nice throwbaack to the classic feel with fresh design sense thrown in. I've payed much more for much worse.","July 15, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just beat the game on normal, so here's my impressions on the game. I completed it during the course of many days, playing bit by bit.\n\nI bought this together with Cthulhu Saves The World for like two euros I believe and as far as this game is concerned, in my humble opinion it 's totally worth its share of the price, and perhaps even more.\n\nWhile it does take about 4 hours to beat if you are familiar with jrpgs and are kinda power-gamey, there is fun to be had in this short-duration homage to classic jrpgs. The characters are quite interesting, it often pokes fun at many jrpg cliches and while it may seem outdated and silly, I believe it's well worth the small fee if you're a fan of the genre.\n\nFinal Verdict - To buy or not to buy?\n\nBuy: If you like funny jrpgs with memorable characters.\nBuy on Sale only: If you like parody jrpgs but you're afraid that it might not be worth the full price.\nDon't Buy: If you don't like old-school graphics and grindy gameplay, as well as humour that sometimes fails to be funny.","July 19, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game plays like Dragon Quest/Warrior IV with slight graphical enhancements.  The story isn't particularly notable, but the writing is mildly amusing, with subtle nods to other classic RPGs that probably only fans of the genre would recognize.\n\nOverworld maps are linear, but the dungeons become increasingly labyrinthine, with chests hidden away in remote areas and dead ends.  Combat is more interesting thanks to the combo system and unity attacks, and random battles now have a quota - reach the quota in an area and you no longer have to worry about battling monsters (unless you choose to trigger a battle).  Characters have two choices of gaining abilities and/or stats per level up, until level 30 (when they just gain +10 to every stat).\n\nThere isn't much to do after you finish the game the first time.  There's a "secret" superboss that isn't difficult to find the first time around, straight out of the Atari era.  There's also Score Attack mode, which I thought might be a Boss Rush of sorts - but instead it's just another complete playthrough of the game, except that you gain "points" for taking on bosses underleveled.","February 17, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Breath of Death is a major call back to the older Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games. The game plays out in a turn based battle system and you get an option to customize your characters at each level up. The game is very streamlined in battles because enemies get a little stronger after each turn that goes by. This makes the player try to finish battles as fast as possible, while still being efficient with MP.\n\nThe music isn't the stuff of legend, but it does a good job of keeping the old school feel without sounding like it came out of a Gameboy. The story is quite funny with a lot of neat references and it does a great job of not trying to be too epic. The game itself is rather short and can be finished in 5-10 hours depending on how often you get lost in dungeons. Most of the dungeons are pretty balanced, not too confusing and not too easy. The final dungeon is a little long though.\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially at the price they are selling it for.","February 23, 2014","true","46.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as Dem, in a world where the only thing left on the world is death and monsters. You'll meet an array of strange characters, but understand the game is far from difficult. The game is beatable in about 2-4 hours for even a casual player, and as you'd imagine, lacks a lot of depth story-wise. The level up mechanic is neat, wich a simple multiple choice system allowing for different builds and experiences with each playthru. The characters are one dimensional and a romance between Dem and amother character comes out of nowhere. However, the game makes sure you understand that is somewhat the point. Not just a traditional JRPG experience, but a meta experience of classical RPG and video game tropes. If you don't mind a game that lacks some depth to it, but has a quirky sense of humor, you'll love Breath of Death VII - The Beginning.","February 18, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat goes fast and is very well balanced, conveyance is straightforward, difficulty curve is steady, music is okay. Everything works. The level up bonus system gives a nice, tangible way to spec out your team. The combo system adds some good risk management. Battle limits ease the tedium of random encounters while still challenging the player. The writing is good and funny, not actually laughing funny, more of a slight smile funny, but still. On the down side, the level design is abysmal. The dungeons are literally just mazes with no logic to their purpose or nature. The dungeon crawl is also very shallow. Aside from bosses, there are no events, and chests typically just contain boring junk like money or potions or things you could've just bought. But still, it's a nice throwbaack to the classic feel with fresh design sense thrown in. I've payed much more for much worse.","July 15, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are quite interesting, it often pokes fun at many jrpg cliches and while it may seem outdated and silly, I believe it's well worth the small fee if you're a fan of the genre.\n\nFinal Verdict - To buy or not to buy?\n\nBuy: If you like funny jrpgs with memorable characters.\nBuy on Sale only: If you like parody jrpgs but you're afraid that it might not be worth the full price.\nDon't Buy: If you don't like old-school graphics and grindy gameplay, as well as humour that sometimes fails to be funny.","July 19, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The major differences are mostly positive: it has much smoother gameplay than the early console games did, more frequent fighting, less tedium in the interface, and rapidly accessible progression. The downsides are minor: the story is very tongue-in-cheek which is somewhat a departure from the stoic tones of the originals, it is easier to get into and therefore requires less commitment (which is barely a negative) and the story is not excellent thus far.

You have your party and you explore dungeons, towns, and the overworld. As with most JRPG’s you can find a wide variety of armour and weapons, each with their own special abilities. The only feature that separates this game from any other JRPG is its combat. It is turn based, with the unique twist; after each turn the monsters slowly get more powerful. Ultimately all this normally does is forces you to use the spells that cause the most damage, and subsequently use up the most of your magic points. After the battle is over your characters will regain full health and a portion of their magic points back. This seems cool at first, but it gets pretty repetitive. Also, each area has a predefined amount of monsters you can fight, which for me really encouraged exploration as I wouldn’t have to fight endless enemies. 6.5/10\n\nSound/Music: I enjoyed the soundtrack, and all of the other sounds were just generic RPG noises. 7/10\n\nGraphics- They are stylized to look retro and I believe it works out pretty well for the most part. The overworld and towns always look pretty good, and handcrafted. The dungeons on the other hand look all pretty similar and boring. I’m a sucker for post apocalyptic settings so I did really enjoy most of the scenes.  7/10\n\nStory: It’s set in a post apocalyptic world where the undead rule. It’s a cool setting and there are interesting characters. Jokes are rampant and most of them are pretty funny. This game is pretty short and only took me about two hours to finish. This is by far the best aspect of the game. 7.5/10\n\nSummary: If you like retro RPS’s then this is for you. Well the actually gameplay is very generic the story and characters allows this game to rise above some of its competitors. The soundtrack is pleasant, and jokes are everywhere.\n\nPros:\n+Story\n+Characters\n+Soundtrack\n\nNeutral:\n*Sound\n*Combat/Gameplay\n\nNegative:\n-Length and Replay Value\n\nFinal Score: 7/10\nRecommended Purchase Price: Full Price\n","May 23, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a sitcom about a topic you really like, so you check it out. You know these sitcoms where the laugh track is the only indication that something funny just happened? This is like one of these sitcoms, only without the laugh track. The title is by far the funniest part of this game. There are lots of jokes or, more accurately, things the devs thought would pass as jokes. The formula seemed to be as follows:\n- Take classic JRPG trope.\n- Put said trope in the game, with a note saying "think of funny subversion later".\n- Get bored and work on something else.\nThe game ends up playing straight all of the things it's supposed to subvert, with a few schoolyard level jokes tacked on where there was space.\n\nNow, imagine watching said sitcom (why are you doing that again?) with a controller in your hand. Imagine that every few seconds, the image freezes, and the only way to continue watching is to press the "A" button between four and seven bazillion times. "Silly me", you exclaim. "I forgot to turn on the difficulty!" So you press the difficulty button on your remote, and you find out that you are already on the highest possible difficulty. You start the game over on "easy", thinking that maybe there's a bug where the highest difficulty is actually the easiest one, and indeed, switching to easy has a significant advantage: You only have to press "A" between four and six bazillion times because the enemies have lower health now. Anyway, save for boss battles, the difficulty is of virtually no consequence. You have lots of fancy special moves to use in fights, a combo count to build up, mana points to manage, which is all fabulous except for the complete lack of a bloody difference it makes. There's just no incentive to get into all these intricacies of the battle system when you fare just as good spamming your basic attack over and over. After each battle, your health is fully restored, so it doesn't even matter how often you're hit, as long as at least one member of your party survives.\n\n"Well then", I hear you say, "the battle system may be an unfortunate abomination of nature, but when I watch Passions, I have to hit my telly every few minutes to get a clear image too, so that's okay as long as I can enjoy the story." First off, go get a new television set. Second, to enjoy the story, there would have to be a story first. I haven't finished the game (in much the same way I didn't finish pouring that bucket of battery acid over there on my head), so maybe the story picks up somewhere after the two-hour-mark, but I doubt it. So far, it's been: "You're a hero. Supposedly witty comment. Go east and kill something. Unfunny joke. Now go north and kill something else." You get party members who are supposedly parodies of some kind. One wants to be a vampire! It's funny because everyone hates Twilight! Why aren't you laughing yet! Said party members provide the crucial addition of being able to push the "A" button more often per round.\n\nTo summarize: I do not recommend buying this sitcom game. Want a funny video game? Go play Monkey Island. Want a nice, retro JRPG? Go play the first few Final Fantasy. They even have a few jokes in them, which is more than I can say about this. Want to donate two quid to charity? I guess this would count.\nI can't say anything about the bundled game, "Cthulhu Saves the World", because frankly, when I think about "playing" a second "game" from the same people, that bucket of acid suddenly seems oddly appealing.\n\nJust my two cents dollars, which I will never get back.\n- Betta George","May 1, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've finished a few old-school JRPGs like Mother and Final Fantasy I, so I went into the game expecting a pretty average experience.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhen I got into my first few battles, I was fairly surprised. The menus are streamlined and though they lack a memory feature (auto-selecting the last command) it's possible to breeze through several battles in no time at all. The ability to auto-heal after every battle was a nice addition too, and it fit well into the game's mythos of undead characters. On the other hand, after playing a few hundred battles I found myself growing weary of the system. Since you auto-heal after every battle, it's possible to blaze through battles with reckless abandon, rapidly mashing A. And for a good 60% of my fights, I found myself doing exactly that. It was only during bosses and particularly challenging encounters did I find myself repetitively spamming my most powerful physical moves. And really, that isn't very much fun either.\n\nSTORYLINE\nThe storyline, though, makes up for that. The tone is fairly light-hearted and the game never tries to take itself too seriously. Breath of Fire VII is a parody of Dragon Quest games, you see, and it knows trying to pull off a huge, epic storyline won't accomplish much. Conversations are kept short and to-the-point, groan worthy video-game references are kept to a minimum (thankfuly) and the game always lets you know where to go next. Overall, the storyline does it's job.\n\nPRESENTATION\nOverall, the game has a very low-budget feel. Super-saturated colors are everywhere, and all of the character graphics have a very blobby pillow-shaded look to them. I understand the game is going for a retro look, but if you're going to imitate the classics at least choose better contemporaries like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI. Just look at games like Echoes of Eternea...It's possible to make gorgeous low-budget retro JRPGS without sacrificing quality.\n\nSo all in all, would I recommend Breath of Death VII? Yes...but only to passionate fans of Dragon Quest looking for an old-school experience. For everyone else, I'd say pass this one up. There are better ways to spend your time.","December 30, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your characters even automatically heal after every battle - less time flipping through menu after menu with upkeep.\n\nIn this way, it's a bit of a "My First RPG". it's the most approachable RPG I've ever played and brings enough "new" to the genre to recommend.

If you get into it, you can play it several times, but there are no achievements sadly.\n\nThe story is kind of lacking, and I was disappointed in the limited visuals (no animations or sound variations for any attack you choose)\n\nBut, for 3 bucks on a 2 pack of games, I got my money out of just this one, and I still have CStW left.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if most people will like this game, it does contain a ton of references to older dialog and content, much of which will be lost on those who have not played the 8-Bit era much.

Breath of Death is a major call back to the older Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games. The game plays out in a turn based battle system and you get an option to customize your characters at each level up. The game is very streamlined in battles because enemies get a little stronger after each turn that goes by. This makes the player try to finish battles as fast as possible, while still being efficient with MP.\n\nThe music isn't the stuff of legend, but it does a good job of keeping the old school feel without sounding like it came out of a Gameboy. The story is quite funny with a lot of neat references and it does a great job of not trying to be too epic. The game itself is rather short and can be finished in 5-10 hours depending on how often you get lost in dungeons. Most of the dungeons are pretty balanced, not too confusing and not too easy. The final dungeon is a little long though.\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially at the price they are selling it for.","February 23, 2014","true","46.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/107300/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","Breath of Death VII is a first attempt at making a game. A bit of a messy one, but it was made by two people so... what the hell! I'll admit, I'm not the biggest of JRPG fans out there, and so this game definitely has a least-common-denominator effect on me as a gamer, but as far as JRPGs go... this game has some serious flaws.\n\nFor one, the game can feel very much like Final Fantasy XIII- where you walk down long corridors, run into random enemies, and deviate from the path only a little bit (but it can be a little frustrating at which path will take you to potential treasure, and which will take you further towards the boss... and away from the potential treasure). However, Final Fantasy XIII is better than Breah of Death VII (Oh, god, it's come to this. Next I'll start saying that I actually like Transformers) in the sense that the characters had unique interactions... and I'm trying incredibly hard to say that with a straight face. What I mean to say is, that there was a little variation in FF XIII's gameplay during the long, boring corridor walks. But BoD VII has one conversation per dungeon. Period. And I feel like making my same criticism that I made towards Soul Gambler. This game shouldn't be too difficult to have little bits of banter and fun conversation between characters, to pace the adventure. But it just turns into walking... and attacking.\n\nBut what about attacking? Let me tell you about Breath of Death VII's strategy in their game. Hit, hit, and keep hitting until they die. Until you get to the one bugger who doesn't take that. And you then realise at that point that all that "free choice" you had during those level-up moments were actually not as free as you suspected. I just figured that each bonus would be balanced with another, and they are most certainly not. There are highly essential spells and attacks you HAVE to learn, and if you choose the incorrect ones (the ones that break your oh-so-special combo meter... you're screwed). This is a massive flaw in crafting an RPG that flows with the player, but instead demands the player pay close attention to what the game wants you to choose. Yes, I know, an RPG-er needs to pay strict attention to their bonuses, but a game should accomodate to the player's decisions. Or else the game sucks. Like Final Fantasy XIII sucks.\n\n"But what about the other elements of Breath of Death VII?" you may ask. "The sound's good, isn't it?" Yeah, sure, sound's fine. "And aren't the graphics great?" Well, that's where I'd have to stop you and kindly let you hold my holy frag grenade as I sprint away from the conversation entirely. No, I don't hate 8-bit graphics. I personally think that older NES and SNES game graphics age far better than older 3D graphics like N64 and PS2. And I think the game's graphics on it's sprites, portraits, enemies, and world is just fine.\n\nSo what's my problem with the graphics? The blackness. Beyond the dungeons there is a lot of black nothingness extending for what I'd expect to be all of eternity, which makes me feel all the more... isolated in the game. And not in the "I'm alone in a cave, and filled with suspense," kind of isolation. I mean the, "Well, that's where the wall ends, because the designers couldn't just repeat a bloody rock texture," kind of isolation. And when you fight enemies, there's no backdrop or really any animation to it. When you travel down stairs or out of towns, there's a neat pixellated background animation for that. Couldn't the designers have done something to make the battles less... spontaneous-feeling? And add a bit of color to the battles? It just feels like lazy desing to me, that's all.\n\nSo, finally, it comes down to story. I'll dedicate this entire blank space to the substance of Breath of Death VII's story in these paragraphs -> (                                                 ). So, yes, there's basically no story. You find a ghost, you go on random adventures! Something about crystals! I think! The story ambles where it wants to go (and, for the most part, is relatively linear)- but heavily caters to the heavily game-reference-laden dialogue. I believe every conversation I had with every character had some sort of other video game reference. And a few made me laugh. Such as the little conversation Dem (by the way, Dem Bones? I laughed at that name when I first saw it.) had with Sara- where he just looked at her, and she said "I'm fine"- and the game announced my relationship with Sara went up 10 points. I hadn't laughed so hard before in a game. However, the rest of the references in most of those conversations made me realize a sort of... predictability in the game. It goes from reading clever, witty dialogue to a game of "Spot that Reference!", where the entire conversation hinges on some Zelda II "I Am Error" joke.\n\nI don't hate Breath of Death VII, much like I don't hate broccoli. But if you invited me to a dinner party and offered me sweet corn or broccoli? I'd pick the sweet corn, because I prefer the taste. But I wouldn't look at you strangely if you took the broccoli. Just as I don't think anyone who buys Breath of Death VII is mentally challenge. For a game made by two people, it's decent. It just happened to balance a bit to the "I don't quite like it" side of my video game scale.","September 9, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combos are built up with most attacks, while others execute the combo to deal additional damage. The same system was used in Cthulhu Saves The World, which makes since as they were made by the same team. at first, battles may seema little crazy, but after you play for a while and get the hang of it, you sort of get a rhythm going for combos. The most difficult battle i beileve for me was the final battle, which makes sense, it took a few tries. Exploring every path yields you equipment rewards, as you would expect, as well as some additional experience(depending on how you play). Random encounters are done in a rather neat way. In an area there are a set number of random encounters that could occur. You can not care about this number and carry on, or, hang around a save point and battle them all at once for extra insurance against randomly getting killed when you were almost out of the dungeon. this can be done by simply opening the menu and clicking on Battle or Fight or whatever the command was titled. It's not the longest RPG, in fact, i would call it on the short side, but there is humor thrown in to give more of a personality to the characters.\nAt the end of the day, i felt like i recieved my money's worth out of it, however, it should be noted that I bought it when it was on sale, and it also came with its companion, Cthulhu Save The World.\n","December 31, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features a fast turn-based combat, graphics reminiscent of 8-16bit RPGs, many dungeons and locations to delve and many more features. Its also a parody of other RPGs that came before, hence the the ridiculously long title that is apparently part of a series of games. I can’t imagine what game they could possibly be poking fun at with the title. The game takes many chances to poke fun at itself, at other RPGs and the characters as well. They also like to break the 4th wall from time to time too. But it all fits into the universe somehow without feeling awkward or thrown in. The campaign itself is around 4-6 hours with additional modes and difficulty levels to keep you challenged\n\nCombat\nThere are quite a few interesting features to the combat and leveling up system. The leveling up system was fairly deep but simple to understand in this game. You had two choices anytime your character leveled up and each choice had its trade-offs. It could be that the one spell hit all enemies but for lower damage or you raised specific stats. This kept things simple when leveling up and I rather liked it. The leveling system seems to end at level 30 though and after level 30 you just get a simple stats boost. Which I actually like that the end of the leveling system is reachable. Some games have the end levels at such a high level you have to do a ridiculous amount of grinding to get the spells you want. BOD, thankfully, avoids doing that.\n\nThe turn-based combat system has a combo count system. The higher your combo count from attacks, the more damage certain combo-breaking attacks did to the enemy. And you have a pretty wide array of spells to choose from. However, some of these spells included combo breaking so you had to plan out how you were going to attack your enemy as well as keeping your companions alive. You’ll need to pull off those combo-breaking moves at the right time too because as each turn passes, your enemies grow in strength and hurt harder and harder every round. So this prevents you from using any sort of tanking strategy, you’ll have to take them down quickly.\n\nOverall though, I didn’t find the combat system as satisfying as I would have liked. It was challenging enough, but I felt like it was in constant conflict with itself. Reason being is that in order to regenerate your magic points, which are needed for your techniques, was difficult to do. You couldn’t regenerate your magic points without either visiting an inn, finishing a battle quickly or find a save point. There were no potions to recover them. So even if you try and conserve your magic points, this can get you in trouble as the monsters hit harder and harder each turn. The conflict, to me, is that your only viable spells in this game are damaging attacks but so very often you needed to use very costly spells in order to survive all the monsters. This could lead you to getting stuck in the middle of the dungeon if you ran out of magic points all of the sudden. I felt like there should have been something added to make the techniques more interesting, rather than they just be primarily damaging attacks, healing or stat boosting abilities. Lita did have some techniques that let her bind or put enemies to sleep, but far too often the enemies would resist or be immune to it, so I quit bothering using them as the game progressed.\n\nPC Settings\nBreath of Death VII has fairly basic settings, unsurprising for a 2D game. It only supports 1280x720, 640x360 and fullscreen mode stretched. As BoD is light on effects, there isn’t any other visual settings to customize. The game does run superbly though and is very well optimized. Remapping and controllers are supported as well but not mouse inputs. It’s also got a reasonable soundtrack for such a "budget" game. I didn’t encounter any crashing or bugs during my playthrough.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBreath of Death VII: The Beginning is an interesting jRPG. There’s plenty of amusing references and humor to keep a somewhat dry story going. The battle system isn't my favorite. I feel like their efforts to refine the jRPG typical battle system has created conflicts. However, it does make sure you’re paying attention but can be frustrating at times. If you're into jRPGs, this is one to check out. It’s short and refined to a polished shine. Plus, its ridiculously cheap as it comes comboed with Cthulhu Saves the World. If you’re not wanting a 40 hour epic, give Breath of Death VII: The Beginning a try.\n\nA Paladin’s Steam Review: Cthulhu Saves the World\nRead the Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nPost about the updated version of this review.[wp.me]","May 28, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Comparatively, the pixel art for enemies is generally pretty nice.\n\n-----------\nThe Good:\n- Random Encounter System. Each area has a set number of random encounters. After you fight that many, no more will appear as you walk around, although you can still seek out as many enemies as you wish through the "Fight" menu option if you need one more level before a boss or such. This system is...interesting. It's designed presumably to not be frustrating for people who get lost easily, but I found myself often simply exploiting the system by doing all 20 Fights that a late-game dungeon had, right next to the MP-restore point, and then going about my merry way through the dungeon totally risk free, a far cry from my memories of, say, fighting my way through FFVI dungeons with very limited resources and the constant hanging threat of game-over.\n\n- Other "ease of play" changes, like above, is that you can save anywhere, and health auto-fully restores for free after each fight, which does streamline things, but also feel like betrayals of the genre to me. Putting it in good however simply because I don't think my opinion here outweighs the majority of people who were likely quite happy to see these features.\n\n- The Humor. It being a parody, a fair sum of the humor unfortunately relies heavily on pop culture references and meta-humor about the genre. If that's your thing, then BuyBuyBuy, but chances are you've heard 9/10ths of it before elsewhere and the other 1/10ths isn't that funny to begin with. Maybe it's sad that that's all we can expect, but it comes with the territory. Thankfully, it doesn't feel as forced as it could be, and it's spaced out enough for the dosage to be non-toxic.\n\n-The truly funny moments come whenever it stops trying so damn hard to reference older games, and just plays with it's own setting and characters.\n\n\n---------\nThe Bad:\n- Lazy port. There's a joke about ports in the opening, which should be a good sign, but then there's no way to quit the game without either dying and returning to the main menu, or killing the game process manually. It also has a permanently floating window, so good luck alt-tabbing out while the game is open.\n\n- The music.  Ruins music is good, town music is generic, the rest is ♥♥♥ and the battle music will make you want to tear your ears off by the end. Mute it, listen to War & Peace on Audiobook and you'll be more stimulated.\n\n- The plot. They didn't even try, which is the one sin an RPG plot can commit that is worse than having an incredibly over-elaborate setting and plot. The fact that the setting here could have been very interesting is what really twists the knife.\n\n-----------\nThe Mixed:\n- Hard Mode is actually hard. Which I would normally put as a good, except that the difficulty curve isn't truly apparent until the back half of the game, by which point some players may feel like they can neither progress nor justify restarting. It is always possible to simply grind through in that situation, though a re-consideration of tactics is usually that is necessary.\n\n- Character building. It's a fun system, could be expanded on but it's tight and simple as is. There is one issues however that I draw against it. Every level-up each character's build options differ, but there's no in-game way of looking ahead of each character's progression. You can know from the archetype that Mages should have high Magic, but there's no way to know ahead of time what skillset your mage will learn have or what mutations each skill can undergo. This may cause some players to consult a guide, and anytime any game pushes it's player towards doing so, it loses major points.\n\n- Interesting Setting, but grossly underused. Similarly, almost all of the dungeons are incredibly bland, but the ones set in the pre-war ruins are a real treat to explore. It feels like there was so very much wasted potential there.\n\n------------------\nFinal Judgement:\nFor me, it easily passes the rule of thumb: Dollar for every hour of true enjoyment. It's price however certainly helps with that.\n\nRecommended for: People who want a very cheap short RPG that isn't in RPGMaker and generally doesn't have aneurism inducing dialogue. You get what you pay for on Steam, but with this price, you actually get just a little bit more.","March 6","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features a fast turn-based combat, graphics reminiscent of 8-16bit RPGs, many dungeons and locations to delve and many more features. Its also a parody of other RPGs that came before, hence the the ridiculously long title that is apparently part of a series of games. I can’t imagine what game they could possibly be poking fun at with the title. The game takes many chances to poke fun at itself, at other RPGs and the characters as well. They also like to break the 4th wall from time to time too. But it all fits into the universe somehow without feeling awkward or thrown in. The campaign itself is around 4-6 hours with additional modes and difficulty levels to keep you challenged\n\nCombat\nThere are quite a few interesting features to the combat and leveling up system. The leveling up system was fairly deep but simple to understand in this game. You had two choices anytime your character leveled up and each choice had its trade-offs. It could be that the one spell hit all enemies but for lower damage or you raised specific stats. This kept things simple when leveling up and I rather liked it. The leveling system seems to end at level 30 though and after level 30 you just get a simple stats boost. Which I actually like that the end of the leveling system is reachable. Some games have the end levels at such a high level you have to do a ridiculous amount of grinding to get the spells you want. BOD, thankfully, avoids doing that.\n\nThe turn-based combat system has a combo count system. The higher your combo count from attacks, the more damage certain combo-breaking attacks did to the enemy. And you have a pretty wide array of spells to choose from. However, some of these spells included combo breaking so you had to plan out how you were going to attack your enemy as well as keeping your companions alive. You’ll need to pull off those combo-breaking moves at the right time too because as each turn passes, your enemies grow in strength and hurt harder and harder every round. So this prevents you from using any sort of tanking strategy, you’ll have to take them down quickly.\n\nOverall though, I didn’t find the combat system as satisfying as I would have liked.

The conflict, to me, is that your only viable spells in this game are damaging attacks but so very often you needed to use very costly spells in order to survive all the monsters. This could lead you to getting stuck in the middle of the dungeon if you ran out of magic points all of the sudden.

Comparatively, the pixel art for enemies is generally pretty nice.\n\n-----------\nThe Good:\n- Random Encounter System. Each area has a set number of random encounters. After you fight that many, no more will appear as you walk around, although you can still seek out as many enemies as you wish through the "Fight" menu option if you need one more level before a boss or such. This system is...interesting. It's designed presumably to not be frustrating for people who get lost easily, but I found myself often simply exploiting the system by doing all 20 Fights that a late-game dungeon had, right next to the MP-restore point, and then going about my merry way through the dungeon totally risk free, a far cry from my memories of, say, fighting my way through FFVI dungeons with very limited resources and the constant hanging threat of game-over.\n\n- Other "ease of play" changes, like above, is that you can save anywhere, and health auto-fully restores for free after each fight, which does streamline things, but also feel like betrayals of the genre to me. Putting it in good however simply because I don't think my opinion here outweighs the majority of people who were likely quite happy to see these features.\n\n- The Humor. It being a parody, a fair sum of the humor unfortunately relies heavily on pop culture references and meta-humor about the genre. If that's your thing, then BuyBuyBuy, but chances are you've heard 9/10ths of it before elsewhere and the other 1/10ths isn't that funny to begin with. Maybe it's sad that that's all we can expect, but it comes with the territory. Thankfully, it doesn't feel as forced as it could be, and it's spaced out enough for the dosage to be non-toxic.\n\n-The truly funny moments come whenever it stops trying so damn hard to reference older games, and just plays with it's own setting and characters.\n\n\n---------\nThe Bad:\n- Lazy port. There's a joke about ports in the opening, which should be a good sign, but then there's no way to quit the game without either dying and returning to the main menu, or killing the game process manually. It also has a permanently floating window, so good luck alt-tabbing out while the game is open.\n\n- The music.  Ruins music is good, town music is generic, the rest is ♥♥♥ and the battle music will make you want to tear your ears off by the end. Mute it, listen to War & Peace on Audiobook and you'll be more stimulated.\n\n- The plot. They didn't even try, which is the one sin an RPG plot can commit that is worse than having an incredibly over-elaborate setting and plot. The fact that the setting here could have been very interesting is what really twists the knife.\n\n-----------\nThe Mixed:\n- Hard Mode is actually hard. Which I would normally put as a good, except that the difficulty curve isn't truly apparent until the back half of the game, by which point some players may feel like they can neither progress nor justify restarting. It is always possible to simply grind through in that situation, though a re-consideration of tactics is usually that is necessary.\n\n- Character building. It's a fun system, could be expanded on but it's tight and simple as is. There is one issues however that I draw against it. Every level-up each character's build options differ, but there's no in-game way of looking ahead of each character's progression. You can know from the archetype that Mages should have high Magic, but there's no way to know ahead of time what skillset your mage will learn have or what mutations each skill can undergo. This may cause some players to consult a guide, and anytime any game pushes it's player towards doing so, it loses major points.\n\n- Interesting Setting, but grossly underused. Similarly, almost all of the dungeons are incredibly bland, but the ones set in the pre-war ruins are a real treat to explore. It feels like there was so very much wasted potential there.\n\n------------------\nFinal Judgement:\nFor me, it easily passes the rule of thumb: Dollar for every hour of true enjoyment. It's price however certainly helps with that.\n\nRecommended for: People who want a very cheap short RPG that isn't in RPGMaker and generally doesn't have aneurism inducing dialogue. You get what you pay for on Steam, but with this price, you actually get just a little bit more.","March 6","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of them are terrible. Surprisingly, this one is not.\n\nGraphics\nThe pixel graphics are sharp. It has an aspect ratio that works well on modern monitors. The animations are fluid yet don't look too "modern".\n\nSound\nPleasant soundtrack that pays tribute to NES games of yore. Highlfy enjoyable.\n\nGameplay\nThough this looks a lot like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, it plays differently in many ways. And, in fact, it skewers the tropes from many of those games. One aspect that is refreshing is that if a member of your party dies, he gets revived automatically if you win the battle. By no means does this mean the game is easy. It's easy to die.\n\nRecommendation\nI don't have a lot of time to play games. I run my own business, and when I'm not working, I got to take care of my family. The fact I've already spent 10 hours playing this game says a lot. The most important aspect of this game, for me, is that it's easy to pick up and play. Within 5 minutes, I can have fun. Then I can save and return when I've got some idle time. Hence, I highly recommend this.","January 17","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first Zeboyd game, and I have heard they are not always set in a realm of seriousness.\n\nThe game appealed to me at first because of it's Dragon Questesque appearance. Admittedly, I did enjoy it starting out, but the more time I put into it, the more tedious everything became. Battles were boring, the maps were unimaginative and very movement restrictive, and the towns seemed to serve no purpose other than a place to get mana and shop. (Villager commentary was mostly useless.) I just wanted it to end. I only beat it because I was near the end and didn't want it to end up as "just another game I haven't finished."\n\nThe game was not entirely faulty. I did enjoy the skill system, it made you think about your play style and what skills may be more beneficial in the long run. Also, as much as I dreaded random encounters, boss battles were fun, requiring quick thinking to take down the boss before his strength multiplier became too high.\n\nI personally believe that there are better games out there, but if you want an RPG to play that is cheap (especially on sale, think I got this and Cthulu as a bundle for less than two bucks,) then give it a shot, but be forewarned; unless you like grindy and unnecessarily long dungeons, look elsewhere.","April 20","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
