Thanks to some ingenius design, the puzzle's difficulty scales with you, but in a very natural way. You can choose to get all the items before completing the game, which will give you more options to solve each situation. But the game is designed that you can beat the game without all the items if you want an extra challenge. And if you, like me, want the extra extra challenge, there's optional puzzles and dungeons that will make you feel dumb for hours while you try everything, before you finally get your EUREKA moment, then you feel like the smartest person in the world.\n\nOn top of the great game design, the charming art and writing is perfect bonus that ties the game all together.\n\nHighly recommended!!","November 25, 2013","true","21.3"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","0"

While the delightful art style and fantastic soundtrack both pay homage to the classic series, the similarities in actual gameplay are rather cursory and it turns out that's a good thing.\n\nThe emphasis here is entirely on the puzzles, more specifically, block puzzles. You'll spend nearly your entire stay on the island pushing, freezing, and teleporting blocks and enemies around, flipping switches and ultimately opening a ton of chests and doors on your quest for treasure. As the sole focus of the adventure the quality of the puzzles is paramount, and fortunately they happen to be supremely well designed and satisfying to solve, rarely crossing the line into overly hard nor easy. They provide an entertaining challenge as well as a bit of replayability with several different paths available for completing the game, something that's rarely seen in this genre.\n\nAll of this combined with the clever boss fights, tongue in cheek humor, and outstanding presentation add up to a very short but (technical hiccups aside) immensely enjoyable game from start to finish. Don't make the mistake of taking Ittle Dew at face value, for it has more than enough heart to breakaway from it's inspiration, and should not be missed!","September 2, 2013","true","3.4"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","4"

Playing as a blonde in a green tunic with a sword (or stick), stuck on an island with a flying friend and top down gameplay doesn't help make it not look like a Zelda clone. That's the flavor of the game. Is it Zelda? No, but it'll do (Ittle Do). This game is slightly different than a Zelda clone because it is a push block puzzle game with a few enemies and deviations from push block puzzles.\n\nThere are a few items and you start with a stick that you can use to light on fire, then melt ice blocks, set off bombs and so on. Eventually you'll move to a flaming sword to do what a flaming stick can, a magical teleportation wand that allows you to set a block, use the wand and have the enemy or object appear where you set the block. Finally, you'll get an ice wand to freeze enemies, blocks, put out fire and even make walls reflect projectiles like your teleportation staff. You can tell a lot of work went into making the items as not just items to solve puzzles, but combat items as well. You can use the teleporation block to set a block under you, step off and if an enemy is on it, the enemy will fly off screen. You can set a block, push it onto spikes, then use the teleportation wand to teleport the enemy into the block on the spikes, killing them that way. Even though it is disguised as Zelda, I feel like the game could have been made in RPG Maker.\n\nAll of the items and weapons are bound to buttons on the X-Box controller which is nice, you can use everything at once without having to visit a menu. There are no deaths in this game, so much as there are room restarts. When you die, you just reset whatever room you were in with full health. Rooms including sections of the overworld map. There is no consequence, making it a very easy for kids game. Each room has a hint sign or two and if you need even more help, you can hit the left button to have your fluttering fox friend give you a hint. There is even a nice little map too showing you where treasures and doors are (unlocked and locked).\n\nThis is an enjoyable game even if its quick and simple when compared to Zelda. There is a good diverse array of enemies with different ways to take them out. The art style is charming, there is plenty of exploration and a slightly open world go where you want feel. The art style, happy nature, hints and ease of puzzles makes me feel this game is better for kids. Give it a go, its fun for a few brief hours until you complete it in one or two sittings. The game is so brief, there are achievements for beating it under 3 hours and completing it under 15 minutes.\n\nIttle Dew is a good stepping stone for this developer to make a grander Zelda like game.","June 10, 2014","true","10.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

It was like a time warp.\n\nAnyways, lets quit the drama and let me present you with a Short, sweet review just like the game.\n\nPros:\n+ Amazing gameplay. It's downright fun.\n+ Cleverly designed puzzles.\n...+ The puzzles are not super hard niether are they super easy.\n...+ It's a perfect mixture of hard yet non-frustating puzzle. Exactly what I look for in a VIDEO GAME.\n+ Short and nice story.

(Each of which grants a different achievement too)\n\nCons:\n- There was only exactly ONE situation where I thought the game/floor/level design could have been better.\n- And that's an extremely low number for a puzzle game. (or any game tbh)\n\nI got this game as a gift from a friend who bought it from humble bundle for $1.00 along with a couple of other games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/241320/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The generally accepted reason for why there aren’t more games like The Legend Of Zelda is that they’re just too hard to make. Ocarina Of Time is still widely accepted as the best game ever made, but that in itself implies that its creation was not a trivial task. There have been attempts to copy the formula, from early titles like Golden Axe Warrior through to Alundra, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Ōkami, but not only are these efforts rare but they’ve generally been commercial failures.\n\nThat is likely to be the real reason for the lack of similar games, but such market realities are not something that indie developers generally worry about. Which is good because, despite a few caveats, Ittle Dew is one of the most enjoyable Zelda-a-likes we’ve played in years.\n\nDespite what it may look like Ittle Dew is not a straight clone, but it does have perhaps the most legitimate excuse for copying another game: comedy. Ittle Dew isn’t just a love letter to the Zelda games it’s also a parody of them, and its spunky heroine Ittle and her Navi stand-in Tippsie (a wonderfully cynical magic fox) gently poke fun at the series’ specific peculiarities and those of gaming in general.\n\nTippsie in particular is hilarious, as she reacts with varying degrees of disgust to ordinary Zelda tropes, such as Ittle eating a heart to get more health to her quaffing potions when she’s not looking. Joking about smashing pots and what enemies do all day as they stand around in lonely dungeons may seem like obvious targets, but as we’ve often lamented games are strangely reticent to ever poke fun at their sillier traditions.\n\nThe jovial mood is enhanced further by the wonderful visuals, but despite the art style being very different from any official Zelda game overall Ittle Dew still ends up looking lawyer-worryingly similar. The game is scheduled for release on Wii U later in the year though so we assume that Nintendo gets the joke as well.\n\nIttle has a much more mercenary approach to her explorations than Link, happily stuffing her pockets with treasure as she goes about adventuring. Even the artefact she’s trying to obtain from a nearby castle is only to bribe a shopkeeper to build her a ship to get home. Although he does at least offer to sell her three items vital to her mission: a fire sword, an ice wand, and a portal-creating magic wand.\n\nUnusually for a Zelda game these are the only three items in the whole game, which is certainly a bold choice. But despite all the puzzles being solved using only one or more of the items it’s disappointing that the meat of most of them still revolves around pushing blocks and hitting switches. In the traditional manner there are torches and bombs to be lit, pressure pads to stand on, and doors to unlock.\n\nThe puzzles might not be very imaginative but they are well designed and often have multiple solutions. You can even beat the entire game using any random combination of just two of the items. Some of the puzzles are very hard but the game isn’t interested in punishing you, only challenging you, and there’s a wide range of helpful hints given out by Tippsie.\n\nThe dungeon-like areas are very much the focus of the game and although there are overworld areas they’re smaller and less interactive than real Zelda games. The combat is also significantly less interesting, being barely any more nuanced than the original NES game and offering zero reward beyond extra health. The bosses are a mostly decent bunch though and also get some of the best lines.\n\nIttle Dew is rather short, at around three to four hours, although you’ll need much longer to collect everything and beat the optional Master Cave (the only truly difficult challenge in the whole thing). But for only a tenner you get a download that is not only fun but funny – a game that is amusingly self-aware but uses this as a means to enhance the experience and not just make excuses for it.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 27, 2014","true","32.9"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","44","67","0","8"

Ittle Dew features an amazing amount of well thought and tricky puzzles. A huge amount of time and love went into crafting and polishing this game.\n\nSide note: Ittle Dew was actually submitted as an idea to Nintendo as a Zelda spinoff, but they turned it down. Which is really too bad for them as this would have fit in with any of the Wind Waker style of Zelda games.\n\nProbably for the best really, a lot of the charm of Ittle Dew comes from the aesthetic as a Zelda parody, from poking fun at the goofy statues to the over the top silly monsters.\n\nReally, the only thing I'd want out of Ittle Dew is a little more content, your first playthrough will top out at 90 to 150 minutes of play. However, there are multiple ways to finish the game, which can lead to a lot of replay value.\n\nBut that said, Ittle Dew is very much worth your time and money if you are a fan of puzzle games.\n\nThanks.","December 1, 2013","true","9.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

It's a cute adventure game focused strictly on solving puzzles. You solve one, open the door, move to the next room and so on. The only few rpg elements include things like health upgrades and cash to buy items (3 items that open up more puzzle mechanics).\n\n\nPROS\n- Lovely art style and animation, very fitting.\n- The writing is really fun. Expect lots of snarky comments and quirky dialogues.\n- The base game is challenging enough for casual playthroughs. There's an optional "dungeon" full of super hard puzzles for the aditional challenge\n- 60fps goodness, runs so smooth\n\nCONS\n- All the puzzles in game revolve around box pushing mechanics. Provides a good challenge but could get boring after a while.\n- Lack of exploration\n- I wish the characters had more story or progression, loved all of them.\n- Not much replayability unless you want the achievements, most of which are rerunning the game with some sort of handicap.\n- The game is short (my first blind playthrough was 2:30 hours, got all collectables and completed the extra hard dungeon too)\n\nSUM\nIf you like puzzlers and don't mind lots of box pushing, you'll love it. The humour is great and the game is very pretty to look at. The puzzles can get extremely difficult (even convoluted) and provide a great challenge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lah5175/recommended/241320/","lah5175","Annavel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lah5175/","379 products in account","I give this game a very cautious recommendation.\n\nI picked it up because I'm a huge Zelda fan, and it was on sale at the time. The gameplay is similar to a 2D Zelda in many regards in that you explore, fight, and solve puzzles using your trusty stick/sword and items that you gain throughout your adventure. So yes, there are a lot of familiar elements here if you like these kinds of games.\n\nThat said, it doesn't PLAY like a Zelda game. That's not necessarily a bad thing depending on why you enjoy these games in the first place. Whereas Zelda has very tight, simple combat and excellent monster design, it becomes apparent soon after starting this game that combat is not the main focus. Ittle's stick has a short range and some enemies do not suffer knockback when hit. There are also not many enemies with unique weaknesses. Most of them are a simple hack n' slash affair.\n\nWhere this game truly shines is in the puzzle department. I would even say that this game is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game, because the world is compact and filled to the brim with puzzles. Many of them are actually challenging! I literally spent hours in the Master Cave, an optional dungeon filled with the toughest puzzles that this game has to offer, because the puzzles were so difficult and I was determined to solve them without a guide. Though I felt like ripping my hair out at the time, solving these complex puzzles was a rewarding experience in and of itself, unlike in Zelda dungeons where it sometimes feels like puzzles are just there to pad the game out.\n\nThis is a short game, and there are only three items (besides the default stick) that you can obtain. The twist is that these items work together to help you solve puzzles and traverse the main dungeon. For instance, you can combine the portal wand and the ice rod to create an ice block that warps you to the other side of the room. This part of the game was handled ingeniously. There are so many things you can do with these three items and the objects in your environment. There are also multiple ways that you can beat the game, and you don't even need all of the items to do it. Pretty cool!\n\nAs mentioned, this game is short. If you skipped the Master Cave, it would likely take you about 3-5 hours on your first attempt. The replay value comes from finding out different ways to beat the game using different combinations of items. The game is also uniformly hilarious and aware of its genre. Even the credit sequence is funny.\n\nTL;DR - This is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game. If you like puzzles, you will probably like it.","April 22","true","17.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/241320/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Ittle Dew is a little game that stands somewhere between Zelda and Sokoban, with a very humorous tone, and featuring friendly game design, with aspects that can be appreciated by pretty much everyone.\n\nFrom casual playthroughs, so rock-hard puzzles and 15 minutes speedruns... it's got it all! It's weird, but it's very nice to see how almost every aspect of this game seems to just fit it and provide a great experience, despite its apparent simplicity!\n\nPresentation\nUndoubtedly, one of its strongest aspects, especially at first. The cartoon-y artstyle is very well done, with a pleasant color scheme, very clean, with added lighting effects modernising its look, somewhat. The highlight here for me, though, is the character design. Everyone looks unique, is a clumsy and silly way, and with their own backstory to support them. It's pretty good!\nAnother detail I liked is how every line moves slightly, making everything seem more alive.\n\nThe music and sound-effects didn't standout out too much for me, but fit nicely with the rest of the presentation, and it wasn't bad by any means! Just didn't seem to carry the experience, for me.\n\nI also found the writting to be funny at times, and it just gave the game a very light-hearted and self-aware tone the whole way through. Ranging from the dialogues with your health-potion drunk companion, to the enemies' entrances and the mocking signposts spread around, everything had something to make fun of.\n\n\nHow's the game structured?\nVery much like a Zelda game, actually. You have an island to explore, and go through several dungeons to beat it. There is also some exploration done outside the main and tutorial dungeons.\n\nNear the beginning of the game, you'll find a shop. The shopkeeper tells you he can give you a raft to escape the island, if you get him the artifact in the castle. And off you go. He also has 3 items to sell. You'll find the gold for it in the castle. The game's puzzles revolve around these 3 items: you'll have to combine their abilities in very varied ways to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe castle has many shortcuts, that you can take by solving much harder puzzles. If you're stuck, you may as well try another way, or go buy another item. There are many different ways of making progress, too!\nThe castle puzzles are pretty straighforward, though, so anyone can safely play it without fearing getting frustrated.\n\nOutside the castle, though, there are other smaller dungeon, with harder puzzles. These usually contain Cards with the game's characters. These are merely collectibles, but they're pretty charming too. The puzzles there can also hint at some mechanics you may have not learned throw the tutorial puzzles.\n\nAs a segue, when you have enough gold, you can take one of several portals spread around the castle to fast travel. When you buy an item, you'll be catapulted into another part of the island. These are the tutorial areas. Your items are all stored near the shop, and you'll have to beat the dungeon only with your newfound item. With this, you'll learn how the item works well enough, and do that through play! I think it's a nice way of doing it.\n\nThese dungeons also contain several paths and shortcuts. One important thing is that you'll never be able to leave the cave while missing important items. When you leave the dungeon, it will be sealed, but you can rest assured that you haven't missed anything important. This is also told to you after your first dungeon, in a sign post.\nThe placing of that was very elegant: since there are multiple paths, it's very likely that you'll miss part of the map, and become worried after leaving the dungeon. Right when you're worrying about it, the signpost clarifies it for you.\nThere are many places like this in the game, making tutorialisation nicely paced. Information is often delivered at the right moment!\n\nI think that about covers it.\n\nGeneral Mechanics\nThis game has both combat and puzzles, although the focus is mainly on the puzzles. There are also some Boss Fights, most of which are more puzzle-driven than combat, although both blend rather nicely, items being multi-purposed.\n\nThe combat is very straightforward. Your basic attack attacks the tile in front of you. There are also projectiles attacks. There are several different enemies, some that attack only in front of them, some have projectiles, etc. Different enemies require different approaches. Also, they'll respawn each time you enter the room, but it's never a problem as they're easy to avoid. Some puzzles also reset, but only when the initial conditions are necessary for you to solve another puzzle in the room (or perhaps to use a shortcut).\n\nThe only problem I've had with the combat, is how the movement is a bit floaty, and there's a lack of knock-back with some enemies. The enemies often drop hearts to replenish your health, and the game is overall not punishing in the least, so it's not too big of an issue.\n\nLack of Punishment\nThat's mostly a good thing, but it sometimes holds the player's hand too much. For example, Boss fights have 3-5 phases, and there's usually a checkpoint between each. I've found that mostly unnecessary, taking the little challenge that they provided. I think boss fights should still be a threat!\nOn the other hand, each time you die, you'll simply reset the room, but never lose progress, or collectibles at all. That's a very welcome thing! It's always annoying to do 4-5 rooms again when you die, or lose progress over a simple miss-step.\n\n\nThe puzzles are basically Sokoban, with a few twists. You have 3 items: a Flaming Sword, a Freezing Wand, and a Teleporting Wand.\nThe sword can set bombs on fire, to explode after a few seconds. The Freezing Wand can freeze enemies and blocks (making them very slippery when you push them, and also breakable), and can also freeze a wall, making it reflective.\nThe Teleporting Wand can create a Green block anywhere. If you hit bombs or enemies with the projectile, they'll teleport over to that block. This is basically all you need to know.\nYou combine these techniques with some more subtle quirks to the tiles and timing, and you can be faced with some evil difficult puzzles.\n\n\nDifficulty.\nIttle Dew sets its casual from its hardcore puzzles\nUsually, to beat the game, you have some fairly easy puzzles. To collect the cards, it's a different matter (although mostly doable). There's a final dungeon with 12 puzzles however, that is really hard! At least for someone inexperienced in Sokoban. I often had to peek into a walkthrough, and was constantly surprised with a new way of combining my items.\n\nPrecision and Perfection rather than simply solving a puzzle\nThe problem is that some of these puzzles required extremely precise timing, with the game's controls don't provide very well, in my opinion. Also, these puzzles constantly made you restart at every wrong move. A time rewinding mechanic would be welcome, even if just on this cave. I had to restart these puzzles many times, making it a bit too frustrating. It wasn't just a puzzle to solve, it was something that heavily relied on execution, which I'm not a fan of.\n\nThen again, these were completely optional! And the game warned you that they were hard. If you complete it, you'll get some more cards, and also Development info, which is very cool!\n\nH.Mention: The castle can be solved with ANY combination of 2 items. I'm very impressed with this! The castle is so nicely designed that you can beat it with any combination of the two items, and the game aknowledges that with achievements. Also for cards, speed, etc.\nThere are many ways of playing Ittle Dew, which is why I think it's a neatly designed game. Many ways that tie together brilliantly!\nFull Recommendation. Also, check Card City Nights!","January 11, 2015","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The makers said the game is designed in a way to allow speed running and it shows, with best times going as low as 10 minutes. This allows many modes of play, adding variety to playthroughs. The items you recieve can be gotten in any order, and you don't even need all of them to complete the story, although catching them all surely helps solving some puzzles. The bosses aren't really given much backstory, as any other character really, but this may have been necessary, seeing as having loads of story in a game this short would detract from the gameplay. However, tidbits of information are scattered throughout the game and reading them adds some depth to the world of Ittle Dew. Some of the harder puzzles can be a little tricky to solve since the game doesn't tell you a couple of abilities one of your items has, nothing that a little thinking wouldn't solve, but seeing each new skill having a small tutorial, one could get a slightly confused. Ittle Dew is an adorable little game that really shows the developers put a lot of care in making it as fun and endearing as possible, while maintaing its unique humour.","June 23, 2014","true","11.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You go through dungeons mostly solving puzzles, but there is a combat element to the game also. The combat is pretty basic, but you can freeze and teleport enemies in addition to slashing them with your sword. The puzzles are nicely balanced. Nothing was too hard to feel like giving up on and nothing was too easy to get bored on. The only thing I didn't like was the optional Master Cave dungeon. You basically needed a walkthrough to get through most of these. The solution to a lot of the puzzles require doing things that you never did during the main game, but are expected to know about somehow in this dungeon. A few of the puzzles also require fast reflexes instead of just puzzle solving like the rest of the game. It just all felt out of place to me. Overall though, the game was very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone that likes the puzzle solving in something like The Legend of Zelda games. You can do mostly everything (minus the achievements) in about 7 hours, depending on how quickly you can figure out the puzzles.","January 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In these games you always played an hero off to find adventure, find treasure and save the world (usually in that order but reverse priority).   To do so, you usually had to solve puzzles and fight plent of bad guys.\n\nEnter Ittle Dew, keen on adventure and treasure, but not so much the saving the world stuff, she is finds herself stranded on an Island, with the only chance of leaving involving getting (i.e. stealing) an artifact from a castle for the shopkeeper.\n\nAlong the way you must get (i.e. once again steal) at least two of three magic weapons with the help of the same shopkeeper (who gladly takes your cash for the favor) to solve the puzzles of the castle and surrounding area.\n\nThis is a great game that doesn't take itself seriously, but is great for serious players.   You can speed run or play for completion.  There are shortcuts for those willing to do more challanging puzzles, and even alternative ways to solve the puzzles, all while Ittle's sarcastic attitude, her potion-holic assistant "tippsy" and a cast of quite insane villians keep you amused.\n\nIf you expect your games to be serious and realistic, maybe you should look elsewhere, but if you like difficult puzzles and timeless classic-style gameplay, all wrapped up into a tribute to the adventure games of old, then this is definately the game for you.","June 10, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","With the sequel confirmed and on the way, getting into Ittle Dew now is the perfect time. I had always meant to play this game but only now did I ever give it the chance.\n\nMaybe it was the Adventure Time style and humor that put me off, leading me to believe this game would be a nonsensical game without any logic. It is nosensical, in a good way, but the puzzles and gameplay are finely crafted with various solutions in an otherwise illogical adventure.\n\nWake up, Adventurer.\nThe story for Ittle Dew is simple: Beat things up and solve puzzles. And then you have weirdo, meta characters and conversations that take slight jabs at the game itself. The interactions with Tippsie (the flying fox) and Ittle are my favorite bits in the game, mostly because of how cynical and arrogant Tippsie comes off.\n\nIf you do like the wierdness humor of Adventure Time or Regular Show, then you'll probably find the other characters entertaining. I had one or two laughs as I liked the small world of the game, but I didn't find anything too interesting or memorable.\n\nWhat Can You Dew?\nWhere the story and the characters were lacking, the puzzle/adventuring aspects of the game were what sold me on the game itself. And not on my first playthrough but my third one as well.\n\nYou are given a stick to start with that can temporarily be set on fire. You later can get a Flame Scimitar (like the stick but stronger and always on fire), the Portal Wand that can create blocks and teleport things, and a Freeze Wand. Some items have some synnergy between them that becomes useful when solving a room when you only have two items.\n\nIn order to beat the game, you only require two out of three items; however, on your first playthrough, you will want to collect all three items to 100% the game. Not only would you want to do this for achievements, but after each item-boss, there are extra dungeons that teach you more in-game mechanics through smaller, harder puzzles.\n\nThe only reward  worth caring about is the heart-notes for extra lives; the cards are added in for flavor, but it's the practice of familiarizing yourself with the mechanics and experimenting with your tools are the real rewards for the challenge. They're all centered on the item you bought and they're all completely optional, so the puzzles are a great method of teaching the player how to play the game better.\n\nOnce you have all three items, and you think you're smart enough, you can then tackle the Master Cave. You might think these challenges begin fairly simple (for the first four or five rooms), but the later challenges will test your reflexes as much as your puzzle-solving skills, sometimes in really convuluted ways.\n\nI'll admit I had to use a guide because some solutions were so specific to the millisecond I wouldn't be able to figure it out on my own. Although the payoff for completing the twelve hardest puzzles of the game is anticlimatic (as well as the boss-fight), this part of the game will teach you skills you were not even aware of you had all the time with a given tool (or combination of the two).\n\nA complete playthrough, on a (mostly) blind run, will take you about four to seven in-game hours depending on how stubborn you are to avoid a guide. The real fun of the game comes on your next three playthroughs.\n\nA Task Against Familiarity\nAs mentioned before, the game is designed for you to complete the game with two out of three items. Backtracking for the items is less tedious as you'll most likely be able to solve the professional shortcuts after the Master Cave. Navigating through the Castle with a limited amount of items is the real challenge.\n\nThe game forces you to tackle certain rooms for enough loot for what you need while also figuring out how to reach the final boss-room. The final boss fight is tailored to whatever items you have, although the fight is much shorter as a result.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of not having enough items to do everything, your playthrough from 4 to six hours goes down to less than fifteen minutes to three hours at most as a result of handicaping yourself.\n\nThese shorter runs are still worthwhile because the game takes previous challenges and does a new spin on them, and some rooms are probably impossible (but you wont' know until you try), so these playthroughs are not worthless.\n\nI just wish there was some way to still 100% ALL rooms with these limitations. No run will match the first one in length or for completion, and they freel tailored for speedrunners alone. (I'm not a fan of speedrunning my games; I prefer to take my time and relax).\n\n"Eh, 3 out of 5 at best."\nThis isn't my score of the game, but I think that line quite sums up my thoughts. The game has great potential to expand upon, but the shortcomings on the more interesting playthroughs make me hopeful for more polish from a game that is already nicely polished.","September 18, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Basically, it's like a 2D Legend of Zelda game with a heavy focus on the puzzles. You're washed up on a mysterious island and, as any good adventurer does, you start to adventure. It's pretty straightforward in terms of adventuring. You go from dungeon to dungeon as they become available to you, work on puzzles with the dungeons in order to complete them, and then receive items to help you progress further. Upon getting an item, you generally are sent to a new area without the other items, forcing you to get acquainted with the new item and its uses before being able to combine the uses of all your items. There are a few optional shortcuts and slightly hidden puzzles you can go after, which is nice for even more puzzle solving. It is also entire possible to complete the game without getting all of the items. You can beat it with a few combinations of a few items. These are reflected in the achivements, but... I'll be honest, I had enough trouble with the main game using everything. There's also some funny little dialogues going on in parts of the game which give it some life and keep things from getting too harsh on your brain. Almost like little rewards for continuing. And there are boss fights which will give some action to your problem solving skills. A nice blend for the game.\n\nThere are a few downsides though, as all games have. One is that the game is rather short. Most of the playtime here will be from getting stuck on tricky puzzles. There's not much adventuring, as most of the places you go to are rather straightforward and without missable secrets. Even the optional puzzles are pretty easy to find. So I guess there could've been more adventure for my taste. Also, the combat is a little rough. It just feels a bit stiff and non responsive. There's less focus on it, but still, a little more fluidity might have been nice. Not a big deal, though. You can adjust. There were some pretty interesting puzzles, some involving good timing, but the game doesn't do a great job of teaching you the timing based techniques used later in the game. Also, there's an awful lot of block puzzles, so... if you don't like those... stay away.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool game. Is it worth the ten dollar price tag? Well, if you're a Zelda fan or a puzzle fan, yes. It's definitely worth checking out. For others? Possibly wait for a sale, or just give it a shot. It's a decent price for what you get. It has some neat sound and a fun art style. The music went well the the mood. It's definitely something anyone could enjoy, but recommended for only the Zelda fans or puzzle crowd, I'd say. If you're looking for more adventure, it may not be your cup of tea. And I must say that, even though it is a bit on the short side, it doesn't FEEL short. It feels like a full game, and that's where it counts. I'd give Ittle Dew 7/10. Good, solid game, but geared more towards the puzzle minded for sure.","January 7, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/recommended/241320/","abbe","Abbe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/","806 products in account","This is a small puzzle game where you traverse a few dungeons with a bunch of different mechanics and items that define what techniques and actions you can use to solve them. It took me less than 3 hours to finish it and get a majority of cards and other things, and I’ve spent over an hour after that finishing the collection. Haven’t decided if I should take the rest of the achievements yet or not, could be a fun challenge though. All in all I’ve spent about 5 hours on it and there’s still things for me to do, but mostly in the interest of completing the game without all weapons unlocked or speedrunning.\n\nI have to say that its quite funny written, the characters and how they behave make fun of retro concepts, like eating hearts that fall on the ground. It doesn’t take itself very serious, which fits nicely into everything else.\n\nSo, gameplay! You solve puzzles by either hitting things, putting things on plates or killing things. Basically, if you have no items, you are limited to pushing blocks and finding fireplaces to light your stick on fire. But if you have a firesword you don’t need to find fireplaces, and if you have the icestaff and the firesword you can freeze blocks and then shatter them with your firesword. If you have the portal wand, you can solve even more puzzles, etc. Not only that, you can combine most of the tools in very, very interesting ways that wasn’t expected at all by me.\n\nThis works very well and the puzzles range from crazy obvious to "bweh?” making you feel very stupid when you don’t get them, and extremely clever when you finally do. In many cases you can leave it for later.\n\nEvery dungeon have a boss and they are ok most of the time. Personally I really disliked the last boss and the boss in the master dungeon (which were the only place where I eventually looked for help in solving the rooms). The last boss being annoying and the master dungeon boss being both hard and showing a lot of gameplay fallacies I dislike in 2D top-down games. Still the game is about solving puzzles first and the bosses come as a break that can be quite welcome.\n\nIt’s super pretty and animated in a way that completely fits the style. It very simply borrows a lot from Zelda games in how the graphics look, but have its own way of drawing it, which makes it more of a homage.\n\nAnyway, if you like puzzle games and solving rooms zelda-style, get it!\nIf you want something more action-heavy, then you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nHave a good day! :)","August 5, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its on here and the Wii U eshop for$9.99. Its hella nice. Yeah go get it. Unless you don't like any of those, then keep moving and ignore this review.\n\nAlright, I'll actually talk about the game. So you're an adventurer named Ittle Dew and her sidekick Tippsie are on a raft when they bump into a rock and crash on the shore of an island. After going through a short tutorial cave, there's a big castle you come across filled with weird inhabitants who wear suits and tend to be wacky. Outside the castle is Itan, who runs a shop. You can find treasure chests in the castle with coins and you use those to go towards getting items from the shop. Well, you pay Itan and he launches you to a dungeon that the item is at (a fire sword in a fire cave/volcano, an ice wand in an ice cave/dungeon, and a portal wand in the woods). Each dungeon contains a shortcut that can help you get to the boss faster (most likely than not you're gonna use these if you're speedrunning but they do help you finish the dungeons faster supposing you can figure out the puzzle for each shortcut). Depending on the combination of the items you collect (you need at least 2 to get through the castle to the final boss), you can take different routes through the castle to get to the end.\n\nAside from the items I previously mentioned, there are also collectible cards you can find in chests throughout the game that have a picture of a character or enemy in the game along with info on them (they go towards an achievement) and you can find scraps of paper in chests as well that go towards increasing your heart count (4 pieces make a new heart a la Legend of Zelda heart containers, this is also for an achievement if you find them all).\n\nThis game will test you and your thinking skills. Sometimes puzzles are simple like press all the switches or kill all the enemies or hit switches. Other times, you might take a while to solve a puzzle only to be stumped by the next one. Two optional bonus dungeons (The Master Cave and, as of October 31, 2013, the Compost Crypt) contain even tougher brain scratchers and while not necessary or important to the plot (I did say optional, after all), you do get an achievement, one per dungeon upon completing them and there's cards in the Master Dungeon so you'd have to complete it if you were gunning for all the cards. Think of them as advanced puzzles, more or less.\n\nLastly, the dialouge is quite humorous. All the characters have a self-aware feel to them when they speak, like they know they're in a video game. There's even call backs/shout outs to older 2D Zelda games like A Link to the Past or Zelda 1. It knows what its doing and you just go with it cause why not. Even the art style is appealing to the eyes.\n\nI've probably harped on long enough but maybe this will convince you to at least check out Ittle Dew. Look, if you like the old school 2D Zelda games or know someone that does, then this game might be for you/them. Hopefully I've said more than enough to peak your interest B^)","July 2, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/241320/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","TL;DR: So, I got this game off humble bundle and wasn't particularly excited to play it. I started it up expecting to hate it after a few minutes and then just let it idle for the cards, but boy was I wrong. This game is really good. Probably among the most fun puzzle game I've played. Easy 8/10.\n\nSo in this game you play as an adventurer. Not much is known about your character aside from the fact that she's totally a girl. I mean, I didn't pay too much attention to the story, but that's basically all I know about it having completed the game.\n\nYou're off to get 3 magical items to help you solve progressively more complicated puzzles, a fire sword, a portal wand, and a ice wand thing. Different objects on the screen interact differently (or not at all) with each magical item. Conveniently, a local shopkeeper sells them and you're able to purchase them from him. Only, when you do, you're put into a puzzle series cave where you have to show somewhat of a mastery of the item to get out.\n\nSome of the puzzles are really solid, making you somewhat frustrated after not getting them within the first 10 tries. Of course, there's also the others that are super obvious and take maybe 1 attempt, 2 if you pressed the wrong button. Good variety and the later stages of the puzzles make you think with portals.\n\nCombat is pretty dull in the game. Though, admittedly, I totally died to a pancake out of recklessness more than a few times. Valv pls fix. You press x to do the damage, or you can be fancy and try to teleport mobs into spikes or something.\n\nThe controls either weren't given out in the game (I had to press every key on my keyboard to figure out how to use the stick to attack for a while), or I totally didn't pay attention to the tutorial. There is a 2 level tutorial.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention, the puzzles vary between push blocks into pressure plates, clear all enemies on the map, light all the things that need lighting, or burn out all the things that shouldn't be on fire. You might think that's pretty lame and hardly fun, but the quickness of the game definitely makes thing way less awful than they would be. Trust me.\n\nAside from combat, which really isn't even a big deal because the game isn't driven to encourage you to fight everything on the map except in a few area where you need to to open a door, the only real upset with the game is how fast you can complete it. Keep in mind, I had intended to just get all the cards in the game and then back out. I was sucked in and before I knew it, I finished the game. I mean, sure, I didn't 100% it, but I cleared the final boss. I didn't expect to because a certain key item given out at the end led me to believe that there would be some other areas to access, but that wasn't the case. In my first blind run, I finished the game in three and a half hours. I mean, sure, that's actually a pretty reasonable time for a game to take in a campaign mode anyway, but I really really wanted more. I guess that's a good thing, though.\n\nSo after getting here this far, you probably know that I'm going to rate this game pretty highly. I would put Antichamber and Portal above this game in terms of similar games that are more fun, but this game isn't too far behind! Easy eight out of ten. I would only dock points for not doing anything groundbreakingly new (which would push it over the top and is basically a requirement to get a 10. ♥♥♥♥ people who give every game 10s), and being exceptionally short. Though, the latter is likely not an issue because this game can be played on your phone.\n\nOh yes\n\nyou heard me\n\nyou can play it on your phone.\n\nI would encourage anyone with even a mild interest in puzzle games to give this one a shot.","June 3, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tools are very different from what you'll find in Zelda games, though, and there's a lot of focus on having them interact with each other - one puzzle may have you freeze a block to let it slide across that spike wall and then freeze and teleport a bomb so its detonation syncs with you lighting a brazier.\n\nBe aware that it doesn't take long to finish the game, but its replay value is high because the path through the castle is nonlinear, there's a lot of optional treasure/puzzles, and extra-hard shortcuts encourage challenge and speedruns. The limited game length also means that a lot of effort could go into each individual room - nothing feels rushed, and the puzzles use available game mechanics to their fullest potential.\n\nIttle Dew's strongest point of the game is the irreverent yet cute, self-aware humour. Quirky enemy design, expressive hand-drawn graphics and the music support the atmosphere very well.\n\nCombat is rather basic and more about approaching strategically or outsmarting enemies than about the actual process of beating them up, but still a nice diversion between puzzles.\n\nIf you care about silly dialogue, clever puzzles and exploring different routes through the same dungeon, this is for you. If you like long, linear games with a focus on combat and are a dialogue-skipper or prefer serious storylines, you're looking in the wrong place though.","July 12, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game takes many pages out of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening's page book, and adds its own twist to it. The game largely does not focus on combat as much as its inspiration, The Legend of Zelda, but puts most of its focus on puzzle solving. And the puzzles are no push over either. In fact, I would wager that many of them are much more difficult than anything we generally see in a Zelda game. Ittle Dew also has a unique quirky sense of humor sprinkled throughout the game, and because of that and its satisfying gameplay is quite the charm. Many reviewers have complained that the game is too short. And it is short, coming in at about four hours just to beat the game. There is some content you can get before or after the game that may add to that gametime though if you wish. But I found little reason to do that. By the time you get towards the end of the game, Ittle Dew begins to reach its limit. Any continuation or extension of the game in any meaningful way would only drag out a good thing way too long. The only drawback that this game has is it's price, which is currently around $15. For a four hour game, $15 is a bit much and for some may not be worth it. Hopefully, we will see another game featuring Ittle Dew sometime in the near future. If it does though, hopefully it will either be longer, but with quality that this game would have lacked if it ran any longer. Or the game will be cheaper to match the low amount of game time.\n\nIttle Dew in many ways does precisely what its title suggests in that: It'll do. But because of that, it focuses intently on a few aspects of gameplay, namely the puzzles and humor, that go above and beyond its title's suggestions and which ultimately makes it a great gem.","August 23, 2013","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Block pushing puzzles, to be precise. If that kind of thing doesn't turn you off, though, you should get this game. It's an entertaining, funny, bite-sized morsel of a game.\nThe main conceit, beyond block pushing, revolves around the three tools you find, which allow you to set aflame, freeze, or teleport things in order to solve puzzles. They all interact in interesting ways, too, like freezing part of the wall to bounce a teleport ray off of, or using fire to shatter things you've frozen, and so on.\nThere's also collectible trading cards with silly flavor text, expert shortcuts and a couple optional dungeons for real puzzle fiends.\nPeople who like their puzzles done quick are also catered to, as in addition to the previously mentioned shortcuts, it's actually possible to finish the game with any combination of just two out of the three tools. There's even an achievement for beating the game in less than 15 minutes, as opposed to the three or four hours a regular playthrough will probably take you. Yeah this game is short. But it's packed with puzzley goodness.","February 26, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the screenshots or heavily inspired Link to the Past aesthetic fool you though, Ittle Dew is about 98% block puzzles and 2% other stuff.  Do not go into this expecting an action-rpg or some kind of dungeon romp with the occasional puzzle.  It's all puzzles and your enjoyment of them will make or break the game for you.\n\nThere are three items used in puzzles: fire sword, ice wand and portal blocks/teleportation.  This isn't anywhere as limiting as it may seem and the game's puzzle design is very tight and well-done.  Ittle Dew gets a lot of mileage with the different ways it incorporates using the tools together to solve puzzles.  I didn't realize until after I finished it that you can beat the game by only collecting two of the three items and with any combination of the two.   It adds a ton of replay value for future playthroughs.  The game also has "shortcut paths", basically hard puzzles that you can use to skip chunks of the game and beat it in less than twenty minutes if you know what to do.  Stuff like beating the game with different combos of items and the shortcut puzzles are cool mechanics/design decisions and I like to seeing them even if I don't necessary plan on ever using them myself.\n\nThe cartoony art is very nice and vivid.  The UI is simple and efficient.  You don't have to walk out of a room to reset a failed puzzle, you can just hit start and hit reset room to save yourself the needless back and forth you'd find in similar games.  The game lets you know how many items are in each area and most collectible item rooms will let you know if you have the correct item to solve the puzzle so you don't spend time beating your head against the wall trying to solve a puzzle you don't have the right item for.  There's just a lot of little things the game does to make playing it a non-aggravating experience.\n\nIn short, if you're down with games that heavily involve pushing blocks and solving puzzles, you'll probably have a solid time with Ittle Dew.  Just don't head into it expecting a Zelda-ish game.","November 6, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Think of it as parody on A Link to the Past, but way more focused on puzzles. So if you like puzzles, exploration and RPG-like games, this is for you.\n\nLet me get it over with now: I loved the graphics and I also think the music and SFX fit really in the game. Yes, it's simple, but it helps constructing the game's atmosphere.\n\nOn to pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n* Game plays nice and puzzles are great and well thought-out\n* Funny dialogs\n* Likeable characters\n* Considerable replayability -- you have basically 3 weapons/tools available. You need two of them, it doesn't matter which. Each pair takes you through a different route. You can also get all 3 if you like. So that's at least four major ways to play the game and I've really enjoyed taking each path.\n\nCons:\n* A bit short (but you can replay it and it'll still be fun--see above)\n* Some issues with save files being deleted temporarily (or definitively, as I've read, but it didn't happen to me)\n* If you're using a controller, it may be weirdly configured and there's no way to reconfigure them. Big picture settings were overriden by the game for me. But I got used to it, no big issue.\n* If you're using a keyboard, I've read they just forgot to explain which key does which. I've found the clues on the forums, though. But kind of lame.\n* The weapons are too short and the hit area is very weird. Sometimes you're sure something is gonna hit something (either you, the enemy, projectiles, the first hitting the other one or vice versa), but it doesn't, and the opposite also happens a lot.\n* The game froze twice while I was playing and I know it happened to a lot of people. It auto-saves on (almost) every room, so you should be fine.\n* There's an optional boss that's ridicilously out of place. It's annoying to have such an action boss in a game that's so much about puzzles. I can't stress how frustrating it was.\n\nAnyway, the game is great! If you're into RPGs focused on puzzles, don't think twice--get it!","June 27, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is everything that there is to love about independent game design wrapped in a convenent package, featuring familiar but creative gameplay and a big, non-linear environment to play in. The whole thing feels a little like a parody of Beyond Oasis or Link's Awakening, but even beyond that there's a charming little story going on.\nIf you aren't the kind of person who likes to play a game more than once, this might put you out a little; to get the full experience, the game needs to be completed four different times. Many of the puzzles have several different solutions, and the game is carefully designed to keep the player from ever getting permanently stuck. The sole design flaw is the handling - Ittle can run at angles but can only swing weapons along straight lines, thus fighting is hectic and clunky in some areas.\nMany of my favorite moments involve Ittle and Tipsie's reactions to their environment; encountering enemies for the first time triggers a short dialogue, nearly all of which are extremely funny. Ittle Dew is worth playing through for it's wholesome comedic over tone alone, and once the appealing gameplay is mixed in, the result is an incredibly fun little romp.","September 8, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each room will have you either killing all enemies in the room, or pushing blocks to press switches in order to open the next room. This wears thin, and even though each item dungeon has a gimmick revolving around the new item, the premise is the same.\n\nSide-content is limited to heart pieces and collectable cards, so there is not too much incentive to pursue these, as taking damage is rare.","March 17","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No, this is not a Zelda-like RPG. And, no, it does not try to be a Zelda-like RPG. Putting the graphics aside, this is it's own unique game.\n\nThe puzzles are worth the price of admission alone. They consist of pushing blocks, planting bombs, and and using your unique items to help you progress. Some of these puzzles can be quite challenging. One of the really clever things about this game is that some puzzles can be completed in different ways by using a different combination of your items. It makes for a lot of "ah ha" moments. There is also a real satisfaction in walking into a room that may seem utterly impossible only to discover the solution after reasoning things out.\n\nThere are enemies to fight, akin to Zelda, but they serve more to enhance the puzzle mechanic rather than offer an action spin. With that said, it does mix things up in the puzzle department and there are collectables that can be picked up for your efforts.\n\nThe only gripe i have with the game is that it is painfully short. It can be completed in a matter of minutes for more intelligent gamers out there; there is even an achievement for it. The average gamer will be able to experience most of what the game has to offer in two to three hours. The game does offer extras in terms of collectables that can be sought for completionists and a end game dungeon to really challenge your puzzle solving acumen. This can extend the game time some but over all it does leave you wanting more.","July 24, 2013","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyway, Zelda lands on an island. I think its Germany because the enemies turn into confetti and candy when you kill them. Anyway, his fairy has become a flying dog that drinks all his red potions. Zelda also has boobs now (they're very small.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3147/recommended/241320/","3147","Arsonist Cow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3147/","1058 products in account","The game is full of cleverly designed puzzles and a great hint system, with very few puzzles feeling like they were unnecessary. The game is a little short, but at this pricepoint it does achieve a respectable 3-4 hours on average the first time, but obviously in less time if you don't do the treasure puzzles. It also has a good amount of replay value. Loads of puzzles can be solved in several ways and there are plenty of shortcuts that require some serious thinking to get through. You can buy the 3 main items in whatever order you want (buying the Ice Wand - the most expensive item - first makes the game significantly harder), you can can reach the last boss without all the items and there are even 4 separate versions of the last boss fight, so you can finish the game without all the items (there are achievements for doing so).\nThen there's also speed-running functionality built into the game. You can apparently finish the game in 15minutes somehow... I could barely do it under an hour when I tried (without memorizing all the puzzles tho).\n\nAnd let's not forget the lovely graphics and funny dialogue. The "wobble" graphics are very unique, quite unlike anything I've ever seen. Kind of like a comic-book game in movement? That's probably the best way I can describe it.\n\nThe game does have one pretty poor part though: the combat. It's just clunky and kind of serves more as a way to add variation between puzzles. I can't say I've enjoyed the combat in any isometric 4-directional movement game though, so it might not be something everyone is bothered by. The boss fights are better than the other fights as they kind of involve puzzles in the fight.\n\n\nIt's a great puzzle game well worth playing. If you're even remotely interested in puzzle games I would recommend giving this one a try.","October 9, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice.\n\nPros\n\nThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.\n\nThe Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.\n\nThe Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.\n\nCons\n\nThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.\n\nThe Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.\n\nThe Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the "cost-per-hour" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.\n\nAt the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it. Cautiously recommended.","July 24, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure if that is the correct amount but for that price, I'd say that is a good deal and worthwhile (here I go..judging the game by the number of dungeons).","December 26, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are only a handful of items in the game to begin with but the most valuable resource you have is your own wit.....and tipsy if you get stuck.  The game is really replayable by challenging yourself with faster times and the last acheivement 'just dew it' will take a while even for the most experienced gamers.

You can complete the game with incomplete set of tools. Speedrunning achievement is also fun. The main dungeons are fairly easy, but there are hard-as-eff dungeons if you want more challenge. The story is completely ignorable, but you might get mild entertainment from its quirky and 4th-wall-breaking dialogues.\n\nIn conclusion it is an OK game for a puzzle genre.

It has a strong focus on puzzles which you solve by pushing blocks onto switches and killing enemies. The game in general is somewhat reminiscent of Zelda. The puzzles are challenging but not enough to be frustrating. The game is pretty short and took me about 3 hours to finish, including a tiny bit of sidetracking. It took around an extra 2 to actually complete every puzzle/area.\n\nI do have some problems with the game however, the boss fights felt out of place and I didn't enjoy them. I was also frustrated with the controls, the game uses the arrow keys as well as A,S,Z,X which in my opinion was an extremely awkward choice of keys, I frequently confused each of the keys despite playing the game for hours.\n\nFInally, while I enjoyed the solving the puzzles required to beat the main game, I found some of the outside puzzles very annoying to solve, there are a lot of things that the game doesn't explain to you, like the fact that you can bounce portals and ice off of frozen walls, things like this end up being part of how you are meant to solve the puzzles so if you don't know about these things these kind of puzzles can be very difficult to complete.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and the main story has just the right difficulty level for people who people who are decent at puzzle games. The puzzles outside the main story like those in the Master Cave or Compost Crypt seem to be more for seasoned puzzle solvers.\nIt's a nice game but I feel that for its short length, it'd be more accurately priced at $5.","June 7, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice.\n\nPros\n\nThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.\n\nThe Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.\n\nThe Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.\n\nCons\n\nThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.\n\nThe Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.\n\nThe Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the "cost-per-hour" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.\n\nAt the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it. Cautiously recommended.","July 24, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as good a quality, if not a little higher than the 2D Zelda games Nintendo offers.

A few of the required puzzles are very brainbending, though for the most part quite passable.\n\nThe optional puzzles are a different story. In addition to puzzles in out-of-the-way caves for collectable rewards (Either superfluous cards or helpful bits of paper) there are "professional shortcuts" which allow you to bypass most of the game if you're smart and skilled enough to use them. You probably won't be, by the by. Shortcuts aside though, the game works quite well mechanically, and the three tools you get to solve puzzles with open up a lot of variety and give way to clever puzzles. Some puzzles were so clever I never figured them out, and I probably never will. And that's okay.\n\nAs an aside, I received my copy of the game through a promotion with Games Matter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/241320/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Traditional Zelda is a style of gameplay that is near and dear to many people. The top down adventure makes for some creative puzzle situations and hugely detailed maps. After many years of tinkering with the formula, Nintendo is finally returning to their heritage with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.\n\nWhat are gamers to do in the meantime, though? If one is not a fan of the 3D games or the DS titles, what kind of game will fill the void? Enter Ittle Dew, a top down adventure game from indie dev Ludosity. What the game lacks in innovative puzzle and world design, it more than makes up for with charm and game feel.\n\nThe plotline for Ittle Dew is incredibly simple. Your character washes up on the shore of an island and wants to get off. The caretaker of a shop will build you a raft as long as you go through some dungeons he has set up. You also need to pay him for the items he sells, so there is a main hub dungeon that will let you accrue some cash.\n\nThis is probably the weakest element of the game. While the original Zelda game did not really possess a story of any kind, forgoing a narrative in today’s age is a curious decision. One can personally believe that gameplay speaks above all else, but without a strong desire to continue, some gamers may not even be bother to check Ittle Dew out.\n\nThankfully, the puzzle designs in Ittle Dew are fairly strong. Stripping down the Zelda formula to its basics, Ittle Dew gives players very limited commands to deal with. Controls are essentially walking with the joystick, the four face buttons used for specific items and two shoulders buttons for a map and hint screen.\n\nThe hint screen is very nicely done, too. Instead of spelling out solutions or talking in cryptic riddles, the game uses the humorous character of Tippsie to lightly insult the player while giving some key hints. Things like, “You’ll only need your fire sword for this room,” are better tests of skill than detailing exactly where to swing your item.\n\nThe specific items collected are a teleport rod, a fire sword and an ice rod. In an interesting twist, there is no proper order of progression in the game. The best aspect of is how non-linear the design is. Upon completing the journey, I was under the belief that any player would have to acquire all three of the weapons to finish their quest. That actually isn’t the case. Some of the dungeons even have shortcuts direct to the boss rooms.\n\nAlong with shortcuts and paths for skipping items, the game also has hidden dungeons for collecting extra health and cards. The cards don’t really offer any purpose to the game, but their rooms have some insidiously obtuse puzzle designs. I was stumped in one room for a solid 20 minutes before stumbling upon the answer.\n\nWhen you are transported to any dungeon for a specific item, you only need your wits to get through. No puzzles require another objects or skills you do not possess. This alleviates a lot of frustration from the proceedings.\n\nThere really isn’t much in the way of challenge, however. If you die, the game simply restarts you in the exact same room with full health. Other than how the sword’s arc doesn’t fully surround your character, the only time one will get annoyed is when they cannot solve a puzzle quickly.\n\nA good mention must go to the writing behind Ittle Dew. Everything is very self-referential and parody laden. Genre tropes like collecting hearts and destroying pots all make some kind of appearance. Even the nonsensical nature of enemy placement gets mentioned for being so pointless.\n\nYour main character revels in eating hearts and even wishes to just smack things around. The bosses utter some ridiculously incomprehensible catch phrases and then admit to not even knowing what they were talking about. One cannot help but crack a smile while playing.\n\nEven the ending is funny. While a rather obvious plot twist occurs, when the final battle comes to a close, the game pokes fun at how most final bosses just kind of give up or don’t take a more obvious approach.\n\nSadly, while Ittle Dew might be great at questioning why adventure games follow specific mechanics, the game really does nothing to spice them up. One shouldn’t be displeased with a fairly high quality Zelda-\nlike game, but a lack of innovation really does hurt the final product.\n\nThere are some texture designs on the world map that are misleading, as well. For the most part, you cannot walk behind any of the trees in the game. Some of the hidden dungeons are behind them, though. Enemies also disappear behind the trees and are completely invisible to the player.\n\nFor that matter, the world map doesn’t really serve any purpose other than to move you from point A to point B. Hiding extraneous items behind puzzles is a great incentive for replay value, but giving players some other reason to explore would go a long way to creating a believable world.\n\nThere is a bonus dungeon hidden in the fields. This acts as the penultimate test of your skills, requiring every item in the game to fully complete. There are 12 rooms and each one gets progressively more challenging in skill. This serves as a nice little bonus to an otherwise very short game.\n\nTo sum everything up, while Ittle Dew might not be the second coming of adventure gaming or a masterpiece of epic proportions, the game provides plenty of wit and humor along with some decently mind bending puzzles. The game also controls nicely.\n\nFor $14, one could do much worse. Ludosity certainly does not get points for creativity, but their craftsmanship is noble. This game may not be Zelda, but Ittle Dew.

Mechanically, Ittle Dew works just about as well as you'd expect. You can walk around, hit enemies, but the real fun comes from the various puzzles. Like a Zelda game, Ittle Dew has an assortment of items that you'll utilize to solve puzzles. However, unlike a Zelda game, where you'll usually find yourself with 7-8 unique items, Ittle Dew only has. This isn't a major issue, for two reasons. Ittle Dew is a shorter game than Zelda games, and two the way that item's works together creates a large amount of replayabilty, due the game's design allowing for puzzles to be solved in multiple different ways. Ittle Dew's three items are a fire sword, which should be fairly self-explanatory, you hit things and light them on fire, a Portal Wand, which allows you to create blocks and teleport objects around and a Ice Wand which allows you to freeze objects. A large portion of the games puzzles are solvable in multiple different ways using any number of the game's items.

The puzzels start off really easy but they are nearly impossible at the end (for me). You start off with just a stick and get more weapons/magick as for progres. A few times you lose all your stuff just to get you to use the new weapon/magick. This might seem annoying but you get it back soon enough. I like the fact that the world is pretty much open. Once you encounter a puzzle you can't figur out, you just continue somewhere else. Then you get a new item and suddenly the puzzle makes sense. The little jokes in between are funny, and the storyline is ok. The only negative about this game are the little graphical and audio problems. In the little rooms where the crazy old man was tied up, the foor was just black. I think the texture tiles were missing. And some tiles didn't fit perfectly, leaving a small green line at the side. And I didn't have any sound. I played this on Linux, so I might miss some dependencies. Overall is this a great game to relax, puzzle, smash and admire the art assets.","February 23, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/241320/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Traditional Zelda is a style of gameplay that is near and dear to many people. The top down adventure makes for some creative puzzle situations and hugely detailed maps. After many years of tinkering with the formula, Nintendo is finally returning to their heritage with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.\n\nWhat are gamers to do in the meantime, though? If one is not a fan of the 3D games or the DS titles, what kind of game will fill the void? Enter Ittle Dew, a top down adventure game from indie dev Ludosity. What the game lacks in innovative puzzle and world design, it more than makes up for with charm and game feel.\n\nThe plotline for Ittle Dew is incredibly simple. Your character washes up on the shore of an island and wants to get off. The caretaker of a shop will build you a raft as long as you go through some dungeons he has set up. You also need to pay him for the items he sells, so there is a main hub dungeon that will let you accrue some cash.\n\nThis is probably the weakest element of the game. While the original Zelda game did not really possess a story of any kind, forgoing a narrative in today’s age is a curious decision. One can personally believe that gameplay speaks above all else, but without a strong desire to continue, some gamers may not even be bother to check Ittle Dew out.\n\nThankfully, the puzzle designs in Ittle Dew are fairly strong. Stripping down the Zelda formula to its basics, Ittle Dew gives players very limited commands to deal with. Controls are essentially walking with the joystick, the four face buttons used for specific items and two shoulders buttons for a map and hint screen.\n\nThe hint screen is very nicely done, too. Instead of spelling out solutions or talking in cryptic riddles, the game uses the humorous character of Tippsie to lightly insult the player while giving some key hints. Things like, “You’ll only need your fire sword for this room,” are better tests of skill than detailing exactly where to swing your item.\n\nThe specific items collected are a teleport rod, a fire sword and an ice rod. In an interesting twist, there is no proper order of progression in the game. The best aspect of is how non-linear the design is. Upon completing the journey, I was under the belief that any player would have to acquire all three of the weapons to finish their quest. That actually isn’t the case. Some of the dungeons even have shortcuts direct to the boss rooms.\n\nAlong with shortcuts and paths for skipping items, the game also has hidden dungeons for collecting extra health and cards. The cards don’t really offer any purpose to the game, but their rooms have some insidiously obtuse puzzle designs. I was stumped in one room for a solid 20 minutes before stumbling upon the answer.\n\nWhen you are transported to any dungeon for a specific item, you only need your wits to get through. No puzzles require another objects or skills you do not possess. This alleviates a lot of frustration from the proceedings.\n\nThere really isn’t much in the way of challenge, however. If you die, the game simply restarts you in the exact same room with full health. Other than how the sword’s arc doesn’t fully surround your character, the only time one will get annoyed is when they cannot solve a puzzle quickly.\n\nA good mention must go to the writing behind Ittle Dew. Everything is very self-referential and parody laden. Genre tropes like collecting hearts and destroying pots all make some kind of appearance. Even the nonsensical nature of enemy placement gets mentioned for being so pointless.\n\nYour main character revels in eating hearts and even wishes to just smack things around. The bosses utter some ridiculously incomprehensible catch phrases and then admit to not even knowing what they were talking about. One cannot help but crack a smile while playing.\n\nEven the ending is funny. While a rather obvious plot twist occurs, when the final battle comes to a close, the game pokes fun at how most final bosses just kind of give up or don’t take a more obvious approach.\n\nSadly, while Ittle Dew might be great at questioning why adventure games follow specific mechanics, the game really does nothing to spice them up. One shouldn’t be displeased with a fairly high quality Zelda-\nlike game, but a lack of innovation really does hurt the final product.\n\nThere are some texture designs on the world map that are misleading, as well. For the most part, you cannot walk behind any of the trees in the game. Some of the hidden dungeons are behind them, though. Enemies also disappear behind the trees and are completely invisible to the player.\n\nFor that matter, the world map doesn’t really serve any purpose other than to move you from point A to point B. Hiding extraneous items behind puzzles is a great incentive for replay value, but giving players some other reason to explore would go a long way to creating a believable world.\n\nThere is a bonus dungeon hidden in the fields. This acts as the penultimate test of your skills, requiring every item in the game to fully complete. There are 12 rooms and each one gets progressively more challenging in skill. This serves as a nice little bonus to an otherwise very short game.\n\nTo sum everything up, while Ittle Dew might not be the second coming of adventure gaming or a masterpiece of epic proportions, the game provides plenty of wit and humor along with some decently mind bending puzzles. The game also controls nicely.\n\nFor $14, one could do much worse. Ludosity certainly does not get points for creativity, but their craftsmanship is noble. This game may not be Zelda, but Ittle Dew.

Mechanically, Ittle Dew works just about as well as you'd expect. You can walk around, hit enemies, but the real fun comes from the various puzzles. Like a Zelda game, Ittle Dew has an assortment of items that you'll utilize to solve puzzles. However, unlike a Zelda game, where you'll usually find yourself with 7-8 unique items, Ittle Dew only has. This isn't a major issue, for two reasons. Ittle Dew is a shorter game than Zelda games, and two the way that item's works together creates a large amount of replayabilty, due the game's design allowing for puzzles to be solved in multiple different ways. Ittle Dew's three items are a fire sword, which should be fairly self-explanatory, you hit things and light them on fire, a Portal Wand, which allows you to create blocks and teleport objects around and a Ice Wand which allows you to freeze objects. A large portion of the games puzzles are solvable in multiple different ways using any number of the game's items. Even beating the game only requires 2/3 of the items, this encourages exploration in the game world and experimentation with the game's mechanics as you figure out how to get to the end with a limited toolset, and I found doing so to be very compelling.

I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice.\n\nPros\n\nThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.\n\nThe Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.\n\nThe Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.\n\nCons\n\nThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.\n\nThe Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.\n\nThe Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the "cost-per-hour" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.\n\nAt the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it. Cautiously recommended.","July 24, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a puzzle game it's surprisingly challenging and the different mechanics work well together and lend to some interesting stages. The design of the puzzles actually reminds me a lot of Portal in how they're constructed and the lateral thinking that you have to apply sometimes (and not just because there's a portal wand in the game).\n\nHowever the game is pretty short, I was able to get the achievement for beating it in 3 hours on my first playthrough and I thought I was taking it slow. There's replay value in that puzzles that are easy with say the portal wand are much much harder when you try to brute force it using just the ice wand, and doing the Wanderer achievement was very difficult and at times I had to use a walkthrough which is something I never do. The collectables are entirely pointless (they even say so in the game), the bosses and combat in general is frustrating and not fun at all, and the entire game can feel shallow but there's fun to be had. I got it for nearly nothing on the humble bundle and I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $5 for it based on its length but if you like puzzle games you'll probably have a lot of fun with it. I just wish they focused more on the puzzles and took out the combat parts of it entirely, since they serve no purpose and will end up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off more than anything.\n\nEDIT: I forgot one of the most important aspects for me which is linux support (if you're running on Windows you can just skip over this). This game does support linux and plays great on it compared to other ports on steam, with fully working achievements unlike say Postal 2 (which still bothers me to this day). HOWEVER the controller support is wonky. The first time I ever started the game I calibrated my controller, and everything worked perfectly. I close the game, restart it, and the controls for the analog stick are completely broken, the character will walk when I dont press anything, will go in the opposite direction of what I tell it to, and generally it's unplayable with the stick now even though it worked perfectly the first time, and recalibration did nothing to fix it. Thankfully I was able to map movement to the dpad instead which was fine, but since I'm using a ps3 controller and the dualshock 3's dpad is garbage it was pretty annoying to control like that, though everything else worked perfectly.","June 17, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I expected something at least decent but what I got was a great and clever puzzle game with high replayability and amusing dialogue/parody.\n\nThe core puzzle gameplay is based around sliding block puzzles, yes, but with interesting mechanics I've not seen done before, especially not all together in the way this game does. Every puzzle feels unique and fresh, and they range from the simple to the mind-numbingly difficult (though I admit that I looked up solutions to a few in the master cave... the harder ones there are also kind of the weakest, lots of secret mechanic stuff you need to know :s )\n\nOn top of that, there are four different ways to complete the game. You can get all three items or any combination of the two, and the paths you can take through the castle are quite different for each 2-combination. I quite enjoyed working out the different ways to make it through to the end, it kept replays fresh and interesting. The achievement set is also pretty great; a few bonus dungeons, 100% collection, and an added challenge to one of the routes for beating the game without harming a few specific enemy types (only possible via one of the four routes, sadly, and there's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ move possible right after the final boss if you don't set up the castle properly... but ehh!)\n\nThe writing is also amusing, toying with lots of RPG tropes (especially Zelda tropes, which is this game's closest comparison to begin with) but not going overboard. It's very self-aware but clearly the devs loved the kinds of games they're mocking.\n\nThe one weakness of the game is the combat, which is very bare-bones and kind of picky; weapon seems to be a bit shorter than it appears on your character, most notably. It's not a big enough flaw to really detract from the overall experience, though.\n\nThe main game will probably only run you 3-4 hours by itself, including all the extras, but replaying is worth it even if you're not achievement hunting since it does change the game quite a good bit. I think the price is fair, although I did admittedly get this game via Humble. But in the end I'm quite pleased with this silly little game, it's quite a good time.","February 1, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I would have to disagree with some other reviewers that this game is a rip-off of the Zelda series.\n\nSurprisingly, I found quite a few of the puzzles to be more challenging than I've found in Zelda games (and yes, I remember the water temple in OoT.)  The developers did an excellent job of creating some difficult puzzles which take all of the available tools to solve (especially in the optional Master Cave.)  The interaction between the freezing rod and the portal rod was especially ingenious.  Plus, the game itself is quite tongue-in-cheek, which keeps it pretty lighthearted.  I was pleased to see the random commentary when walking up to some random objects throughout the game.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy games that make me think, and this game definitely accomplished that.  Additionally, I found Ittle Dew to have decent replay value due to the added challenge of trying to complete the game with varying combinations of the tools (rather than all of them.)\n\nIn the end, if you enjoy puzzle-heavy games in the same vein as classic Legend of Zelda (and have a sense of humor), then Ittle Dew is worth the purchase.","December 31, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That impression proved to be largely inaccurate.  They share some superficial similarity... a tope-down perspective, a sandy haired protatgonist clad in green, some hack and slash gameplay, bombs, wands, and puzzle solving...  But Ittle Dew is much more oriented toward the puzzle solving.  The controls are quite firm-feeling, and are not well-suited to extensive swordplay, but the level design doesn't push a lot of hack'n'slash action.  Most rooms have puzzles to be solved, and the game is mostly non-linear.  In fact, it offers built in challenge modes by purchasingonly 2 of the 3 items offered for the completion of the game's puzzles, with semi-secret alternate routes to accommodate those that choose the handicap.  It also has some extra challenge rooms at the end of the game, after all the items are unlocked.  Some of these border on unfair by featuring puzzles that exploit mechanics that were never seen in the main game in ways that aren't intuitively very clear.  The main quest, by comparison, is almost too straight forward and kid-friendly in its puzzle design.  Approach it with tempered expectations and it's fun game on its own, worth spending a few hours on.","September 7, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But while the premise for the game is solid and built on nostalgia, I never felt like I was playing anything more than a very long demo. I hope Ludosity recognizes they have a great concept on their hands and create a full-length sequel in the future.

The game is mostly puzzle based though also containes a lot of enemies to fight. But it's definitely the puzzles you'll be concerned with, since they get HARD. A few of the required puzzles are very brainbending, though for the most part quite passable.\n\nThe optional puzzles are a different story. In addition to puzzles in out-of-the-way caves for collectable rewards (Either superfluous cards or helpful bits of paper) there are "professional shortcuts" which allow you to bypass most of the game if you're smart and skilled enough to use them. You probably won't be, by the by. Shortcuts aside though, the game works quite well mechanically, and the three tools you get to solve puzzles with open up a lot of variety and give way to clever puzzles. Some puzzles were so clever I never figured them out, and I probably never will. And that's okay.\n\nAs an aside, I received my copy of the game through a promotion with Games Matter. They are cool people you spotlight games and throw free copies at people, so go ahead and follow them at @GamesMatterHQ.","August 20, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the inspiration is clear, Ittle Dew focuses almost completely on the puzzle aspects, and completely outdoes Zelda in this regard. In the game, there are only three items. One item burns things, one item freezes things, and one item moves things. All of these items interact with each other, and create interesting puzzles as a result. The game is beatable with all three items, or with any two. The items can be acquired in any order. This actually dramatically changes the way you'll progress through the game, as well as the puzzles you will encounter. There is also a sort of modular difficulty, in that many puzzles are solvable with only one or two of the items, but are difficult. If you come back more fully equipped, it usually makes the puzzles much easier.\n\nThat's all I have to say mechanically, which I think is the primary draw of the game. However, it also oozes charm. It uses a Home Movies-esque Squigglevision style animation which lets you immediately understand what is interactable on the screen. It has a lot of cute dialogue. The characters are one-note, but they do what they need to, and have some pretty funny jokes involved with them.\n\nI think this is easily in my top 10 games. Everyone who has an appreciation for tight design should play it.","December 27, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics, the adventure tag or the RPG liked screen shots. Ittle Dew is a game with minimalist and nonsensicle plot with a little exploring with tonnes of puzzle.\n\nIn this game, you need to explore dungeon and progress by solving puzzles and unlocking doors. Each area may consists of 1 to several puzzles that you need to solve with the aid of certain weapons. They can be more than 1 approach to solving the puzzle. Each room is reset when you leave the area and coming back. Solving the puzzle will then unlock the doors permanently.\n\nThe puzzles can be challenging especially the optional ones. The mechanics can be simply but the logic can be tricky. If you longed for greater challenge, you can always visit the master dungeon (which is optional), but be warned as you might need to juice the brain a little.\n\nThe boss fights can be tough as there are no hint on how you should approach or tackle them. My guess is there were meant to be that way so it seems like another puzzle for you to solve along the way.\n\nMy only beef with the game is the achievement. Personally I think there is no reason to replay them as the puzzles and maps are the same even though there are several ways to tackle them. You might already solve them during your first gameplay but having all three weapons automatically cancels the achievement.","October 6, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is mostly puzzle based though also containes a lot of enemies to fight. But it's definitely the puzzles you'll be concerned with, since they get HARD. A few of the required puzzles are very brainbending, though for the most part quite passable.\n\nThe optional puzzles are a different story. In addition to puzzles in out-of-the-way caves for collectable rewards (Either superfluous cards or helpful bits of paper) there are "professional shortcuts" which allow you to bypass most of the game if you're smart and skilled enough to use them. You probably won't be, by the by. Shortcuts aside though, the game works quite well mechanically, and the three tools you get to solve puzzles with open up a lot of variety and give way to clever puzzles. Some puzzles were so clever I never figured them out, and I probably never will. And that's okay.\n\nAs an aside, I received my copy of the game through a promotion with Games Matter. They are cool people you spotlight games and throw free copies at people, so go ahead and follow them at @GamesMatterHQ.","August 20, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acedrgn/recommended/241320/","acedrgn","BWAAAAAARRRKK!!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acedrgn/","621 products in account","Ittle Dew is a simple top-down action adventure game about an adventurer, Ittle Dew, and her magical fox companion, Tippsie. The duo crashes their raft against an island with a castle, and they do as adventurers do. They explore that ♥♥♥♥ hard.\n\nIttle Dew was a lot of fun, despite its very short length. It has the look and feel of a Zelda clone, but it leans a bit harder into the puzzles than Zelda games tend to. That's definitely a good thing, considering how interesting the puzzles can be. You use a small set of three items to solve a decent variety of puzzles ranging from incredibly easy to fairly difficult. I doubt you'll be pulling your hair out with many of them.\n\nIt was smart for Ittle Dew to focus more on puzzles than combat, because the hit detection is sloppy with a capital S. You'll often find your sword passing through enemies while you often get hit from incredibly awkward angles. On top of that, later rooms can be filled with projectile launching enemies. Thankfully, the only consequence for death is a room restart, so it never gets to be too frustrating.\n\nI spent just over 2 hours in my playthrough of Ittle Dew (2 hours, 1 minute, 5 seconds according to the in game timer). A 100% completion run could easily see 1-2 more hours added onto that. While this is definitely short, it's certainly a very enjoyable experience. Ittle Dew's leaderboards also challenge you to compete with others in speedruns of a few different categories.\n\nAll that said, $10 may seem to be a fair price, or it may seem to be a bit too much. If you really enjoy 2D Zelda games and their imitators, and if you really enjoy speedruns and replaying games, grab this one at full price. If any of those three previous qualifiers don't apply to you, but you still want to check this one out, maybe wait for a sale.\n\nFor those who like score numbers, I'll take the score straight from Ittle Dew's mouth. It's a 3/5 at best.","November 17, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It consists of\n80% block pushing puzzle solving with some of the hardest puzzles I ever faced and I faced lots. In fact the puzzles remembered me of the ones in Goof Troop. I often thought "How can this even be possible?". At least the Master-Cave will get you to really hard thinking.\n10% being like Zelda and\n10% making fun of Zelda ^^ (I love Zelda and laughed heartily, because it nails it)\n\nThe puzzles have some cool and innovative mechanics. You can summon a portal block, then shoot a portal projectile which will teleport certain things to where the portal block stands. You can freeze walls to mirror portal projectiles or freeze ignited bombs to stop them from exploding a short time until they dew. This I suppose gives the game not only its name: It will dew = It'll dew = Ittle Dew, but gives many possibilities for the puzzles. And these possibilities are used with skilled cunning by the devs *great praise*.\n\nSuggested for pushing puzzle logic likers ;-)","March 5","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I can't say Ittle Dew is exemplary by any means (specifically, the ones previously listed) it excels well in understanding its unique charm.  The flaws, in this sense, actually improve the game (subjectively, of course) since the whole game is just filled with character.\n\nThe Zelda-esque gameplay has been done a hundred times, so you should know the exact gameplay you're getting into--As a side note, it is pretty unique in that its short, but certain items (which all help solve the game's puzzles) can be collected in different orders on your playthroughs, though I admit I've only played through the main game once.\n\nMy favorite part of this game though was the dialogues--Its very rare in a game do I get excited to drop the controller and see some back  and forths, complete with animated character portraits, that, once again, are filled to the brim with developer charm.\n\nThe world is colorful and the characters in it are what I'd consider the game's top aspect.
