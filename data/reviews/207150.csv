"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenraven/recommended/207150/","greenraven","greenraven22","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenraven/","955 products in account","Before we begin let me just say that there's a chicken and the egg paradox here: Nobody wants to buy this game because it's dead, but it's only dead because nobody wants to buy this game. So for those of you who just want to know how active the game is right now, the answer is "dead as dead can be". At the time of this review I have successfully completed 14 matches after having "played" for 36 hours.\n\nIf this was a free game then maybe the user population wouldn't such a problem that it is now, but it's not. This game will usually get a 75% discount during major Steam sales, if you see it, buy it. And here's why.\n\nPicture League of Legends in space, that's the gist of this game. But there's much more to it that than. There's an overall ship progression that carries over from games that allows your ship to grow more powerful over a period of time. At the end of each match you'll usually get rewarded with augments, weapons, and medals to customize your ship. And you can choose between 4 different skills to take into battle to better fit your playstyle, and as these type of games go you also have an "ultimate ability" late game to make that final push towards the enemy HQ easier.\n\nThere are two main game modes: Conquest and Battlefield. Conquest is the main League mode where each team tries to sweep across the map and smash the opposing HQ. What's really great however is that there's an emphasis on teamwork because there's a shared technology/upgrade pool. You can spend your credits to upgrade yourself OR you can give it to the team and upgrade your faction's capabilities, particularly the strength of your minion ships. Plenty of potential for strong team coordination.\n\nThere are a total of 6 ships available by defualt and 4 DLC ships with unique mechanics you can purchase that greatly change the playing field. If you're going to get this game might as well opt in for the full bundle and get those 4 ships, at it's 75% discount they'll literally only cost pennies.\n\nA quick breatdown of the DLC ships:\n\nScience Vessal - First of all this is the only ship to begin at level 2. It has some powerful board manipulating skills including scrambling the enemy's movement and a tractor beam to drag your victims into your team's firing range. It's ultimate is an all consuming blackhole.\n\nSupport Ship - The ability to drop turrets and repair station on the field is a powerful advantage, the support ship lives up to it's name by being a power tactical asset to your team.\n\nThe Carrier - Introduces a new squadron mechanic to the game. You are able to launch fighters that allow you to "hit & run" from a distance and harass the enemy frontlines.\n\nArtillary Ship - Is able to bombard from a distance. Instead of line-or-sight like most ships the special cannon does almost instant damage with it's barrages. Fully upgrading your range will allow you to sit comfortably behind your allies while chipping away at the enemies defences with little worry for your personal safety.\n\nIs the game dead? Unfortunately yes. Should you buy it at full price? Probably not. Should you buy it when it's on sale? Hell yes! Should you tell your friends to buy it? Definitely yes!!\n\nFor those of you who do end up giving this game a try a few quick tips: The majority of the remaining player base is European, so if you want to find a good game chances are you'll need to adjust to their timezone. If you can't find a game you can at least do a PRACTICE MATCH against the computer. (A lot of people complain that they haven't been able to try out all the ships without realizing there's a practice option.) You won't get any experience towards leveling your ship, and you won't get to have any real ship on ship battles, the maps only have minions and turrets. But it's a way to get familiar with your ship without the pressure trying to win.\n\nThis is a really great game whose only real problem is a lack of players.","February 24, 2014","true","51.6"," 190 of 222 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","190","222","0","9"

Instead of focussing on some pre-defined characters it focuses on ships which can be customised with various abilities. More importantly it becomes about using your surroundings in combat and playing towards your opponent's weaknesses. Stars, nebulas and asweroid fields become tactical possibilities through which to achieve victory.\n\nHowever I cannot recommend it as it has no player base and from what I can tell it has been abandonned by the developers some time between last time I played it and the last time I attempted to.","October 14, 2014","false","8.6"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","51","57","0","0"

And if you have any questions, feel free to read the help guide, an epic tale almost as long as War and Peace, but more boring.\n\nNow with more than 6 (SIX!!) non-unique ships, each with overlapping powers so as to avoid any individuality, you can feel like a true Captain Kirk from that episode where he fights with a man in a rubber dinosaur suit who can't see or move very quickly and probably has trouble breathing.\n\nThis game is perfect for that time when you want to see a ship turning at about 2 degrees a minute, before suddenly spinning around randomly and teleporting inside a sun.

But if you are looking for something with plenty of replay-ability, I would advise not choosing this game. Seems that multi-player games are only bolstered by sales, and then quickly lose players.

The game is not very active is the right word to use. When you jump into Stellar Impact, don't expect playing this game 24/7. But if you get into a game, then you'll soon learn the small community which are playing this game, and you'll soon notified whenever people are playing. So if you don't mind maybe only playing a few matches a day, then this game is great for that.\n\nPersonal ProblemThe biggest problem I have with the game is, that matches some times can last up to 1-2 hours, which I would consider long time to play the game. And then after such a long match time, I usually get tired of it after a match or two.\n\nSummaryStellar Impact only cost 10€, so it isn't such a bad game where you can have some nice time.

The debate over whether the game is dead or not is largely one of semantics. It's technically not dead in that there are still players, but most times of the day there's hardly anyone on and this is a multiplayer only title.\n\nWhen there are enough players on to get a game going in a reasonable time frame, the community is largely divided between long time diehards eager to convince people to buy the game so they have more newbies to stomp in game and the less experienced that got duped into trying the game out. Yes, you can sometimes get a reasonably balanced match with players that aren't hostile and toxic. Sometimes. Not being a glutton for punishment, I see no reason to roll those dice.","July 19, 2014","false","1.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It is an older indie title with no single player mode. It is not nearly as popular as many other titles like this, and thus it will be very difficult to get into games, unless you are either very lucky, or the more likely scenario, you bought a few extra copies so you could play with your friends.\n\nI do not dispute that some people must be able to get groups together to actually experiance what this game has to offer, however given how tiny the community for this game appears to be, the likelyhood of you being online when a match is goign to be played is very low. Being a review, I can only judge the game on what I see, and since after a week of owning it have not been able to get into a single match, have no opinion on it other then, it really should have a single player mode.\n\nIn its current state, I wouldnt to recommend a purchase unless you know a few other people who already own it, or will purchase extra copies for them.

Both are very fun in their own way, but the longer conquest games which are evenly balanced are great fun and really promote team play.\n\nHighly recommend, especially if looking for something different than Demigod/LoL\n\n\nEdit:\nUnfortunately support for this is now very limited as the dev is working on a new game.","May 15, 2012","true","161.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Within the game itself I was constantly berated for not knowing what other players were talking about despite having less than half an hour within the game. I'm glad I only spent a few pounds on this piece of garbage, but even so It was a waste of money. Experienced players wonder why they get no game time, and then openly criticise new players.\n\nI hope you enjoy watching your precious game crumble under it's own lack of community, and as the last servers are shut down to be reused as cloud storage for Xbox one savefiles, all your hours of gameplay will fall into obscurity under the crushing disappointment that is Stellar Impact.","September 14, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ships look cool, and it feels satisfyingly naval-y in the way you have to think about your momentum/direction, and whether that puts you in a good position in the next minute or so. It's fun throughout the match, and you don't tend to feel too outmatched by people at higher levels.\n\n\nHOWEVER, it is dead - like other people have said, there are never any games going, so don't waste your money on buying. Instead I'd recommend keeping an eye on Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, another game made by this developer based on the space-navies in Warhammer 40k - it should have a very similar, tactics-based feel.","January 16, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do not pick it up. It is conceptionally flawed in a way that prevents any newbie to win against a veteran player. I bought this game during a sale, because its concept was nice. Back then, it was a few months after release, the game was almost dead already. (It is dead right now)\n\nThe game was fun for the first couple matches, because there were a good amount of newbies and 2nd Tier ships at most around. At that point the game was balanced. After a few more matches a Vetern joined with a Tier 5 ship. In a 5v5 match setup our complete team, all newbies in Tier 1 and Tier 2 ships, kept firing at that guys ship and he won. He literally outtanked all of our damage and killed us 1v5. It wasn't that we were bad, it was just that our ships weren't leveled enough. Not enough damage, not enough hull. The Tiers are balanced to each other but as newbie in this game you have lost the match before it even started.\n\nIt is the reason this game is dead. No one will put up the required hours to die their way to a max level Ship, just to be on equal footing with people that played the game much longer. I soon there after abandoned the match, as the realisation sunk in with the end of the promo weekend, that there just weren't enough newbies around anymore to have fun or level up.\n\nThe game's mechanics canabilse its own newbies, by making it completely impossible for them to have fun if they are in a match with people that played the game for much longer.\n\nIt was a good and interesting game, as long everything was balanced, but the low player base means you'll be joining matches with veterns in much stronger ships than your little dingy ship can measure up to. Its a fun game to play during sales, when new blood gets into the game, but as soon as the sale dies down, you are most likely going to deinstall the game.\n\nSave your money.","April 21, 2014","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy other MOBAs, you'll probably get at least a few hours out of the game just trying it out with each of the ships and toying around with it.\n\nIt has versatility in the number of initial potential options, even without the extra DLC ships. I Would recommend picking them up just to give yourself a few more tools to work with, in a similar manner to buying extra champions in LoL. One thing is the fact that you an not play to earn the ships, but instead you must buy them with $$$. It's a downside, but understandable. Every company is in business to make a profit. If there is no income, there is no business, no updates, no patches to fix minor problems or major bugs.\n\nThe reason I say Wait, though, is because there seem to currently be problematic server issues. People having graphical errors, account creation problems, and being locked out of the game because 'You are already logged in' errors.","April 18, 2012","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the game has a questionable player base at best multiplayer is unreliable and can leave players waiting hours to play a game which may or may not start, leaving the game for the most part unplayable. If you do manage to get into a game it's very much an enjoyable (lengthy) experience.\n\nAnother rather major issue is that this game is no longer supported by tindalos interactive, meaning no updates, patches or technical support. The game also has various balancing issues and bugs which have not been addressed, as well as a lack of security which leads players to cheat the game into adding more player slots or worse. The game will not be changing anytime, so if you do plan on buying it be prepared to accept the game for what it is. This was not a random occurance, tindalos did run into hard times without the funds to continue employing full time programmers. Unfortunately this meant that they had to cut their losses with the stellar impact title to pursue other avenues.\n\nOverall the game was a very ambitious project for a new development company to take onboard. Which unfortunately did not succeed in the end. While the game itself is actually rather good, it lacks the necessary support that a pure multiplayer moba needs to operate. It is a good game, but near impossible to play. Unfortunately in it's current age and state it's not worth buying.","December 26, 2013","false","202.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One, the game's graphics are well done in specs for how much you can purchase it for.  There are very few glitches overall in the game which makes playability enjoyable.\n\nAlthough, the lack of advertisement and support was this games down-fall.  It truly is a sad deal when a great game falls short.  Only for the fact of lost vision.\n\nCurrently you will find that the game has almost no one playing.  The ones that are playing are usually a group of four to eight people or more... that know each other and have the game.  Sadly, you'll be hard pressed to get people to game with.  There use to be a public TeamSpeak server for the game.  It was a form of assistance to help find games and teammates, as well as communication for in game.\n\nThis game could easily make a come-back if the creators and or current holders probably changed a few things... what I feel they could change to improve it.\n\n1- Change how DLC works, for example new ships costing money is not a bad idea for a space battling game.  It is very much like League of Legends, Dota, or many others in this field of play.  Change it, but how?  You ask...  Well simple, currently many have bought the game so you might as well just let them have the DLC and Ships currently available.\nWhile allowing new users to unlock these ships after meeting certain criteria.\n\n1.5- Coming off the first improvement would be including a ranking system.  Example would be using Air-force or other forms of ranking to enlist Player's rank in games.  Someone who has played enough games to be seen as a veteran or a pro could be listed as a General.  Using XP and Wins to show their personal abilities.  You could even make it rank specific to ships.... meaning I could be a Commander Specialist on a Dreadnaught but a Rookie on a Destroyer.  Granted these ships already have a leveling system which enables survivability, but not game-breaking..\n\n2- Servers, servers, server!  Find a deal or a means to get cheap and affordable server(s) that are not atrocious!  Heck, the current game building is not bad actually!  Although servers would allow them to create updates, new events, things that many games are now adopting.\n\n3- Advertisement!  I honestly never even seen any advertisement effort.  If there was it was not enough.  DOTA and LoL did not get to where they are just by fan-base alone.  They sold themselves like an individual who willing sells them self for $2.00 an hour!  I mean seriously... Not enough advertisment!  When can you have too much advertisement?  When you have people laughing at the advertisment because they see it as silly... when it becomes SO normal that when it's missing they go... oh, hey... that's a new billboard?\n\n3.5- Youtube, Google, Steam, Facebook, MySpace, and soo much more!  Heck, Youtube and Facebook you don't even need to pay for!  Be shameless in your advertisement, go all out if need be.  Blow the game up to superb expectations just to fall flat but then raise the game to those expectations once the money rolls!  Simple, no?\n\nand my conclusion...  I just followed what a bunch of others have probably said about this game... those hard-core gaming members out there that enjoy a space battle.  This game is good for a top-down battle game in space.  It gives you that feeling at least... just depressing the game has essentially disappeared due to the current holders and or creators just giving up on it.  Sad days for such hard work that they put into a potentially fine game.\n\nI rest my rant.","March 19, 2013","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is one that of a sluggish MOBA where your ship, even as you upgrade it's manueverability still turns worse than an impregnated whale on human growth hormone. I was under the impression that "multiplayer combat" meant a consistent game-to-game ship where I would upgrade work on my ship with tracked upgrades and progressions. Instead it gives you this MOBA-like upgrade system where everything is temporary, with no real incentive to play more than a few games. I'm not against MOBAs, but the expectations coming out of a game that looks like this, and almost deceitfully poses as a space sim rather than a MOBA; stating that there's "tons of loot and equipment", "classes of ships", and "factions" - not that there's much of this either. Don't let the screenshots fool you - it's NOT A SPACE SIM.\n\nAlso all the servers are empty and there is no SP.","January 2, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too many space-based games try to make you fight in three dimensions, which is more annoying than anything, but this one doesn't fall into that trap. If they'd only added a single player campaign, it would have been a hit. However, as you will soon learn, it's multiplayer only, and no one plays.

Do not pick it up. It is conceptionally flawed in a way that prevents any newbie to win against a veteran player. I bought this game during a sale, because its concept was nice. Back then, it was a few months after release, the game was almost dead already. (It is dead right now)\n\nThe game was fun for the first couple matches, because there were a good amount of newbies and 2nd Tier ships at most around. At that point the game was balanced. After a few more matches a Vetern joined with a Tier 5 ship. In a 5v5 match setup our complete team, all newbies in Tier 1 and Tier 2 ships, kept firing at that guys ship and he won. He literally outtanked all of our damage and killed us 1v5. It wasn't that we were bad, it was just that our ships weren't leveled enough. Not enough damage, not enough hull. The Tiers are balanced to each other but as newbie in this game you have lost the match before it even started.\n\nIt is the reason this game is dead. No one will put up the required hours to die their way to a max level Ship, just to be on equal footing with people that played the game much longer. I soon there after abandoned the match, as the realisation sunk in with the end of the promo weekend, that there just weren't enough newbies around anymore to have fun or level up.\n\nThe game's mechanics canabilse its own newbies, by making it completely impossible for them to have fun if they are in a match with people that played the game for much longer.\n\nIt was a good and interesting game, as long everything was balanced, but the low player base means you'll be joining matches with veterns in much stronger ships than your little dingy ship can measure up to. Its a fun game to play during sales, when new blood gets into the game, but as soon as the sale dies down, you are most likely going to deinstall the game.\n\nSave your money.","April 21, 2014","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had a lot of mechanics (both original and ones I haven't seen since wc3) that made it not another dota clone but its own unique and fun experience. It also had a lot of maps to choose from which was really nice.\n\nSadly the game is mp only with no bots so its now basically dead. Only buy it if you and 3-7 other friends also want to try it and you can just play together.","July 29, 2012","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
