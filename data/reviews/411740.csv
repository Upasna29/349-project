"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/411740/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3532 products in account","So, after playing a decent amount of levels on this, and spending around nine and a half hours on the game (at the time I am writing this) here's my overall impression of the game:\n\nThe story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, if you are looking for some immersive story-rich experience.  Some alien being has stolen your cows while you were sleeping, and you are on a mission to get them back at all costs.  I guess a lot of platformers can be kind of vague in this regard, with very limited story, so I don't really have much to complain about with this, but it is worth mentioning.  I don't really understand what is going on, but the idea is to collect at least 3 of the 10 "o rings" in each level in order to open the portal gate thing to get to the next stage, while avoiding traps, pits, falling objects, creatures, and other obstacles.  I've been working on collecting all 10 rings per level so far, and it is fairly difficult on some levels, partially due to the need to have a responsiveness adjustment for controller or keyboards.  Your lives are unlimited, but you will lose a collected ring from the level you are on with every death you incur.\n\nI really like the graphic style, and the mood and setting.  The art is nicely done, in my opinion, and the Gameplay is pretty responsive, but for me, a bit too sensitive.  Music is light and doesn't overburden the experience.  I also like the small square gates you can enter in the levels that will take you to small subterranian tunnels to usually find an "o ring" or something similar.  They're  generally scattered around the levels as you progress.  I also like some of the small in-level objects you can "eat" or "use" to create other effects with your environment, whether it is cooling yourself to tolerate heat better for a limited time, eating various fruits that grow from the regular green trees that will cause farts when jumping, which I believe can potentially kill things.  I am not certain, but I think I might have killed a fish with one at some point, though I am not entirely sure at this point.  There are also some black root-like structures that will grow when you get near them which give you some explosive powers when you jump that will lower spike traps very temporarily.  I also like that you can find hidden bonus items in many levels that you can use from the menu that will help you temporarily as you progress.  They are limited, to my knowledge, so best used wisely!\n\nWhile I like the art and style, a little more variety would be nice, as progression seems a bit slow at times, due to the fact that I am collecting every ring in each level, perhaps.  I have noticed water as I've progressed though, which is nice, and a few other things every 10 or 20 levels I move onward.  I've had a difficult time using a controller, since the sensitivity cannot be changed at the time I write this.  This can be a bit frustrating at times.  When I use the keyboard, it is much easier to do smaller movements left and right, but still not as easy as a lot of similar style games.  Some areas can be fairly difficult, where you need the smaller movements, which my controller overcompensates for, as does my keyboard - would be easier to play if I could lower the movement speed or sensitivity with a sort of in-game slider or something.\n\nI haven't figured out one squirting button I noticed on controller, and I'm not sure what that does, or if it is useful for anything.  As far as bugs, if I hold down the squirting animation, and jump away from it, the stream will stay in the same spot, I noticed.  I also noticed you can hear jump noises, or farting noises if the game is paused, and this also happens if you die and try to jump over and over.  Also, if I exit the game, I have noticed that it will default me to the wrong page, rather than what level I was just on, so I will have to go back a bit to start over, if I completely quit to the selection menu.  Once or twice upon falling off the screen, my ring appeared in places where it would be impossible to retrieve it and still collect all 10 rings in the level, making me have to restart the level entirely.\n\nOverall I do like the game, but there are some things I hope can be worked on with some time as it is developed and improved further.  In particular, I hope there will be a controller sensitivity slider that can be used because I find it moves a little too quickly for me with my controller compared to similar platformer-style games.  The glitches are fairly cosmetic, and have no real effect on gameplay, aside from the missing or unobtainable rings prompting a restart.  I feel it is a little bit pricey for what it is at the moment, but for the amount of levels it has, I would say at maybe half the price, it would be a good deal if you were planning on spending a good bit of time playing.  There seems to be at least 140 levels, and from what I have played so far, they have been fairly challenging to collect all 10 rings in each level.  It definitely is not a bad game by any means, and I will probably continue to play more and see what happens as I progress further to beat up this alien and get my cows back!\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

There is no handholding in this game and you must figure out many of the game's mechanics by yourself. Jump, glide, and dodge your way through various trap-filled levels. In every level there are "O-Rings" to collect which power up a teleporter at the level's exit. Collect enough and reach the exit, however, everytime you die you drop your "O-Rings" near wherever you died and you must go back to get them again!\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nClean, crisp graphics\nEasy to pickup\nRelaxing soundtrack\nMinimalistic tutorial (can be +/- depending on you)\n\nCons:\nLimited trap variety (spikes, falling stones mainly)\nIcons used in place of text (- for me), still don't know what "O-Rings" are!\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n\nFun platformer that provides a challenge at times. Steam achievements/trading cards and other features are on the way to make this game more polished.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations  here","November 30, 2015","true","7.9"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","27","40","2","1"

Yet Another World isn't just another silly indie platformer.\n\nIt's a solid, well-balanced adventure through the unique world full of funny and sometimes surprising details.\nWhat I personally loved about this game is the controls: it reminded me of Super Meat Boy.\n\nThe atmosphere though reminded me of FEZ thanks to ambient music and soft palette.\nSo, as the result we have a mix of FEZ & Super Meat Boy with plenty of unique features and different sort of funny stuff (like farting - honestly, the guy can fart).\n\nI would give it 4.5/5 , because I only give 5s to AAA titles lol.","December 6, 2015","true","9.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","2"

The plot is simple: villain stole the cows of the main hero, and we need to get them back, anyway. The first levels overcoming on a single breath, but the further you go, the harder the game becomes. You need to be more attentive and smart, to walk through all the difficulties and to reach your goal. A Huge amount of levels, relaxing and tightening atmosphere - that's why Yet Another World is the best platformer of the year.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfox444/recommended/411740/","snowfox444","Snowfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfox444/","463 products in account","Game IntroductionYet Another World - funny hardcore platformer in minimal style and relaxing ambient music.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeBnlpwWw98\nComments+Gameplay revolves around collecting a certain amount of rings that are scattered throughout the level to advance to the next. For you perfectionists out there, each level has lots of rings and some even have hidden secrets. Although there are many rings in the levels, only a few are required to progress to the next. You may decide if you want to find them all, or just the bare minimum to move on.\n\n+Difficulty: similar to super meat boy, with the same amount of frustration. Falling objects and spikes that pop up out of the ground can be found throughout each level. When you die, you drop some of your rings. There is also a death counter so you know how much you suck at playing ;)\n\n+Graphics colorful, pleasing to the eye; nice and simple. They may suffer from lack of variety, but are acceptable nonetheless.\n\n+Content: An abundant amount of levels, around 15 hours of gameplay to complete all of them. Every few levels, traps change and new ones are introduced.\n\n+Soundtrack used as a relaxing stimulant, and helps with the frustration of dying. Ties in with simple and colorful visuals.\n\n-Story: Lacking depth. Basically, an alien comes and steals your cows, and you have to go on a journey to get them back. Then again, this game is more focused on completing levels (like a usual platformer) than anything else. Don’t buy this game expecting a super deep and interactive story.\n\n-Controls: A little too sensitive for my tastes; one wrong move means certain death. When you are required to make very small movements, it become difficult, if not near impossible. The controls are very responsive, especially when using a gamepad.\n\n-Glitches: A few small bugs that don’t have much of an influence on gameplay. Hoping they can be fixed in the future.\n\nFinal overviewFrustrating platformer that will test your patience. Has very colorful graphics, a relaxing soundtrack, and many hours of content. However, it suffers from overly responsive controls, a few glitches, and a shallow story.  For the price, it is a great alternative to more expensive platformers. Overall a great little game to pick up and play for fun. Would like it if they fixed some of the things I mentioned and maybe added Achievements and trading cards. Level editor would also be welcome.\nVerdict: 7/10","December 8, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"
