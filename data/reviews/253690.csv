It's clear that the game was designed with multiplayer at the forefront, as playing solo is possible but significantly less rewarding. Multiplayer can be in the form of couch or online co-op or competitive play, and features gameplay so fun that it's difficult to get too worked up over the potential failures of your teammates.\n\nThe game never wants you to take it seriously, and that framework is part of what makes the game work so well. It's charming, packs a killer ear-wormy soundtrack, and offers brain teasing gameplay that will no doubt remind you of Portal. Though the main story campaign is pretty short, the package you get from the multiplayer is more than worth the price tag.","December 8, 2013","true","12.7"," 75 of 88 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","75","88","0","1"

While the game is playable in single-player you are definitely going to want to round up three other friends because this is where Tiny Brains comes alive much like Portal 2 did once you stepped into the shoes of either ATLAS or P-BODY.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=292297519\nMuch of Tiny Brains humor comes from experimenting with different possible solutions to the tasks you face and with three friends involved this can often be a laugh-out-loud riot. I will admit there were times my sides were nearly splitting from laughing so much at what had just befallen one of my online team mates or even one of my own silly foibles that lead to my untimely death that had the rest of the group roaring with laughter.\n\nTiny Brains sees you take on one of four different mice who have each been genetically altered by a mad scientist. Each mouse comes with a single physics-based power that must be used in conjunction with the other mice's power and/or environment in order to navigate their way through the challening and often barking-mad labyrinth the scientist has set up for them in an attempt to escape the laboratory they find themselves imprisoned in.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294975812\nAs the players advance, the puzzles that require solving become a little tougher and more interesting ways for your little charge to meet his untimely end are introduced. My personal favorite was either flinging or being flung under a piston like object that if not done done correctly would see the one being flung squashed to bits. The puzzles do get interesting the further along you progress but none of them stood out in the same way the puzzles from Portal 2 or Quantum Conundrum did although there were many times the team was left scratching theirs heads, furiously trying to think of the solution in an attempt to outwit one another.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=292297044\nWhere Tiny Brains falters is with its glitches and bugs galore - of which there are too many to mention and this somewhat dampens the players will to continue. Net-code is also a bit creaky often resulting in players lagging terribly or getting lost entirely as connections drop. If it were not for these problems I would most certainly have given Tiny Brains a solid 7 out of 10 but for now I would suggest that this is definitely one worth picking up on a sale. Better yet pick up three other copies and gift to three friends because you are bound to get a good few laughs out of it in the process.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 18, 2014","true","2.6"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","47","57","0","0"

It's not portal, but it's still an excellent game, what really makes this game shine is when you play it with a bunch of friends- and that's the point. If you're going to solo play this, I think your time is better spent, but as a co-op game its definitely a great experience to test friendships working out puzzles, since each person is handed a single tool in your toolkit.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that I wish there were more puzzles, DLC is likely in the future, but even so when my friends and I did our first playthrough it only took us 90 minutes- there are some challenge modes, which are definitely great to extend it's lifetime, as let me tell you, working together with 3 other people to keep the ball on the endless rotating pillar is pretty exhillarting and full of suspense, and when you do fail you just try to do it better again.\n\nFinally, I will say this, the game is available on the PS4, and if you have one I would reccomend you get this game for the PS4 instead. The game's strength is as a couch co-op/party game. Its easy to play, it's kid friendly (if you're wondering) and the single player mode just honestly doesn't bring the same entertainment playing it with friends is. As of this moment, I think this is the best party game to get for a PS4, definitely something to grab if you were looking for a reason to invite your buddies over to play your PS4 with you.","December 11, 2013","true","3.9"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

Amongst all of the similar platformers and shooters and everything in between, this game somehow manages to bring back that hilarity that we so enjoyed on a snow day at a friend's house. It can be played alone, but the game really does shine when you are playing with others. If you can't do local or friends (which is preferred, you won't want to miss those moments), you can still play with others online, and it is simply a blast. The characters are lovable and zany, and the story completely out of left field, as to be expected from indie publishers. The game has a few kinks that need to be ironed out, and the story is quite short, but the challenges and extra modes don't get old when you play with friends - it's an overall very positive experience. 8/10\nP.S: Beat the Jules mode to get the best achievement to ever grace our mortal kind!","December 11, 2013","true","2.6"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

In my opinion, there is some wasted potential here, but it works. Tiny Brains boils down to giving each player a very specific 'power' which they can then work as a group to solve puzzles. In general, the puzzles are trying to get out of a single room (move the 'key' to the slot kind of thing). The theme is science. It could be better executed, but because this is such a niche genre (4 player puzzle solving) it gets a pass. I hate saying that. In general I think it suffers from some blandness that often is associated with AAA titles. Although I have no idea what the budget was for this game - there were many people in the credits.\n\nTry the demo - it is a decent length.\n\nPros:\n+Science theme is cool enough\n+Controls work fine\n+Puzzles have a medium difficulty - could have been more difficult IMO, but it was fine\n\nCons:\n-Some levels have fighting elements which I would rather do without - just stick to the puzzles\n-Voice over is real meh\n-Graphics are bland, needed someone to make stronger artistic decisions, IMO\n-Better in short play sessions to keep it from feeling repetitive\n-I know this sounds really silly and picky - but it bothered me when all the people in the credits had the Dr. title - I know its in the theme, but it just bothers me\n\nIts a steal if you can get it on a sale.

Where Spearhead takes this so far however is in seemingly forgetting to design its puzzles as anything requiring involved thought or clever utilization of its awkwardly implemented mechanics.\n\nThere's this feeling throughout playing Tiny Brains like you're running on a treadmill through the tutorial for all of its four very brief levels. It reuses the same puzzle types, repeats similar level designs, and never gets around to taking the training wheels off. You're a rat in a maze doing the same things again and again. And that's really boring.\n\nMore frustrating still is how poorly it makes use of its coop component. It's very clearly the way Tiny Brains was designed to play, but puzzles rarely requires the use of more than one or two different powers, essentially meaning if you're playing a full game of four you'll be trading off who gets to actually do anything instead of using your combined efforts to progress. It's at this point that you're probably asking why you wouldn't simply play solo, and the answer to that lies in the aggravating handful of levels that make playing solo immensely difficult or downright impossible. I'm fairly certain I cheated through several of the last levels as there didn't seem any way to possibly get through them without the help of more players, and at one point was attempting to use two controllers simultaneously to get past what was still a very rudimentary puzzle.\n\nAnd then there are all the portions which don't center around puzzle solving at all, but instead rolling a giant ball through an obstacle course or protecting a little pink chick from a horde of rampaging chickens. These are without question the worst parts of an already miserable game, and besides being terribly boring are often obnoxiously difficult because of the poor controls and annoying cooldown timer. These portions probably take up about a third of the game, which is only an hour or two long to begin with. I'd take a moment here to write a bit more about how the before mention pink chick, ostensibly the sole female character in the game, is used solely as a victim and a villain and feels just a little sinister and problematic, but the dialogue is so cringe inducing and the narrative flimsy that there's hardly any point.\n\nEverything just comes together like a giant mess of bad design, not helped by the abundant technical issues (as of this writing online coop is all but entirely broken, and even playing solo I experienced crashes after every chapter). I love what Tiny Brains was going for with a coop puzzle game with some unusual means with which to solve them, but it fumbles the whole way and never does anything with its concepts that it just wants to keep introducing over and over.

Lags will hinder you to play the challenges (roughly 50% of the game), some people can't connect to each other and are theirefore unable to play the game at all and the developer doesn't really care about all this. So they abandoned this game for their new project.\nYou want a decent coop game? As funny this game does look, it's not worth your money. Don't buy this one and get something else.\n\n______old-review_______\nIf you didn't picked up this game yet you missed a very well executed coop game. There is nothing bad to say.

I try to play just my self on the story campaign with was getting bit frustrated because some of the puzzles are really tricky, But i manage to play try to finish that puzzles, I did not finish the full story but is actually a good game but requires to have patients. I can say this game was designed for coop play with is not a bad thing if you have a couple of friends to play it. I try to play on challenges with a friend, i fall in love with the ball washer is just pure fun that game mode will be every time your progress will be much harder. Other challanges content atually is worth it to play them. Music is very cool and i will like to see them to make a dlc for only the songs, music created by Samuel Laflamme ( he also did the Outlast music ).\n\nHere is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbPzbzwEfis video with explane the music.\n\nThere is my playlist if you want me fail in challenges, if you do thanks so much !\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSJUhACaHQkBvQIL0S0LN-xNCwUjeKsR\n\nFor me this tiny brains is a good game is fun and i enjoy so much ! I strongly recommend it to try it for 8,99 Euros support the developers who made this game. Even for full price worth it, if you want to wait for it definition you should buy it on sale\n\nOnly thing should know, PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS !","April 19, 2014","true","2.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Tiny Brains is a commendable attempt at creating a unique co-operative multiplayer experience that can be enjoyed in a single play session. The controls and concepts are straight forward enough for less experienced players to succeed, while still presenting an entertaining challenge to gaming veterans. It's a great title to play with a few friends on Steam Big Picture for an enjoyable evening of collaborative physics-based puzzle solving.\n\nSome areas of the game can be difficult to execute and may try your patience, but conquering these sections is bolstered by a wonderful feeling of group accomplishment.\n\nTiny Brains is easy to recommend to anyone looking for a fun and unique title to explore with family or a few friends.

The story is very short but there is a lot of extra content to keep you busy like jules mode where you have all the powers of the tiny brains but can't respawn, troll mode where you play as human versions of the characters but there is friendly fire, the ball chalenges they can be very difficult and fun, and soccer where you play in teams of two and you all have all the powers.

Let's get that out of the way first.  Tiny Brains is a fun little romp, created by indie startup Spearhead Games.  These guys made, easily, one of the funniest little bits of gaming I've ever seen in recent memory.  That being said, Tiny Brains does miscalculate at points and occasionally it feels like you already went through something.  Bear with me here.\n\n\nFirst, let's talk gameplay.\n\nYou play as one of four superpowered rodents (Technically five, although I'm not divulging due to spoilers), which all have a unique, physics-bending, power.  One can pull stuff in, another can create a block of ice which can either act as a trampoline or wall, or can be affected by the other Brains' powers, another shoves stuff away, and another swaps places with some object, BUT cannot affect the Brains themselves.  The game is, put bluntly, a puzzler.  You need to combine and conquer with powers, using two, three, sometimes all four at once just to get past a puzzle.  It's a devious piece of work - At times I was forced to take a step back, re-analyze my strategy, and then adapt to whatever I was coming up on.\n\nThat's the good news of gameplay.  The bad news?\n\nThe Brains, for starters, move a tad bit too slow.  It's not a HUGE issue, but in some cases, it does glare right through, most notably in the challenge mode.  Also, unfortunatly for the poor install base (I think it's small), this game was MEANT to be a co-op game, and playing single-player can sometimes feel less like a game and more an exercise in how to non-standardize puzzles.  It's still OK, but friends = Good.\n\nNow, for the graphics.  They're...Weird.  This game was meant to be a PS4 release title, but it got shoved back some.  The graphics themselves are cartoony fun, mixed with horrifically dark themes.  It makes for an oddball experience, oftentimes completely clashing with it's silly premise.\n\nThe game itself takes, at best, two and a half hours to complete, more if you want to see everything ever.  This game is good fun, but I'd get it on a sale - 20$ seems a little too much an asking price for a package this tiny (Heh).\n\nOverall, I'd buy Tiny Brains.  And so should you.","January 5, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tiny Brains is a commendable attempt at creating a unique co-operative multiplayer experience that can be enjoyed in a single play session. The controls and concepts are straight forward enough for less experienced players to succeed, while still presenting an entertaining challenge to gaming veterans. It's a great title to play with a few friends on Steam Big Picture for an enjoyable evening of collaborative physics-based puzzle solving.\n\nSome areas of the game can be difficult to execute and may try your patience, but conquering these sections is bolstered by a wonderful feeling of group accomplishment.\n\nTiny Brains is easy to recommend to anyone looking for a fun and unique title to explore with family or a few friends. With any luck more developers will take chances on games like Tiny Brains.","December 31, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was able to play this with my two younger sisters, one being 6 and the other being 11 years of age, and we were able to finish the main story in 2 hours. It was frustrating at times (probably due to their ages), but it was a lot of fun and a great puzzle co-op game for all ages to enjoy. However, because there were three of us and this is a 4 player game, having to switch between characters was a bit tedious at times. But if you can get together 3 people it is a lot of fun! And for afterwards there's even a soccer mode and some variations to the main story that you can mess around in with your co-op partners. Although the price is a little steep for the short experience, so I'd recommend picking it up in a sale.\n\nEnjoy! :)","September 30, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

If you let the appearance of it at first fool you, you should take another glance at it and when you find it on sale (not saying it's worth its original price) pick it up and try it out sometime :) i promise you will not be dissapointed.","January 6","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YTAG/recommended/253690/","YTAG","YTAG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YTAG/","412 products in account","It's a nice puzzle co-op game. The problem is, the gameplay is a bit disjointed. Probably the best way to play it and get the most fun of it, is to play it full 4 player co-op. That way four different people will get four different characters with four different powers. Having 2 player co-op or 3 player co-op leaves somebody to switch characters with different powers on the go, which could be problematic and frustrating.\n\nTo the game's credit, it is possible to fully pass the game in 2 or 3 player co-op. But that leads to my other problem with the game - it's short. Really short.About 2,5 - 3 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe humor is fine and cheeky. But visualy the style is undefined and, personaly, hurts my eyes a bit.\n\nAfter all of the above, I would only recommend this game if it's on sale AND you have 3 other friends that want to play a short, nice, little co-op puzzle game.","January 11","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only problem is the glitches, for example if someone leaves the game, its nearly impossible to kick them without disconnecting their controller and rebooting the game. Another is players respawning in places where it is impossible to complete the level without restarting. These can make Tiny Brains a really frustrating experience!","January 7","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We had no issues.\nThe difficulty level goes up during the second chapter.\nAt a point on chaper 3 we had to give up where you apperently had to swich a char in a mid air jump, but maybe we are just not skilled enouth for that :-)\n\nGame compairs to Portal2 and Trine. Its fun to play with friends. I would recomend to pick up a controler to play.","February 1","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
