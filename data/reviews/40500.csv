I liked the idea of playing capture the flag in a RTS enviroment but the limited unit selection, below standard mechanics, and over all dated feel kept this game from hitting it's mark by a long shot.\n\nI'd say try it if you don't have any other games at all and you like RTS but I even think F2P options are higher quality.\nIt's not that horrible, but I would not even play it if it was free it's so sub-par.","November 25, 2013","false","0.3"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

I couldn't click faster than the computer (what a surprise) so I lost.  I guess this is what some people like and call "fast paced", but I call it frustrating and unsatisfying.  Graphics and concept seemed OK, but way too many games to choose among to settle for another one of these experiences.","June 7, 2014","false","0.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LargePad/recommended/40500/","LargePad","Large Pad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LargePad/","405 products in account","It's a low-rent RTS/capture the flag/zoning game.\n\nAfter doing the tutorials and starting a real game, the quickest thing that stood out, is there's no standard resource gathering. You start with set gold, and you gain more by turning builder units into towers, that just instantly give a set amount of gold. But towers must be so far away from each other and maps are small, so there's a fight for territory constantly. You could also turn those builders into spell towers, which are global use, but with a long-cooldown, and every one is pretty damn strong.\n\nSo the building itself is quite novel, but then army mechanics are pretty light. There's no tech tree, and no fog of war. Just watch what the other guy's doing, and make counters. All small army/lone unit stuff.\nIf a unit dies, you get back all the gold from it, and can build a new one at your base within 3 seconds.\n\nI'd have to play more to get a broader sense of tactics, but it's just really different from most RTS games out there.","July 18, 2012","true","1.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Only 6 units, only 1 side. You get set number of gold and can't build bigger army, you just replace guys that die. You build buffing towers, thats it. Do the exact same CTF scenario the entire time. Its just a micromanage click fest and computer is better at it than you.","December 10, 2014","false","1.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

You can’t build towers close together, the level of unit micro-ing requirement is freaking insane, there is no patrol function, the economy system is poorly implemented, building variety is poor, very limited unit composition, max players per map is 2, map design is incredibly uncreative, and sound effects are poorly orchestrated. I could go on but I am limited on characters. To be fair this game is millions of times better than APOX, but alas this game can’t compare to any of the AAA RTS games. Sacraboar is quite a ♥♥♥♥ experience. Need your RTS fix? Go play supreme commander AGAIN!","April 8, 2012","false","107.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

There weren't many unit types and it seems like there's only a few different ways to play the game. A lot of time is either a mad rush for their pig or chasing after your own. The bots varied from incompetent to incredibly difficult.\n\nI didn't get a chance to check out multiplayer, but for a game this obscure, I don't think there's a lot of people playing. EDIT: I checkd out multiplayer, its just Local Area Network. Sad, because not only is that not a very common way to play any more (without special programs like Himatchi), but it means there's no ladders or neat things we see in other RTS games like Starcraft.\n\nBut hey, if you wanna see all the RTS's out there, this one has a few new neat mechanics to give you some fun for a while. But if you are looking for an RTS to get serious about, I'd probably keep searching.","September 6, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
