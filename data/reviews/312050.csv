"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/312050/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Red Johnson’s Chronicles is a game very similar to games like Puzzle Agent and Professor Layton, although it has a more serious tone and puzzles require a bit more effort than just pure logic. In fact, it blends together some of the better elements found in other (point-and-click) adventures games and does this successfully, but ultimately (and as expected) not without any flaws.\n\nRed Johnson is a private investigator who’s investigating a murder at Drownedman’s Bridge. One clue leads to another and before you know it, you’re in the middle of it. The story is actually pretty cliché, and the final payoff isn’t as good as it should be. Furthermore, the game ends with a cliffhanger, one that wasn’t even necessary to begin with, in my opinion. Still, we got a part two because of it, because Chronicles is not just one game, but two. So you get two games for the price of one. Well, two chapters is more like it, but come on, that is a good deal.\nBut let’s not get ahead of ourselves and let’s just focus on the gameplay for a minute. You view the world from a fixed (first person) perspective and with your mouse you can click on points of interest. Some of these are useless (thankfully, there aren’t so many of these) and others are useful. The useful ones will usually zoom in on the object and let you solve a puzzle, or puzzles, next.\nPuzzles range from slide puzzles and ‘detail’ puzzles (rotating an object in search of a clue, item or answer) to character confrontations where you have to pick the right answer.\nSolving puzzles will earn you money and this money can later be used if you don’t know how to finish one. Hints are relatively cheap to buy so you could get through the game by just using one of the many, many hints. It clearly needed a bit of tweaking in that area.\nThere’s actually a good variety of puzzles here. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t always use checkpoints. Sometimes it does, but sometimes it doesn’t and when the latter happens you have to start the puzzle all over again. This is awkward game design and something that shouldn’t have happened to begin with. Some of the puzzles are tediously boring or hard to solve and if you have to quit because of a lack of time or because you don’t feel like playing it anymore you shouldn’t punish the player for this. Same goes for quitting the game while trying to solve a puzzle; the game registers it as one attempt if you quit halfway through.\nSometimes puzzles reward you with evidence and that evidence can be analyzed and compared by a device set up at your headquarters. These results can then be used to progress even further, by finding new suspects and places to go to, or interrogating suspects.\nEvery now and then a QTE will trigger and it’s because of the cool controls that these encounters become even remotely interesting in the first place. The mouse is used to create a motion so let’s say that you have some screws you need to get rid of then you have to rotate the mouse in a circular motion to unscrew them. During encounters the game will ask you to press the left button and move up, down, or anywhere else depending on the given situation. But, yes (there’s always a but), the controls just don’t work. I’ve failed many encounters because the game didn’t register them properly. Unnecessary and evil, because the game ranks you based on the number of tries it took you to finish an event or puzzle.\nWhile you’re not doing any of the things mentioned above you have to search apartments and areas for clues. Unfortunately, some of the objects you have to search for are too hard to see because the graphics are either too dark or because the object isn’t instantly visible to you because it’s tucked away in a corner. So in the end it comes down to pixel hunting and that’s again something that shouldn’t be needed in this game, although it’s something we see often in the point-and-click genre.\nThe story is the usual ’whodunnit’ and even though it’s cliché, it’s executed pretty well. The characters all have the right motivations and the whole thing connects together nicely in the end.\n\nThe graphics consists of static backgrounds mixed with some small animations but on the PC they’re fuzzy and blurry and anything by hi-res. They’re also mostly brownish but that’s just the style of the game. Character animations are fine, but never great, and they’re also a bit unsharp. Lip syncing doesn’t seem to be there, characters just start moving their lips as soon as you enter a conversation.\nOverall, the style of the game is pretty good, but it could’ve used some improvements here and there.\nThe voice acting is actually pretty good (which surprised me) and same goes for the jazzy music.\n\nThe game is pretty long. I think it will take anywhere between 4 or 6 hours to complete the first chapter and after that you still have chapter 2 to complete. My estimate is that it’s roughly the same length; I still have to finish it. But it’s good value for your money. You get a good amount of gameplay here.\n\nRed Johnson’s Chronicles isn’t the game I hoped it would be. I expected another Professor Layton/Puzzle agent type of game, but got a regular point-and-click adventure instead. It mixes some fine gameplay elements found in other adventure games, and although that doesn’t make the game awesome or great it’s still become a somewhat enjoyable game in the end.\n\n[Rating: 64/100]","September 22, 2014","true","5.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","1"

The controls are horrible. Its a point and click game without the pointing and clicking because they force you to use keyboard controls for things that could easily, and much more fluently, be done with the mouse. At many points the mouse just did not work which seemed to be because i had the mouse at the wrong point on the screen. However since I didn't have a mouse pointer present at the time it was impossible to tell this.\n\nThere is also a very limited option screen which only features volume controls. There are no resolution or graphic options at all so you have to play on the settings they give you.\n\nHowever if you can deal with these issues the game does have some redeeming factors. Although I didn't play long enough to see much of it the story did look to be interesting. The characters were designed very well and had great voices work. But the best factor about this game was the graphics style. The settings all looked amazing with vibrant colours.\n\nOverall if you can overlook the horrible controls and other issues then you could play this game, if it was even just for the story. However I can't recommend this due to it being impossible to play for me personally.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","September 13, 2014","false","0.4"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/recommended/312050/","actherian","Therian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/","482 products in account","Overall a detective game "with potential" though, that is where it seems to end.\nA very poorly done console port leaves MUCH to be desired.\nI'd barely got even to the "fourth" possible destination, looking for a particular person, and spent the next 26 attempts trying to get past the ensueing QTE before getting fed up without any option to skip or auto complete.\n\n"Registration" of mouse movement is extremely temperamental. Sometimes it'll work with just the tiniest inch of movement, other times, your virtually having to throw the mouse across the room to get it to detect; and when it does, it often detects the wrong direction entirely.\n\nBaring in mind my limited playtime for this.\n\nPROS\n- Seemingly interesting story with plot twists, though thrown into the deep end with a incompetant police officer to start.\n- Interesting and varied puzzles, solvable even without having to purchase the hints and requiring a little thought to figure out where those hints are, often looking at objects in a 3D View.\n-- Though the above is also highly troublesome due to the interface. Through most of the game even, your constantly changing between using the keyboard and mouse by force, while many things could be accomplished with the mouse alone, such as rotating objects to get the 3D view.\n\nCONS\n- No options in the menu to define graphics quality or resolution, pretty much a standardized option for PC users even with years-old games.\n- Forced into using both keyboard and mouse, not an optional switch to steamline according to your own preferences.\n- Mouse sensitivity randomness when dealing with QTE Events\n- No "Skip" option for QTE or Puzzles.\n- Forced Tutorial, unable to skip. Invasive at times too when you already have a clue what your supposed to be doing.\n- Full Screen doesn't "stick" itself. With a dual screen setup your constantly moving between the screens with your mouse, making QTE even worse to try to complete. In the majority of anything else full screen will "stick" the screen and you'd have to alt out of it to do something on the second screen.\n\nOn top of that, does this game even some with a save feature?! I found out eventually that it auto saves, but there was no indication of that what so ever.\nStill, I didn't get too far into the game before getting pretty much fed up and mashing to get out of it. To think, I was looking forward to eventually getting around to playing it as part of cleaning up my backlog. May eventually try it again, but not likely.","October 15, 2015","false","3.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Awesome characters, voice acting is one of the best in video games. Red Johnson is so hot! QTEs are horribly implemented: you must use your mouse to perform various movements and that don't work most of the times.\nGameplay is very repetitive and puzzles are too difficult. I hope if the third part will be released then it will be more close to classic adventure than to collection of ♥♥♥♥ing hard puzzles which make me insane.","February 20","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It forces you to control itself through a nearly sadistic combination of keyboard and mouse and features a lot of stupid super high tech apparatuses. It's mostly non-dubbed, dubbed dialogues are only shown in weird out of place close-up scenes.\n\nPositive points are some innovative ideas and somehow interesting puzzles (disassemble stuff, do a weird puzzle, get your clue), a not so bad dubbing and an impressive soundtrack.\n\n\nIt's also not clear which audience is targeted...(neither HOPA players nor point and click adventure player)","May 4, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/312050/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Red Johnson's Chronicles is a point-and-click adventure that has a certain attitude, with decent graphics and some quick time events (i.e. press button X before time runs out, and then some other button, and then some other mouse move...) to pass the "challenges", and the usual puzzles. While the writing is somewhat fresh, the puzzles are forced and derivative, QTE's are boring and out of place, and the weird interface really turns you off. This game was clearly NOT written for the PC, and it shows.\n\nRJC has you playing the titular character, Red Johnson, who's a private investigator and he's been tasked by Officer Johnson of the metro police to help check out a murder... someone got whacked on the bridge... unfortunately, no body (may have fell into the water). You have to solve a couple puzzles to get access to clues, find more, and solve a couple QTE sequences on the way.\n\nThe graphics has a sense of those "noir" detective novels / graphics novels, with brown and gray being the primary colors. The transition between scenes are often animated and the cutscenes are quite nice with good if a bit cliched voice acting.\n\nThere are three major problems to this game: forced puzzles, weird interface, and QTE button smashes, all stemming from this being a console port.\n\nThe puzzles in the game makes ZERO sense and felt extremely "forced". For example, you find an instant camera, but the eject button doesn't work. Opening the bottom revealed that... "all the resistors had fallen out"  Huh? However, someone left enough clues on the board that I was supposed to form one complete continue line of resistors from 'start' to "finish" without violating the "number" (from 0 to 3) which is the number of resistors around each particular square. HUH? Another puzzle involving a different camera requires you to slide pieces of circuit board around to restablish the circuit among a power supply and two power destinations. Yes, the good old 15 pieces in 4x4 board sliding puzzle.\n\nThe interface doesn't help either. Most PC adventure games either use only the mouse... or only require arrow keys, space, ESC, and maybe one other key. This game requires the use of the mouse, left AND right click, space, B, V, M, AND the arrow keys. AND with the mouse you have to perform drag up / drag down / drag left / drag right actions, and it's never consistent. Many actions that could be done with arrow keys require mouse drag instead. This makes sense as this was originally designed for console controller with dual sticks AND a D-pad, plus addition buttons (4 primaries, and shoulder and trigger...)  but when it came to the PC, new keys were assigned without thought on how a PC gamer would be approaching the game.\n\nWhich brings us to the QTE... again, can never tell if you'll be doing mouse drag or actual key tap, maybe both. My first ever QTE was encountering Saul. First I hit space, then mouse drag three times (different directions) to conclude this easy test, and I flunked the first time because I wasn't gettng it.\n\nAll in all RJC's developers chose to make a barely adequate port and it shows. It's annoying to play, puzzles are forced and obtuse, which makes playing a chore rather than fun.","September 17, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
