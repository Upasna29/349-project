The game even has clips from the film.\nThe campaign is good but short and you do a nice variety of missions. The tutorial at the start is comprehensive enough for you to get a quick grasp of the controls.\nIt also has some nice realistic elements. Soldiers can get injured and can't fight until attended by a medic and if you're not fast enough may die from their injuries. You also get off screen support fro missions such as D-30 artillery strikes, rocket artillery and Hind CAS (all of which are extremely deadly) and so on. If you lose your radioman you lose your access to support. For some missions you get armoured vehicles to control and if these get hit you can bail the crews before the vehicle brews up. It's best to take care of them as they provide a great fire-power advantage over your enemy.\nThe game does have issues though nothing severe. You can't map your own controls and moving the camera around is quite sluggish. The AI have a tendency to wander off and attack enemies though this may be down to me not knowing the best way to control the troops. For some reason all of your soldiers are privates apart from a couple of warrant officers. There's also some translation errors but this is forgiveable. There are also two missions with some bugs that force you to reload in order to get through them. also  there is a mod for the game that improved it a bit .\nOverall I think it's a good game. when I think of a game that I purchased and I write about it. I always ask myself "Would I buy this again?" In this case I probably would.","March 16, 2014","true","217.4"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","89","103","0","2"

Some of the missions were actually difficult to complete, especially when you get ambushed while trying to clear a mine field.  Some might find the fact that your reallly need to keep close watch on all your troops movements at all times, especially if you split them up into 2 groups for a 2 pronged attack, a bit tedious, but I liked having to be constantly aware of my soldiers because you never could tell where the enemy would hit you next or when you would run into a MG nest.  If I had to pic anything that was annoying, it woul dbe the AI's constant targeting of my medics, but to be honest, that made it that much more challenging and realist, 'cause the enemy probably would target medics if RL anyway.  Anyway, great game and I would recommend getting it if you like rts style games.","May 19, 2014","true","36.4"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

You can only take a certain number of them on a mission, so it's good to rotate guys a bit, to give all the experience they need for the hard final battles. It has nice pre-battle squad equipment management options and off-map close support options, which get better if you complete missions well. Interesting and rather difficult missions also teach you a lot about history and the nature of guerilla warfare in Afghanistan.\n\nIt's possibly a bit too short so not all that much replay value, but if you play through it once every couple of years it'll be fresh enough. ;)","October 16, 2015","true","19.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Anyway, it follows the experience of a unit of Soviet soldiers upon arriving in Afghanistan in the 80's where you fight against future Taliban.\n\nGame itself is a mixture of RTS where you directly control several squads together with armored support (each soldier separately, so not like Total War where you commanded only a whole unit) who level up with experience. Provided they survive, of course... You can also call in support such as artillery, strike aircraft and combat helicopters if available for that mission.\n\nThere are bugs, of course. After all, this game was created on a budget lower than what an exec of a PR department of big Western publishers spends on business lunch. Okay, exaggeration, but hopefully you get what I mean. But still not as many bugs and definitely more enjoyable than some AAA games that required Day 0 or Day 1 patches and for which you also paid AAA prices. This game is only 2.50 euro at the time of writing this review, so it's well worth it's price.\n\nGraphics are pretty good, considering how old it is, just like the sound. The game itself can be pretty hard, so you either must be very good or very careful/tactical/reload frequently to get all your soldiers through alive.\n\nI admit I'm biased because I played the game when it came out and loved it and was happy to buy it cheap on Steam after so long, so I can only recommend this game and advise to keep an open mind.","August 8, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(select a unit and the camera "cinematically" pans to it while rotating...)\n\n\nThis seemed like it had some potential, but unfortunately due to the combination of unwanted camera rotations, unbindable keys, and the requirement of the middle mouse button with no keyboard equivalent (to rotate the camera) makes this a frustrating mess to play.\n\nFans of the genre may enjoy it, but due to the above issues, I have to give this a "soft" no.","January 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"
