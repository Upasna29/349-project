Some of you may be familiar with their other tiles, Strategic war Europe, Time of Wrath to name a few. While there are some issue this game seems to fix a lot of the problems with the earlier titles.\nBasic\nPlayers can choice from  variety of scenarios ranging from the fall of Poland, the invasion of France, a grand campaign and many others. Turns are a week long and each scenario has different lengths. Players can then choose which countries they wish to control, both major and minor countries can be controled and players can control as many as they feel they can handle.\nUnits\nThe game has Infantry, Mechanized troops, armor airborne fighter, tactical bombers, strategic bombers and a variety of navel units. Players can conduct research in the varies units and develop stronger better versions (more attack power). When purchasing a unity players select the unit type, the size (corps or army) and the level (1-4 depending on what they already have unlocked. The price and time before deployment will change based on the player selections.\nDiplomacy\nThere are diplomacy options but it is the basic, convince a future ally to join sooner or an enemy to join later; over throw a government or if your nation allows hold elections in your own country.\nNavy\nNavy action is simple and basic. You build a fleet and send it to a sea zone. You set the fleet to be either regular (attack enemy fleets) or raider (attack enemy conveys). The computer will randomly decide when there are navel engagements which will take place between the last plaer turn and the first player turn.\nWhat has changed since other Wasteland titles\nWell first the interface seems much more user friendly\nYou also have an increased number of options during the game. For example when Belgium do the French arm the retreating survivors  (add a unit but loss production points) or do they send them on their way. The Germans also have the option to actively look for volunteers for the army or simply stay with recruitment stations\nThe bad\nThere are two minor issues with wasteland games.\n1. Multiplayer is PBEM (NOTE there is hotseat play at the same computer). Now this is an old system and some may feel it is outdated. With a campaign being over 400 turns I doubt many people are going to\nhave the time to sit and play very long in a single seating. So while I do not see it is a problem some people may have issue.\n2. Game balance\nThe developers choose to create a more open world than historical acute one. What I mean by that is that it is possible for Romania to have tanks more advanced than the Russians.  There is still no way Romania alone could beat Russia but they may not have the crappy units they had in real life\nOne other thing with balance, and what I do not understand, is that Russia will not see the economic and military boost after Stalingrad there are no reserve from Siberia coming and it is doubtful the Russian army will ever see the number increase in troops they did in real life.\nFinal thoughts\nToW is not a bad game, and it is clear Wasteland learned from their mistakes. Sure it has some issues but most are minor and do not take away the enjoyment of the game. Some people will say 'The graphics look old" well these types of games are not about graphics but the play experience.\nSo if you looking for a decent strategy game with a good bit of depth, but not as deep as hearts of Iron I say give ToW a try.\n\n","July 19, 2014","true","8.2"," 43 of 62 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","43","62","0","1"

There is also storm over the pacific which I also own, and its also an excellent game covering the Pacific theater.\n\nWhat I like about this game is there is enough detail to feel like I have lots of control over my nation, but not so much detail that I just give up trying to play it.  I have enjoyed games like Hearts of Iron II, and Decisive Campaigns Case Blue.  However HOI III was too much, and so games like war in the East and Gary Grisby's other games were just too much for me, as much as I wanted to like those games.\n\nThis one though, its just perfect.  FIghting as the Russians against Germany for over a year and a half in my second attempt has been excellent.  I had to change the difficulty to very easy, and Im still struggling to hold on to Leningrad in June of 1942.  There is a thrust toward Stalingrad, and a new one going toward Moscow which will be tough to contain.  This game is fun and challenging for both new wargamers and veterans like me.\n\nThe graphics have many options, so you can adjust the map and the units to achive the look that you want.  I think the screen shot of the graphics and my belief that the game would be too simple and have poor AI is what kept me away from these games.  Don't let that stop you.\n\nThe only caveat is that Wasteland games does not give the best support.  I had trouble with Storm over the Pacific and fortunately I had purchased the game from Matrix, who has awesome technical support.  They helped me find a solution to the game crashing all the time.  However, I have had only one crash and one other techical problem with Time of Fury, and both problems were fixed with a reload.  I guess if I had a real serioius problem I might have to buy the game again trhough Matrix.  So that is the one caveat, the support is really poor.  Which is a shame, because they have an awesome system for war games.  Heck I just bought the 1953 Nato vs Warsaw pact game, even though its incomplete in terms of balancing and pictures for all the units.  And again, the knock on that game which is in early access limbo is that its not getting any support.  So come on Wasteland, support your awesome strategy games.","January 2","true","119.7"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","1"

There's no two ways about it; however, the gameplay is solid. If you were one of those grognards who remembers hunching over a tabletop covered with a hexmap littered with counters, this is a gem.\n\nKnow what you are getting into. This is one of those kinds of games. There is no realtime clock running or blow up tactical battlefield to play with. Instead players are treated to making hard decisions about where to invest limited resources and how to achieve victory, constrained by the same.\n\nI've enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend Time of Fury.","May 8","true","135.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Like any game it has its frustrating features. Overall, though, if you like exploring big picture WW2 strategy, this game is for you and allows you to make certain tweaks if you want an edge or a handicap in certain situations. The diplomacy and research elements are quite rudimentary, but the game's main focus is on operational strategy and in my opinion you can have quite a bit of fun with this aspect. If you're a FPS fanatic, or into RTS and brilliant graphics TOF may not be for you, but if you like good strategy and have enough patience to work out the flow of this game you'll get some rewarding play time out it.","March 17","true","0.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Also for nuclear bomb you need 3000 or even 6000 to research and after that build them, good luck getting it withtout the possibility to upgrade your IP.\n\nAlso the airplanes are ok for now, fighters prevents sometimes on their range zone enemy bombing runs, enemy recons and enemy carpet bombing. But i dont get why airplanes can be REBASED or POSITIONED in random exes withtout an airfield, this seems a bit stupid in my opinion why i can place my Stuka or my Spitfighter anyware on the map withtout the care to use a city or to build an airport?\n\nAlso the diplomacy for what i have seen now its useless, he doesnt show up, to do most actions you need 200+ diplomatic point wich are revolutioning with a chance to fail or to make a pressure on another nation ( Like make italy joining your axis alliance or make USA hate the Allies more ) but you dont get that much, the agreements are 3 and you cant make anything else, also no spying included. The Tutorial is missing this also.\n\nNaval warfare is maybe ok, basicaly you just move your fleet in any sea you want and give him the orders to fight any incoming fleet / Convoy or to avoid anything. When they engage you have random turns going from 1 to 3 to make actions, but lf you have a fleet of 10 ships and you have 1 turn you can only make to move one of your ships or to fire one time, this also applies to the enemy wich can also try to retreat his fleet with a chance, in case of failure he loses his turn, also sometimes when the turns are 3 you can only fire once or move once and then you can press "Next Move" button but he doesnt do nothing and the enemy can still do actions.\n\nSometimes the unit pathing its a mess, you can move to marshes, forestes for 1 AP with an infantry unit and still attacking somebody, but you cant move trought railroads you captured, lf you move sometimes your units for random reasons they get FREEZED for 20 turns withtout explainations or why they get stuck near cities you have captures totaly free or even in random Hexes.\n\nThe attack of ground unit is ok, but i find stupid you can reinforce units who are directly at the front by just buying reinforcments with your IP ( Industrial Power / Points ) and losing the turn by doing it, but lf an infantry unit is inside a city and you keep doing that hes almost unstopable even lf his attacked by 4 panzer divisions with 2 infantry army support and with airstrikes, also you dont have the capability to use artillery battlegroup or artillery battalions to barrage the enemy positions, this is another stupid thing i dont like the infantry have setted amount of Artillery / Anti Tank / Anti Aircraft guns already created for them. Sometimes also to attacking you can lose the turn, the attacking system is a mess, you basicaly click your unit, click enemy unit and then click again but lf you want to make a multiple attack you need to click your unit, enemy unit, another unit near then click another unit but lf you click another unit withtout moves you lose everything and you need to make it again just sometimes the same units who cant join a cordinate attack they can attack anyway alone for no reasons.\n\nFor me the game is not fun, nothing special just a mess of things put together dispate they say "Its somenthing innovative blablablabla"\n\nIs not worth 20 dollars ( i paid 20 euros for this, also same price in russia ), he costs the double then buying it on MATRIX GAMES, wich is a totaly WTF.\nAlso thanks for 9% Discount\n\nThanks for reading and sorry for my english, but is not my main language.","July 19, 2014","false","1.6"," 66 of 132 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","66","132","5","3"
