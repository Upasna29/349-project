Everything's hidden by a fog of war and has to be gradually revealed, and the amount of resources needed for building and upgrading is arbitrary and unpredictable, so it's impossible to strategize beforehand. But it's also impossible to fail. There's no time limit, just high scores and gold times, but the map doesn't show at a glance which levels you've beaten the gold times for and which you've utterly failed, so you wouldn't know which ones to replay even if you wanted to. If you're looking for a better game with a similar theme, try MOAI instead.","March 21","false","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

The cost and content are equivalent to a Happy Meal, the kiddies will learn a bit of hand/eye coordination, the graphics are nice, the audio will not drive you batty and there a tiny bit of easy reading involved.\nAs an added bonus... I have yet to see any nudity, simulated violence or death.\n:)\n\n\nEdit: typo","October 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","8","13","3","0"

I got it again.  for that person that says you can't fail because tehre is no time limit they obviously didn't play it on the right play level.  And for what the guy said about fog so you can't strategize before hand, well that is part of the challenge!  this game isn't a math problem, it's a time managment challenge... it's not laid out easy for you. but very doable.","March 24","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, there isn't much chance of failing but sometimes after playing more in-depth games it's nice to play a straightforward one. I enjoy resource management games and am not too bothered about the difficulty level. Hoping to see other versions of Island Tribe available on Steam soon too.","June 4","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
