"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/recommended/335080/","2d_invasion","RoX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2d_invasion/","1244 products in account","Biology Battle; originally released for XBIG in 2008, makes it's debut on Steam.\n\nAs a huge fan of twin stick gaming, I hold high standards when it comes to this genre game, and Biology Battle didn't disappoint me. Ported nicely, the tight controls and varity of weapons, upgrades, and power ups make this twin stick shooter an enjoyable arcade like experience, where you'll be playing "just one more time" just to "one-up" your friends, or yourself.\n\nSure there are a lot of twin stick games that are "musts" over this one but if you are looking for something new, or an enthusiest of twin stick gaming, or just need some cheap arcade action, this is a great buy. It takes the best of other games from this genre, combines them into one nice neat little package, and adds it's own flavor at a budget price.\n\nGame modes are limited but this does offer local co-op for up to 4 players and definately makes\n\nOverviewGame Play: Acrade Twin Stick Shooter\nGraphic: Decent - BB offers 2 different camera modes. Your typical top down or 3D which gives it a Mutant Storm type view.\nSound: The music and sound is really where this game lacks. When you look at other intense twin sticks like Ultratron, Geo Wars, Echoes+... they always have this driving Techno sound track that makes the game that much more intense. Sound effects are just okay but that mono-tone chicks voice (announcer) gets a little annoying, and quickly had to be adjusted to a volume level of "0".\nControls: Solid, tight, twin stick controls - when you die, you know its your fault.\nReplayability: Yes. - Though, I find myself only able to play a game here and there, as it is not a game you are going to sit and play for hours on end.\nOverall: For what its worth; 8/10.\nYes, this game is limited with play modes but that is compensated with it's price. Overall it's a fun shooter that you will pick up again and again.","February 1, 2015","true","2.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

I don't know... bacteria ?\nAs you can see, I'm not great at biology and I'm not great at twin-stick shooters, either.\n\nEven though I'm not a huge fan of the genre, I think Biology Battle is pretty enjoyable. It does not do anything out of the ordinary, though; Shoot enemies, get powerups, unlock skills and don't get yourself killed. The controls are a bit wonky sometimes and a controller is highly recommended.\n\nFans of twin-stick shooters, will probably have fun playing this game but there are a few reasons why you might not want to get Biology Battle.\nFor instance, I could imagine you want to compare your scores to others. Too bad, the leaderboards are only local. Even though, there is a global leaderboard, I do not think it works (unless I'm the only one on the planet, playing this game). There are also no achievements, which is not a big deal for everyone but it certainly does not help for replay value.\n\nHowever, the worst part in this game would be the false advertisement "play online against thousands of real opponents". Perhaps, I just did not know how but whenever I tried to play online it simply did not connect me to anyone else (if this feature DOES work, I will correct this here). Besides, I do not think thousands of people are actually playing this game.\n\nSo yeah, Overall 'Biology Battle' is not a bad game but you probably will get bored with it soon unless you are a real hardcore twin-stick shooter.","May 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Well its exactly like that, you enclosed in small space, bunch of stuff coming towards you, and you must shoot them before they touch you. Simple as that. Gameplay doesnt offer something impressive - pick up upgrades (there are quite big variety of those) and blast everything that moves, but it provides with quite alot of fun. Game also has a tiny story that really makes you smile, atleast the first time playing.\n\nBIology Battle was imported from xbox and that was done by a very lazy person, so seeing "press Y to do smth" is quite annoying but doesnt impact gameplay.\n\nSummary - fun and simple, if its on sale def worth picking up.","August 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ultimately, I had to go thumbs down since 99% of the cool features have to do with multiplayer; and I checked I'm the only player to play today...\n\nA typical dual-stick space shooter, instead of space though you are inside cells doing battle with foreign bacteria. This is a challenging offering for this genre; it gets hard right from the start.\n\nI'd pay $1 or less for this game. This was a bundled game for me.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

It's not even close to the fine polish you'll find in Geometry Wars 3, but it provides it's own depth and it's definitely a fun game with its own achievements to attempt.  For the price, I got it at (just over $1), it was definitely worth the money; especially if you love dual-stick shooters.  It's probably a bit much to ask the full $5 price for it though.  For the value I got, I would give it a 4 / 5.  From a pure gameplay quality / polish level and considering it's a pure indie title, I would give it a 3 / 5.","April 5, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not aged well, and the game is not worth your time. It's a generic shoot em up that doesn't do anything interesting, and doesn't take advantage of what could have been an intresting premise. For a shoot em up, it lacks spectical, and it lacks oomph.\n\nMore Information and Gameplay Footage Here: http://youtu.be/P8bRt8TT5E0","January 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","17","38","3","0"

In any event, I love the game for the visualizations, the lack of mismatched music, and the difficulty level. This is one of those games that you cannot beat. You just shoot and keep progressing until the 'monsters' get to exceeding building fire regulations for too much in too small a space. The 'monsters' also show a great variety in their attributes and forms which is fun. The multiplayer format of the game is also part of why I had originally purchased this game. If you have a couple of minutes to blow on a game to unwind, then this game fits the bill. If you want to get a friend to help you get further, then by all means. I should mention that this game works best if you use a controller (similar to Xbox 360 controlers), however you can change the controls such that you can play using a keyboard and mouse, but it is far from ideal. Oh, a kinda fun yet distracting part is the random text that shows up when you collect boosters, weapon upgrades, shields, die, or kill things.","July 31, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're a nanobot and you're killing very questionable amount of "virus mobs" in a cell. You get awarded points for the kills. You have few abilities, one pushes mobs away and the other is a black hole. You'll unlock them after surviving a tad. There are also powerups that help you a lot. Some of them spawn projectiles, one shields, one makes you shoot plasma, other makes your firerate rather fast. You can also pick up upgrades for your weapns.

Even when set to proper resolution.\n\nThe thin red aiming laser it hard to see in most cases and it is easy to get lost; being unable to aim or easily find yourself is one way to quickly end the game any annoy players.\n\nAll of the menu / buttons are output as though a controller must be used, and the help / tutorial windows disappear too quickly to read what they say in most cases.\n\n$5 is too much for such a simple game.
