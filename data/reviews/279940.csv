"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/recommended/279940/","Masterchiefs","Belegarssøn #ianmcshanerocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/","951 products in account","UPDATE BELOW:\n\nHere's what I originally said after playing the first chapter of The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 in Early Acces:\n\n"Ah Germans, the greatest storytellers of the modern gaming industry. First Daedalic, now KING Art, I wonder what would they bring us in the future when they already gave us the most amazing modern adventure games in recent years ?\n\nI didn't play the first The Book of Unwritten Tales, but I did play another adventure game from KING Art - The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief. While the game had good story, great gameplay and somewhat likeable characters, it also had horrendous camera, awful facial expressions and mostly terrible voice acting. Luckily, The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 doesn't suffer from technical issues (besides bugs, ya' know, Early Access) and moreover, the game is already perfect.\n\nThe story can be described in two words: MIND-BLOWN. At first, I thought it was just a typical tale about a princess, a gnome and a generic dude with beard who's destined to save the world blah blah... but I was wrong. TBoUT2 is more than that. It's full of witty, funny jokes and pop culture references. You can easily find something related to Harry Potter, Batman or Game of Thrones throughout the story and of course they're not misplaced at all. You will love the characters, no matter how they look and what they do. You will laugh until you fall of a chair, a lot. You will drop your jaws because of how beautiful the world is. You will scream "I WANT MORE!!!" after the chapter ends. However, I'm still a little bit disappointed with the ending, as many subplots are still unexplained and the game kinda ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nYou want me to tell more about the game ? I'd like to but I can't. Experience the game by yourself. Even in 30 minutes, 1 hour or 6 hours, you won't regret visiting the wonderful world of The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.\n\nNow, are you ready for a new adventure ?"\n\nAnd it's been nearly a year after the game came out, and my point still stands that it's one of the best adventure games of 2015, standing on the same line of Grim Fandango Remastered, Tales from the Borderlands and STASIS. A title full of energy filled with remarkable writing and memorable characters, and you just simply won't find any fantasy point-n-click game with this kind of production value in this day and age.\n\nMy only complaint is the ending, the game ended so abruptly on a cliffhanger and a lot of sub-plots weren't dealt with. It seems like Book 3 is definitely happening and the story will truly end. That said, the ending isn't so bad that makes the game pointless, the thing that matters most is the journey itself and Book 2 did it fantastically.","September 7, 2014","true","19.4"," 65 of 72 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","65","72","3","3"

It was a perfect adventure game for me, logical puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, good graphics, nice story and humor. When i found out that sequel is in development i get excited and instantly added the game to my wishlist.\n\nIt is strange to see an adventure game in early access. At least this one is not abandoned and devs are working on the game like they promised. From what i have played i like the game more than the first two. You play as the same three characters as in previous games.\nThe backgrounds/environments are gorgeous, i admire them and want to take screenshots. Graphics looks really nice, maybe character models could use some work, but this is really a very small flaw. What i love the most in this game is humor. I don‘t know if it‘s just me, but i laughed countless times already, the dialogues/monologues are hilarious and there's some funny references to other games or game characters. I hope the game will keep the same mood and dialogues until the end.\nOh and this game is pretty educational. For example did you know that dolphins aren't fish? They're birds.\n\nThe game plays as classic point&click adventure game, nothing new here. You talk to characters, put countless junk in the abyss  in your pocket, combine things, use things, read things.\n\nI know the genre is not very popular, so if anyone love this genre at least a little i encourage you to support "KING Art". At least try the previous games which are often ~80% off.\n\nGreat work so far. Thank you for this game. I hope my opinion will not change when i finish the game :)","January 20, 2015","true","23.0"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","44","53","2","0"

The trailer claims 25 hours, but it's more like 15. I did click through most conversations since I finished reading before they were done talking.\n+ Needed a hint only 3 times, and only one of those times was actually justified. This was mainly due to the ability to display all important locations on the screen, so I didn't need to go pixel hunting.\n\nThe Bad- Sometimes the game freezes and you may lose some progress, but not too much since autosaves are frequent.\n- There are some audio bugs that don't really affect gameplay since everything said is also written, but still annoying.\n- Most NPCs were characters that came back from the first game. There are some interesting new characters like the gnome bounty hunter, but they don't get enough story.\n- Too many story threads are left open at the end, with many things that are hinted at but not shown in this game.\n- No replayability value. I won't play the entire game again just to get the few achievements that I missed","June 28, 2015","true","20.6"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","28","28","0","0"

I'm 2 chapters in (out of five) and Steam tells me that took about 7 hours. That's with not necessarily finishing every optional side-puzzle chain and skipping lots of the audio dialogue (the voices aren't bad at all, I just read faster and prefer to move along in games this text-heavy).\n\nI'd perhaps recommend playing the original first to get to know the characters and be able to follow what continuity there is. I can't say what it's like to fresh eyes, as I played and loved the last game ages ago, hence backing the Kickstarter for this immediately.","February 19, 2015","true","18.1"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","0"

With a very few exceptions this game's puzzles are more in line with the first Book of Unwritten Tales.\n\nGraphically the game looks better as well, even the backgrounds were improved which I'd thought was almost impossible, but they're just so beautiful and all the details are crisp and the compressed screenshots really don't do it justice. I think that as far as backgrounds go, these are the best I've ever seen, and could only be dethroned by a different art style that I'd prefer to the rather stereotypical fantasy setting of this game.\n\nAll the protagonists of the first game are back, and it seems I was not the only one who favoured Wilbur, as he gets by far the most playtime in the sequel. Speaking of playtime, the sequel is also quite longer than the first game - it took me 16 hours in-game to finish it.\n\nThere were a few times I had to look up a solution, and in two cases I feel justified - the parrot, and launching the Constructor which as far as I can tell was just a trial and error venture that I chose to spare myself of.\n\nSadly there are also some glitches - sometimes voices are either not playing or playing seemingly in a far distance, I managed to get into one situation where I had to load an autosave because the game got stuck waiting for something that didn't come. (Don't try to show Lizzy the broken PKE meter.)\nLip-sync seemed a tiny bit off.\n\nAll in all, a worthy sequel to the great first game.\nSloth academy rating: 3 golden sloths.","November 29, 2015","true","20.4"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/279940/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","The greatest old-school adventure game of all times?\n\nClose, but that is still actually a pretty legitimate statement for The Book of Unwritten Tales 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the tremendous The Book of Unwritten Tales 1, a point-and-click adventure game set in a fantasy world. What is even more surprising is the fact that certain parts of the game alone put so many classics and modern games of its genre to shame. It is hard to believe that after so many years such a gem can still be created. A gem with some flaws though.\n\nFirstly, the Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is without any doubt the best looking point-and-click adventure game to date. An improvement from the original’s already colourful aesthetic, it can be clearly seen that KING Art pushed the visual fidelity with this game. The way the 3D camera and objects orientate around the characters gives such a pleasant ocular effect to the environments. The backgrounds are mesmerising and better than ever, packed with so many tiny details. The character models are also superior than in the original game; Ivo and Nate, two of the protagonists of the series, have received excellent character redesigns which feel both mature and a bit less cartoony (in a good way). And of course, let’s not forget Wilbur's (the main protagonist) new mage outfit which I personally dig. Visually, KING Art just outdone themselves, but that is not to say that they cannot go even further than this. Additionally, the soundtrack has the right vibe for a fantasy setting, especially with its memorable theme tune. The English voice acting is once again strong, but if there is one criticism about it is the fact that during certain situations some of the spoken dialogues lack urgency -- like if you are falling to your death and you do not feel like screaming out your dialogues.\n\nThe humour is back, and it would not be The Book of Unwritten Tales without mocking and making funny references to tropes, movies, TV shows and video games. Once again, there are plenty of moments of laughter to be had. When it comes to parodying pop-culture and paying homage to the classics, this franchise does it best. It is truly the spiritual successor of Monkey Island when it comes to comedy.\n\nThe puzzles in the game have the right balance between easy and hard, but for comparison, the difficulty got bumped up a notch compared to the original game. As a result for those who thought it was a bit too easy in the first game, then the good news is that in this sequel they are a bit more challenging, especially in some areas. While the brilliant character-switch mechanic is back, it does sadly feel underused here. Personally, I really wish there were more puzzles involving all the characters working together than the game has to offer. There are few puzzles which require some backtracking that may ultimately cause some pacing issues with the story around the middle. Nonetheless, it is good to see that at least all the puzzles are logical and, more importantly, fun to solve.\n\nUnlike the original game’s story which was more or less The Lord of the Rings in a nutshell with its own distinct flair, this time around it is a lot less on that epic scale of good versus evil. And no more encounters with (new) dragons, orcs, goblins and taurens (spotted the WoW reference yet?). In a way it feels more intimate, especially with Ivo and Nate’s relationship, with more time dedicated to character development instead. Of course, the whole "a new evil force is slowly growing in the world of Aventasia in secrecy and our heroes have to prevent it before it is too late" is still present. As a whole, the story is solid and on par with the original, with enough plot twists to keep you engaged for what is a very lengthy adventure game. On the other hand, it could have been enhanced by introducing a lot more new interesting characters since the game seems to oddly do the complete opposite by bringing almost the entire cast from the original game – which is great to see all the old faces - but it does not have the same spark the second time around. Though, that is not to say that the new few characters are not appealing; for instance, the owner of the adventure shop is actually a pretty cool character. But then you have characters like Miss Kiki who just feel a bit out of place and Bennie, the genie, who feels like such a missed opportunity and only gets about five minutes of screen time. If there is an area where The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 kind of falls flat on its face is in the heavy reliance on the old supporting cast (including revelation of the main antagonist) to drive what is a solid fantasy plot -- almost as if the game wanted to play it safe, take no risks. So in that regard the first game still has better, more memorable moments than in this sequel only because of its novelty. Evidently, there are a handful of moments which are also brilliant in this sequel too.\n\nHowever, the developers have done it once again with yet another rushed cliffhanger at the end which left more questions unanswered while making you scratch your head until you cut your scalp. It is hard to comprehend how they could replicate the same annoyance found in the original’s ending in here as well. The ending is clearly left opened for another sequel, but the last five minutes feel very rushed. It is almost impossible not to feel like the ending ruined some of the experience, which it did for me to an extent. "Wait what?", "But how?', "Urghmm" and "That was it?" will be the common phrases running through your mind when the credits start to roll.\n\nIn conclusion, The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is the best point-and-click adventure game that there is in this day and age, even with its few issues. While it does not reinvent the wheel and is not perfect the way I maybe wanted it to be prior purchase, it did enough to proudly earn its place amongst the greats such as Monkey Island, Longest Journey, King’s Quest and many others in my book. I cannot think of a better and more fun game of this genre from the past decade than this, with the exception of maybe the original game. Great characters, interesting plot, best visuals for this kind of game, hilarious conversations and the list goes on. You cannot go wrong with this game if you are a fan of old-school adeventure games. Whoever makes such games nowadays must learn and take notes from this series, except on how to make endings. I only wish the ending was more cohesive and not so rushed. That is something which this series still needs work, pronto.\n\nBring on The Book of Unwritten Tales 3.","March 10, 2015","true","28.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

All four main characters are back, albeit in different costumes, there are multiple throwbacks to the previous games and every location has pop-culture references for you to find.  Needless to say, this installment as well is very aware of itself as a video game.\n\nYou will however, notice some changes. The User Interface has changed slightly, to where your inventory is displayed as a backpack with all your items being smaller icons. Not unlike the UI from the Ultima games.\n\nThe game remains a point ‘n click adventure game, which means the pace is slow and focuses on story and characters rather than combatting enemies. This means you’ll have to endure a very dialogue heavy game. But thanks to the expert writing and humor throughout, backed up by the returning voice-actors who once again do an excellent job, you’ll never truly grow bored with it.\n\nThe puzzles you’ll have to solve don’t feel too easy, but aren’t too hard either. Never do they feel illogical (as far as mixing magic potions go) and for those who might need a little more help the game will provide plenty of clues.\n\nA normal player will get about twenty hours of gameplay out of this game once all five parts are released, which makes the asking price of €29,99 an investment. But I have faith it will be worth it by the end.","September 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

I also used this game in my bachelor thesis some years later. Then I noticed how many different kind of puzzles there are.\nAnd now, it is back .... yes ... and we can play it in Early Access on Steam. It is great to be back in the world of Wilbur, Ivo, and Nate. It is again a beautiful mystical and wonderful world with lots of beautiful places. After a short lovely intro and a nice tutorial, we start with Ivo and we have to solve some problems again. The details of the world are beautiful and made with love. The game does not become boring. I am always curious about the next puzzles to solve. After Ivo, we have to help Wilbur to solve some problems, too. He has become a teacher and has to teach magic, without knowing something about it. But yes, it is Wilbur and with our help he will find a solution. But first he has to solve some mystic questions about the old magic school building. And of course this is BoUT World, Wilburs friend cannot help him, because he is busy playing a role play game of the real world.\nThanks to the Early Access players are able to give constructive feedback to make the game super awesome. The developers listen carefully, ask lots of questions and are eager to put the feedback into the game. They already increased the accessibility of the game. It has a window mode, better quality of the subtitles and a menu icon.

This point and click has my favourite puzzle design because they are not too hard to figure out, but also not too easy. The characters are unique, interesting and lively, and the graphics are gorgeous without putting too much strain on a computer (as a laptop gamer, I especially appreciate this as there is nothing sadder to me than a game I really want to play with specs that my computer can just about manage with lags). As in the first game, Wilbur is an absolute treasure, Ivo is as great a female character as ever and Critter is quirky, sweet and loyal. Nate has grown more likable in this game as well as gained a fair amount of depth and development.\n\nPersonally I enjoyed the return of NPCs from the previous title as I like callbacks and appearences from earlier games in a series, and they are just as fun to talk to and interact with as they were in the first game. The voice acting is absolutely brilliant with a range of accents and voices which are organic and smooth.\n\nI also have fun with the function of switching between characters and swapping items between them, as well as the little conversations they share. I love the addition of sidequests in which you can gain costumes which look great on the characters, and so feel like a nice reward. The ost is also extremely good with a few pieces sticking with me after I take a break from the game.\n\nThe expansion on and creation of areas such as the Elfburrow is also interesting to see, giving a nice variation on areas and allowing more characters or interactions to be introduced and viewed. The length of the game is a healthy one and helps make it worth every penny, especially when it's on sale.\n\nI had to look up for help a few times, but I still think that the difficulty is perfectly balanced, allowing me to feel accomplished as I beat most of the game myself. The game has also bugged out a couple of times, but not to an extent where it's too frustrating. The autosave feature makes it possible to not have to go back as far as you would think. The game engine used for this sequel seems to be a little more buggy than the previous games, but as I said it's nothing too bad. I have researched others' experiences with the game and a lot of the issues seem to be fixed. Sometimes the voices do not play, or have a strange quiet echo to them, but most of the time you can just have the character repeat the line and hear it properly.\n\nI've heard complaints about the ending, but honestly I see no problems with it. It does what it's supposed to - set up for the next game in the series.

There are many references based on popular games (eg. WoW), tv shows (eg Scrubs) or books (eg. The Neverending Story, Song of Fire and Ice) which will make you smile and in my case bring forth some genuine laughter. You'll experience a story in which the three (four) main characters (Ivo an elvish princess, Nate a Captain of a skypirateship and his companion "Critter" (think of Han Solo and Chewie) and lastly Wilbur a gnome wizard) get back together to fight a pink menace that threatens the world of Aventasien. It will take you about 20 hours to finish the game which is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nIf you like this genre then you should really get this game now and don't wait for a sale because if a game of such quality (especially in its genre) doesn't sell well then there might be no point in making any in the future. So please get it if you think that this might be something for you. I'm quite sure that you won't be disappointed.\n\nI would strongly recommend playing the first instalment of the series not because it is absolutely needed but because it adds to the experience of this game and it is another great adventure.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI backed this game through kickstarter because I believed in KingArt and their ability to make a great adventure game. My trust in them wasn't misplaced. BoUT2 is an outstanding adventure game of which I enjoyed every second. I had to laugh so many times during my playtime that I'm already hoping for a sequel.\n\n\n----Story----\nI don’t want to spoil too much of the story but it should suffice to say that you’ll be able to play as the gnome Wilbur who just became a teacher at a wizard school, as the elven princess Ivo who is inflicted with some kind of „disease“ and is currently staying at the elven castle, as captain Nate who still has issues with headhunters and their employer and as the Critter who is the loyal companion of Nate. All three of them get dragged into a political struggle for power and something which transforms the world of Aventasien into a pink and cute version of it.\n\n----Puzzles----\nThe puzzles are designed pretty well and if you are an experienced adventure gamer you shouldn’t have any problems with them. Every puzzle has a logical solution and there are no “WTF” moments like the monkey wrench puzzle in “Monkey Island”. What should be mentioned is that there are optional puzzles which you don’t need to solve to progress in the story. Instead you’ll get a cosmetic Item which your characters can wear e.g. a fishing hat. There is one really great optional puzzle in the wizard school which pays homage to the evolution of adventure games.\n\n----Graphics and Sound----\nThe graphics are top notch and I’m not sure you’ll find better graphics in a point and click adventure. It is not uncommon that Items with which the player can interact stand out from the scene. That isn’t the case in this game. Every usable item looks like it’s a part of the background.\n\nThe voice over is great in the german version of the game. All of the old characters have their voices from the original and each voice actor breathes life into the characters. It’s hard for me to judge the quality of the English voice over (because I’m not a native speaker) but I started a second playthrough in English and I’m quite happy with them as well. So in my book they are pretty good as well. The soundtrack is well made and this time most of it is done with a real orchestra.\n\n----Conclusion----\nBoUT2 is great adventure which is quite big (~20 hours) and thus is something which is rare nowadays. If you like adventure games in the spirit of “Monkey Island” you need to get BoUT2 (and 1 if haven’t played it). The people at KingArt, who developed this game, poured their heart and soul into it and the game shows it. The lovely crafted scenes in the background, the witty and funny dialogues and the many references to pop culture already earned a sweet spot in my geeky heart.","February 20, 2015","true","33.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

If you have played either Book of Unwritten Tales or Critter Chronicles, you know what to expect: the graphics are stunning, the pop references are everywhere, the puzzles are hard enough to make you think twice but probably not much more (although I'll admit the cleaning the hall task had me stumped for a bit as the clue was a little too foggy for this old mind). Poking fun at everyone and everything (including themselves), The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 promises to be a whole lot of fun. I actually was laughing so loud I get yelled at while completing the library task; as this is an early release, I won't say more but if you are an old time player like who remembers computers without monitors, you will get a giggle out of that task. To be fair to you, I did conribute to the game during it's Kickstarter and my mug will appear at some point in the game (or wait a minute, that troll did look familiar) so keep that in mind as I have a horse in this race. That said, I love what I'm seeing and I'm sure glad I got a crack at Chapter 1. I for one, can't wait for Chapter 2 in October!\n\nUpdate for November 18: I finished Chapter 3 last night and I can say the game is holding up to the promises of Chapter 1. The gameplay is continuing to be fairly straight forward although a couple of the puzzles you just have to bull through as there is no real logic to them.  One thing to add to this ongoing review is that King Art has done a very good job about making you care about the characters. This is, I think, one of the best things about their games is that they give some depth of character and motivation to the heroes. I don't want to give away spoilers for folks who are waiting until the game's release in January, but Wilbur does go through a crisis of confidence and the way the game brings the situation on and resolves it is so much better than so many other games. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to Chapter 4 in December.\n\nUpdate for December 22: Finished Chapter 4 last night and if possible, I think I like it more than Chapter 3! The game continues to hit almost all the right buttons. The graphics are lovely (although there are a few technical glitches with the beta, especially in the pyramid), the gags and pop culture references are non stop and we continue to be introduced to crazy new characters. This last point is an important part of this series; the writers do a nice job of mixing up the old characters with the new and taking time to give some depth to the minor characters so they aren't just foils for the main characters.\n\nDo I like the game being released in episodes? The answer is a reserved yes. Each chapter has ended on a cliff hanger with a few old crisis resolved but new ones fbeing formed. King Arts certainly took a cue from the old serial films and radio broadcasts. One can almost hear at the end of each chapter: "Tune in next week, same bat-channel, same bat-time" (for you young ones, try Google). While it is a device that moves the game along and clearly sets up the goals for the characters, it does sort of feel like I've played four mini-games instead of one big one. I may change that attitude when I replay the whole game but I thought I'd toss that in here.\n\nFinal update after finishing the game and Chapter 5.  Just a short note to say the final chapter was a lot of fun. Wilbur never dissapoints and this short chapter continues the tone of the first 4 chapters. Do be warned, the ending is not wholly satisfying in that several major threads are left unresolved. King Arts is clearly setting up another game or two with BouT2. The ending presented is bittersweet but hopeful and brought me back to the first chapter where Ivo's father tells her in the end "everything will be alright". Ivo asks him what if things aren't alright to which he replies "then it isn't the end yet". Suffice it to say, the game doesn't finish at the end!","September 29, 2014","true","39.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Not a big deal, but clunky.)\n\nA few glitches, but that's to be expected from Early Access, and nothing gamebreaking that I stumbled across.\n\nI've loved point-and-click adventure games since I was a kid, especially those that don't force arcade elements upon you.  I've had less and less time to play since then, however, and have started many games with high hopes but ended up getting distracted and/or losing interest halfway through.\n\nWas very pleasantly surprised by the first BOUT - played it all the way through and yearned for more. Thought Critter Chronicles suffered a bit in comparison, possibly because I feel like his humor's a little one-note compared to the variety of color that the multiple protagonists in BOUT brought to the story. (Sorry, Critter!)\n\nSo far, BOUT 2 looks like it's a worthy successor to the first game, and I can't wait to play through the first three chapters and see what's yet to come.\n\n(Also, OT, but I loved, loved, loved the first chapter of the King Art game 'Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief' as well; such a surprising treasure for any fan of Agatha Christie. It's a pity that the following two chapters couldn't live up to it, but I hope the devs decide to try something else with that same 'cozy' mystery atmosphere in the future!)","November 9, 2014","true","25.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

I smiled more than one time. It started already with the intro/tutorial which has been a nice reference to a well known fantasy series and that was just the beginning - the game is full of references to modern fantasy games, movies and books. I´m sure I missed some by the first playtrough.\n\nThe VISUALS are the best ones, I´ve seen so far and I´ve played a lot of adventure games in the past. Full of details, you can discover something in nearly every corner.\n\nThe MUSIC recordings with the live orchestra will happen this month in prague. I guess this soundtrack will bring the game to a whole new level and improve the overall atmosphere of the game. It would´ve been great if the last kickstarter goal with full orchestra recordings had been reached, but unfortunately some pledges were missing for this milestone.\n\nThe CHARACTERS are lovely drawn and animated and perfect dubbed by famous voice-over artists (I played the german version).\n\nI have to confess, that the DIALOGUES in the first chapter are long, therefor the pacing is a little bit slow, but the developer, king art, has talked about it yet and they said, that the pacing in the upcoming chapter will be better and that they are thinking about improving it in the first chapter. I miss some more close-up scenes or cuts to the characters while they are speaking - but that´s "complaining on a high comfort level" and there must be a goal to reach for the possible third  BouT part ;-)\n\nThe PLAYTIME is huge: I played the first Chapter nearly 5 hours. If the following four chapters are as long as the first one, there will be at least 25 hours of pure adventure fun - that´s a big adventure game!\n\nIt was the right decision to support the game and the developer with the help of kickstarter to improve there vision of a wonderful adventure game in these days. I can´t wait to play the second chapter. Guess we can look forward to an amazing second part of the series! You should get it now, if you´re not already a kickstarter backer - it´s worth the price, won´t get cheaper until the "official release" early next year and you can play it right now with all the continual  regular updates.","September 6, 2014","true","44.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","3"

The other day we purchased the The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 and played for about 2 hours.  Hard to believe they could actually make an even better game at this point in the series.  Its technically more refined, in terms of gaphics and sound, smoothness, etc, and the writing and dialogue are even more polished.  Yet everything that made the other games so great is still there.  Seriously, its excellent - I highly, highly recommend The Book of Unwritten Tales 2  if you like this type of game at all. If you liked the first two, you probably aren't even going to bother reading this because you'll have already bought the game.","December 29, 2014","true","31.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I don't normally write reviews for games but that is not because i don't feel the games aren't good enough, its just that i didn't feel the urge to express my complete love and awe for them as i do for this MASTERPIECE  of a game!! You guys have created a pure gem of a game (and series) and i simply can't get enough of it. I just love everything about this game. Its perfect in every single way. You guys have taken the point and click genre to a whole new level. You have taken the traditional gameplay formula and unravelled it and have polished it up with the most up to date references of other games, movies, books,etc and such a perfect sense of humour from juicy biting satire to the most ridiculous hilarious jokes and anecdotes etc.. I constantly have to go back and save moments in game to shoe my family as the comedy is priceless and so hard to replicate and produce in this era. Seriously guys you know what you are doing and I just pray and hope that the Book of Unwritten Tales series continues. Please don't stop what you are doing, you guys are perfect and keep this genre alive and kicking!!!! I LOVED THIS GAME and recommend any adventure lover with a sense of humour to try it out!!!!

What a great cliffhanger at the end of Part 2. Stories just keep getting better and better over the years. The characters and stories are so enjoyable, you forget you've been playing over 8 hours. Can't wait for the continuing adventures of my favorite gnome - Wilber Weathervane. Here’s a review of Part 1 I wrote on Amazon back in 2012. If you want to feel like you're on a quest as Frodo Baggins was in Lord of the Rings, or be reminded of Yoda from Star Wars when a little gremlin appears in the palm of your hand, or just enjoy being in a magical world like Harry Potter, you will look forward to sitting down and opening The Book of Unwritten Tales. You will be going on an adventure with four characters but I like Wilbur Weathervane. I'm routing for you little guy, by the way he's a gnome. The controls are very easy to learn - just point and click. Press the spacebar if you get befuddled but use it sparingly. The creative author weaved a unique tale of good vs. evil. With a swish and flick of their paint brush, the imaginative graphic artists will whisk you off to an enchanted world. The voice actors with their wee bit of a Scottish accent have the best voices to tell a story, and hearing the sounds of birds singing, bees buzzing, potions exploding, wind blowing while you're atop a dragon, helps to immerse you into the story. I wish I could smell the flowers. Someday we might have a button on our game consoles for smell. Now what would it be called? I know! How about the Sensatizer or Sensometer or the NoseKnows? I leave that to your imagination. Soooooo, if you're looking for a virtual book to read and one that you will wish the story never ends, look no further than The Book of Unwritten Tales.","December 15, 2014","true","60.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It was way longer, and the characters were developed even more. It ends on a cliffhanger ending though, so watch out! The artwork is great, however it can be a little choppy occassionally (may be my computer). There are also a few glitches so make sure to save often. For those of you who like challenging puzzle games, this is the game for you! I found myself wanting to use a walkthrough all the time, but tried not to unless a particular puzzle took more than an hour. I felt like the story itself was really good up until the end, where it seemed rushed, and left us with an incomplete story. I do hope they come out with a sequel soon!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/279940/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","Original Book of Unwritten tales was a complete surprise - it was released at the time when it seemed that comedic adventure games were truly gone there was that game, looking good, voice acted good, with a restrained amount of pop references and very strong self identity and pretty good gameplay. Critter Chronicles, while not as good and clearly started as more of a short expansion made bigger for a full standalone release with pointless filler, was still a great game and I've had a lot of fun with it. The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 manages to be both much better and kinda worse than the first two at the same time.\n\nIt still looks fantastic - even better now, voice acting is still great and a lot of humour and dialogue is still good. The sense of adventure is here, for the most part, and gameplay-wise around 70% of the game are very nicely done. However, closer to the middle the amount of "and now you have to do this" piling up on top of previously solved puzzles/issues in the absolutely same almost unchaged location in each of 5 Chapters started to get annoying. Chapter 3 introduced a lot of pointless back and forth and Chapter 4 was all about that - running around completely different locations, finding items in one place to solve puzzles in other places. And it was just a bit... too much. I'll give KING art they're due - they did try to make every new task more or less fresh and events rarely stalled for too long. But moments of "can we move on now?" happened more often than I would've liked and ending parts of the game were quite dissapointing.\n\nAnd the weakest part of this, by the end, was the storytelling. The game started very strong, but starting from the middle it just went "whatever", despite introducing actually cool characters or moments from time to time. And ended in a very disappointing sequel setup, which made the entire game feel less of a TBoUT 2 and more like TBoUT 2. Part 1, where both previous games felt self-contained stories that can live without sequels. And pop culture humor is crossing the limits way more this time around. In the first games there were actual attempts at world building. Here the identity gets easily lost among all the "this is this game, this is this movie, this is this book" things that happen all the time - the entire closing chapter is one huge Halloween-themed reference party. And it doesn't help that despite having 3 characters again it rarely feels like a proper 3-character story, like the first game did.\n\nBut I'm disappointed just because how much better many things were, just how much potential there was and still is and just how much I actually liked playing most of the game. Not all. Constructor "puzzle" needs to die in a fire. Ahem. But yeah - it's still a good game, just... better served for those who already invested themselves in the series with the first game, but not as good of a sequel or a standalone game as it clearly had every chance to be.","January 19","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I don't really like repeated blatant ripoffs of other series. The copying of ideas from Harry Potter like the Fireplace Network (Floo Network), Broomball (Quidditch) and other things makes the game seem like I should be playing Harry Potter instead of The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.\n\nOverall, it's still a fun and imaginative game, albeit with reduced original ideas.\n\nPROS\n1. Game is fun\nI love the puzzles and surprises. E.g. Ivo is pregnant?\n\n2. Extended Game\nIt's much longer than the first. You have to solve multiple puzzles in one map.\n\n3. Tougher Puzzles\nMuch more difficult to solve this time compared to The Book of Unwritten Tales 1\n\nCONS\n1. Too much copying\nJust too much with the Harry Potter stuff.\n\n2.

The inventory bag tended to block the object you were trying to interact with.\n\nNEUTRAL\n1.

If you like traditional funny adventure games then you will really like The Book of Unwritten Tales 2. It is well written, looks great and really makes you care about the characters.\n\nThe Book Of Unwritten Spells 2 is set in the land of Aventasia and you control four main characters; Wilbur Weathervane a gnome mage, Princess Evo an elf, Nate a human, and Critter A kind of purple Muppet like creature. You take control of each of these characters at different points in the game in events following the first game.\n\nAn epidemic has struck the land and throughout the course of the game all of the main characters are brought together. The storyline is solid if a little predictable but like some of the best animated films predictability does not mean that story isn’t fun and engaging.\n\nGenerally puzzles are pretty sensible. There are a few ones that do not make a lot of sense but overall I generally progressed at a reasonable pace.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I had with the game was there are a few instances where you have to click on and item a few times and scroll through several seemingly fob off statements before finally interacting as you expect or hope.  There were a couple of instances where I did get stuck and had to rub everything in my inventory against everything in the world but this did not happen often. You are helped however with the spacebar as a press reveals everything in the environment you can interact with.\n\nA couple of times when going into a zoomed part of a scene my character would get stuck and be unable to interact, talk or leave the scene basically meaning I had to restart. In one case even reloading my save file did not fix this as it had auto saved itself after the bug…. While this was not game breaking and I am sure this is something that could be sorted out afterwards it did mean I lost about 2 hours of gameplay at one point and I could imagine myself giving up in anger if that had happened more than once.\n\nMy advice manually save regularly.\n\nOverall however The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 is possibly the best Adventure Title I have played in the last 20 years and easily sits alongside Monkey Island and Simon the Sorcerer. While not perfect I cannot recommend this game highly enough and I cannot wait for the hopefully inevitable Book of Unwritten Tales 3.\n\nFor My Video Review of the game visit the link below\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150307_game-tutor-grades-book-unwritten-tales-2\n","March 7, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So far I feel it has improved on every aspect of the original; the artwork, animations and soundtrack is great, and the voice acting is superb.\n\nFor those interested, in contrast to the first game, TBoUT2 works also flawlessly on Linux in my experience.\n\nThere is only one thing that I can think of that I wish they would improve. Sometimes the dialogue text is right on top of the characters speaking, which looks a bit weird. It would be a lot better if it were below or above the characters. This is ridiculously minor, however.\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.","December 24, 2014","true","31.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After a slight disappointment of the Critter Chronicles (which was funny, of course, but lasted about five hours for me to play through), and The Raven (which was clever enough surely, but nowhere as good as the BoUT), this one caught me in a big surprise: 20 hours of flowing playtime without getting stuck (which is A LOT for a point-and-click, in comparison it took me 5 hours to beat Broken Sword 2) and the writing is just as good as what we remember from the first one.\n\nPuzzles are easier than in the previous games, but still just as fun as they were in those ones.\n\n10/10.

Also in Ubuntu Linux 14.04 there are a few major bugs when playing with the Steam controller that appear randomly. Those bugs sometimes make it impossible to move along with the storyline and I had to load a savegame from before the bugs occured (even loading a save game after the bugs appeared for the first time did not fix it). The bugs I encountered are that all possible actions disappear (e.g. when activating the machine for the zombies), pushing a button on the Steam controller is recognized as two button pushes and during the showdown with Munkus at the end all actions disappear as if there was an animation where Munkus turns the middle part of the machine but the animation just does not start. Those navigation and animation issues appear very often throughout the game and are very annoying. Still I would recommend the game, just save often and use different slots so you can go back if you need to.","December 31, 2015","true","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What I like in my clickers is that I can complete them in a sitting and this easily was three times longer than that. It's way longer than a person can bear. I also like adventure games that have, well, adventure, that go places and have you experience interesting things. The majority of the game however you spend in the same three locations, the same locations that you start the game in, so you never really go anywhere! I understand that this is a kickstarter game and it just comes off as taking advantage that they make the same so long but without many locations and also reuse many characters from the previous game. It did not feel like I was experiencing anything new and of value in the series.","October 15, 2015","false","27.3"," 5 of 26 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","5","26","0","0"

The game imbues every frame with pure joy for devotees and non-devotees alike; from sharp satirical humour poking fun at petitions, to incredibly silly slapstick involving Nate and the over-consumption of alcohol. It's also a bit more brash than it's predecessor, with some toilet humor and even a touch of sweariness, but fortunately- at least, thus far- it's kept to a minimum. But really, what we have thus far is everything that made the first game so charming: Great humour, lovely graphics, and lots of clever puzzles. Oh, and lots and lots of Wilbur! :)\n\nApart from the bugs, which have been dealt with thus far pretty well by KA up to this point, this has been the most pure fun I've had playing an adventure game since...well, the first one!

It's FUN and FUNNY. I love it! And completely reccomend it.","January 24, 2015","true","66.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are stunning, the voice acting is great and the soundtrack is nice to listen to. Thankfully, the puzzles are slightly more challenging than in the first game, but still never frustrating. The story features all of the well known characters from the first two games and is again filled with puns and references to other games/books and films we all love.\n\nThe only downsides I can think of are:\n- The new inventory is a step backwards. The old one where you just had to move the cursor to the bottom of the screen was way easier to use.\n- A few bugs with the speech audio files (especially in the German version, some parts are not voiced or the volume is completely off)\n- The movement of the characters sometimes feels too slow and it can be annoying when they are stuck in animations that force you to wait.\n\nWhat I miss:\n- Having chapters or acts with rendered movies in between them would be great because it feels so rewarding when you hit those points in the game.\n\nFor fans of the classic point&click adventure genre this is an absolute must have, but I would recommend this to anyone really, since it is such a fantastic game and probably the only game of the genre that has the look and feel of a AAA production. Finally, the game is also good value because even as a veteran adventure player, resorting to a walkthrough guide a couple of times and not always waiting for audio to play out, the first playthrough took a full 24 hours.\n\nPS: Do not play it with a controller, you will regret it.","May 16, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game imbues every frame with pure joy for devotees and non-devotees alike; from sharp satirical humour poking fun at petitions, to incredibly silly slapstick involving Nate and the over-consumption of alcohol. It's also a bit more brash than it's predecessor, with some toilet humor and even a touch of sweariness, but fortunately- at least, thus far- it's kept to a minimum. But really, what we have thus far is everything that made the first game so charming: Great humour, lovely graphics, and lots of clever puzzles. Oh, and lots and lots of Wilbur! :)\n\nApart from the bugs, which have been dealt with thus far pretty well by KA up to this point, this has been the most pure fun I've had playing an adventure game since...well, the first one!

It looks good, the soundtrack is wonderful, the puzzles are nicely done (btw. I wrote a walthrough while playing – which is why the number of hours I spent with BoUT2 seems higher than usual) and the characters charming. Plus there are many hilarious references (to series, other games, movies...). It is a game that feels right from the first moment on.\n\nHowever one thing bugged me and that is the ending: From my point of view the narrative structure of BoUT2 fails when trying to build up to a dramatic showdown. It feels a bit like movie where the third and last act is told in five minutes. Also at the end the whole situation didn't seem much than before.\n\nBut as much as that annoyed me, it was hard to stay ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at an adventure game that does so much right. Especially if you already enjoyed the first one not much can go wrong with this sequel. Then again if you didn't like the first one, it might be wise to stay away. The humor is quite similar (though the sequel works better for me and it really didn't feel like seeing more of the same to me) and this time there are no - from my point of view - annoying puzzles like the rain dance or the thing with the potion here.

Assuming you play legitimately without a walkthrough, the game should last you a long time figuring things out by comparasin to other click adventures, and you'll easily obtain any achievements you missed along the way by loading your previous saves (completionists tip: don't skip the credits at the end, the achievement for watching the credits doesn't count when watching from the menu). The puzzles present a good bit of challenge and you'll end up wracking your brain at times. luckily the hardest ones are optional, but those ones are worth it to pick up the extra outfits. However, it is very pricy for what it is and the extra price for the almanac edition doesn't really warrant getting that upgrade either.

Unlike a lot of fantasy adventure games, which try to make you invested in them because of epic storylines while having brain-breakingly evil puzzles, these puzzles are fun but still challenging, taking some ingenuity but not a lot of trips to a walkthrough. There are your traditional "combine every item in your inventory to every other item in your invetory" puzzzles, but there are a lot more interesting onces, too, involving math, dance, and the optional gambling dice game.

This is one of my favorite games now. And I absolutely love everything about it. It's whacky, and has way too many good jokes and references. It's witty, and more beautiful graphicly than the last game. I just can't not reccomend it enough! I would play Number 1 first though. It really helps to know the characters. :D","February 9","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is like reading an interactive novel aka Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings.\nPlayed the original 'The Book of Unwritten Tales' - overall presentation level is keeping up and do not disappoint like some other boring pixel hunting click adventure games.\n-Beautiful and engaging story\n- Remarkable and charismatic characters, like in a novel book\n- Lots of humour and pop culture references (more in this game comparing to the first one!)\n- Lovely detailed environments and atmospheric settings\n- Solving puzzles is done very creatively, so you would feel ashamed if you read or watch though the walkthrough. You actually motivated to merge onto this fantasy world, trying to understand its rules and logic.\n\nWell the game's name speaks itself the main point - reading/playing the Tales of adventures. This is what could be called as the art of interactive story telling in video game industry.\n","December 20, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had points were I had to pause for a loud laugh, and the puzzles were mostly solvable.\n\nThe setting is a parody of fantasy RPGs and MMORPGs, and the fourth wall is not only kicked out but exploded and its place was sowed with salt; basically, the entire game is a giant homage to these kinds of stories and games. The story is itself generic, but told with great style; similar to other point-and-click adventures the style is the important aspect...\n\nI had two issues with the game:\n1. There were some sections that felt padded out. Maybe a bit less would have been more.\n2. I had some strange graphical glitches; after an hour or two of play, first the colors and then everything was rendered incorrectly. At such points, the only way to go was to save my progress and restart the game (luckily, saving always worked, so I have not lost progress because of this issues).","December 13, 2015","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You pretty much have to play with subtitles or you'll miss a LOT of the dialogue.\n\nConclusion:\nDefinitely worth playing if you're at all into adventure games (or even funny games in general).

I was constantly rolling laughing with the first one, but in this one the humor felt more forced, so I was less engaged. I got stuck more often in this one as well.

Nonetheless, if you liked the original, this game is worth the money to continue the tale.
