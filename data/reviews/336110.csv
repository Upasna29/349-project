You are the last survivor and must beat in 4 chapters on 24 different maps each 3 waves. After you got dropped by a helicopter hundreds of zombies spawn around you. Shoot your way through them and kite them all down. 7 different weapons unlock during the story progress. Shotguns and the magnum are the most useful. You also got grenades and pickup powerups like health packs, ammo or other weapons.\n\nThe most unique feature are the traps you activate over switch platforms that helps perfectly to decimate the hordes. Like running sawblades, firewalls, slasher walls or minefields. But be awared: they can hurt you, too. In some maps also cars and trains run recklessly through zombie waves. Their arrival is shown by blinking arrows. So try to lure the zombies on the tracks / streets.\n\nAnother feature is the rage mode when a certain rage bar is filled you run with circular chainsaw attacks into the enemies and cannot be harmed anymore. It lasts just for 10 secs.\nAlthough the graphics are not the best the gameplay makes quite fun. The game is nicely relaxing and quite easy beatable.","December 9, 2015","true","5.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You're the Survivor, a man with no name, face, address, or phone number. You're the only person alive - aside from whoever pilots the helicopter at the beginning and end of each stage - in a world filled with the walking dead. Your mission? Kill ALL of the zombies. We're talking complete and utter zombie genocide. Of course, this begs the question: What next? Humanity has been wiped out (again), so who's going to re-populate the earth? The Survivor and... and...? I suppose that's just something we'll have to live with. After all, we caused the zombie apocalypse sooooo.\n\nOh right, this is a game review.\n\nEach level is fairly simple. There are three waves, and you...kill all of the zombies. Aside from a selection of guns and a wicked knife, you can also use the environment to your advantage. Everything from exploding barrels to runaway trains will make short work of the undead menace. There is a scoring system that favors large combos as well as envirokills, but you likely won't give it much attention. This is mainly because there aren't any leaderboards. You could work towards an S rank in every stage, but the feeling of accomplishment will be far too fleeting.\n\nNo, the real appeal of this game is the absolute massacre on display. There aren't really any boss-fights or a complicated plot. You can start this game up, shoot through a few thousand zombies, and then go on with your day. It's purely in-offensive entertainment, and does enough right to keep you playing for at least an hour or two. Not once while I was playing this game did I feel like it needed something more, like an upgrade system or even a couple more types of enemies. Besides, who needs all that junk in the game, when you've already got giant spiders? ♥♥♥♥in' spiders man, I hate them.\n\nSo yeah, that's about all I can say regarding Bloody Streets. This game is disposable, and I mean that in a positive way. Some games create memories, some good, others you wish you could bury. Once you've gotten your fill of Bloody Streets, you'll probably forget it ever existed. Sometimes it's a good thing when a decent game can be forgotten. One day out of the blue, you'll smile and wonder why, but in your heart you'll know that it was because on a random day you played a pretty decent videogame, and it was pleasant.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I remember every terrible game. It's like hundreds of chains dragging me into the abyss.","December 23, 2015","true","2.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The graphics are simple but the game is designed so that\nmore complex graphics are not necessary.  While the game has its issues, such as\nkill points cluttering up the screen and  roll mechanic that lacks momentum, it\nalso has some good aspects, such as achievement points and fast paced survival feel.\n\nI was a bit disappointed to find that there were no leaderboards, as the game is set up ideally\nfor competition. The game is fast paced, and I feel it also really would have\nbenefited to have a co-op option.  It doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the game,\nbut I feel it really would have raised it to a higher level.\n\nThe weapons lack any sort of customization, which is unfortunate, because\ninstead of using the weapons you want to use, it comes down to using whichever\nis the most effective, which i cover in much depth in the video.  It doesn't destroy the gameplay, however, as you are still enjoying the high paced tension of the game.  As long as you are killing the enemies, it becomes less of a detriment when combined with the combat and level design.\n\nThe combat is based upon speed, and how fast you complete the 3 rounds\nof each map, with out worrying about some ticking clock.  What keeps this game from feeling repetitive, however, is the variety of zombies.  Exploding zombies, spiders, giant worms, all used in a different way.  This combined with the level design, which is done in such a way\nthat continuously makes you experience them in a different aspects as you progress, are both\nexamples of how this game respects your time.\n\nI can see the potential for this game to be great, but as is, it is\nentertaining and enjoyable.  The detriments do not outweigh its benefits. I\nenjoyed my time in this game, and its an easy recommend for I never felt like my time was being wasted or the game didn't respect my level of effort.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","March 12, 2015","true","2.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

I got a game that enertained me for about 20 min and the next 10 min after that I grew bored and frustrated. The game mechanics is very simple, almost too simple for my taste....\n\nyou start a stage with a single gun you choose (7 guns total, they unlock as you progress) and some gernades. The gun has limited ammo which runs out a bit too quick in my taste (especialy the desert eagle ammo) and when that happens you may resort to knife which is pretty effective IMO. On the stage there are spawn points for items, you can pick up ammo or health or gernades there. Also there are few points with weapons on the map so that you can swich gun if you like to the one that is on the specific map point. You can perform doge to try escape the enemies but the problem is the maps are small and there are not open spaces but more like corridors and the enemies spawn so massively that whenever you jump to dogde you just run into a horde of enemies. There are explosive barrels on the map that you can shoot and they will explode damagin enemies but using them in that total chaos is really difficult and not worth the trouble. There are some specific features on some maps like train tracks where every now and then a train passess running over everything in its path, there are some map traps like flames that either activate on their own or you can walk on a big button to activate them. For each killed enemy you pick up small orange balls that fill up your rage meter, when it is filled about 25% you can activate the rage mode in which you turn into a small tornado like Taz the Tasmanian Devil rotating with hyperspeed and cutting everything you pass through like a living chainsaw. The duration depends on how much you filled the rage meter before activating it.\n\nThere are also new enemies as you progress. First there are zombies which come later on in different variations, there are also small maggots and also spiders that spit some acid or sth...\n\nSo it looks like a great game right? Right?!\n\nBut sadly it is not...\n\nAround 5 or something level, there were kamikaze zombies which exploded when near you or when shoot and since that stage the game is total chaos in which you cannot control the situation even in smallest percent... it is just chaos and desperate shooting doging and gathering rage points to survive a wave. After 20 min of playing you start to feel the boredome and lack of excitement even with the new enemies and new gun... there are no RPG elements to keep you interested in your character. You just unlock guns as you progress and that is all.\n\nI really wanted to like this game and bought it with much enthusiasm to play it. but this is sadly a bitter dissapointment. It dosent excite you, it bores you with the overwhelming chaos and lack randomness like Crimsonland had for example (you never knew what weapon you would get and perks when you level up which made your gameplay somehow different each time you played).\n\nI must complement the graphics, they are hand drawn and very nicely animated, especialy the zombies.\n\nThe game may satisfy score beating maniacs, this is the only group of people I could recommend the game for. The rest should stay away or buy on a very big sale","March 9","false","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/336110/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Bloody Streets is a pretty simple, straightforward shooter; from a top-down perspective, fend off hordes of zombies and other abominations and survive 'til the end of the round. At the start of each of the 24 stages (set across four chapters, each with its own distinct setting) you'll select one of seven unlockable weapons, then battle your way through with the help of pick-ups in the shape of extra health, ammo and grenades as you rack up combo kills and amass points. A rank will be awarded at the end of every stage based on your points, but it doesn't really count for anything special aside from bragging rights, I guess.\n\nOther treats come in the form of environmental hazards, such as trains, mines, cars, crushers, flames, blades and good old-fashioned exploding barrels. And also to aid you is a Rage mode, a super attack that turns you into an invulnerable tornado of spinning, bladed glory for a limited time, activated by collecting orbs from downed enemies. There's a little bit of a story to the game, the action being told through very brief, comic book style panels at the very start and end of the game, but it really amounts to nothing more than zombies are happening, gun-toting bad*ss shoots them all up, the end. But at least the panels look pretty.\n\nThe game in general is nice enough to look at, in fact, being a welcome change of colour and brightness that most zombie themed games will usually stay well away from. Although, overall, as nice as it looks, you can't escape the sense that the whole thing feels like a browser game more than anything else. I bought it for 99 cents, and am perfectly happy with what I got for that, but I could see how some people might see the full asking price as a little much for what it is, though I still think it's set pretty fairly.\n\nLike I said, it's simple and straightforward, nothing too fancy here, but still enjoyable. Although, while I had little issue on my first play through, on subsequent plays the game did crash frequently... very frequently. Like, maybe a dozen or so times in the 4 hours it took to finish (though that's only for completionists. Just to reach the end should take no more than 90 minutes). Though, to it's credit, it did at least have the decency to only ever do it during the menus and loading screen and never during actual gameplay at any point. Whatever the hell that's about.\n\nI've played better, but I've also played a lot worse, and even with a bunch of minor niggles, nothing was too bad to stop me enjoying my time with it. It's a fun, competently put together little number that I'd really like to see expanded upon in future titles, and although not necessarily glowingly, is one that I'd still be able to recommend.","May 7","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At this state though the game is not worth $5, or the price of a large Cafe Mocha, I've enjoyed them for longer than I enjoyed this game.","April 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Wasn't even able to play with my keyboard and it took me about ten minutes of sitting through the mind-numbing intro's just to discover that.","November 7, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

You will listen to the intro at max ♥♥♥♥ing volume because suck my ♥♥♥♥, that's how zombies roll, especially for ♥♥♥♥ing $1.  The animations are banging, and that's about it.  I didn't play it very much, TBH it bored me, the AI is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just follows you in a straight line.  You can easily herd them around a barrel and blow them all up into little down syndrome flakes all over the ground, and speaking of mental handicaps, you have a rage meter.  What rational thought came to mind when you read that?  Your bullets get stronger for awhile when you fill it?  Your character gains super melee abilities or some sort of invulnerability? Nope, upon activation, your character turns into A ♥♥♥♥ING GOD DAMN LAWN MOWER, SPINNING AROUND LIKE AN AUTISTIC CHILD DENIED HIS GOODBOY POINTS FOR CLEANING HIS ROOM.  I'm not sure, but I think someone is ♥♥♥♥ing with me here.  9/10, would play for 6 minutes again.","December 27, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
