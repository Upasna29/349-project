I'll update this if/when I finish the game to update/finalize my thoughts. Here's what I feel right now.\n\nThis game is fantastic. It really captures NES-style fun, platforming and frustration.\n\n- PROS -\n- Great art direction; I really like the look of the backgrounds and characters.\n- Great understanding of contrasting colors. Oftentimes a cool color will be in the background and a warm in the foreground (or vice versa ). Really makes the game pop (so many games get this wrong. It's great to see it done well here).\n- Gameplay is fun and varied. The jump feels great too (not *fantastic*, but very good).\n- Wide variety of weapons and items to keep gameplay from becoming bland.\n- Really good music. When I entered a certain area - I had to pause for a second and just listen to it. It sounded *very* familiar (I'll leave it at that). Once I got the reference, it made me grin from ear to ear.\n- Lots of cute, interesting nods to other games (Mega Man, Castlevania, etc.).\n- Interesting, challenging boss battles. I hate boss battles that are *just* long. Here they're challenging and varied - but not too long once you get the pattern down. That's cool.\n\n- CONS -\n- It took me a while to get used to the screen transition. In Super Metroid, The Binding of Issac (or a host of other games  - Shovel Knight, even) when you enter a new screen, the character pauses and slides across the screen as the new area is introduced. It helps to keep everything clear: here is the character; here is a new area. In 'Castle in the Darkness' the new screen just kinda pops into existence. Then it takes me a half-second to find where the character is. I have to admit that I found it rather jarring for the first few screens. I got used to it...and this may not affect everyone - but just thought I'd mention it here.\n- No map system - and the game is HUGE. I may have to break out some graph paper and draw my own...\n- (As far as I know) No 'current objective' slide to look at. So, if you put this game down for a week and come back you would be COMPLETELY lost.\n- 'One-hit kill' spikes abound.\n\n-NOTES-\nIt has to be mentioned (as I'm sure you've read in other reviews) - this game is *hard*. I think I have over 300 deaths already. It's cool, though - having a blast doing it. What's important to note is that this game uses a design philosophy that some players may not like - what I call "playing from save point to save point". It reminded me of a saying I hadn't thought of in years - "It's not real until you save." Beat a boss? Go back and save. Got a new item? Go back and save. Unlocked a secret room that's really cool and you want to explore it? For the love of all that is good GO BACK AND SAVE YOUR GAME. This is not a game where you run carelessly past save points as you vanquish foes with ease. This is a game where you jump for joy at save points, thank them for existing, give them a huge hug and kiss and then step cautiously into the next room. I grew up on games like this, so I understand this design philosophy - but I can see how others could see this as annoying or grindy.\n\nAlso, as I get further into the game, the amount of 'one-hit kills' (i.e. spikes) seems to be increasing exponentially. I hope the endgame is not just jumping through like thirty rooms filled with spikes - and if you slip up and touch ONE of them - you gotta go all the way back to the beginning. I mean, Super Meat Boy has one-hit kills as well - but that game has a super-fast reload time and no level is more than one screen long. That level of difficulty in this metroidvania structure would NOT work well. I hope that doesn't happen. >_<\n\n- OVERALL -\nSo far, I'm really enjoying the game. Great NES-style action and great music. If you love platformers and you're ready for a challenge, I say pick it up (it's less than $5!). If you want something light to beat in a weekend, though...this may not be for you. I, however, am thoroughly enjoying it and look forward to seeing what other craziness the game has to offer (and I've seen some crazy rooms in it already). I hope I'm able to finish it. *fingers crossed*\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- UPDATE -\nTHOUGHTS: 02.08.2015\n\nI just beat the game with 90% completion (this took a little over 18 hours) and wanted to share my final thoughts.\n\n'Castle in the Darkness' is wonderful. It truly is an engaging, challenging gem of a game. It surprised me how new enemies kept showing up right up until the end of the game. I was like, "This game is STILL introducing new enemies?!" Love it.\n\nAll of my thoughts above still apply and I was impressed that right through to the end, it's was an incredible experience. Also, Matt Kap (the developer) is still fixing things and making the game the best that it can be. Much respect for that!\n\nSo, in the end, 'Castle in the Darkness' is VERY much recommended.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to explore a bit more and see if I can get 100% completion. Cheers! :)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- UPDATE -\nTHOUGHTS: 02.17.2015\n\nNow I've beaten the game at 100% completion! Hurray! *does a little happy dance*\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994686280/screenshots/?appid=262960","February 7, 2015","true","27.9"," 136 of 151 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","136","151","10","0"

All… but one!'Intro of Castle in the Darkness\n__________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\n'Castle in the Darkness' is a revival of oldschool action-adventure platformers full of tough bosses and hellish platformer sequences. It takes many ideas from the classics of the different genres (e.g. from the Metroid Games, Castlevania III, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Mega Man…) mixes in some interesting new elements and spices the whole dish up with some RPG elements, tons of secrets and a lot of Easter Eggs. The result is a quite tough cookie of a retro-metroidvania that is probably not the healthiest choice - neither for your controller/keyboard nor for your nerves (sometimes it will make you swear so much that even a pub full of sailors would be impressed).\n__________________________________________\n\nGameplay\nAs the only survivor of the Royal Guard it is your duty to save the Kingdom of Alexandria from attacking monsters (and of course you need to save the princess as well). So you start running and jumping through the levels, armed with a sword, an armor and some magic while looking for treasures and secrets to make your journey easier. Which is quite necessary as the game’s difficulty curve jumps up quite fast and soon you have to face scary platforming sequences and unfriendly creatures. However as spikes kill you instantly (and the architect of the kingdom decided to put them nearly EVERYWHERE) they will probably be your toughest enemies and the stuff your nightmares are made of.\n\nOften it‘s a wise decision to backtrack and look for different ways and areas aside from the main path that you may have missed before. (Luckily there are some Warp points which allow teleportation between several major stages.)\nThe amount of secrets and optional stuff is huge and if you look closely you can find lots of breakable walls, hidden entrances, fake spikes, optional areas and bosses and items to e.g. increase your health. Many of them are quite well hidden but aside from (more or less obvious) breakable blocks there are several hints to less obvious areas, secrets and abilities – keeping your eyes out in the levels is definitly recommended.\n\nBefitting the oldschool-charm of 'Castle in the Darkness‘ the game comes with good oldschool 8-bit graphics and an (amazing!) 8-bit soundtrack that may bring out some nostalgic feels (- well, at least if you are not mad at some particular spikes and areas in the game).\n__________________________________________\n\nContra...?\nIf you plan on finding all the secrets and getting all hidden items and stuff you will need some extra hours after finishing the game and it will bring you straight to some nightmaris jumping sections and plattforming areas where you have to start over and over and over and over… again. (At least it rewards you with a secret ending and a NG+ with additional stuff for completing the game 100%).\n\nAlways keep in mind: After dying a lot of times the amount of happiness when you finally suceed is way much sweeter:\n'Great I finally got the last page from the Book of  the Dead so now I can go back to the safe poin-…\n\n"Here lies…\nDied 0000560 times.“\n\n(…oh crap, I forgot about ceiling falling spikes.)\nYou and this little counter on the death screen will become pretty good friends because you will meet each other very often.\nThere’s an achievement for dying 500 times. If you want to finish the game at 100% you probably won’t even need suiciding to accumulate this amount of deaths. In the end it said I died 560 times – mostly to spikes I guess.\n\nYes it can be very frustrating and even if you're used to challenging titles and tough sequences, you will probably end in hating the game or at least some areas as much as you like other parts. Ragequitting the game after dying for the 18th time on an area, isn't that uncommon. One or two additional save points in tough sections would really have been a blessing and could have ended in letting more of my nerves survive the journey.\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nIf you expect a difficult little retro-platforming action-adventure with some RPG elements 'Castle in the Darkness‘ will entertain you a lot, providing enough content for at least ~6 hours (for the 'regular bad‘ ending) while balancing between motivation and frustration. I rate it 8 out of 10 points and can say that it’s a great little game for the common ~5 bucks in a sale. However, if you're used to difficult games and you have no problems repeating same areas a lot, the game will be funnier for you compared with those who normally tend to choose 'Easy Mode'\n\nThis endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union, providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.","May 26","true","17.4"," 48 of 49 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","48","49","0","10"

Castle in the Darkess just gives me that well-known feel we old farts love so much — I would totally see myself playing this game for hours back in 1991 on my SEGA Master System II. Savegames didn't even exist back then. Good thing this game has them, because you're going to die quite a lot.\n\nArt style is gorgeous (no ♥♥♥♥, Matt Kap = Isaac Rebirth visuals); the music is on-point (gotta love dem chiptunes mang), and the game offers good mechanics even by just making use of two buttons. The old times are back!\n\nOh, it's also discounted by 17% 'til February 12th. That's less than 5€.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GentlemanProtagonist/recommended/262960/","GentlemanProtagonist","adventure","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GentlemanProtagonist/","92 products in account","I think Castle in the Darkness (herein referred to as just "Castle") is proof of a few things:\n\n-You shouldn't judge a book by its cover (or a game by its trailer in this case)\n-There are certain gaming staples that needed to die long ago\n-You get what you pay for\n-A "Neutral" option for reviews would be really nice\n\nI'll get this one out of the way first. Yes, Castle IS fun. But it's the kind of fun that needs to come with a few asterisks (more on that later). The game has a very simple charm to it that transcends words. Movement and attacking are quick and fluid. Enemies are nicely varied, if a little arbitrary at times, and fighting them is engaging enough. Bosses are equally varied (and there's quite a few of them!), virtually no boss (from what I've played so far) is remotely like any other, and it's fun trying to figure out their patterns and how to take them down, though I would argue that perhaps they aren't spaced out very well. Sometimes it seems like you're fighting a boss every 5 rooms, other times you're wondering if the area has a boss at all.\n\nYou start with basic equipment (short sword, basic armor) and gain more as you explore the world. These include various weaponry (of course), better armor, various magic (used by holding Attack to charge), relics which offer passive benefits (break certain blocks, keep traction on ice, etc), and Life increases (dropped by bosses). Some equipment you must buy from various NPC's, requiring you to keep on top of collecting all the coins that enemies drop.\n\nIt is cool to explore the world and gain an arsenal of equipment, but I can't help but feel that it's also a bit superfluous at the same time. The game seems to be designed so that enemies' strength is pretty much always on par with your own, so why even put in all the stat and weapon upgrades if they never add to your power relative to the enemies'? There are a few exceptions; entering Ruth's Hall at the first possible moment is essentially suicide, but then, why even bother letting me enter at all until I'm further along in the game?\n\nThe story is relatively vague, or perhaps a better word would be loose. What's there isn't bad. But at the same time, it's not really what you're there for. Playing Castle for the story is somewhat akin to playing Mario Bros. or Dota 2 for the story.\n\nNow for what I didn't like. While the action is fun, the platforming is not. It's flat out frustrating. Well, the platforming itself isn't strictly bad, it's platforming around all the stuff that instantly kills you that's maddening. There's something about the way the Protagonist jumps that just feels off. It's so close to perfect that it's maddening, but it's not quite there. As I hinted above, the developer seems to have an insatiable crush on spikes that instantly kill you, and traps that instantly kill you. I'm going to reckon the vast majority of any players deaths will be to some form of instant-kill environmental hazard. Actually, there were times I forgot I had a life meter at all. In one room, there's a rugged series of steps with a single spike on one of them, and the spike blends into the background really well. In fact, the first time I passed through that room, being somewhat focused on the enemies, I missed it by chance, and had no idea it was even there. The second time through that room, it killed me (I hadn't even seen it until it did so), and I seriously considered uninstalling the game and never playing it again.\n\nBut the absolute worst thing about this game are the blocks that break when you step on them. You can (and in most cases MUST) hold Jump to gain extra height as you jump on these blocks to reach whatever destination you're striving for, generally this is "ground that doesn't have instant-kill spikes coming out of it". Which is fine and all. Except for one tiny detail: these blocks look the exact same as every other block. If a block serves a different function from a standard block, it should look different. I'm no game designer, but that seems like a basic. What we have here results in a very I Wanna Be The Guy-esque trial-and-error experience. And it's not like IWBTG, where it's so absurd it's actually funny, it's straight-up frustrating, unfair, and terribly designed. The game is withholding information from you.\n\nThe final thing about Castle that bugs the hell out of me is its sense of humor. Before I go any further on that, I have to kinda explain what I mean. See, there's a difference between making a subtle, clever nod or shout-out to something, and just pointing at something, saying it exists, and that by merely confirming its existence branding yourself as a comedic genius. And what Castle seems to love to point at is none other than Zelda 2 (and to a lesser extent Zelda in general, and a few other games), but it's not pointing at it, it's just quoting it verbatim, and at the same time portraying Link as (just to avoid having to ask everyone to pardon my French) a sadistic jerk, and even then it was a one-time joke that added nothing to the game. There comes a point where I'd rather a developer just not make any nods to other video games at all, and Castle has crossed that point and then some.\n\nAt the end of the day, yes, Castle is fun, but this is coming from someone who had the patience to finish Demon's Souls. My recommendation must come with the caveat that if you're not okay with dying a ton, or just dying unfairly in general, then you probably won't like this game. My recommendation must also come with the caveat that I have not beaten it yet. Perhaps I'll have a more definite stance on the game once I do, but even though there's a simple charm in Castle that keeps pulling me in, there's also the game's unrefined platforming pushing me away.","February 5, 2015","true","1.3"," 79 of 115 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","79","115","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PKStylin/recommended/262960/","PKStylin","Starman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PKStylin/","151 products in account","I wonder how long it will be when we will be able to have another pixel-perfect, tough-as-nails platformer that isn't just a homage-fest. This game isn't it. I want to let it be known that before I wrote this review, I did in fact 100% everything in the game as far as percentage and achievements go. So this isn't a case of a salty review. I wish to inform people what this game IS and what this game ISN'T:\n\nWhat this game IS:\n\n-More of the same. It has more in similarity with I wanna be the Guy then a game like Meat Boy for example. Right down to all the other video game references and ideas it shamelessly borrows from.  Even down to the trial and error methods of tackling levels.\n\n\nWhat this game ISN'T:\n\n-It is NOT a metroid vania. Not even loosely. Just because a game has powerups and backtracking does not make it a metroid-vania. It doesn't even have a MAP.\n\nMost of the game, and I do mean the vast majority is backtracking. If you take nothing else from this review, understand my hatred of backtracking is absolutely immense. To add insult to injury, in a game where maneuvarability is paramount, your double jump ability is kept from you until around the first third of the game has passed. You will encounter a ton of areas that will require that double jump to uncover the secrets. That is probably the most laziest way to hinder progression. It shows not a lot of thought or care was put into actually creating a world worth exploring but instead wanted to pad the game as much as possible with backtracking. To make matters worse, the warp zones are put in the absolute worst positions, you will become lost for a good majority of the game, and al lthis does is add time to the clock but nothing is getting done. That is inexcusable for a game that came out in 2015.\n\n\nand I know what you are going to say, "but Starman! Super Metroid is one of the best games ever with a similar grab the powerups to open new areas game, it had a lot of backtracking too!" Ok first off, Super Metroid was THE game that "metroid-vania" was based off and for good reason. You wanna know why it holds up to this day? It created interesting powerups. It created interesting beam combinations. It created an environment you wanted to explore. It had so many powerups and collectibles for it's time that it offered a much more fulfilling sense of accomplishment. It also didn't rely on cheap trial and error segments to pad the game for length.\n\n"But, But castlevania! Symphony of the night! It was the -vania part of metroid! it did similar things!" Not even comparable. Castlevania: SOTN was more like Metroid, but built upon the idea with a huge array of secrets, weapons, spells, and other things. Also, NG+ allowed you to play as other characters and the like.\n\n\nTo even COMPARE this game to a metroid-vania is an absolute lie. Don't even. First third of game is playing crippled, the last 2/3's is backtracking and getting lost, and dying at segments where there are 4-5 screens before your next save point.\n\nSo, why did I play this game to completion? I clearly HATED the game right? No. I didn't hate the game.  The fact is, the game's core gameplay has proven itself to be rewarding, as most of these platformers tend to do. My issue is that the game took the lazy, cheap way out of dealing with things. It has no identity for itself. It's just some frankenstein monster of other game's great ideas hindered by lazy development and shoddy "HAY GAIZ, REMEMBER THIS FROM [this game]?"\n\nI want new, unique titles. You can have your trial and error pixel perfect jumps. But stop trying to be every other game.\n\nand if you really want to create a metroid-vania, CREATE, a genuine metroid-vania experience. Not this.\n\n\n","March 13, 2015","false","14.1"," 147 of 234 people (63%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","63","147","234","14","14"

A match made in heaven.\n\nBoy this game got me hooked. So hooked that I like to call it Castle In Le Dankness. Don’t judge me. Anyway the game’s as advertized:\nIt’s super fast-paced, challenging, and full of secrets!\nAnd that’s true folks. There’s just so much to explore and to find.\nTons of references are just waiting for you behind fake spikes, walls and breakable walls of course. A huge bonus if you’ve played like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid or Castlevania since this game really has a ton of references for those games.\nAlso I do recommend to check out the options menu before you’re starting to die … I mean play this game for hours.\n\nThat being said let’s get into it!\n\nStoryOne dark and gloomy night, the kingdom of Alexandria is attacked by an evil sorcerer and his army of darkness! Despite their best efforts to protect the king and their princess, the royal guard falls one-by-one, to the forces of evil. One knight, unconscious but still alive, awakens on the throne room floor to find that the princess is nowhere to be seen! What're more, the entire city has been overrun by monsters! With sword in hand, he embarks on a death-defying mission to find his princess and restore peace to the kingdom!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484015863\nNow that’s the story. One thing to note is that you’re not your everyday hero. You’re not the chosen one nor the Warrior of Light fighting the Darkness.\nYou’re just a mere Knight doing your duty: Rescuing your Princess.\n\nGameplayWelcome back to the, how I like to call it, golden age of gaming. This game is heavily inspired by games like Castlevania and you’ll notice that in the way the game works. But not only Castlevania pretty much of every game it has references off.\nOne thing I have to tell you right now is: You will die. Not just once. Not twice. Be prepared to die a lot. I’ve finished the game with 305 Deaths. Is that a bad thing? Not it isn’t. To be quite honest with you I had a blast dying countless of times mainly because of my own stupidity. Well I say my own stupidity but that’s not quite true. The thing is the game has so many ways to make you visit the Game Over Screen numerous times. Be it a switch that activates some spikes beneath you, which will instantly kill you by the way or this weird and accurate jump you’ve to do just to get some stuff. Some levels have ice on the ground so you’ll slide slowly but surely into your death and others have strong winds which will send you straight to your Death.\nNot to mention some enemies have specific weakpoints and attacking those is the only way to actually hurt and defeat them.\nThe game does feature upgrades in form of Weapons such as different Swords, Boomerangs or an Axe. Also different types of Armors which will help you on your quest to rescue your Princess.\nNot to mention magic. You can either throw a Hadouken err I mean a Fireball or summon the winds to slash your enemies into pieces.\nAlso there’s another reference including a simple sword and a nature armor. Just to give a small hint.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484949936\nIf you’re fighting a Boss then timing is your best friend as well as choosing the right weapon and magic.\n\nAnother thing to point out is that the game’s all about platforming. Precise jumping and timing will be required to get through the game.\nSecrets. Did I tell you that there are literally dozens of it in the game?\n\nVisualFine and beautiful Pixel Art. I already pointed out to actually check out the options menu before you’re playing for one simple reason: Scanlines. In my opinion adding Scanlines to the game makes look just so much better but then again it could just be me.\nThe difference level just look awesome. The whole game just has a gorgeous Art Style.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485556842\nAudioHere comes the real beauty. There’s an optional Area called Sunken Temple and this is the OST:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu3q98JzuYo\nI found myself running through the entire Area three times after I cleared it just because of this track.\nThe gorgeous art style and the beautifully crafted Sound for each Area just fit.\nTake Torture Chamber for example. Once you reach it you’ll truly understand what I mean.\nThere are more of course but I don’t want to spoil you all the fun.\nMight just be me but if the OST would be available to buy it’d be an Insta Buy for me.\n\nWhat else is there to say?Castle In Le Dankness The Darkness is a game filled with Nostalgia.\nI tried to not go into that but I can’t help it. It’s not only because of all those References but just the overall game. The look, feel, gameplay … Just everything reminds you of the Golden Age of gaming. Be it the enemies, the Bosses or just some items. Nearly everything reminds you of games like Castlevania or The Legend of Zelda and many more. I can’t go and list all of the games since it’s just way too much.\nDying was fun. I grinned so often when I found myself dying because I missed a jump or activated a trap to kill myself … numerous times.\nI seriously had a blast dying and I couldn’t stop playing it.\nI actually go as far as to say that Castle In The Darkness is the Shovel Knight of 2k15.\nWe need more games like this and I truly hope we will see some more in the future.","August 25, 2015","true","17.8"," 47 of 67 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","47","67","0","2"

Well thats a no no because unlike old platformers this is not a platform metroidvania game, Its more like a Trial-And-Error.\n\nYou will die A LOT, the death counter is set for even 7 digits that's never a good thing, You will get frustrated by all the spikes that will kill you and even more angry at the trolling spikes on the roof that will fall on you once you get right under them, you'd think you can see and dodge that but sometimes they dont even show because the roof is too far to show in the screen and you simply die while trying to figure out where to jump to next.\n\nI am sure a lot will vote this review down after reading this but I will never hide anything in a game and show the positive stuff so here  goes.\nThere are some flaws in the level design, In some places its literally impossible to go back through a place, There are other ways around if you want to go back to a warp point but still seeing that gives me an uncomfortable feeling that they didn't do it right, And not only that .. In most places while going back the focus on where enemies are and spikes makes it harder so you can expect to die a lot more when going back than you do going forward.\n\nThis is why i called this game Trial-And-Error, You will keep dying from spikes and platforms that shatters when you stand on them, And places that you will just have to die at least 5 times to know what you are doing wrong.\n\nIf you are thinking you would get some challenge from monsters or bosses I can tell you now if you are a "Hardcore" gamer you will get disappointed because.\n- Enemies look tough at first but after getting a certain sword you can pretty much kill them without sweating.\n- Boss battles are fun they are but I don't know if its me always finding their weakness by equipping the right skill by luck or just them not being that hard, Hardest boss killed me about 3 times before figuring out what I was doing wrong or figuring out how to kill it.\n\nSo yeah your main enemy are those spikes ... Spikes SPIKES SPIKES everywhere enjoy dying a lot.\n\nSo gonna get to the pros and cons to get to my point.\n\nPROS :\n1 - Old school magic revived in a beautiful game, Music and sounds its all bringing memories.\n2 - A lot of time to spend to grind for all the hidden items and what not.\n3 - A lot of secrets to find and secret levels you'd need to play.\n4 - Very reasonable price for this great game ( and a lot more pros )\n\nCONS :\n1 - At the first 3 days of launch it advertised Full Controller Support and I can assure you thats fake because you cant close the game or even pause it using a controller ( at least they edited it back to partial controller support ), Still not a reason Not to buy this game.\n2 - A Few flaws in level design that might throw the game for some as you probably saw in some negative reviews, Yes the game is ridiculously hard at some points, you will die and die and die.\n3 - The game has "fullscreen" but it doesnt cover my entire screen, In my 15.6 inch laptop with 1366x768 resolution, The game is 960 x 640 Although it doesn't even show in the screenshots I uploaded but its the truth, And the rest of the screen is just annoying black boarders, And the 1-2-3 windowed scaling's at number 3 the game goes out of my screen boarders ( Cant see hp and money .. etc )\n4 - a few bugs here and there and this is what i found so far.\nA - When the screen transition happens going from a screen to a screen sometimes it feels glitchy.\nB - When dying or opening menu ( You can only open menu at save points ) it freezes for a few seconds and considering you will die a lot in the game thats bad, BUT the freezing is soo short but thought I should bring it up.\nC - Most of the time when I kill monsters the gold they drop gets inside a rock and gets stuck there, Although I have an item that gives me the ability to act like a magnet to it, Still they get stuck and most of the time I cant pick them up.\nD - When killing a boss and taking the Heart ( the victory music starts and character jumps ) SOME times after it ends the character will either do an extra jump or will walk a few steps to the direction I'm facing, Nothing wrong with it right ? wrong .. some bosses have spikes on the floor and after killing a Certain Crab boss I automatically walked left and fell to spikes and had to do the fight all over again.\nE - After killing a boss if you touch it while its dying you will get damaged, And it killed me once and had to do the fight again, This might not be a bug might be how they wanted it for you to stay away after killing it so just be careful here :).\n\nF - Theres also some serious FPS drop issue at the Final boss Spoiler >  the real final boss battle for the 100% ending  it stayed around 36-38 the entire battle was all in slow motion, in both my pc and laptop ( and my pc is pretty tough )\nand also some usual fps drops every now and then.\n\n\nSo after putting all the good and bad you are free to think of this review as you will.\nYou are free to think of me as a (whiny little brat) Like some said that I complain a lot\nor to think that I just think its reasonable to have stuff like that fixed\nbut to me ? I will still play this game because its good\n\nSo I recommend this game to anyone who likes old school retro Platformers.\nBut with a BIG warning, Know this game is really hard and most places its right down frustrating and Considered a\nTrial-And-Error So keep that in mind when you make this purchase.","February 13, 2015","true","15.9"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","40","58","3","0"

If you enjoy NES classics such as Castlevania and Mega Man then this title is just what you want. The controls are extremely tight and responsive, graphics do a great job of bringing that classic NES feel, music is equally amazing in regard to that kind of nostalgia I am talking about, and the game progression is just so well designed. Some of the boss battles in this game got me really smiling... Sometimes it almost feels like an endurance test. The only modern game that gives me that same feeling would be Dark Souls I think (but in no way is this anything like DS). The platforming skills required in this game are also pretty high... Spikes everywhere....\n\nThe one negative comment I would make is that there is too much back tracking. Some sort of quick travel (at least to the warp hub) would have been greatly appreciated. A Metroid or Castlevania style map would have been nice too!\n\nBeat this game at 78 percent and plan on getting 100% soon.

There's tons of spikes and backtracking and cryptic secrets. If you're not the kind of person who can finish all the levels in something like Super Meat Boy, you'll probably rage-quit this game at some point.\n\nCastle in the Darkness is all about re-living the days of NES games. The visual and gameplay style is based on games like Zelda 2, Castlevania, Faxanadu, and the like, and there's countless references to other NES games too. If you grew up playing those games, you'll get crazy enjoyment from finding all of the hidden easter eggs in this.\n\nThere's tons of cool bosses, secrets, pretty good music, and overall a great sense of exploration. While the difficulty will rightly put a lot of people off, I also feel it adds a lot to the experience, and it wouldn't be an authentic NES game without it.

Castle in the Darkness is an unapologetic love-letter to the 8-bit era of gaming, both in aesthetic and challenge. You play a peppy little knight who is the sole survivor of a curse that took hold of your castle. It's up to you to explore every corner of the kingdom to find all the gear and doodads you need to save the princess, and there is a LOT to find. The game is most like Simon's Quest if you ever played that. It's a side-scroller where the stages are stitched together into a continuous world, full of side paths and secrets. There's no map, but the level design is mostly direct enough that you should have no trouble navigating.\n\nIt's important to note that Castle holds nothing back in its fanatical adoration for the NES era. Enemies are pulled right from Metroid, Castlevania, Gargoyle's Quest, and even stuff like 8 Eyes and Magic of Scheherazade. Also in line with the bygone days of gaming is the challenge. The difficulty ramps up quickly, with enemies doing huge chunks of damage to you and more and more insta-kill spikes making appearances. Finding better weapons, armor, and spells can mitigate the former, but the latter will quickly become the bane of your existence.\n\nThere's no getting around it, sadly. Unless you're the kind of person who got Impossible Boy in Super Meat Boy, you're going to reach a point where the difficulty becomes too much. Mine was right at the end of the game, when I discovered that the final boss would take almost five minutes to kill and could kill me in maybe five hits. I started looking for more secrets that could help mitigate this, and got through an insane gauntlet of spikes and collapsing floors to find an even harder boss. As much as I (mostly) enjoyed the journey there, reaching that point of frustration and defeat soured me on the entire game. I really want to be able to recommend Castle in the Darkness, but I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer that same heartbreak.","October 5, 2015","false","5.0"," 46 of 76 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","46","76","2","4"

I was pleasantly surprised when I actually bought it and played it.\n\nThe controls are really solid, even if it feels the characters moves a bit too fast at times.  Attacking and jumping are simple enough to do and are all you really need in the grand schema of things.\n\nThe difficulty I feel is just right.  Yeah, it's hard, but it's plenty fair, and while savepoints are the only healing they're spread out nicely -- not too far apart, not so close to make it a cakewalk.  It makes you work to better yourself rather than to let you bulldoze through everything, which I can greatly appreciate.\n\nThe sound and graphics are right up my alley, as I've always loved the bleeps and bloops of chiptunes since I was a kid, and the pixel art is honestly very pleasant to look at.  Every area has a unique atmosphere as well, which really adds to a game like this.\n\nMy only problem is that you can't use a controller to pause or exit to the main menu.  This is easily remedied with third-party software, but it'd be nice to see it natively supported.\n\nAll in all I feel I spent my money well, and have no regrets.

However, I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the one-hit kill spikes are a detriment to the game. I'm here to set the record straight and offer a new opinion. The one-hit kill spikes are integral to keeping Castle in the Darkness engaging and consistently enjoyable. Explanation commence.\n\nThere are spikes in Super Metroid that don't kill you in one hit should you fall into them from time to time. Therefore, avoiding these spikes offers little sense of acomplishment as they were only a minor obstacle. The same goes for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. While the spikes in SotN may cause a hefty amount of damage, they still do not kill in one hit. Thus the sense of acomplishment is only marginally greater.\n\nIn Castle in the Darkness, there are spikes littered throughout every level in sporadic patterns that often challenge you to alter your normal jumping strategy. Every time you jump over a spike, you just traversed something that has such a serious ramification as killing you, and that gives you a sense of acomplishment. If spikes merely chipped away a bit of health, then their weight as a threat would be completely dissipated. Not to mention the challenge of many of the game's rooms would be invalidated.\n\nOne-hit kill spikes keep you on your toes. They keep you from getting complacent and bored. Thus they keep you engaged and having fun. Dying ten times on a particularly difficult spike room only makes it all the more invigorating when you finally traverse the obstacle that you have been struggling with and claim your reward.\n\nIf you would like to know all the other reasons this game is amazing and should be purchased at the very low asking price, check out any of the other splendid reviews from fans. I just wanted to take a moment to explain how what many believe is a fault of the game is actually a strength in my opinion.","February 15, 2015","true","14.0"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

But if you liked the NES Metroid or Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (okay nobody liked that game, I guess rather if you liked the concept of the game but wish it was far less confusing and more fun) then this will be your type of game.","February 7, 2015","true","11.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

At first I was irritated with the mechanics and over-use of references, but it all grew on me. The thing with this is - it doesn't just have "a lot" of references, it's actually built on them. About 90% of the game is a reference to something, and almost nothing is original. Whether or not you like that is up to you, but it ended up giving the game personality in my opinion, where at first I felt like it made it devoid of any.\n\nIt's not -just- difficult, either. The Dev straight up trolls you in some areas, and others the quick jumping and tough jump-height control can cause quite a few extra deaths. Can feel a bit slidey as well. You get more skilled with each death though, to the point where when you need to back-track you'll be thinking "Oh, I thought this was hard? Psh." It's a nice since of progression that you can't get from just leveling up. (You don't level up in this, just talking about other games.)\n\nI think it showed about 5 and a half hours for 100% for me, but it resets the timer if you die. I've spent atleast 18 hours wandering aroung looking for things. At 98%, I finally asked on the forums where to find a couple things. Although it doesn't have quite the depth/scope of SOTN, it's the first game in awhile that's come close to giving me that vibe.\n\nAnyway, I'm still wandering around in New Game+ even after 100%ing it.

Death at any point meant going back to the start, including having to watch the cutscene again.

Large areas filled with secrets requiring gratuitous backtracking through dozens of instant death spike traps. A Hero that moves and fights like Symphony of the Night's Alucard if he had magic used like charged shots from Mega Man's buster. This is Castle in the Darkness.\n\nIt's a fun game! Areas are broad and varied, filled with secrets, parodies, homages, and shout-outs. An enemy in the Agros Woods (resembling woods from Castlevania II) has a fairy enemy that says "Hey! Listen!" when it hits you. The Triforce and a Yaisichi sit in the background of the Museum. Link and Bagu are minor NPCs stuffed in houses. Heck, one of the late-game weapons is the "Bro Sword", or Sword Brother from Symphony of the Night! So much nostalgic goodness is stuffed into this game.\n\nUnfortunately, it's also stuffed with rage-inducing tedium and death. Warps are way too few and far between, causing most of the game to be backtracking through the same instant death spike traps over and over.

Expect challenging platforming, a huge number of bosses, various items, relics, weapons and armour hidden in caves, temples, castles and dungeons. If you grew up on classic videogames, you are going to love "Castle In The Darkness".\n\nIt is basically an 8bit Metroidvania, however there is a large amount of "NES hard" platforming that will make you RAGE! in no time. We are talking early Mega Man here, with a slightly more agile hero. The rest plays out pretty much like Symphony of the Night and its sequels - meaning you will slowly expand your item-set in order to explore even the darkest corners of the gameworld. Worth mentioning is the emphasis on battles, the game is jam-packed with boss-monsters. There are at least three dozen of 'em, sometimes just blocking your path but more often than not guarding valuable items, abilities or equipment. They have a very NES-like-feel to them and there is a large variety of situations and patterns, so bosses are always special / fun encounters despite your numerous run-ins with 'em.\n\nNaturally, a game paying homage to the golden age of videogames game is decidedly straightforward in its design - if you need crafting, random loot & levles and other such nonsense, you are out of luck. There is a set amount of items and equipment to find, and it will always be in the same place, being unlocked by the same techniques. There is some variety in the magic (working pretty much like Mega Man weapons, including weakness against certain types) you can use, though. If you are worried of not getting enough bang for your buck, my first 100% playthrough took me 14 hours and from what I understand there is a NewGame+ and it even offers new secrets and challenges.\n\nNot everything is perfect though, in its current state the game has a few quirks - sequence-breaking might be a thing if you are into the whole speedrunning business. Some stuff is even glitchy (and the AI on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bird is just broken, haha) - good thing there are plenty of checkpoints everywhere so you can safely reset the game or take a break. And you will be taking a break, as some of the platforming-sections-layouts and trap-designs of this game are best described as infuriatingly evil. But I guess this is the very reason this game is so much more motivating than all that AAA crap the big megacorportations of today try to shove down everyones throat.\n\nAlso, the presentation is top notch, the sprites are great looking and the music which I would describe as chiptune-speedmetal (think Mega Man music turned to 11) is all balls to the wall! Good stuff.\n\nCastle In The Darkness is a real gem, could use a bit more polish here and there sure, but it's unique blend of NES-hard action and Metroidvania-exploration and progression are so amazingly fun and addictive (even when you rage ;)) that I highly recommend getting it, if you are into oldschool stuff (and even if you are not, hehe).","February 8, 2015","true","14.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It was definitely worth picking up. While I got it on sale, the full cost of $6 is a more than reasonable price for it. It is not flawless, but it is a lot of fun.\n\nThe storyline is nothing special. The kingdom is overrun by monsters, you are the only guard left to save them. The end. Oh and I guess there's a frog knight or something. It's enough of a tale to tell you what your goals are and why you are adventuring, and that is really all it needs.\n\nThe gameplay is what the focus is on. Let me clarify that the controls are fair, but the level design is not always going to be fair. During your first playthrough, unless you are being very careful the entire time, it is inevitable that you will have spikes fall out of nowhere to kill you. Spikes in general will be your worst enemy. Monsters will very rarely kill you, given that save points restore your health, as do warp points. But spikes are instant death, and they are everywhere. Get used to that death jingle; odds are that you will be hearing it a lot. On the bright side, there is an achievement for it, so embrace being killed many times!\n\nIt is likely that a lot of people have already expressed this problem, but I'm going to beat the dead horse and say it anyway. The biggest issue is that the save points are spread out horribly. At the beginning, you will find a save point every few screens. This is nice for beginning players. However, as you get further into the game, they become more and more scarce. Yet even then, you are unlikely to die to monsters. So the lack of healing points is not making the game much more difficult. The huge, glaring flaw with this is that it provides difficulty through frustration.\n\nHere is a prime example. As I write this review, I am on the final level of the game. There are at least seven screens between one save point and another, probably more. Yet I am stuck on that seventh screen. The other six are easy, and then I keep falling to my death due to an irritatingly-placed broken block. Now, if the save point was a screen away, or a few screens away, I would be happy to keep trying until I got through. But having to keep walking through the seven areas, some of which are a bit lengthy, gets extremely tedious. This is not legitimate difficulty. The only thing it makes me want to do is play something else so I don't smash my head into a wall from the same boring six screens.\n\nBut otherwise? It's a great game. There are a lot of fun little references to other games, some of which I got and some that I didn't. The controls are good, even on a keyboard, which is what I have been playing with. I enjoyed most of the boss fights, and there is a lot to collect, which suits me just fine. It has a handful of achievements and some trading cards. It also has music that I personally like quite a bit. I also have never had the game crash on me, or any kind of terrible glitches, so that's always a plus.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who likes the genre. Just be prepared for some frustration later on.","August 22, 2015","true","13.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I got to the final boss around 85% completion (typical for this type of game for me) at around 10 hours. So I was doing plenty of exploring in addition to making progress towards the end. The game is absolutely filled with secrets so you'll find good reason to keep exploring areas you've already passed. The bosses and traps are really challenging, but not so bad you'll rage/quit and never come back.\n\nThe game is also filled with easter eggs and nods towards other games of this type. The game creator has a good sense of humor and it comes across in the game without being lame or campy. You'll see obvious references to metroid, cave story, mega man, etc. There's even a NG+ mode for non-casuals.\n\nMy only critique of the game is the warp system. There is a warp hub that will send you to 4 locations on the world map, but I wish there was an item (even a rare consumable) that takes you to the warp hub. I found myself spending a lot of time backtracking through areas multiple times and found it a bit tedious as I was approaching 100% completion.","June 30, 2015","true","38.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's very challenging, perhaps for the wrong reasons at times, but I found the vast majority of the game to be fair to the player. You'll die. A lot. But if you're anything like me, that'll just intensify your desire to conquer whatever obstacle currently blocks your path.\n\nThe graphics are in that retro style that's so popular for indie games these days, so if you like that style you'll likely find it equally appealing here, especially if you are familiar with the myriad of iconic enemies and bosses reproduced in this game. The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but it's all right, and the sound effects are what you'd expect from a retro style game. The story is about as barebones and standard as it gets, but you typically don't play a retro platformer for a rich narrative. The control seemed perfectly fine for me using an xbox 360 wired controller, but the ability to pause the game or return to the main menu from in-game (without dying) is exclusive to the keyboard, which is just a teensy bit annoying.\n\nAll-in-all, Castle In The Darkness is an awesome little game. I had a lot more fun with it than I expected to in the 14 hours or so it took me to 100% it. Pretty impressive since it was made by a single person.","February 24","true","16.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In it, you are the lone surviving royal knight, and it is your quest to find the princess and save the kingdom from the hordes of invading monsters.  Sounds familiar, I’m sure.  The story is minimal, but still manages to throw a few unexpected twists at you.  The writing, such as it is, is funny and incorporates many tropes, gags, and in-jokes from gaming history.  Much of it is conveyed visually and will be recognized immediately by any seasoned gamer.\n\nI know it will be compared a lot to Shovel Knight, and they are similar in some ways, but this does not feel like a clone at all. Whereas Shovel Knight leans more toward the Mega Man/Mario 3 end of the platforming spectrum, Castle In The Darkness draws more inspiration from Castlevania:SOTN and Metroid.  There is no map, as NES era games often did not. That might be a problem for some, but I haven’t had much issue with it yet. The music is great and always complements the overall aesthetic of each area.  The art style is great and really captures the NES’ essence.  It is clean and consistent throughout.  I never saw a single out-of-place sprite.\n\nThere are a ton of bosses. Most of them are pretty varied and interesting. Some I killed in one life fairly easily, but a few required 5+ attempts. When you defeat one, you are rewarded with lots of coins and a heart that increases your total health.\n\nDuring your adventure, you will find Armor, Weapons, Magic, and Relics throughout your quest. Some are needed to proceed, and others are optional.  Killing enemies causes them to explode into coins for you to collect.  These can be used for purchasing new equipment from NPCs.  Mostly though, it seems new gear is found in chests.  Plenty of stuff can only be found in cleverly hidden secret areas.\n\nThe controls are tight and not the least bit floaty. I used a controller, but keyboard controls worked well for the short time I used them.  I see some people on various forums and websites complaining of cheap, unavoidable deaths. Yes, you will die frequently, but in my experience, each one is my own fault. This isn’t like I Wanna Be The Guy where the goal is to make you rage quit hilariously for YouTube hits. There are crumbling platforms and spikes falling from the ceiling, but you always have a chance to get out of the way if your reflexes are up to the task. And once you’ve seen it, you know. It helps that save points are fairly common and are often placed very near boss fights and difficult platforms.\n\nThere are a few technical issues holding it back, though. Each time you start the game, it opens in 2X windowed mode regardless of how you had it set previously. It’s a bit of a pain to have to change it to fullscreen when ever I want to play. I’ve only had one crash (right after springing off a crumbling block), but some are reporting more serious bugs. Hopefully these issues will be fixed quickly. In my case, these have only been a minor nuisance.  While writing this, the game was updated, so this complaint might already be moot.\n\nFor the price, I can hardly believe how good this game is. There is a ton of content. So far, I’ve got 3 hours and 25% complete. New Game+ and 100% completion give it even more longevity.\nSeriously, just give it a chance if you like Metroidvanias even a little. It’s cheap enough to be a no-brainer in my opinion.","February 7, 2015","true","22.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The areas have the classical themes of old school 8bit games (town, forest, castle and so on). Many areas will be reachable only after acquiring certain items, and this will make you go back to the early levels in search of secrets (and there will be many).\nThere are only a few things that bugged me. Certain checkpoints can be located  far from an tricky room that you are trying to pass, and in case you die you have to backtrack a lot every time.\nAlso some dialogues before a boss fight aren't skippable, and so you might end up listening to them over and over.\nOverall i feel like this game is a good 9/10 considering also the very low price.\nEnjoy it!\n","March 4","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you pass certain points of the game, you'll get little tidbits of story here and there, but for the most part the game is fine with leaving the story in the back of the car between its bigger brothers, Art Direction and Game References.\n\nThe two big forces driving Carstle in the Darkness are Gameplay with the steering wheel and Music riding shotgun and fiddling with the volume knobs. The game is very much a platforming adventure sort of thing (though I guess 'Metroidvania' is a snappier term), giving you a huge sprawling map to explore and hiding the means of expanding exploration behind boss battles. Which makes the lack of an in-game map curious, to say the least. Though it's not exactly difficult to get lost since a lot of the game is spent going down horizontal paths with far fewer vertical sections to worry about.\n\nFighting starts out difficult as you start with what the game calls the worst sword in the game, and a piece of armour that's worth ten coins. You'll eventually gain more weapons and armour, and even gain mastery over the forces of magic that allow you to defeat enemies in new and interesting ways.\n\nThe health bar you have is deceptive, as it never changes to show your actual HP value - it'll always show fifteen chunks regardless of your actual total HP. This can lead you to believe that enemies are doing insane amounts of damage, when in reality they're slapping a full hit-point off you. You also start with HP in single digits, which can be boosted with Boss Hearts. Every boss you kill will drop these, along with a substantial monetary payload. As for the boss fights, they're all unique - only a couple of fights are repeats, and that's because you're re-fighting old bosses that return with new tricks.\n\nThe platforming side of things can be rather punishing at times, in part due to the abundance of spikes that litters the land and the titular Castle. You might encounter some stalactites in caves that bounce harmlessly off your helmet, but pretty much every sharp object you encounter is a one-hit kill. And you'll encounter a LOT of them. I've not taken a count of them, but there's got to be at least a thousand spikes scattered around. Mistime a jump and you're gonna fall into metallic pointy death. The game even keeps count for you, just to embarrass you.\n\nThe music is chiptune goodness, reminiscient of earlier days in gaming. As are the graphics. You can even get a scanline filter to really emulate that crummy CRT look. Really, the game weaponises nostalgia - things that made sense in old games will earn you another tick on the death counter in this game. Relying on old knowledge can work against you.\n\nHowever, it can help you as well - this game is stuffed to the gills with references. Some of them are subtle, others couldn't be straighter rips unless they were heterosexual Beyblades. The game does have some humour of its own, but a lot of it involves pointing at other things and saying "This is what it is!", passing them off as jokes. You might laugh at them - I was more amused by the idea that the devs can get away with this.\n\nCitD also has a New Game+ that has some interesting changes and additions which can carry a second playthrough. What I'll say is this: if you like Symphony of the Night, you'll like this. If not, then I'd give it a miss.\n\n(oh, and the "arsenal of over 100 weapons, armour, items and magic" is a collective number of items you can obtain; I'd be hard-pressed to even say there's a hundred items, but maybe it counts the Boss Hearts in as items to pad the numbers)","January 5","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game itself is a giant homage to those very games and although I do enjoy the references and the throwbacks that this game gives me, I wish it was more original. This had the chance to be much more than just a love letter to old school difficult platformers.\nThe game is very strong in some areas and very meh in others. The music and art are great, and the progression is VERY satisfying! The deaths at times can be cheap but you can adapt and learn from your mistakes and progress further on your next attempt -- much like in the Dark Souls series. The gameplay is fun and simple and the controls are average. I have to point out that the game has an annoying partial support to controllers so there are many things you cannot do in the game when you use a controller. For starters the menus are extremely annoying since you cannot press B to just exit or go back. There is no pause when you press the start button you will have to press P on the keyboard. And in a lot of cases the jump will not register when you press the A key -- which can lead to some unfair deaths.\nThe game isn't perfect and the length is pretty short but you will surely have fun if you are a fan of these kind of games.\nI would say this game has its issues but overall its very fun and worth at least a playthrough (New game plus adds more secrets and it is more satisfying to complete).

Oh, and if you're into that sort of thing (as I shamefully admit I am), the game is absolutely overloaded with myriad referencesd to older games and franchises from start to finish.\n\nAs nice as it is, though, there are issues; the game suffers from a bit much of that dreaded "ultra-difficulty" syndrome so many retro-style games are cursed with, this crazy idea that developers have to fill their products with hair-pullingly hateful platforming with insta-death spikes everywhere in a bid to "make it NES-hard" when even the most spike-filled real NES games almost never involved such pixel-perfect accuracy or were hard for different reasons.  Luckily there are many sections with little or very manageable platforming ridiculousness but there are a bit too many sections that just make me shake my head and wonder why so many devs really think so much of that garbage is such a good idea.\n\nOther than that, the main problem is the sparseness of upgrades for much of the game; despite every single enemy dropping money, places to actually spend it are INCREDIBLY few and far between, and tend to sell just one item, priced exorbitantly such as to sap your every dime even if you've been diligently collecting every coin and finding all the hidden treasure up to that point.  And on that note, you'd better be into scouring every nook and cranny for hidden junk, because upgrades in general tend to be so radically spaced-out during your adventure that if you DON'T find all the hidden optional stuff along the way it'll feel downright disappointing.\n\nGripes aside, though, Castle in the Darkness is very fun, charming and sure to tickle the fancy of most any retro fan, Metroidvania fan or action-platformer fan.  And even if you do complete the game and get 100%, there's a New Game Plus mode with some interesting new gameplay options and trinkets given to you very early on, as well as other stuff to sink your teeth into like some earlier builds of the game to play around with.  Easily worth the small asking price for all that content, especially on sale.  Just stick with it if things seem too hard or sparse here and there, the game always ends up getting better.","March 29, 2015","true","16.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

But when an unseen ceiling spike fells on me for the umpteenth time after getting the already difficult to find book pages which then forces me to get it AGAIN, I start to realize I'm not having fun.  I was hoping for a fun action-adventure game, which I almost got.  However, in the end I got a game where the HP doesn't make anything in the face of deadly triangles.\n\nIf you're a fan of frustration, and raising your blood-pressure, go for it.

With all the recent hype around Shovel Knight, people WILL make the comparisons to this game which is something that I will try not to do. Castle In The Darkness is an 8-bit, 2D Platformer, Metroidvania with a run-and-stab combat style. It knows it's a throwback and it knows every game it draws inspiration from.\n\nWith references to Mario, Zelda 1 2 and Ocarina, Castlevania 1-3, Pokemon, TMNT, Cave Story, Ghosts and Goblins, Mega Man, FF7, and SO MANY MORE, it is a must if you have played many other games. The music is great but the spaces it lasts  makes each track feel overplayed and really makes me feel that a bigger sound track would've been great.\n\nIn a Metroidvania level design is key and that's where Castle In The Darkness lacks the most. The level design is ENTIRELY based on trial and error over having skill. It becomes even worse when doing the backtracking that is virtually required to have a chance in a game like this. You have to remember each spike and trap that makes no sense. To make the RAGE worse it counts each death\n\nIt is very easy to get the best armor in the game fairly early which ruins progression but beats all the backtracking. A lot of this game feels like needless filler that is only meant to prolong the game.\n\nAll the secrets and references are so fun and enjoyable to find. Each one is rewarding it its own way and really puts value into 100%-ing it. That said DON'T GET 100%! It is not worth it while very fun the level design that makes you want to punch the dev for being an absolute troll. The story is simple 80s style nothing special. The bosses are all great with references rewards and a kind of Mega Man weakness system for some. The bosses were my favorite part of this game closely followed by the secrets.\n\nAll in all this game has great music, while repetitive, the gameplay was simple yet satisfying, the level design was bellow average and just there to troll (which it is aware of), the secrets are so fun to find with all the references and rewards, and the bosses even manage to beat Shovel Knight's bosses (sorry, tried to not compare the two)\n\nMy overall score is 7/10! An absolute joy to play, but a pain to complete\n","March 12, 2015","true","18.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

(Boomerang hurts more than your sword!)\n+ Different magics (Though, you're probably gonna be charging them only to find out the next enemy is melee only)\n+ Tons of secrets that make you want to pay attention to detail (Every crack in a block might be a secret!)\n+Chiptune is very catchy (The kind of songs you keep singing the word "Dun" to.)\n+Very reminicent of old platformers such as castlevaina (Play it with an NES conroller, and you're good.)\n+ Some glitches still in the game that make you laugh really hard (During the prologue, when the mask smashes down the bridge, you have a splitsecond to jump back, and you'll see him just sitting there not knowing what to do next after you avoided his trap.\n+Gameplay is addictive\n\n/ Tons of instant-deaths, especially while back tracking. I mean- seriously. You jump over those spikes everytime. Kill the boss after 15+ tries, and backtrack for the save; *Stab* you're dead; try again :)\n\n/ Many MANY MANY save points that heal you instantly, so dying is 75% of the time instant death, 15% stupidity against enemies, and 5% Still learning the patterns of the enemies.\n\nUsing a sword means a lot of button mashing; prepare for calluses galore- and possibly a new controller.\n\n- Too hard if you don't play these kinds of games; however there is an option for Easy Mode in secrets after 50 deaths.\n- As of writing this review, no modern rock in the game (will change this if it is found later as a secret)\n- NPCs don't have much variety (recolours mainly)\n- Bosses seem to come very often, so there's no telling when you get to the area boss.\n- Gets a little boring during long sessions, so it seems more fun if playing 2 hours max per sitting. (If you're getting bored of it, you should probably take notice that the sun was rising when you started, and it's setting as you stop)\n- Controls for a gamepad are wrong by default, so beginners may be frustrated figuring out why nothing's working; unlike the prologue.exe from 2012/2013.\n- VERY late game, as it was supposed to come out long ago. (Probably because of stuff like the Binding of Issac: Rebirth)\n\n\nOverall, I had a ton of fun with this game so far. The prologue released was incredibly fun and had surprisingly a lot of replay value, especially for the temple of sin. This game has gone past that, and has become a really fun game for a surprisingly low price. If you like old style platformers, this is the game for you; so long as you don't mind dying, getting murdered, burned, and other such things 100+ times.\nAlthough, it's weird how a spike to the head hurts you (and popsicles/carrots/apples/cherries will heal that) yet stepping on a spike kills you.","February 5, 2015","true","4.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

It's got a great soundtrack and the graphics are decent but the game itself is just a frustrating mess to play.\n\nIf I had to use a new age example, it'd be like taking Dark Souls and making an NES port of it... You die in a few hits, there are instant kill spikes and pit falls at every corner and the game developers just love trolling you with them.\n\nThe game takes extreme memorization and the path isn't exactly clear as to where you're supposed to go first but they expect you to beat the game in a specific order... I can't stand games like this. You NEED a walkthrough for games this cryptic and it's just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to have to spoil upcoming events / areas in order to complete a game.\n\nIt's great if you like this sort of thing but I grew up with NES era games and none of them were this difficult or obnoxious... The only games that even come close to this calibur are Faxanadu and Castlevania II but even those games didn't have instant kill traps every 5 steps like this game does.\n\nThe developers just got lazy and rather than designing quality areas, just threw spikes on the ground with character wide spaces as buffer so you can jump between them. Considering the game plays at near break neck speeds and it feels like your character is gliding on ice shoes it's kind of ridiculous to get that precision accuracy with your jumping.\n\nMy favorite troll is the developers putting spikes on the ground as soon as you walk through a screen so if you didn't jump in to that screen first, you die. Amazing design you a-holes. /sarcasm.\n\n3 / 10 - The soundtrack is good from what I listened to, there are some decent 80's references strewn about as well which I smiled at.

A lot of enemies make you wait around to strike at the right moment which gets annoying after a while. Still, it's a good, if difficult game. Also, there are sooo many references to other games, mostly NES classics. Castlevania, Ghost n Goblins, Monster Party, Legend of Zelda, Mario 1 and 2, Sonic and that's only scratching the surface.

The story starts with you, the only surviving knight after a vicious monster attack, trying to rescue a princess and defeat all the monsters.\n\nLike games in that era CitD is VERY hard at first, but gradually yields all its secrets to persistent players. Spikes bringing instant death are present in over 70% of the game’s areas and it is very likely that you will see the majority of your deaths from coming into contact with them. Additionally there are a couple equally-lethal versions that drop from ceilings and also pop out of the floor.\n\nMonsters themselves are not too much of a challenge but may occasionally bump you into aforementioned spikes (the short invincibility period after being hit does not protect you from death spikes). You will spend a lot of time memorizing level layouts in order to get ahead in this game and thankfully there are plenty of save points.\n\nBoss battles are just like you would imagine for any retro game: dodge attack pattern, retaliate, rinse and repeat. Finding additional spells, armor, and weapons can make the difference between an easy fight and a long, drawn-out battle to the death. The game also has a completion percentage which, when you reach 100%, will grant you access to a secret boss and alternate (better) ending. There are also a plethora of homages to various retro games waiting to be found.\n\nThis is a pretty solid game for what it’s worth and I can’t find much to complain about. Even the death spike locations can be memorized and once you remember where they are, getting around them is very easy. I guess it would have been nice to have a pause button for gamepad users as well as a menu to change magic and equipment without going all the way back to a save point, but it didn’t really take that much away from the overall experience. This game is a great bargain, even at its base price, so I recommend picking it up whenever you’re in the mood for a retro-style challenge!\n","March 10","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizzozeron/recommended/262960/","bizzozeron","Baka.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizzozeron/","140 products in account","Castle in the Darkness is a throwback to "Nintendo hard" games from the NES/SNES era.  It's a basic action platformer where your basic goal is to defeat bosses, collect hidden gear and treasure, and eventually save the king.  It's not a one-of-a-kind game, but what it does it does very well.  You'll be faced with a handful of enemies that are basically a cakewalk, a couple instant death spiketraps, various other obstacles, and eventually an area boss.  The only catch is that if you die, you lose everything since the last time you activated a checkpoint.  Just got some treasure?  Run back to the checkpoint or risk moving forward and hoping for a new one.  Just found an item?  Better go to the checkpoint.  And the most beautiful situation of all:  Did you just beat a boss?  That's right, many bosses don't have checkpoints near them, and the level design is actually clever enough to function in a harder fashion on the way back to the checkpoint.  Nothing about the areas change, spawns are the same, layouts are the same, crumbling blocks respawn, but because of the way the areas are laid out, going backwards is often harder than the original progression towards treasure, gear, or bosses, and holding onto the spoils of victory makes the trek back even more nerve-wracking.  If you like hardcore NES titles, you'll love this game.  It has a NG+ if you really enjoyed the experience, and by the end of that, if you started really getting the hang of things, you can always go for the super secret item, which is acquired via the most intense of feats.  Get hit and start over.   Oh, and if you don't like NES hard games, and you don't like being punished or carrying the weight of consequence, skip out on this one.","March 12, 2015","true","35.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm proud to be one of the 9.4% of players around the world who actually 100%-ed the game.\n\nThis game does a very good job at being 'Nintendo hard' with modern conventions, however what it doesn't do a very good job at is letting you know where you could get stuck in places if you advance and save at that the next checkpoint.\n\nThere is one thing to keep in mind, most of this game was made by one man, in his freetime making with artistic help from a couple of other people. As a budding indie developer myself (I'm working on a humble little RPG that's my idea of what Final Fantasy The Sacred Stones was SUPPOSED to be) I gotta hand it to Matt Kap, he's done some amazing work.\n\nDifficulty wise I would put this game somewhere between NES/SNES era megaman games and Super meat boy, that being said, there's an area called 'torture chambers' in this game. I'm just going to let that sink in a moment.\n\nWhat's great about this game (and what some people seem to miss) isn't that it's classic 8 bit platforming with a lot of modern ideas, it's that the backtracking everyone's complaining about isn't 'forced' on you.\n\nThink about how a metroid or similarly structured game allows you to reach an area and find out that in order to progress the story you must go back to x area and gain x item to defeat x boss.\n\nThis game is the exact opposite of that, it's more like Link's Awakening, with much, much more freedom in what to do first, once you get the Wing boots (your double  jump) the whole world is a clam, now go find your pearl.\n\nThe best part of the game is also the most frustrating part, getting 100% means going to hell and back, having a beer, and doing it over again, until you get the prize you seek. This isn't what makes it good, what makes it good is unlike other 'ZMG hard as balls' platformer ( Super Meat Boy, I wanna be the guy, etc) every mistake feels like it was legitimately your fault. The developer took great care in making the platforming challenging, but not unfair or impossible. If you're dying a lot to one thing, take a deep breath, go after something else; and come back once you've gotten better at the game. The frustrating part is that even after you complete whatever platforming challenge you faced to get your prize, you still have to go all the way back to the nearest save point, which is sometimes five or more screens away with a multitude of those beloved 1 hit kill spikes of doom littered about.\n\nIf you're super into looking deep into every nook and cranny of a world, you'll enjoy this game. If you're not into that, well, it's only $6 man, give the indie developers some love!\n\nAlso, if you love 8 bit music, you will enjoy this game.\n\nNote: If you are going to go for 100% you may encounter a 99% glitch even if you do get the achievement of Lvl 2 Treasure Hunter.(Finding all items) You can go to this website: http://citd99.meteor.com/ drag your save files (found in the filepath mentioned on the website) to the box, and download what files it creates to replace the original. Until Mat Kap fixes this bug, unfortunately this is the only option at the moment.","May 22, 2015","true","58.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somerndomdude/recommended/262960/","somerndomdude","[BT] somerndomdude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somerndomdude/","423 products in account","This was a pretty pleasant little adventure down the Metroidvania hole. It's got pretty much everything you want, weapon/armor/magic upgrades, hidden paths with challenging platforming, boss fights that are, for the most part, challenging but very, very fair, and a ton of hidden goodies to go back and find. At this time I'm at 94% completion and I've finished the 'main' boss. I probably won't go back and find the last 3 or 4 things, because at least 2 of them I forgot to grab on a save and they're behind a long platforming section :^)\n\nSound/Graphics - 9/10: Pretty much what you'd expect from this genre. Crunchy sounds, crisp sprites that make it pretty clear that something is bad news. They do the job and don't get in the way.\n\nControls - 9/10: Once I took some time to get familiar with controls, I didn't have a single death that wasn't absolutely my fault. A few from impatience, but I should have stopped playing for the session before that happened. You get a jump, then you get a double jump, and there are some other mechanics involed that help you maneuver. Standard stuff executed well give the player very reliable control.\n\nPlatforming - 9/10: Platforming elements are introduced slowly and the truly difficult ones are generally either bracketed by save points OR are one way - you get the treasure and then the spikes or w/e go away. Sometimes it'll be the opposite - easy to get in, and then an unexpected wrinkle makes it hard to get out. The nice thing is that like Super Meat Boy, you're never more than a minute or two from a save point, so you don't get super frustrated if you die. Every platforming sequence is very doable, nothing is frame perfect that I've seen.\n\nUpgrades/Findables - 8/10: All of the upgrades feel weighty and useful, and quite a few of them make the game DRAMATICALLY easier. A lot of people complaining about the game being too hard may have not put in the exploration tax. Without certain spells, or enough HP, or a certain weapon, you'll get dunked early and often. I docked two points here because the spells are just way too powerful, and unchecked. The strongest sword in the game, for which you need to defeat a fairly difficult encounter, pales in comparison to any of the top four spells. Pair that with the fact that magic is free as long as you charge it and this game can quickly turn into Megaman. It seems to be balanced around that so I can't complain, it's just that swords were a bit disappointing. I guess the best way to look at swords is as trophies, as they all come after pretty cool encounters and require some digging to get to.\n\nMap Layout - 10/10: This game does a fantastic job of encouraging you to explore and take notes. It'll dangle doors and platforming elements out in front of you that you can't complete, and if you're thorough you'll find a key for that door or remember that a new ability will get you past an old obstacle from earlier in the game.  It's VERY easy to traverse the map given the fast travel system, and you're heavily encouraged to do so. Guides are available, but a keen eye and a will to check all available paths will get you to at least 90% complete. This game throws a lot of the classics at you: sliding platforms, nonexistent blind roof jumps, phasing platforms, nothing you haven't seen. There are some really cool exploration elements at play and if you don't go out of your way to see everything the game has to offer you'll probably miss at least half of the content. Also, the last 'level' will ♥♥♥♥ you up because you'll be super undergeared.\n\nEnemies/Bosses - 9/10: There is not a single boss in this game that you can't beat iwthout taking more than 25% damage. If you learn the patterns you can crush everything. That said, boss art is great, attacks are fun, and with a little analysis you SHOULD be able to breeze thorugh 99% of the content. There are a few bosses that are pretty brutal, but usually there is a save point right before them so you can get reps in quick. Enemies are pretty standard and level with you as you go, but if you're gearing/exploring they should all take ~4 hits and all hit you for about 10-30% damage.\n\nDifficulty - 10/10: I feel like this section needs to be included because of the negative reviews. This game is difficult. It's not 'brvtal' or 'savage' or 'cheap', but it's difficult. There are sections that will frustrate all but the absolute best platformers, but there's nothing that is as hard as say, the three-screen fall in VVVVVV or anything APPROACHING the high end SMB stages. It requires you to put in work to explore if you want to have a fighting chance. You will not breeze through this game with the stuff it gives you in the main quest line. The reward is that you wind up with a powerful character, some neat gear, and a great experience. I think that's a fair trade.\n\nOverall I give this a 9.5/10. It's a recommended buy at the standard $6 and a must have at anything less.\n\nAlso, if  you're on the fence, don't hesitate to buy and try it. You will know WELL within 2 hours if this game is for you.","January 25","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Does it live up to the lofty expectations we neoretro-lovers had placed on it after playing Matt Kap's surprising 2013 demo?  Most will say yes.  And *I* will say that the full version has exploded my own predictions into smoking confetti with how awesome it is!  CitD takes place in a sprawling 2D kingdom, every corner of which is stuffed with secret bosses, optional weapons and nostalgic cameos, all rendered in some of the most authentically gorgeous 8-bit art I've seen.  The nameless little knight at your command rips joyously across this pixelated wonderland with the the speed of NES Ninja Gaiden's Ryu, vaulting instakill spikes and stabbing his comically huge blade into the game's sizable menagerie of beasties as quickly as you can hammer the X button.\n\nSome people call it a "metroidvania," but I don't think that's the right word; CitD feels far too open, too rollicking and venturesome for that (rather stodgy) designation.  It's precisely the kind of game I hoped La-Mulana was before discovering it to be the impossibly esoteric rite of some bizarre cult:  fast-paced and challenging with a million things to look at and secrets that are not too obscure and not required for progress.  CitD's secrets are so compelling, though, that you'll be driven to seek them all out (I 100-percented the game without feeling one iota of weariness)!\n\nWatch the trailer.  If this looks like your type of game, then it definitely IS your kind of game -- and at this immorally low price, you have no excuse not to buy, save dirt-caked poverty.  If incredible games like Castle in the Darkness are still being made when I am 80 years old, then I will sure as hell still be playing them!","February 18, 2015","true","18.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I love it.\n\nThis game is not easy and is not forgiving.  Some of the traps and battles can only be figured out through trial and error.  You will die many times and the only hand-holding you get is the frequent save points.  If you can't handle a game like Super Meat Boy, this game is not for you.\n\nPersonally, I love how absurdly easy it is to die and would be happy if there were either far fewer save points or maybe a higher difficulty that forces you to restart the entire stage.\n\nDue to the precision required for much of the platforming and combat, the quality of gamepad you're using is crucial.  A clunky off-brand gamepad will make the game even harder than it already is.\n\nThe art and sound of the game are close to what the NES was capable of pushed to its limits, maybe closer to Sega Master System quality in some areas, but nothing is present that breaks the illusion of being a >25 year old game(with the possible exception of being able to use the mouse on the main menu).\n\nMy only gripes so far are that YOU CAN'T SET A PAUSE BUTTON ON THE GAMEPAD and that there are a bit too many references to certain classic games.

I love hard games, clocked 555 hours into Dark Souls and 400+ into Dark Souls 2, but the Dark Souls games are also fair, when you die you feel that it was your fault, if you had played better you would have survived. On this game, however, 90% of your deaths are by instant kill traps, like hidden spikes next to a lever you have to pull so you'll die the frist time you pull it, a spike that falls on your head as soon as you enter a room, it's basically a memorization game. Add that to the fact that it has ♥♥♥♥ controls, tons of platforming with insta death spikes (which you have to do with the ♥♥♥♥ controls), the poorly placed checkpoint locations and 3 billion turns and paths without a map, which will lead you do get lost all the time, and you've got the perfect formula for frustration and boringness.\n\nIf you want a good metroidvania game, play the old metroids or Axiom Verge, if you want a hard but fair and rewarding game, play Dark Souls.

I am not deterred by it at all because I strongly feel that Castle In the Darkness is a gem, and it is as good as videogames like Shovel Knight, if not better.  You will also notice that many people (more than the number of people that have written positive reviews), have downvoted the negative reviews as payback.  Interpret all of this as you will, but ultimately, I hope that you guys make the right decision.\n\nThis upvote/downvote system could not be any more broken.\n\nReview:\n\nAs a gamer that was around when games like Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Contra, and Battletoads on the NES kicked my butt to hell and back, I can say that Castle In the Darkness is a homage to classic video games. Castle In the Darkness is challenging, yet fair, and you die because it is your fault.\n\nThe challenging part about Castle in The Darkness is not so much the enemies, incredible bosses, and the obstacles in your path, but more so the required amount of patience on the player's behalf.  The game is fair, and it respects the player.  It does not toss cheap enemies and obstacles that lay out poor design.  Instead, it is challenging, but fair by having well placed checkpoints throughout levels for you to save and change/equip weapons, armor, and relics.\n\nThis is may be another Shovel Knight to some people, but I feel like there is worthwhile gameplay and content here.  I hope that people will look beyond the surface and employ your critical thinking skills to see beyond the outer glass.  It is a game that is truly worth playing, even for someone like myself.  I am one of the last people you will probably find playing tough games like this, despite growing up playing them in the first place.  Even then, I still enjoy classic games such as Castle in The Darkness from time to time.\n\nI was truly surprised by the number of mini-bosses and bosses in the little time I have played the game.  I may be a bit biased, but I love boss fights.  Well, good boss fights!  Don't you?  The boss fights have their abilities and patterns, but they are so likeable.  If you ever played Mega Man/Mega Man X, you will completely understand how boss fights work.  There will be a certain pattern, that is not entirely scripted, but it can be memorized in such a way where you can defeat the boss.  It is still challenging to an extent, but not merciless to the point where you want to throw your controller at the wall.\n\nThe Xbox 360 controller, as well as the mouse and keyboard both work on my system.  I am using a wireless Xbox 360 controller (older version, not the new version with the improve D-pad), and I am using the analog sticks--not the D-pad.  You will need to button-map TWO control buttons -- attack and jump.  Set them to whichever buttons you want.  It is a simple and quick setup.\n\nI have read that some players have completed the game in just over 5 hours.  For the asking price of $5, I feel like it is worth it.  I feel like it is worth at least $10.  It's a very good game.\n\nThere are little things that I would like to mention:  collect coins as quickly as possible as they disappear, save at checkpoints whenever you can to save time, and be patient.  Patience is the key.  The game is not incredibly hard.  It is not extremely hard.  It is plain, challenging, which is a good thing.  Take your time, enjoy the game, and soak it all in.\n\nThe original soundtrack by Matt Kap is undoubtedly well done.  I noticed hints of Mega Man music flair in it.  Nostalgic or not, it is undeniably a great OST that isn't grating to the ears, but promises you a good time while you play this game.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWhile there are many positive points in Castle In the Darkness, it isn't without issues.  There are some balance issues when it comes to checkpoints.  Sometimes, the game is generous with checkpoints, while sometimes there isn't a checkpoint to be found after defeating a boss, and then having to traverse through a few sections filled with mobs to save.  And if you do not get to that save, alive, you'll have to come back and beat the tough boss all over again.\n\nAnother balancing issue is the amount of copper and silver you receive from mobs before the inevitable upgrade.  Even if you collect nearly every coin that the enemies drop, you won't have nearly enough, and often times, half of what you need to buy the upgrade.  There is a solution, however, which is to cheaply farm an enemy, one that hopefully drops at least 2-3 silver coins.  Silver coins count toward five currency, and copper counts as one.  You may need to farm a section before you can move on because you cannot pass up the crucial upgrade.\n\nVerdict:\n\nCastle In the Darkness would make a great addition to your game library, and a great game to play over the weekend.  I understand that there are so many Indie games out there that are priced variably, with little or a lot of content, and it can be a difficult decision to make at times.  I can reassure you that for the asking price of $4.97, this game is totally worth it.\n\nEarly impression rating:  8.5 out of 10  (subject to change)","February 5, 2015","true","2.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","2"

The ability to control when and how often I save.  Too often I find games that auto-save so bloody often that it winds up saving when I don't want it to.  Get a crap drop from a boss?  It autosaved, gotta start over.  Autosaving may seem like such a convenient thing, but when a game actually has missable achievements, collectables, quests, etc, autosaving can become a rather costly convenience.  Or, to put it more simply, it turns from a blessing to a curse.\n\nWhich is why I'm glad games like Castle in the Darkness can remind us of our roots, where the game doesn't save until you tell it to.  No relying on autosaves, no quicksave/quickload.  No, you're on our own.  This game is hard, almost brutally so in some areas (Torture Chamber comes quickly to mind), but it's the kind of difficulty I often like.  Memorization, skill based, platforming challenges at it's purest.  Sure, there's cheap shots occasionally, but they occur more towards the end of the game, when it's throwing everything it has at you, or in challenging little puzzle rooms for great items.  Getting to 100% completion itself is a daunting task, but a managable one.  Most people here have said they had hundreds of deaths and you will too; I beat the game 100% with a little over 200 deaths.\n\nAnd my GOD, this soundtrack!  There are a great many places I wound up going back to and just running the game in the background so I can listen to the music.  Sure, you can get the OST from Matt Kap's bandcamp page for $3, which I think is a little overpriced (Seriously, you're selling your game for $6 and $3 for the soundtrack?  Jake Kaufman, who did the soundtracks for the Shantae games and Double Dragon Neon, amongst many others, gives his away for free.) compared to the game itself.  Sure, it's a very small amount of money, but in terms of percentages, yeesh.  Seriously, 50%?  Anyways, I highly recommend the track for the Grand Hall the most, it's amazing.\n\nThis game beautifully marries old school platforming and music with more modern, open world exploration, to some extent.  You can go anywhere just about anytime, and while the game is more or less a straight line until you get a hold of the double jump, you can go just about anywhere for little bonus items that make other areas easier.  For example, you can get a fantastic spell from the House of Ruth pretty early on (In fact, I'd say you're an idiot if you don't get this optional spell since it helps out SO MUCH).  Just go inside, go long the lower path and, when it splits, go right.  You should find a massive chest with the spell, Energy Splash, inside it.  Think of it like a chargable shotgun blast, with that kind of spread.  Oh, and it's considerably more powerful than the Fireball spell you'll have at the time.  In fact, that spell was almost broken and I never used any other spell for most of the game, except when required, at least until Gale Wind became available to me.\n\nEven better, this game is smart with the spells, where certain magic and attacks do nothing to certain enemies while others wreck them completely.  I've had bosses get nuked from, say, the Soul Blazer spell when a technically superior spell, like Gale Wind, does nothing.  I appreciate this, as it encourages the player to experiment and not play so safely with the same old spells.  Some weaknesses are obvious (Like the Ice Golems when you should only have the Fireball and Energy Splash spells...) and others are not (Killing the Red Ogre that flings lightning with his own reflected shots gets you the Thunderblast spell.  I just saved you, like, an hour trying to find that last bloody spell.)\n\nBut if there's one piece of criticism I have to launch, it's that this game is a little too old school.  You can only change our gear at save points, which is a very odd choice, since there will be times you go to fight a boss and be completely unprepared for the battle, perhaps even having on a spell and weapon combination that actually cannot harm the boss itself.  I myself got hit by this numerous times, so not being able to hit a button to change gear and spells was more annoying that anything else.  Secondly, this game has no pause button.  Oh, it'll pause if you click on another screen to look something up or answer an email or the like, but the button to unpause does nothing after you press it.  Just because games like Titanfall and Dark Souls can't pause doesn't mean the pause feature is no longer a good idea.  Pausing isn't needed for those games because of the multiplayer element.  This game, however, is a single player game with no online mode or features to speak of.  Not having a pause button, especially in a game that's essentially a huge love letter to old school gaming, is a freaking sin.\n\nAnd finally, the lack of a map.  Now, old school games weren't known for their maps, but you know what is?  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  And this game gets referenced a TON in Castle in the Darkness.  Also, old school games didn't typically need a map since old school games were relatively short, with very few exceptions, like Metroid.  And given the number of secret rooms, many of which housing important items, this game would have benefitted so much from a map system.  ESPECIALLY when it comes to conveyance.\n\nI assume you all are familiar with the term after that one Egoraptor video.  For those not in the know, it means how well something gives you direction and purpose.  The map of Castle in the Darkness is so huge that it's hard to figure out where to go and what to do, especially when you reach a point where you're missing one very good spell, X-Sword.  Eventually, after exhausting all possible leads and finding more secret passages than you can count, you MIGHT figure out that you can actually GO TO THE RIGHT IN THE WARP ROOM!  You know, that one room where you can choose which statue to warp to?  You can goto the right.  And there's a bit of an area to explore, then, if you have a certain item, you can enter the Crystal Tower, which contains not one, or two, but THREE bosses.  Two of which give HP upgrades (+1 each) and the last giving the completely broken X-Sword spell.  Oh, and there's also another item, the Elixir, to get here, which gives a massive +5 HP upgrade.\n\nAlso, if I may ask a question of the developer; What is the sixth teleporter statue for?  Because there's only five teleporters in the game.  Are you going to add some additional content via DLC?  Because that would be interesting.\n\nAnyways, if I had to give this game a score, I'd give it an 8/10.  The game is fantastic and other than some minor annoyances with the controls, lack of a pause button, and the lack of a map, it's well worth anybody's time.

While the graphics are a love letter to 8-bit NES games, like Castlevania and 8 Eyes, the gameplay itself soon becomes an experience in perfectly jumping through spike floors and platforms, attempting to survive from save point to save point.\n\nThere's a big exploration and collection aspect to the game as well, with a variety of items and spells that one has to travel off the beaten path to find. Playing through on New Game + I was surprised about how much time I actually spent investigating the side paths and trying to find all the possible items. There's a good amount of secrets to be discovered as well.\n\nThe game is a little buggy. Entering a door when wind is blowing you away from it can result in a soft lock, the hitbox on some floor spikes can hit or miss you from odd angles, trying to jump at the very edge of a platform can result in the weaker double jump instead after you get that upgrade. NG+ gives you a fast attacking weapon that, if you wear with certain armor, won't attack if the projectiles from the armor are still on the screen. I got a hard lock once, but couldn't reproduce it.\n\nDespite these issues, the game was a blast to play. Even though it dips into being a masacore game later on, it definitely has a better Metroid-esque design than most games labelled as "Metroidvania."","May 17, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can go anywhere just about anytime, and while the game is more or less a straight line until you get a hold of the double jump, you can go just about anywhere for little bonus items that make other areas easier.  For example, you can get a fantastic spell from the House of Ruth pretty early on (In fact, I'd say you're an idiot if you don't get this optional spell since it helps out SO MUCH).  Just go inside, go long the lower path and, when it splits, go right.  You should find a massive chest with the spell, Energy Splash, inside it.  Think of it like a chargable shotgun blast, with that kind of spread.  Oh, and it's considerably more powerful than the Fireball spell you'll have at the time.  In fact, that spell was almost broken and I never used any other spell for most of the game, except when required, at least until Gale Wind became available to me.\n\nEven better, this game is smart with the spells, where certain magic and attacks do nothing to certain enemies while others wreck them completely.  I've had bosses get nuked from, say, the Soul Blazer spell when a technically superior spell, like Gale Wind, does nothing.  I appreciate this, as it encourages the player to experiment and not play so safely with the same old spells.  Some weaknesses are obvious (Like the Ice Golems when you should only have the Fireball and Energy Splash spells...) and others are not (Killing the Red Ogre that flings lightning with his own reflected shots gets you the Thunderblast spell.  I just saved you, like, an hour trying to find that last bloody spell.)\n\nBut if there's one piece of criticism I have to launch, it's that this game is a little too old school.  You can only change our gear at save points, which is a very odd choice, since there will be times you go to fight a boss and be completely unprepared for the battle, perhaps even having on a spell and weapon combination that actually cannot harm the boss itself.  I myself got hit by this numerous times, so not being able to hit a button to change gear and spells was more annoying that anything else.  Secondly, this game has no pause button.  Oh, it'll pause if you click on another screen to look something up or answer an email or the like, but the button to unpause does nothing after you press it.  Just because games like Titanfall and Dark Souls can't pause doesn't mean the pause feature is no longer a good idea.  Pausing isn't needed for those games because of the multiplayer element.  This game, however, is a single player game with no online mode or features to speak of.  Not having a pause button, especially in a game that's essentially a huge love letter to old school gaming, is a freaking sin.\n\nAnd finally, the lack of a map.  Now, old school games weren't known for their maps, but you know what is?  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  And this game gets referenced a TON in Castle in the Darkness.  Also, old school games didn't typically need a map since old school games were relatively short, with very few exceptions, like Metroid.  And given the number of secret rooms, many of which housing important items, this game would have benefitted so much from a map system.  ESPECIALLY when it comes to conveyance.\n\nI assume you all are familiar with the term after that one Egoraptor video.  For those not in the know, it means how well something gives you direction and purpose.  The map of Castle in the Darkness is so huge that it's hard to figure out where to go and what to do, especially when you reach a point where you're missing one very good spell, X-Sword.  Eventually, after exhausting all possible leads and finding more secret passages than you can count, you MIGHT figure out that you can actually GO TO THE RIGHT IN THE WARP ROOM!  You know, that one room where you can choose which statue to warp to?  You can goto the right.  And there's a bit of an area to explore, then, if you have a certain item, you can enter the Crystal Tower, which contains not one, or two, but THREE bosses.  Two of which give HP upgrades (+1 each) and the last giving the completely broken X-Sword spell.  Oh, and there's also another item, the Elixir, to get here, which gives a massive +5 HP upgrade.\n\nAlso, if I may ask a question of the developer; What is the sixth teleporter statue for?  Because there's only five teleporters in the game.  Are you going to add some additional content via DLC?  Because that would be interesting.\n\nAnyways, if I had to give this game a score, I'd give it an 8/10.  The game is fantastic and other than some minor annoyances with the controls, lack of a pause button, and the lack of a map, it's well worth anybody's time.  Just be ready to die a lot.","May 10, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the graphics are a love letter to 8-bit NES games, like Castlevania and 8 Eyes, the gameplay itself soon becomes an experience in perfectly jumping through spike floors and platforms, attempting to survive from save point to save point.\n\nThere's a big exploration and collection aspect to the game as well, with a variety of items and spells that one has to travel off the beaten path to find. Playing through on New Game + I was surprised about how much time I actually spent investigating the side paths and trying to find all the possible items. There's a good amount of secrets to be discovered as well.\n\nThe game is a little buggy. Entering a door when wind is blowing you away from it can result in a soft lock, the hitbox on some floor spikes can hit or miss you from odd angles, trying to jump at the very edge of a platform can result in the weaker double jump instead after you get that upgrade. NG+ gives you a fast attacking weapon that, if you wear with certain armor, won't attack if the projectiles from the armor are still on the screen. I got a hard lock once, but couldn't reproduce it.\n\nDespite these issues, the game was a blast to play. Even though it dips into being a masacore game later on, it definitely has a better Metroid-esque design than most games labelled as "Metroidvania."","May 17, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Summary of rating of game below this huge paragraph)\n\nBut more so than that, this game is truly a masterpiece. The 8bit music is beautiful and nostalgic. The combat although simple requires quite a bit of unexpected strategy when fighting both bosses and regular monsters. The control scheme at first put me in the mind of Megaman: Jump and Attack. However, the weapons you find change up the way you go about attacking. Whether its directly in front, at an arc or a descending straight line. If the basic weapon isn't enough, you acquire magical spells to really change up how your offense and defense is crafted. It's impossible to clear the game with the regular weapon you start out with so, in a way, the game forces you to cycle through the weapons to see which one best suits your playstyle. The game itself is fast-paced but, careful not to go too fast or you may run into several different traps spread out across the maps that'll insta-kill you. There's only one thing that bothers me about this game and that's it's lack of a map. I get that there is a lot of exploration but, you have to go back and forth through different areas in order to 100% complete it (like in Metroid) and sometimes its hard to remember where you haven't been by just looking at the surroundings of the area. Oh yeah. Speaking of Metroid, there are tons of scenarios and monsters that reference so many different classic games directly. Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Legend of Zelda, Cave Story, and Megaman just to name a few. There's a strong amount of Mario and LoZ references though.\n\nPros:\n* Music is beautiful\n* Gameplay is unique\n* Playstyle is completely up to the player. No strict format telling you where to go or how to play.\n* Silly references to classic games\n* Difficult puzzles and hidden areas\n* Hard bosses\n* Each different area has way more depth than what it appears to on the surface, requiring you to revisit again later on\n* Strategic save locations that serve more as a checkpoint than anything else\n* Fastest method of saving keeping the pace of the game fresh (Press Up at a statue, continue playing)\n\nCons\n* Due to the fact that you have to go back and revisit areas to 100% the game, it gets a bit frustrating going around in circles trial and error'ing to see if one spot leads to another\n* Lack of a map makes this even more frustrating because you start to lose sense of where you're going","July 12, 2015","true","51.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Matt Kap developed the game, and it is a fairly challenging platforming game. You can pick the game up on Steam for $5.99 but if you do so before Feb 12, 2015 it is on sale for $4.97!\n\nThe game just gives me a Ghosts and Goblins feel. Swords and zombies probably is the reason behind that. As you progress deeper into the game, the sword you use grows bigger and bigger. Coins and all sorts of equipment litter the games many levels. Locked doors require keys to open, some take just a normal key, while others take keys that are specific to that door that must be found in different areas of the game.\n\nKeyboard controls by default are just odd, and I used my controller after a few mins using a keyboard. As you can see in my stream it took a few tries to get the game running properly after switching to a controller set up. Hopefully that gets fixed (or I figure out what I did, so I don't cause that bug again) soon. Once I switched to a controller I had a much easier time with the game, but at least the game comes with a keybinder, so you can still use a keyboard with better controls (I'd imagine running WASD instead of arrows with space for jump and shift or tab for attack (if you can set either of those, if not c or v may work for me as well).\n\nThe game is very challenging, I could see what I needed to do very easily but lots of room for stupid mistakes. Reminds me a lot of basic math tests back in school. In the lets say 30 minutes that I played I probably died 25 times. Mind you I'm in no way an expert on this style of game, so if you enjoy these games, you shouldn't die every minute the way I did. Despite my numerous deaths, I enjoyed the game, but can't imagine doing a marathon session of the game for hours on end due to my lack of skill in this style of game. Short bursts however would be great for me.\n\nThere were numerous areas to explore, each adding something slightly different than the last, and many leading to areas that were inaccessible until gaining a key. Sadly I would go to the blocked off areas before heading towards the unlocked areas. This lead to numerous deaths for no reason. And since the game tracks your deaths (even if you delete a file you keep your deaths!!!) I got annoyed with myself for going that direction (not a complaint against the game, just against my RPG nature of explore everything, the out of the way stuff before the easy stuff).\n\nThe game was fun, and worth the $6 price tag, even better if you can catch it on one of Steam's sales. For me a session of an hour or less is ideal, but I could see someone sitting in front of it for hours on end trying to finish something harder than what I've seen so far. The game rotates between a 7 and a Negative 1523563676 when I'm dying in the same spot over and over (the game cheated! /rollseyes), so in fairness I'll give it the 7.","February 21, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Wait for a patch.\n\nThis game is basically a hard version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night meets Mario. It is a ton of fun if you can get past the massive amount of bugs. Have some patience and keep trying, you will find its worth putting up with some of them. There are save points everywhere so save often and you should be fine. To clarify, you don't actually level up, but everytime you beat a boss you get a stats increase. You can only access your menu at the save points, and this game could do with some sort of map.\n\nYou -MAY- have to reinstall the game like i did on the first go, but that should fix the problem. This game seems to be stuck in Windowed mode (edit you can change the setting in options), so if that bothers you i would pass on this for now.\n\nRunning Windows 8.1 and an Nvidea 745M graphics card if that helps anyone else having difficulty getting this to work.","February 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

An apparently one-man affair, Castle is full of references to old games, controls like old games, and has similarly frustrating design elements that old games have - remember all the instant-death spike pits in old games, like the NES Mega Man games? Remember how fun those were? No!? That's because they weren't fun, and they are ALL OVER this game.\n\nThe save points are frequent, but spaced out unevenly. Several times, I would beat a boss only to go to the next screen, die due to insta-death spikes, and have to rekill the boss. Also, the first time I launched the game, the sound didn't work at all - sad considering the soundtrack seems pretty good. Furthermore, it didn't detect my PS4 controller, so I had to play with a mouse and keyboard. A lack of display options is also frustrating, locking the game to an "old school" resolution. For a one-man effort, it's pretty impressive, and overall I'd recommend it. But for the love of god, STOP putting instant death spike pits into your retro platformers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakazo/recommended/262960/","dakazo","draconianVoltage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakazo/","1087 products in account","I'm going to put the TL;DR at the top: This is a challenging game with a lot of value for it's low price. It's not perfect but it's enjoyable.\n\nThis feels just like a Cave Story/Castelvania/Mega Man kinda game, with good platforming and a bunch of enemies that you can tackle in different ways.\nMy particular copy of the game seems to have some audio issues, so I can't say anything about the music or sounds.\nThough I do like the level design, there are a few issues I have with the mechanics, namely that attacking while on the ground greatly hinders your movement. You keep mommentum in the air, but there were a lot of times I went to attack an enemy while running only to have my movement halted. It's difficult for me to get used to but ultimately for the design of the game it does actually help you not run headlong into enemies that take more than one hit to kill.\nBosses are pretty epic, at least visually. They can be daunting and tricky at first but once you figure out their very simple patterns it only takes some patience and a steady pattern of hitting them once or twice when you get your chance and then backing off.\nOne thing about the game that feels a little cheap in my opinion is how little health you have. There are ways to increase your health and defense, but so far as I've played, the few upgrades I've gotten barely feel like they make a difference. Just about everything kills me in about 3 or 4 hits, while even the weakest of enemies take at least 2 or 3 hits from my weapon.\nThe world is mazelike, with a bunch of faux branching paths that, as far as I've played, end in a locked door, loop back to the main path eventually, or require you to have the double jump upgrade to reach them. This wouldn't be so bad if the double jump weren't so apparently late in the game. 3 hours in and I'm already going to have to do tons of back tracking to the beginning of the game just to get to some double jump sections. Some things this game lacks that would make this far less dreadful is if there were more warp points for the warping item you eventually get (I've only passed 2 so far and I'm somewhere in like level 5) or, in my opinion most importantly, a map system that allows you to track you path through areas you've already visited.\nThe lack of a map is the main thing that makes this game feel like a maze, as you're never quite sure where you are or which way you need to go to back track to a save point (Which is far safer than trying to make it to the next one, believe me). While this can be good for the exploration aspect of the game, I feel that that kind of approach is far better suited to a game that doesn't require large amounts of back tracking, as this game seems it will involve.\nThe game is challenging but again, it feels the difficulty is stemmed mainly from the fact that you have so little health and that there are no heath pick ups. The only way to regain health is to pass a save point or grab an item that increases your max health.\nThere are other nit-picky things about this game I don't like, such as how the health bar doesn't feel like it accurately depicts how much health you actually have, or the lack of a means to attack directly down or up (Like the down and up slashes you can get in Zelda II).\nThis game does have some glitches, none of them game breaking (at least as far as I've seen) and some of them are actually a bit silly.\nUltimately, despite it's flaws, this game is very challenging and kind of fun. I love that it feels very much like Cave Story, a game I love and highly recommend. From what I've seen it has a LOT to offer for a game that's only $6.","February 28, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And as far as I can tell this is as good as I'm going to get. This is an incredibly well done platformer, one that me and the cats that frequent my balcony have taken to calling "Mega Man-Vania" If you're a fan of either franchise I urge you to jump on this, because neither of them seem to be on the verge of coming back any time soon.\n\nGameplay is simple. You walk, you jump, you attack, maybe hold attack for a magic spell not unlike Mega Mans Mega Buster. I have noticed an issue of slowdown on some of the bosses thus far, though not game breaking it warrants a mention, it's most noteable on bosses. I've yet to see it break the game, but it may make you resort to some less than proud tactics. So far it hasn't been a gamebreaking issue however.\n\nIf you enjoyed the NES-era Mega Man and Castlevania games this is certainly worth a look, especially at a paltry 6 dollars. As for people online comparing it to Dark Souls, they must be afflicted with an intellectual disability. I haven't seen one mechanic common to the two. Well it counts your deaths I guess.

My first review on any game on steam. Why this game? TL;DR, it sucks. so. much. "but whyyy". Many things, I'll try to keep it short. There is no map, why. You run around and of course the path branches off. You take one, branching again, and again. Suddenly, boss. You die miserably. Let's go back, but where to!? There is no sense of direction, you just backtrack to find some item that makes the boss beatable, speaking of which: You need the right item, always. This game has this illusion of choice, enemies simply become unbeatable with the wrong item "choices". You die, often. Every minute, why? because you're bad? No. Because the game's "traps" are either invisible or if not yet killed by impossible to dodge. You simply get killed for no reason, BUT NOW YOU KNOW, that at that exact spot is a trap. The game doesn't really teach you much any other way. There are apparently mechanics that never get used, like reflecting projectiles. (srsly, why implent it if you can't literally reflect any afterwards, you try anyways and die ofcourse.) Safe points are sometimes 3 screens apart, sometimes 50. (wtf). You collect money, fooor...? There are sometimes mechants selling exactly 1 item. Wow. Much choice, so grind. I forgot about dodging things, enemies can turn immidiately, while you merely "swing" back. Your sword has the basically the range of male genetalia, so yeah, you cannt dodge simple enemy movement, which is just unfair. You get magic to help you out range-wise. You use it. You ONLY use magic. You run around waiting for it to charge, because you suck at melee. But again, the game forces you to change strategies by simply making enemies immune, wow. Btw most of the bosses are immune to every sort of magic, makes sense, right? I have now roughly played 3-4 hours, still playing right now. There are teleporters all over the place that are inactive (why). Ah, and after you beat your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss ( I forgot to mention that bosses always have exactly one strategy to beat, the mechanics are so simple my little brother could programm those.) you can ask yourself: Where is the next safe point, which heals me. (thats the only way to heal). You can backtrack, but can you make it with your low health? All the way back? Well, you can try advancing into the unknown, where any reasonable dev would place a safe point near, not this one. After every boss I ALWAYS go back and safe. had to repeat many bosses because afterwards no safe point for 20 screens, and lots of fun traps.\nTO SUM IT UP: This game lacks about everything and it's "difficulty" comes from all the unfair things happening to you. You run around and remember things, you don't solve any problems, you learn to avoid them. Without a sense of direction and the really cheap story you feel lost all the time. Equipping different items to suit your style is also not feasible, cause enemies need hard counters. I bought this for 2,50 and more would be overpriced, honestly. It copies castlevania and stuff (probably for fun) but even those old games had better graphic, better music, better gameplay, better exploration and just about everything. Castle in the darkness sucks.","August 8, 2015","false","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

You should also be okay with the game killing you with "prank" deaths and insta-death cheap shots. This game is full of that sh** and it does it more and more as you get further into it.\n\nWhat do I mean by "prank" deaths and cheap shots? Here are a few examples:\n\nEarly in the game you find a Mario style pipe sticking out of the ground. There is a sign beside it that says "Stay out of the sewer pipe!" So naturally you jump into the sewer pipe. It's just a narrow tube that drops you directly onto a bed of spikes. [developertrollface.jpeg]\n\nThere is a cave in the game made of jagged grey rocks. As you're climbing a jagged upward slope, the devs put a single grey spike right in the middle of the slope, completely blended in with the rocks. What, you didn't see the deliberately camouflaged spike and accidentally touched it and insta-died? [developertrollface.jpeg]\n\nNot to mention the countless, countless, countless times that, spikes fall from the ceiling and instantly kill you. Sometimes you can see them and avoid them, if you remember to look for it, constantly, at all possible times. But also sometimes they'll just fall from beyond the top edge of the screen somewhere like the p*ssed off hand of god deciding that, no, actually, your life is over now, because f*** you that's why. [developertrollface.jpeg]\nI ultimately got too p*ssed at this game and decided not to finish it. I recommend this game because the metroidvania elements really ARE good, but the prank deaths and the meatboy bulls*** ruined it for me. But if you like that sort of thing, then you're gonna love this.\n\nFAIR WARNING, though, for people who just want the metroidvania but aren't into the uber difficult platformer fad.","October 31, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't know if the game is just coded badly or the dev used some engine that's just awful so it isn't even much of his fault / there is nothing he can do about it. So I admire his ambitions and this game would be fun and great if it worked but it doesn't. Here are some problems I have: The game tends to lock up on start so it takes me like 3 times or more in order to get it to work. I usually just start the exe inside the Steam folder because launching it straight through Steam seems to cause trouble. While it is a retro platformer it has trouble with a controller. Basically the game is NOT playable with a controller (I use an Xbox 360 controller). Saving and staring and restarting the game (if you die) takes like 10 seconds each time if you are using a controller! It's more than frustrating and maybe not even the devs fault but once again the fault of the engine he uses but lets be fair: As a gamer / customer I only care about the final result and if a game isn't playable for whatever reasons it just isn't any fun. The game also tends to SLOW DOWN like hell most of the times so it's super slow and running at like 1 FPS and lagging like hell. I've got a good enough computer to play modern titles without any problems so once again: badly coded.\nI also get annoyed by the music. It is the same song looping over and over and over again. Awful. Maybe the song later changes but in the time I've played it the song didn't change at all and I've got the feeling it won't. I also find the game to be quite hard and unfair at certain times but this might as well just be me being a bad gamer. So the biggest problem and the reason why I do NOT recommend it: With all it's bugs it's just unplayable - unfortunately. This could be a great title. I will NOT ask for a Steam refund to get my money back because 1) I want to support little indie devs 2) I hope the developer will actually work on his game and fix it (now that he got some money from it).","February 21","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

On two different machines I got the same problems. Changing the window size crashes the game. It loads up at the last windows size selected, but it's a huge pain.\n\non first load, the volume for everything is turned all the way to 00 for both music and sfx. X and C are your selection buttons for some reason, enter and esc do nothing. when I changed it to controller, it assigned BOTH jump and attack to 'button 88' which I manually changed. No big deal, but not confidence inspiring either.\n\n"partial controller support" is accurate. It works for a few minutes then completely messes up. upon getting the first power up from the first boss, holding right on the controller when you get it will cause your player to become unresponsive and ONLY go right. You then get stuck on the first obstacle you should be able to jump over.  If I have to make sure I'm not touching anything on the controller when I get a power-up or it'll break the game, I won't be playing long.\n\nI got these problems on both an intel based and amd based system, initially with an xbox controller, and after with a steam controller. both were terrible experiences.\n\nI can't recommend this game until it is actually playable for me...","November 22, 2015","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is definitely a metroidvania title. That said, I can not personally recommend it. The 8-bit artwork and animations look cheap while the story is boring and uninspired. The unique secret areas in the game are pretty much all just non-sequitor references to other games and have nothing to do with the story in Castle in the Darkness. The game is full of secrets but you will be very disappointed when you find them. While Castle in the Darkness certainly nails all the mechanics of what you would expect from a Metroidvania title- it feels like nothing more than an emulation or parody of those games.\n\nIt could have been great but ultimately falls short of expectations.","November 24, 2015","false","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some are labeled retro simply because they're 2D, even though their design and even visuals have nothing to do with older titles and probably wouldn't have been possible on the machines of the past.\n\nSome ape the forms and functions of older games in total. Castle in the Darkness is one of those, and the problem with it is that most of those games were, in fact, kinda ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEnemies with unclear hit boxes, bland color palette, small and undetailed sprites, deaths that can only be avoided by memorizing the locations of traps, bosses you can cheese by finding spots in their arenas they can't touch (but which are otherwise exercises in tedium, with tiny hitboxes you always have to jump to strike), no map and no sense of forward momentum. If you're devoted to the actuality of middling NES titles as well as the memory of them, you may find all of this charming. I found it, like the games it was attempting to evoke, a reminder of why we've left all this stuff behind, and why the very best titles like Mario and Mega Man generally didn’t have it to begin with.\n\nCastle in the Darkness would have been an okay game in the 80s, but we’re decades away from that being good enough for a commercial release.","June 3","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antroid/recommended/262960/","antroid","therealantroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antroid/","433 products in account","This game is fantastic. It has minor flaws, but those didn't stop me from 100%-ing it over the course of three days, and now I'm very much looking forward to playing the bonus stuff and NG+.\n\nBut anyway, let me detail why this game is great.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics are not just pixely, they are actually stylized very well after a real 8-bit game, which many "retro" game authors don't do. Technically I suppose there are things that a NES couldn't do in this game (some bosses are huge, sometimes there's many sprites at once, etc), but it sets the tone perfectly in my opinion. Doesn't hurt that it all looks nice by itself.\n\nThe music is great, too, not simple generic chiptune stuff, it's actually very memorable, gets stuck in your head, but doesn't detract from the gameplay, instead enhancing it by adding a lot to the atmosphere. My favorite tunes are the last area's and the cave's. And the boss music is awesome too!\n\nThe atmosphere is top notch. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but it pretends to. It has a lot of easter eggs and references, but they are somehow done very unobtrusively and I never thought that they distracted from the immersion as they often do when done hamfistedly. If you like the mood of those old castle-featuring NES games, you're gonna get that and more.\n\nThe controls are damn near flawless. Your character is pretty mobile, perfectly responsive and everything bad that happens to you is usually your fault.\n\nThe gameplay is addicting. It gets hard, very challenging in fact, but 99% of the time it's fair.\n\nThere's some exploits for the bosses making them pretty easy if you know the right spell to use (there's one that kills pretty much every boss insanely fast...), but they're still mostly pretty fun. The platforming will keep you on your toes but none of it is obloxiously hard. It's very refreshing and keeps you engaged even when you have to retrace large sections of the game with shiny new items or abilities - the enemies are much easier when you return, making it fun to slash them all apart with ease, but the platforming is still respectably dangerous but not overly specific or complex. This makes it fun to backtrack.\n\nThe layout is sort of linear, unlike a typical metroidvania: this game is sturctured more linearly, with a single linear path from start to finish and diverging dead ends with goodies (many of which you won't be able to access on your first run through the world). And there's several quick travel waypoints. This makes backtracking very manageable. I tend to dread having to comb a world of a metroidvania after getting a bunch of abilities, because it's often a chore. However, in this game you won't easily forget some random corner somewhere and forever forget to check it. It's really easy, for example, to get through almost the entire game again after you get the double jump and find all the places that were just too high. There's some unique stuff you should memorize the location of, but that's easy too. In conclusion, the exploration aspect is very light but very fun.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of secrets and all of them are really fun to discover, too. Some make you feel clever even when it's simple stuff.\n\nOverall, pretty much everything about this game is done well and it's definitely worth a playthrough or several. If I were to pick it apart and mention some flaws, I would only be able to find minor things: a few magic spells seem to be entirely useless, some equipment parts as well (over the course of the game I found like three swords while already having better ones). Some pre-boss cutscenes are unskippable. That's pretty much it.","August 28, 2015","true","16.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But it also has the poor level design (falling into an instant death spike trap as you appear onscreen), horrible repetition (playing areas over and over and building muscle memory because you died so many times), and the sloppy controls and hitboxes of many of the games it draws inspiration from.\nSome bad game design choices break the game a little bit further.  For instance, there's no way to bind a "pause" key to the controller...in fact there's no "pause" at all, you have to hold escape to quit out to the main screen.  There's also no way to change weapons or equipment without hiking back to a save point (there is a prompt to swap it out when you receive a new item, but it's tiny and if you leave the screen accidentally you miss the opportunity).\nThe graphics are pretty good, and the references to classic games and some 80's pop culture are fun, but the aggravating gameplay completely cripples what could have been an indie classic.","November 29, 2015","false","12.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That would be a mistake, because the two games have fundamentally different design philosophies. Shovel Knight aimed to emulate the games of old, but not copy them blindly; it included many modern touches that made it a stronger game overall. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Castle in the Darkness.\n\n\nSpeaking plainly, I am not certain the developers understand why some trends in gaming have died. In seeking to emulate older platformers, this game simply adopts old design ideas without much apparent thought as to what works or doesn't. It is, fundamentally, a game of trial and error. Instant death spikes run rampant, there are no health pickups whatsoever, and your character has the endurance of wet toilet paper.\n\n\nOn their own, none of those things are inherently negative, but combined they make for an experience that simply is not enjoyable. Frequent save points in another game would be an act of mercy. In Castle in the Darkness, they reek of lazy design: of the developers knowing exactly what is wrong with what makes their game difficult and not caring to fix those problems, instead using the many save points as a two-inch bandage over a gaping wound.\n\n\nTo be clear, this review isn't me going "Waah, game too hard!"... I have no issue with games choosing to be difficult. The Souls games are among my favorite in existence for a variety of reasons, difficulty curve included. I don't care about games being hard, I care about WHY they are. A well-designed difficulty curve is a fantastic thing, worth notice precisely because it is not easy to make a game that is difficult for the right reasons.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this game is one of many that don't understand what those reasons are.

You need to save to keep your progress, but a lot of the time when you back-track from somewhere that is important (like a boss fight or getting an item) to a save point you end up dying and have to do it all over again (I kept having to fight a boss because there was a spike pit that was designed for the other direction in the way, and the jump was hard to make while back-tracking).\n\nThe jumping mechanics take time to get used to (it feels like the gravity accelerates way too quickly).\n\nIt's also extremely open-ended. There was one boss I fought that needed a certain spell to be beaten or else the fight was pretty much impossible, and the spell you need to beat it is all the way back in the starting place and you need double-jump to get it (which you should already have by the time you get to this boss, but the double-jump is much later in the game than Alexandria). I also had no indication or hints to use that spell on the boss. I already had the spell by the time I got to this boss, but I didn't think to use it because there were absolutely no hints or indicators that it should be used for that boss. The only possible hint I had was that the trajectory of the spell matched up with the boss, so I used it. If somebody else didn't see that spell -- or just forgot that it was there -- they'd have to look up a walkthrough or else they couldn't progress through the game. Except not really, because all I got from the bosses was an item called White Orb that does "?????". That's what it says it does in the inventory. I still don't know what it does, so as far as I know it was a waste of time to get. You gotta love this Simon's Quest nonsense.\n\nHonestly, I'm considering not finishing the game, because at least 75% of the deaths I've racked up were from cheap level design, and you have to keep repeating the same sections of the game over and over again.\n\nIt has a lot of references to old NES games, and they all just reminded me that I could be playing a better game.","March 8, 2015","false","20.7"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

The spikes are just too much.  I get it in Super Meat Boy or 1001 Spikes, and I love those games.  Those games are **meant** to be tough platformers, and excel at that one thing.\n\nThis game, however, does a REALLY good job as being an action adventure game with tons of really great bosses, enemies, power-ups, and weapons, a large open(ish) world, with lots of secrets and exploration.  That right there would have made the game a solid 9/10.  But the spikes, man ... just too much.  The game doesn't need it at all.  I'm having such exploring and slashing away and one sloppy jump has me repeating the same areas way too many times because of insta-kill spikes.\n\nAnd that's fine.  If Kap wanted to make a tough platformer with lots of action/exploration elements, that's great, and he NAILS the action/exploration aspect of this game.  Where it fails for me, though, is the platforming/spikes/insta-kill.  It's too much for me to want to care anymore.\n\nThis is really difficult for me to give this one a thumbs down, because it does so many things just spot on.

I've played a lot of sidescroll/platformers over the years and I can say that this is not recommended until they patch the gameplay. From my perspective this feels like an easy money grab from the devs because I don't see how they would even dare release this game if they actually play tested it internally. Again, this game has potential if they fix it but in it's  current state it is a disaster.\n\nWhere to even start with this mess. The movement (jumping, moving and combat) is unacceptable quality for a game that isn't more than 50 megabytes. The acceleration is unnintuitive and the response time is poor. I have died way too many times because it's unnecessarily clunky/difficult to jump over gaps/pits when you stand still near the edge. Jumping is too fast relative to the game mechanics. I don't even know how they muck up the combat considering you can only press ONE button to attack enemies (no down/up attacks). Combat is clunky in the sense that your melee range is tiny and you can't make ANY contact with enemies after hitting them or you lose a third of your HP. You maybe have 10 pixels of safety when you got to melee enemies. Hitboxes vs bosses (I only played one mini-boss but again if they can't even get that right then the rest of the game can't be much better) are a joke. The visual animation of the sword attack doesn't reflect the hitbox either.\n\nI was pretty excited for the death traps in the game but it's not what I expected. I was expecting that I would have to be aware at all times for any signs of traps but there is simply no way to know without dying or checking a playthrough. It makes the game unnecessarily repetitve because you get punished for things that are beyond your control which is not the "frustration" i look for when playing challenging platformers. One of the big flaws that essentially killed the game for me is the forced animation you get for picking items. You are forced to jump on the spot for about 30 seconds after getting a new item and imagine having to do that every time you die (which is very often). On top of it, the devs have joke based achievements related to death count when most of your deaths are from traps that you cannot fortell or because of terrible combat.\n\nIf you liked Super Mario games, Sonic, Donkey Kong Country or Shovel Knight I would highly recommend that you don't get the game in it's current state. If the devs fix the movement and the combat I think it would be worth the 5 euros either way.","February 11, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","4"

Except for the armors that are mostly swap colors, every weapon and magic is unique (different hit box, skin and effect). You even have a weapon/armor combo that gives a pretty cool special added effect to your weapon.\n\nAlso in this game, secrets are real secrets. Don't expect a huge arrow pointing you were to look for. Some are really really really well hidden.\n\nThe OST is just great. Some themes are pretty nice.

Some references are even used in a clever way: you've got to get the reference to understand how to reach some secrets.\n\nLast point: this game as huge potential for speed running.

I lived for Megaman (3, 5 and X2 being my favorites), Ninja Gaiden, and other games people claimed were "so hard".  I might have lost my touch as I got older, but I'm so thankful that retro games like these are being made these days.\n\nCitD is not like other so-called brutal platformers I've played.  Yes, death is inevitable and often, but the level design, the solid controls, and the progression REALLY give you something to work for.

A somewhat hard action metroidvania platformer with equipable weapons and items that help you progress through the game with a ton of funny NES and SNES game references. You can tell this game was a labor of love and cater to those who grew up with aformentioned console systems.\n\nI didn't think it was overly hard, just make sure to back track once you get the double jump and you can find lots of juicy power ups.

It has earned its place in my opinion based on its design and control. However it does have certain limitations and design quirks which may bring down the experience for some.\n\nPros:- Graphically wonderful, if you can stomach 8/16 bit pixel style.\n- Audibly wonderful, if you can stomach chip tunes.\n- Controls wonderful, not as tight as I'd like.\n- Serviceable to decent level design.\n- Levels littered with little secret nuggets.\n\nCons:- Lacks controller support, even though it says it has it.\n- Full screen option doesn't work, at all. It worked once and never again, be prepared to stare at game surrounded with thick black bars.\n- Can only open inventory at save screens. It's extremely annoying and limits your ability to check your items and magic.\n- Framerate decides to kill itself for no reason at times.\n- Insta-death spikes everywhere, these will wear you out very quickly.\n- Jumping sometimes feels off and unresponsive to the button presses especially when about to jump off the last pixel of a block.\n- Visual inconsistency, some blocks that can't be broken looks like those than can.\n\nLimitations:- Bosses are damage sponges.\n- Would've loved to see a bit more originality character and enemy designs instead of rips from other games.\n- No map (Can often get confused when looking for secrets but not a turn-off without one)\n- No quick select for choosing weapons or magic at least, not a big deal.\n\nVerdict:The game is frustrating in the latter half however it is fun and enjoyable oddly enough. The frustrating is a result of a plethora of insta-death spikes especially in the final area before the true final boss fight and some trolly bits.","February 16, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

I would not recommend it if you are not liking games were you have to try hard and multiple times to succeed, but if you do love challenging games, then this game will really make you feel rewarded.\n\nYou've got a good bunch of weapons/armors/magics. Except for the armors that are mostly swap colors, every weapon and magic is unique (different hit box, skin and effect). You even have a weapon/armor combo that gives a pretty cool special added effect to your weapon.\n\nAlso in this game, secrets are real secrets. Don't expect a huge arrow pointing you were to look for. Some are really really really well hidden.\n\nThe OST is just great. Some themes are pretty nice. Only problem would be that some loop too quickly imo.\n\nThe number of references to other video games makes is really enjoyable to just progress through the game. Some references are even used in a clever way: you've got to get the reference to understand how to reach some secrets.\n\nLast point: this game as huge potential for speed running. The open world and the fact that you theoretically only need very few items to reach the end makes it a game that could be very entertaining to speed run. Add to that the way save points are working, and you've got a game that could be just amazing in speed run.\n\nIf you're into hard retro games with a lot of stuff to do and discover, I can't recommend it enough.","February 6, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good God was I wrong! This game went above and beyond my expectations, at any opportunity it got!\n\nFrom the moment the game started, I was graced with a beautifully colored cinematic, in the fashion of older games, such as "Phantasy Star". And then, seamlessly, the cinematic transferred me into a full-on "Metroid"-style open world, with vibrant colors that reminded me of the old "Megaman" and "Castlevania" titles.\n\nFrom here, I took my first steps into the kingdom of Alexandria. Where I was greeted by a child being chased by a ghoul. Upon saving the kid, I was granted some copper coins. Which were added to a coin-count at the top of the screen. This automatically registered into my brain, that there were going to be some RPG elements involved. So, I made sure to gather most every coin I could, as I walked through the kingdom, slaying minions along the way. At one point, I ran across a villager, whom told me: "Some attacks can be knocked back at enemies". Truly helpful information as, two screens later, I found myself against my first boss. A floating eyeball demon, which launched laser "O"s at me, that I had to knock back at said boss, to injure it. After the boss was defeated, I was given a "Boss Heart" heart container. Which raised my maximum HP.\n\nFour hours later, I found myself still playing, and looking forward to new areas, and amazing throwbacks to retro games from the NES & SNES era of gaming (trust me, there were a LOT of them!).\n\nNow, onto the scoring:\n\n[Graphics: 10/10]\n- Pleasing to the eye, this game is filled with smooth-flowing, colorful pixel graphics. That capture the NES era of gaming perfectly.\n\n[Sound: 9/10]\n- The music in this game is crisp and clear, not to mention: "Well composed". This game's music rivals that of "Megaman 2"'s: "Wiley's Castle".\n\n[Controls: 8/10]\n- Nearing perfection, the controls to this game are precise, yet fluid enough to keep it from feeling too stiff. Though, there are times where the jumping feels a little floaty.\n\n[Story: 9/10]\n- Being a retro-style game, there isn't too much depth to the story: "You are a Knight of the kingdom, in charge of defending the ill king, when monsters attack." Is all you get to go off of at the beginning. However, as you get deeper into the game, you'll find new aspect to the lore. Though, you'll remember the story just about as much as you do "Symphony of the Night"s lore, your first time through.\n\n[Gameplay: 10/10]\n- Have just been released, this game is extremely well polished, with very few glitches that will hinder you.\n\n[Marketing: 4/10]\n- Despite all the greatness that is in this game, it's marketing was fairly poor. As I, and all of my gaming aquaintences, had not even heard of it, until the day before its release. Perhaps this is because all the demos were only avaliable at gaming conventions, or because of there being but maybe one findable youtube ad.\n\nIn the end, this game is worth every penny! And, I highly recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it!\n\nGAME RATING: 9/10","February 8, 2015","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what can you expects from Metroidvania style? This kind of approach will have you a lot of places or rooms to explore, many secret areas to explore, finding treasures like keys or power-up, developing a gameplay mechanic with stuffs, and big-scale puzzle/quest in the game to go back and forth. Castle in the darkness able to grants you all above features and a NG+ at a really little cost.\n\nI mean, seriously, this game give you much much contents that worth more than $6 you spend ($4.97 at 17% discount at launch).\n\nSo what will you see in Castle in the darkness? This game give you a role of hero to fight his way through a lot of monsters and finding a princess. Monsters and bosses will stand in your ways guarding treasures, spells, equipments, and keys. This is like a traditional setting of adventure games which is fun and Castle in the darkness make a good job to deliver these experience of exploration to players. The first challenge this game throw at your face is 1 Atk, 1 Def, and low help. You can take damage upto 2-4 times at most so first solution to you is carefully advancing the game. Most bosses in this game have only 2-3 patterns at most, actually, once you understand their pattern, fighting monsters and bosses in this game is ridiculously easy.\n\nHowever the Castle in the darkness does not places it's essence on battling monsters, instead, developer focus on making a challenge situations that will hook player to focusing on precisive control to advance in various haphazard environment design. (Please think of games such as Super meatboy, Limbo, VVVVVV but this game isn't as extreme as those game) So after you able to equip yourself with better equipments and can take more damages you will find yourself in a more extreme situations with lots of holes and spikes, and this is the second challenges this game throw at your face (lol). After this point you may find yourself cannot handle the damage from enemy again but you should also pass several optional paths on the way, that is where the exploration begins.\n\nSo the true essence of this game lies in a combining of adventuring, finding treassures, and challenging hardship together. Eventhough this game has many things similarly to the Symphony of the nights and some other game, I think developer make a good job to make Castle in the darkness feel different and unique in it's own way.\n\nAnyway, This game is really cheap at it's full prize so you should give it a try.

For a cheap $6 gamen, I thought it was going to be either really simple or fairly short. However, I got more than I thought. This game is not only lengthy, but feature several of easter eggs and cameos from other games (such as Cave Story and even Ninja Turles believe it or not). Although the instant death traps might seem a bit unfair and there is a bit of back tracking, the game is an absoulte must have, especially for the price of it. So if you're into old school Castlevania games and was some laughs (and some frustration), I highly recommened picking it up.","February 9, 2015","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for only $5.99 USD? It's a joke, right? If you born in the 80's (1985 - 1987) and even the 90's, and you used to play Atari, Sega, NES and SNES, this game is totally for you. You'll enter in a Nostalgyfest that will make you feel again in that time. The soundtrack's just great, the game offers challenge at your own risk and some fun Secrets that can be unlocked while you play the game.\n\nI'm waiting for the DLC / Sequels / New Content or anything else.

And music that sounds a lot like Mega Man, chiptune and all. I swear it is equally good to say the Mega Man 2 or 3 soundtrack (the best in the series). And the character is actually blue as well for obvious reasons.\n\nThis has got some of the most fluid platforming in any recent 8-bit style game.  Jumping is not stiff and you can get in a great groove just jumping and killing rinse repeat. It is almost hypnotic in this game.\n\nBe prepared to die a lot. And I mean a lot. 2 hours played and already died over 100 times. But this game will not make you rage quit. Why because save points are fairly frequent. Frankly the game is almost old school NES "lite".  Maybe I just am used to how punishing old school NES games can be (Ninja Gaiden, anyone?). This game is tame compared to Mega Man.\n\nAnother great feature is that bosses are frequent and many. If you like simple boss battles you will love this. It is almost like a boss gauntlet. And there are some bosses that will seem familiar. You will know what I mean. A hero frog that uncannily seems like the one from Chrono Trigger? lol. With a slurping tongue to boot.\n\nMy only complaint is no map but this is to be expected because most 8-bit games did not have a map feature. And the levels are pretty much easy to navigate and remember. Only other complaint is back tracking seems a bit annoying I have yet to find keys for the first area and I am already way past it.\n\nThere are also many optional side areas you will miss unless you really watch for those breakable walls. There are many and they are usually noticeable. Usually you get a valuable new weapon or item out of this careful exploration. And the areas are usually a big step up in challenge for what you get out of them. They are worth exploring even if you die a lot on them.","February 9, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're into old school retro platformer/metriodvania type games then this game is up your alley. It's extremely fast pace and punishing, but its always moving forward and trying to teach you lessons that will last throughout the game. You can choose to power through the whole game and have a harder time or you can take your time and explore and find all the secrets the game has within it. The game always has a way to make yourself stronger if you're having trouble with a boss, or you can try to skill your way through it. Another great addition is the music. It fits every area and when you get into a boss fight the music gets you pumped up and excited. Overall the game is extremely enjoyable and you will love every second you're playing it.\n\nMy only issues with the game are:\n\nIt needs a map system. There are a lot of secret areas/items and when you're back tracking trying to find certain rooms its extremely easy to get lost unless you spend a lot of time searching. The game flows so fast that this issue is easily ignorable.\n\nTthe game lacks identity. It spends so much time mimicing other games that it fails to deveop into its own style. A lot of people will compare this game to X or Y and thats how you know its lacking something to make it unique. It almost made it there on its own, but it didn't make it.\n\nAt the end of the day these issues are anything but game killing. If you're wondering if you should get this game you need to go and buy it right now. You will not regret it.","February 9, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The old school influence is obvious, both in graphics/audio and gameplay.\n\nThat said, there are some issues. A lot can be written off as design decisions (like not being able to attack while moving), but the game is diffuclt, not because of how hard it is but because it lacks certain polish.\n\nMenus are slow performing and not all controls are clear (like pause as p and fullsreen as f), Attack range is shorter than it should be to start out making some easy enemies needlessly hard. Audio is hit or miss a lot of time, and starting with a default 0 level for volume leads to a bit of confusion.\n\nOverall the game gets a recommendation because it is a good game, but it could have been truly great with some polish.","February 9, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I lived for Megaman (3, 5 and X2 being my favorites), Ninja Gaiden, and other games people claimed were "so hard".  I might have lost my touch as I got older, but I'm so thankful that retro games like these are being made these days.\n\nCitD is not like other so-called brutal platformers I've played.  Yes, death is inevitable and often, but the level design, the solid controls, and the progression REALLY give you something to work for.  Not often in games like this am I really pressing myself to learn exactly how to play each room - most games never really inspire me to care enough.  This, however, has a very Nintendo feeling charm to it, and I find myself feeling like I'm playing a game like Solomon's Key, only with a really cool weapon and magic system, and one that I'm not horribly punished with having to restart the entire game every time I die.  A few times I've been frustrated, but only with myself, because I *knew* I should have charged my fireball before I ran into that room, but I charged ahead to my death despite my better judgement.\n\nThere is some backtracking, but the platforming, the soundtrack, the visuals and overall pleasant atmosphere of this game never made it feel like a chore.  I was happy to revisit previous locations, discovering new secrets using my new abilities like it was a Zelda game.\n\nSteam needs more of these, badly.

It has earned its place in my opinion based on its design and control. However it does have certain limitations and design quirks which may bring down the experience for some.\n\nPros:- Graphically wonderful, if you can stomach 8/16 bit pixel style.\n- Audibly wonderful, if you can stomach chip tunes.\n- Controls wonderful, not as tight as I'd like.\n- Serviceable to decent level design.\n- Levels littered with little secret nuggets.\n\nCons:- Lacks controller support, even though it says it has it.\n- Full screen option doesn't work, at all. It worked once and never again, be prepared to stare at game surrounded with thick black bars.\n- Can only open inventory at save screens. It's extremely annoying and limits your ability to check your items and magic.\n- Framerate decides to kill itself for no reason at times.\n- Insta-death spikes everywhere, these will wear you out very quickly.\n- Jumping sometimes feels off and unresponsive to the button presses especially when about to jump off the last pixel of a block.\n- Visual inconsistency, some blocks that can't be broken looks like those than can.\n\nLimitations:- Bosses are damage sponges.\n- Would've loved to see a bit more originality character and enemy designs instead of rips from other games.\n- No map (Can often get confused when looking for secrets but not a turn-off without one)\n- No quick select for choosing weapons or magic at least, not a big deal.\n\nVerdict:The game is frustrating in the latter half however it is fun and enjoyable oddly enough. The frustrating is a result of a plethora of insta-death spikes especially in the final area before the true final boss fight and some trolly bits.","February 16, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

I'd make this a neutral review if I could. It does have its fair share of good points - art, music and enemy design are all fantastic, weapon mechanics introduce variety with different reaches and three ranged weapons which all work differently, even if some of the swords are rather pointless - but then you have the backtracking caused by non-linear map design in terms of upgrades, even if the game itself is actually very linear where you just keep going right forever, the absence of any sort of map and the placement of warps makes it so you're constantly backtracking because everything is far away from every warp, not to mention several pixel-perfect jumps - even if some have tricks to them - or the pointlessness of your health bar for most of the game since you'll probably die in 4~6 hits from anything up until the near the end of the game and 8 magic spells where you'll get basically no use from most of them - you'll use your first one until you can get energy splash, then use that until you get gale wind then use that for the rest of the game, switching only if you beat a bonus area or when the game requires you to use summon falcon or crystal shock to kill ghosts.\n\nAlso, good job having a ice area which you'll probably complete before getting the upgrade that makes it so you stop sliding on ice, then never see ice again.","April 8, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a big name or famous in any capacity, but I do hope you'll heed the message that this game is very special and can be very fun for a certain kind of player.\n\nCastle in the Darkness is good. It has more references than you can shake a stick at that span from various iterations of Castlevania to the original Zelda for the NES, and many others that I won't get into just so you'll be pleasantly surprised when you stumble across them. That comes as the sugar coating to let you know it is also difficult, but not in the bad, frustrating kind of way that feels utterly unfair.\n\nI, personally, am not very good at games, and especially not anything of Kaizo-level proportions, but Castle in the Darkness takes a step back from some of the other kind of trial and error, die until you win situations by making the game control very well even on a keyboard (My preferred method of gaming), and the mistakes that are made never feel as if they were caused by bad design. In fact, the game is designed extremely well in order to actually make things difficult without making them too punishing.\n\nSave points start off separating every half dozen or so screens, give or take, but as the game advances they become more and more scarce and increase the level of punishment for mistakes made, which can be a bit of a drag, but again I feel the design of the game even allows the less-than-adequate among us, like myself, to come across victorious after a few tries, and completing game is definitely rewarding when you finally lean back and breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nI'm not going to be giving any kind of arbitrary scoring system, but I will say that this game is full of homages to games of the past, it is designed extremely well in a simplistic package that can be deceiving to some, and offers a great kind of sidescrolling, metroidvania experience that, for six dollars at full price, is definitely something I'm glad I picked up when I saw it.\n\nBuy, download, die repeatedly, and enjoy every second of it.","March 13, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not transcendental or genre-defining, but plays comfortably in that genre's sandbox.

There's no pause or quit-to-menu option.\n- I wouldn't mind another warp point or two.\n- Some of the platforming sections are frustratingly difficult, dancing right on that fine line between "hard" and "inducing table-flipping, controller-tossing rage."\n\nStill, the controls are perfectly tight, and succeeding at those difficult platforming sections feels GOOD.

Other people simply won’t have the patience that you need when you’re playing this game, especially if you haven’t played many platformers. This is your typical new Mario platformer. This is almost a pixelated 2-d version of dark souls.  Clearly my nearing of 600 deaths will show you that I was not prepared in many ways for this game. This however doesn’t mean it’s a terrible game.\n\nThe game starts you off with a fairly plain story. The king of the land has fallen ill, and in his weakened state monsters attack the kingdom. All the castle guards are defeated besides you! So you go off on a journey through the kingdom to save the princess and the king. Of course if you’re playing this game it isn’t for the story so it’s good enough to get you out and exploring.\n\nSo what can your little knight do? He can jump a use a sword. The first bit of the game for me was getting used to how my characters hit boxes were and how far the sword could swing out. Literally if something hits the feather of your helmet it will damage you. Throughout your adventure you will acquire new weapons, armor, and magical abilities to improve your chances of survival. 1 thing the game could have added to help would be a map. Many parts of the game require you to go back and use new abilities like double jump to find hidden areas and gain new powers. If rather few teleport areas in the game it would have been nice to have a map to make sure I was done looking everywhere rather than traversing the entire map only to find out I might have missed one turn somewhere. Without backtracking with new found abilities this game will be a lot harder than it already is.\n\nIf they were going to rename this game they should call it The castle of trial and error because that is what you will be doing most of this game. If you don’t get in the habit of saving right after you kill a boss that took you 20 deaths to beat you will find yourself facing it again if you die before the next save point. If the bosses don’t irritate you the instant deaths of spikes will. Spikes are used in this game to much for my liking. You will learn to cautiously approach every room because many deaths will result in unexpected spike deaths or not jumping the correct way, and it is because of that fact I recommend playing this with a controller. Trying to jump through death traps with the keyboard could be rather frustrating at times.\n\nThe variations of enemies is astounding in this game. You will learn how to approach all of them after a couple encounters fairly easily. Bosses require skilled timing and memorization. After realizing how to defeat a boss the pattern might seem fairly simple. If you don’t have the right weapon however the task can be very agitating. After beating bosses though you will be filled if a huge feeling of relief and you will rush cautiously back to the last save point so you don’t have to do the encounter again. The soundtrack fit the game perfectly and I wish I could enjoy it more if I wasn’t constantly hearing the small tone that plays after you die.\n\nOverall the game has a super large variety of enemies and bosses for players to face off against, there is no lack of content to be found here. The soundtrack fit this game perfectly. However lack of a map made backtracking a hassle and spikes felt slightly over used for my taste. If you’re into a nice challenging platformer then this might be what you’re looking for. If you don’t have a lot of patience, aren’t that good at platforming maybe you should pass this one up and come back to it later on.\n","May 17, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays simple enough with the 2 button control.  Attack with one button, jump with the other & you get a charge style attack that changes depending on the spell you have equipped.   It's a very good metroidvania style game.\n\nThere's a very heavy emphasis on exploration as well.  You really have no idea on where you need to go & the game gives you very little direction.  There are several places in the beginning that you can enter but if you lack a certain upgrade you won't get very far.  I found this out the hard way.\n\nYou are very weak in the beginning & will die a lot but you get health upgrades from bosses, find them in the world & can buy them from certain shops.  There are also various enemy types that will remind you of other games.  One in particular is a blue hedgehog that attacks you with a spin dash. The bosses are hard at first but they each have a set pattern that once you learn will be able to beat them easily.\n\nAs you progress through the game you'll find new armors, weapons such as stronger swords, the throwing axe & even a bow.  You can only equip one of these weapons at a time & they do replace your sword so you may need to plan ahead for each weapon.\n\nThere's also several annoying cheap deaths such as spikes falling from the ceiling in specific spots where it's like the dev was just trolling but it is kind of funny when it happens the first time.  One of which is right after a fairly hard boss next to a reward chest.  If you stand in the wrong spot while opening the chest a spike will fall down & insta-kill you.  There are many cheap deaths in this game that require precise jumping & control of your character to avoid so proceed with caution.\n\n\nOverall I haven't gotten very far in this game yet but I have seen enough that I can already recommend it.  If you want a classic NES style game & you thought Shovel Knight was too easy then you should pick this one up.  It's also good for anyone who wants a decent metroidvania style game.  Just be aware that you will die a lot when you play it.","March 5, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercilessmerc/recommended/262960/","mercilessmerc","MercilessMerc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercilessmerc/","614 products in account","Old school Castlevania-like that is fairly challenging but not overly frustrating. The game isn't very long and can probably be beaten in about 5 hours at around 50% completion rate (assuming a fair amount of deaths in the process), but the real meat of the game is trying to find all of the secrets and items to complete it 100%. There are a large number of bosses, all of them very different from each other, both in attacks and in visuals, and a good variety of common enemies as well, with only a few recolours. If you are into the idea of backtracking and finding optional areas to acquire all of the different weapons, armor and magic then this is the game for you.\n\nHowever, be forewarned that there are a few negatives. At the time of this review, there aren't any sort of resolution options besides x1, x2 or x3 scaling nor any type of borderless windowed options. While gamepads are supported, it is lacking to say the least. Initially, you'll have to turn on the ability to use the gamepad in the options menu and then rebind the attack and jump keys to be able to use it. However, there is no pause button available to be mapped to the gamepad at all, it appears you can only pause the game by clicking/alt-tabbing away from the game window. After you want to unpause the game you have to press "P" on the keyboard, which is annoying to say the least. Of course, you could bind the "P" key to your gamepad using another program, but that shouldn't be necessary. There is also no way to get back to the main menu using the gamepad, you'll have to hold the escape key for a couple seconds in order to do so. In addition to that, the music is very short and repetitive; I'd say most songs are about a minute long at most and repeat ad nauseum. The sound design isn't that great in other areas either, when you are charging your magic (which will likely be the majority of the time after you acquire it), you'll hear a constant sound which can get annoying very quickly. Thankfully there is the option to lower/mute the music or sounds in the options menu. Also be advised that this game uses a LOT of screen flashing; every time you use your magic the screen flashes white, and every time you die it will flash red. This isn't an issue for me, but it may be for some others.\n\nOverall the game has quite a bit to offer, as long as you can get over some of its shortcomings. If you are looking for a game very reminiscint of Castlevania, then you cannot go wrong picking this up. At the $5 pricepoint it is a good value proposition, and even moreso if you are looking at this during a sale.","February 6, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I have enjoyed this more than shovel knight so far but time will tell.) Controls are spot on, graphics are perfect (for an NES style game), very authentic and well-done. I don't know how long it will take me to beat it since I'm not the best player ever but it's an unusual game that is this hard and keeps my full attention. More later, in short, BUY THIS GAME if you liked Mega Man or any of those great old games from the way back then. -Josh / Space_Duck","February 6, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other people simply won’t have the patience that you need when you’re playing this game, especially if you haven’t played many platformers. This is your typical new Mario platformer. This is almost a pixelated 2-d version of dark souls.  Clearly my nearing of 600 deaths will show you that I was not prepared in many ways for this game. This however doesn’t mean it’s a terrible game.\n\nThe game starts you off with a fairly plain story. The king of the land has fallen ill, and in his weakened state monsters attack the kingdom. All the castle guards are defeated besides you! So you go off on a journey through the kingdom to save the princess and the king. Of course if you’re playing this game it isn’t for the story so it’s good enough to get you out and exploring.\n\nSo what can your little knight do? He can jump a use a sword. The first bit of the game for me was getting used to how my characters hit boxes were and how far the sword could swing out. Literally if something hits the feather of your helmet it will damage you. Throughout your adventure you will acquire new weapons, armor, and magical abilities to improve your chances of survival. 1 thing the game could have added to help would be a map. Many parts of the game require you to go back and use new abilities like double jump to find hidden areas and gain new powers. If rather few teleport areas in the game it would have been nice to have a map to make sure I was done looking everywhere rather than traversing the entire map only to find out I might have missed one turn somewhere. Without backtracking with new found abilities this game will be a lot harder than it already is.\n\nIf they were going to rename this game they should call it The castle of trial and error because that is what you will be doing most of this game. If you don’t get in the habit of saving right after you kill a boss that took you 20 deaths to beat you will find yourself facing it again if you die before the next save point. If the bosses don’t irritate you the instant deaths of spikes will. Spikes are used in this game to much for my liking. You will learn to cautiously approach every room because many deaths will result in unexpected spike deaths or not jumping the correct way, and it is because of that fact I recommend playing this with a controller. Trying to jump through death traps with the keyboard could be rather frustrating at times.\n\nThe variations of enemies is astounding in this game. You will learn how to approach all of them after a couple encounters fairly easily. Bosses require skilled timing and memorization. After realizing how to defeat a boss the pattern might seem fairly simple. If you don’t have the right weapon however the task can be very agitating. After beating bosses though you will be filled if a huge feeling of relief and you will rush cautiously back to the last save point so you don’t have to do the encounter again. The soundtrack fit the game perfectly and I wish I could enjoy it more if I wasn’t constantly hearing the small tone that plays after you die.\n\nOverall the game has a super large variety of enemies and bosses for players to face off against, there is no lack of content to be found here. The soundtrack fit this game perfectly. However lack of a map made backtracking a hassle and spikes felt slightly over used for my taste. If you’re into a nice challenging platformer then this might be what you’re looking for. If you don’t have a lot of patience, aren’t that good at platforming maybe you should pass this one up and come back to it later on.\n","May 17, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you're probably wondering is if it does these genres justice.\nThe answer is yes.\n\nThe controls take a little while to get used to, but are extremely solid and accurate. Gameplay is fairly simple, with one button to jump, one button to attack, and a charge attack you learn early-on by holding the attack button.\n\nThe game is hard, but fair. I died a couple hundred times during my 100% run, but at no point did I feel like the game was jerking me around or that there was nothing I could have done to avoid it. Most of these deaths were due to being too cautious, as the game rewards fast and confident play.\n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect, minus one high-level area you can access early if you explore a bit. The platforming puzzles start out very easy to help you get used to the controls, and slowly ramp up over the course of the game until hesitation at any time can kill you. This works because the controls are exceedingly well-refined, and the rooms are designed to clearly present their challenges as soon as you enter them. By the end of the game, you'll be flying like a pro through spike-filled deathtraps the first time you see them because the game has taught you how to play it, and has given you the ability to use your skill to the fullest.\n\nThe soundtrack is great to listen to while not being distracting, and your opinion of the visuals will depend on whether you like pixel graphics or not. Personally, I find pixel graphics to be more charming and interesting than most 3D counterparts, so this was a plus for me.\n\nBacktracking to get new and better equipment once you learn certain skills is not necessary to progress and complete the game, but it can be of immense help in the final level.\n\nOverall, this game is one of my favorite platformers, and I think it deserves to be more popular than it is.","November 19, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Built like a cross between Symphony of the Night and Super Meat Boy, Castle in the Darkness has all the sprawling levels and new gear to unlock that one expects from a Metroidvania title, while also featuring fast-paced gameplay with tons of instant death traps that at times give it more the feel of a twitch-based platformer. It's an interesting mix that mostly works great, presenting the player with a constant rising challenge as their skills improve. The weapons and magic spells all feel good to use and distinct from one another as well, encouraging you to experiment on combinations that you like.\n\nThat being said, the game can still be absolutely frustrating at times. Health-restoring save points are often more scarce than one would like, sometimes forcing you to repeatedly pass the same grueling gauntlet of instant-death spike traps just to face an exceptionally difficult boss for the umpteenth time, which feels more punishing than challenging. There are also some unfortunate design choices with regards to backtracking (which as per any Metroidvania is essential to completing the game), most notably the small number of warp points on offer, the fact that an item has to be obtained in order to use them even after they've been found, and most egregiously of all, the complete lack of a map to consult, which leads to frustrating moments of trying to remember where certain areas are.\n\nUltimately though the game still shines even despite some questionable design decisions, not the least of which is thanks to the charming graphics and catchy chiptunes that permeate the experience. It may not be the next Symphony of the Night, but Castle in the Darkness is still compelling and enjoyable, and at less than $10, the game gives you plenty for your money. If you can deal with some frustration in your Metroidvania, don't hesitate to pick it up.","March 2","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of them you only notice if you pay attention, some others are pretty obvious, but all of them made me smile.\n\nThe controls are very simple (NES like) and the gameplay is well balanced.\nThe game is fast, so maybe at first you'll have a bit of trouble getting the hang of it. Is not as slow as a classic Megaman game, for example. I died a lot of times because I got cocky and fell down on some spikes, so just try not to run like crazy on your first playthrough.\n\nOne complaint that I have is that some bosses require practice to beat (none is really hard, but they can be tricky) and since I was not able to skip some of their dialogue, I got annoyed (the dialogue is slooooow...). I hope this gets patched in the future, but other than that the game is really enjoyable (and if you're a better player than me, you wont even suffer like I did having to watch the cutscenes a thousand times).\n\nI recommend this game to any NES / Platformer / MetroidVania lover.","November 1, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you're probably wondering is if it does these genres justice.\nThe answer is yes.\n\nThe controls take a little while to get used to, but are extremely solid and accurate. Gameplay is fairly simple, with one button to jump, one button to attack, and a charge attack you learn early-on by holding the attack button.\n\nThe game is hard, but fair. I died a couple hundred times during my 100% run, but at no point did I feel like the game was jerking me around or that there was nothing I could have done to avoid it. Most of these deaths were due to being too cautious, as the game rewards fast and confident play.\n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect, minus one high-level area you can access early if you explore a bit. The platforming puzzles start out very easy to help you get used to the controls, and slowly ramp up over the course of the game until hesitation at any time can kill you. This works because the controls are exceedingly well-refined, and the rooms are designed to clearly present their challenges as soon as you enter them. By the end of the game, you'll be flying like a pro through spike-filled deathtraps the first time you see them because the game has taught you how to play it, and has given you the ability to use your skill to the fullest.\n\nThe soundtrack is great to listen to while not being distracting, and your opinion of the visuals will depend on whether you like pixel graphics or not. Personally, I find pixel graphics to be more charming and interesting than most 3D counterparts, so this was a plus for me.\n\nBacktracking to get new and better equipment once you learn certain skills is not necessary to progress and complete the game, but it can be of immense help in the final level.\n\nOverall, this game is one of my favorite platformers, and I think it deserves to be more popular than it is.","November 19, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, the term "retro" is thrown around much too often in the Steam store.  The term is sometimes used as a cover for bad graphics and simple gameplay.  Sometimes you have games that try to be "retro" but without understanding retro gaming and what made it great.  Take some sprite graphics, throw it into a half-decent platform engine, throw in some tough enemies, and whammo you have yourself a "retro" game – or do you?  Such games fail to grasp what made retro gaming great.  Difficulty was never the goal, it's more of a side effect that sometimes happens when you get the recipe right.  It takes some good level design, some unique and interesting enemies, good boss fights, and excellent controls.  Castle In The Darkness has all of these in spades.\n\nClearly the biggest influence here has been Castlevania, visually inspired by the 8bit games, controls inspired by the more fluid movements of SotN and the handheld games that succeeded it.  Even the name of the game is a nod to Castlevania.  The game is hard, yes, but fair.  The enemies are strong but consistent and predictable, you need to use reflexes but also strategy to survive.  The mood and tone of the game hits a balance somewhere between 8bit Castlevania and 8bit Link/Zelda.  The NPCs are spot-on and run the full gamut from helpful to cryptic, hilarious, or useless.  The controls are tight, the combat is fast but not frantic, the platforming skill needed is moderate for most of the game, though a few sections do require extreme precision.  You put all of this together and you have one of the most authentic retro gaming experiences on Steam right now.  You will die, you will die a lot, but you'll never get stuck for long in the same place, and when you beat that boss or hit that save point, you will feel a true sense of accomplishment that's often lacking from modern games.\n\nI think this game would have fit right in on NES or SMS and I think it would have been well received at the time by critics and gamers alike.  Back in the NES days, I would have spent $6 just to rent a game like this for two nights, so to be able to buy it for that price, I think that's a great deal.","July 27, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main character walks pretty fast so platforming can get pretty tricky.  If you are like me, the vast majority of your deaths will be spike related.  Spikes are everywhere in this game and they deal instant death.  If your fairly decent at platformers you should be able to 100% the game before killing off an entire Prinny squad.  The game does make an effort to let you know where there are breakable walls.  Also, in new game +, remember when you get new armor to equip it and then re-equip the frog suit. Oh, and the troll armor and the troll sword is the dev trolling you if you encounter these items.","November 11, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are tight and easy to get the hang of, and the gear differs well and gives the player a feeling of freedom. The frustrating back tracking, and insta-deaths, are the hardest part of the game to come to terms with, and are further compounded by the merciless death counter on the game over screen. But even with its frustrating elements, I still had a great time testing my metal in Castle in the Darkness.\n\nDeveloped by indie game designer Matt Kap, and published by Nicalis, Castle in the Darkness is an action, adventure, platformer with some RPG elements. The kingdom of Alexandria, is attacked one night by an evil sorcerer. The royal guard do their best to defend their king but are  overrun by monsters. The last remaining member of the royal guard awakens to find the kingdom under siege, and the king and princess missing.\n\nThe story while basic fits in perfectly with Castle's nostalgic 8-bit theme. Players are thrown straight into the action, and taught the basics of the controls as they traverse the first few levels. The controls are simple in their design, players jump through levels, attack enemies, and can use charged magic spells to decimate their opponents.\n\nEach level follows the same formula, platform through a series of spike filled screens, while fighting progressively harder enemies before facing off against a boss. This formula is straight out of the 8-bit play book, but where Castle in the Darkness changes things up, is in gearing up and stage secrets. Each enemy drops coins on death, which can be used to purchase new armour, spells and weapons. Also each level has a host of secret rooms and alternate paths to follow, which often lead to new gear for your character.\n\nThis gear can be changed out at each save point, and many boss battles can be near on impossible unless you have the right gear for the job. This gear system is simultaneously my favourite and most frustrating part of Castle in the Darkness. The gear is great, as it offers a feeling of progression and lets the player choose how they approach battles. Sadly however, if you decide to take the most direct path through this game, you will miss much of the equipment on offer and eventually find yourself up against bosses you can't beat.\n\nI should note, the game includes warp points to allow the player to backtrack through the game to get the gear you missed, but sadly these are few and far between. For me there is nothing more frustrating than dying repeatedly while back-tracking for gear, that you need to progress. Another little issue for me, is the rinse repeat play style it uses. Many deaths you suffer will be as you enter a new screen and have no time to react, or from enemies or level hazards that you haven't seen before. While this is a hallmark of the 8-bit era, I think it would have been more prudent to leave that play style in the past.\n\nFor my full review and other delicious content see Glitch","February 20, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know why some people think this is harder than Dark/Demon's Souls series, though. There's a bunch of little hidden secrets and nods to other indie games strewn about that makes you feel cool for finding them, or knowing what they're from. (Some are actual old NES nods, too. Like Monster Party.)\n\n100%'ing the game on the first pass only took a few hours, though your mileage may vary. There's a NG+ mode you can unlock as well, which playing through with it opens up new areas/content as well.\n\nFor only about $6 USD, you can't really go wrong with this title. highly recommend it if you are into old platforming-action adventure based games, and love finding secrets.","February 21, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what can you expects from Metroidvania style? This kind of approach will have you a lot of places or rooms to explore, many secret areas to explore, finding treasures like keys or power-up, developing a gameplay mechanic with stuffs, and big-scale puzzle/quest in the game to go back and forth. Castle in the darkness able to grants you all above features and a NG+ at a really little cost.\n\nI mean, seriously, this game give you much much contents that worth more than $6 you spend ($4.97 at 17% discount at launch).\n\nSo what will you see in Castle in the darkness? This game give you a role of hero to fight his way through a lot of monsters and finding a princess. Monsters and bosses will stand in your ways guarding treasures, spells, equipments, and keys. This is like a traditional setting of adventure games which is fun and Castle in the darkness make a good job to deliver these experience of exploration to players. The first challenge this game throw at your face is 1 Atk, 1 Def, and low help. You can take damage upto 2-4 times at most so first solution to you is carefully advancing the game. Most bosses in this game have only 2-3 patterns at most, actually, once you understand their pattern, fighting monsters and bosses in this game is ridiculously easy.\n\nHowever the Castle in the darkness does not places it's essence on battling monsters, instead, developer focus on making a challenge situations that will hook player to focusing on precisive control to advance in various haphazard environment design. (Please think of games such as Super meatboy, Limbo, VVVVVV but this game isn't as extreme as those game) So after you able to equip yourself with better equipments and can take more damages you will find yourself in a more extreme situations with lots of holes and spikes, and this is the second challenges this game throw at your face (lol). After this point you may find yourself cannot handle the damage from enemy again but you should also pass several optional paths on the way, that is where the exploration begins.\n\nSo the true essence of this game lies in a combining of adventuring, finding treassures, and challenging hardship together. Eventhough this game has many things similarly to the Symphony of the nights and some other game, I think developer make a good job to make Castle in the darkness feel different and unique in it's own way.\n\nAnyway, This game is really cheap at it's full prize so you should give it a try.

Super Metroid, for instance, is not filled with instant-death spikes in the most assholish positions with a crappy jump and a slightly slippery character. Neither is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, for that matter.\n\nNot only that, but the previous games have movement tech of some sort. Alucard could shield dash and do a wing smash while in bat form and Richter coud air slash/slide, for instance, but nothing of the sort in Castle in the Darkness. Maybe I just haven't found anything for that yet, but I doubt the game will give you anything interesting or cool like that since it seems to rely on navigating one-hit kill spikes a lot.\n\nAlso, Castle in the Darkness likes to make a lot of references to better games:\n"My name is Bagu"\n"It is dangerous to go alone"\nBlue arremers\n\nand what not,  so it ends up like a mess of bits and pieces of other games and has no spirit or character of its own.

You die more often of the sloppy control than of your skill based gameplay\n- try and error....I just hate it in this kind of game. You go one specific way and spend an hour on it, because you die so much on the way, only to find out, that you needed a key to even go that way......such a waste of time and energy\n- this is not a metrodvania. You have to backtrack, but its not in the same genre....enemies respawn, there is no map and you often go in the wrong direction the first time, where in metroidvania games you can come back to reveal a secret or an obvious new path.\n- the screen transition is so awkward. It happens instantly, leaving you right open for an enemie without any time to reorientate yourself. There are also several screens, where you push to the right and fall right into a trap or spikes, because the transition gives you no time to even see the new screen.\n- checkpoints are placed to annoy you. they are so far away at times, that you have to redo bossbattles at times.....or you must backtrack after every bossfight, which is tedious and only sucks up on your time.\n\nI got way too many good games to focus on. and Im glad Steam introduced its refund system.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacob-p/recommended/262960/","jacob-p","Jacob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacob-p/","212 products in account","This game devolves very early on into a super meat boy clone-style frustration-platformer where 100% of the challenge/difficulty comes from not dying to unforgiving instant-kill spike, falling spike and buzzsaw obstacles by flawlessly performing various jump sequences. The game is not difficult otherwise - enemies and bosses are trivially easy, in fact. They follow simplistic and predictable patterned ais and have obvious weaknesses. Most bosses can be defeated handily by jumping around haphazardly while blasting off the same single spell over and over and with regular enemies the best course of action usually is to jump over and proceed past them unharmed. When one-hit kill spike obstacles are the only real threat to the player it renders the majority of the game's already somewhat meager action-adventure-rpg elements irrelevant - it doesn't matter what armor, magic, weapon and relics you wield if the only dangerous obstacles kill you outright, regardless, whenever you don't time a jump perfectly. Buy and play it if you want finnicky platforming and nostalgia-inducing references and easter eggs. Pass on it if you want any semblance of even a vague storyline, worthwhile hidden collectibles, rpg elements that have even a modicum of depth to them, cool gameplay-altering weapons and spells, interesting characters, varied gameplay, or challenging, rewarding monster and boss encounters. Still addictive if you're a masochist but nothing like the vastly superior Cave Story.","July 23, 2015","false","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some complaints I have about it are certain aspects are a little buggy (e.g. it was very easy to get stuck inside the gears in the clock tower), and the hitboxes are quite a bit larger than the actual models. I've been hit many times when I though I wasn't close enough, and the sword reaches quite a bit farther than the animation suggests. Additionally, enemies deal a lot of damage, so it kind of makes me wonder why I have so many HP in the first place, but I guess that's also made up for with the frequent save/recovery points.\n\nTo be completely honest, I can't think of any especially good points about the game. It plays just like you'd expect any other retro platformer to play. Granted, I haven't completed the game yet, so there may be other mechanics in the game that I am not yet aware of, but it's pretty much a standard platformer.\n\nAll in all if you love platformers like I do, then go ahead, give it a try, but if you're not specifically into the retro platformer genre, then I don't see much reason to pick up this game.","July 23, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said It needs a bit more, like the controler working off the bat, more options, sound maybe (im not sure if there is sound or not but there was none for me). Who make a game without sound? Multiple resolution support? The gameplay is OK, but I feel like it is geared towards the reaction time of the younger generation (Im and old 30 year old, lol). Yes you can memorize the fights and move on (in my 1 hourish played I already killed about 8 bosses) but its more frusterating that satisfying when you are forced to memorize things by repeatedly dieing. So rather than being skill and strategy based I feel this game is reaction time based, and memorizational.\n\nAll that being said, I hope the Dev keeps at it. Even though this game is simply not one I will recommend to friends, I fell the dev will do much better on his next game, and I will glady give that a try.

Along the way he will fight tough bosses to obtain more vitality, and through secrets and NPCs he can obtain better swords, armor, and magic.  He will also obtain relics and items that bestow various powers and abilities.\n\nCastle in the Darkness is a challenging game that is not for the faint of heart.

You will die a lot, in a magnitude of hundreds, but it is all part of the experience.\n\nAs for my personal opinions on the game, I had a very enjoyable experience.  I had difficulty at times, but I never felt that the game was too difficult, that there was never any hurdle too unreasonable to pass.  The game has a wonderful NG+, that is like a whole new game, and the Secret levels were a good challenge.\nIf I have any advice for people looking to play this game, EXPLORE!  Secrets (of which there are no end to) are always rewarding, if only in humor.  Also, experiment with your magic; I coasted through many challenging fights by exploiting magic.
