The story is so well done that you cannot help but to be engrossed in it. The visuals are amazing if you like a comic books which I do!! Some games have that cheesy voice acting but this game was top notch. It had just the right amount of everything for everybody. Script, score ... the whole shabang!  INCREDIBLE!!

Last but not least the music also fits perfectly.. from the well done intro with Bigby wandering through town up to the whole game, the "Film Noir" atmosphere is present everywhere.\n\nAs in any good of these detecive/Noir stories, it get´s rather dark and the borders between good and evil are easily shifted.","February 5, 2014","true","9.4"," 376 of 406 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","376","406","0","9"

You assume the role of Bigby Wolf "The big bad wolf".  The first episode of the story has you involved in solving a murder mystery that has the appearance of leading to something much bigger.\n\nThe game follows the Telltale forumula used with their Walking Dead games.  A narrative-driven story where your decisions have some impact on the outcome of certain story elements.  One significant and welcome change that was added to The Wolf Among Us is that not only do the choices you make impact the outcome, but also WHEN you make some of the choices.  This means that you can be presented with a decision of what order to do things and the order you choose will change how the story flows.  This new feature will add some amount of replayability to the game because of the significant changes in narrative that result from the order of certain decisions.\n\nThe artwork follows a comic book style similar to Telltale's The Walking Dead games and the music is very well done and sets the tone for the game.  I also liked the feature where you unlock various "Book of Fables" entries as you play the game.  These entries will allow you to read more about the lore of the various characters and their backgrounds as they pertain to this story.\n\nI really enjoyed playing the first episode of this game and looking forward to what the future episodes will bring!","December 28, 2013","true","11.5"," 216 of 227 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","216","227","0","9"

Scroll down to see individual episode thoughts and a final conclusion.\n\nAfter Telltale’s breakout success with The Walking Dead, my expectations for whatever they chose to do next were understandably extremely high. Yet in the span of only the first episode, The Wolf Among Us has completely met and surpassed them leaving me stunned and impressed, feverishly awaiting the next installment (of which five are planned).\n\nBased on the graphic novel series Fables, The Wolf Among Us is set in a world populated by fairy tale creatures, from Snow White to Red Riding Hood and others I won’t spoil for you. Don’t think for a second that this in any way makes for a childish or overtly fantastical narrative; TWAU is a shockingly gritty, mature, and gripping piece of fiction, held together by exceptional writing and voice work. Also, fear not if you haven’t read the source material (as I haven’t); Telltale did an excellent job of establishing the rich world and lore, and you don’t need any prior knowledge to get a lot out of it.\n\nNo character falls flat, and the performances that bring them to life are simply remarkable. Not least of them is our lead, Bigsby Wolf (you can probably guess his origin), that shows one of the key areas Telltale has improved upon from previous games. The Walking Dead was Telltale’s first real attempt at providing player choice to shape the narrative, but often it didn’t feel that way, largely relegating you to an onlooker “picking the right answer” than an active participant in what was happening.\n\nTWAU changes that by letting you be the character you want to be. You can be the benevolent sheriff or a complete jerk, and it never felt as if I was being pushed toward either path, letting the story unfolded organically as I shaped Wolf to the person I wanted him to be, which makes the thought of what could unfold all the more exciting.\n\nTelltale has again gone with a stylized, cel-shaded graphics style which comes even closer to a moving comic than TWD, and the result is stunning. With excellent use of shadows and framing, this is a gorgeous homage to classic film noir (which proves a perfect match for the dark, mystery ridden narrative). The controls are largely unchanged from TWD but have been tightened up considerably and the bugs and glitches that plagued previous games all but eradicated, making this the developer’s most technically sound production yet.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us is something you absolutely need to play. The first episode is an outstanding display of just what Telltale is capable in terms of storytelling, and if future episodes follow suit this could easily be in the running for my game of the year. The only reason I would recommend waiting is because the wait for more is going to prove unbearable. In the end all I can say is they’ve left me hungry...hungry like the wolf.\n\nEpisode 2 Update\nIt's difficult to say much about EP2 without spoiling both it and the previous episode, so I will simply say it takes the story in even darker and more controversial areas than before. Telltale has further confirmed my original impression from EP1 that they have a bold vision for where they are taking the season, with numerous shocking and unrestrained moments fleshing out the characters and leaving me breathless in anticipation of EP3. I can only hope it doesn't take another four months to get here.\n\nEpisode 3 Update\nWhere the first two episodes were used to introduce us to the characters, build the world, and set the plot rolling, EP3 acts as something of a midway point both literally and figuratively. There are few if any reveals or twists on the level of prior episodes, but with how invested I am with the characters and story at this point it didn't matter that I wasn't stunned when the credits began. Each moment to moment, no matter how mundane, held my rapt attention as I eagerly ate up every line of dialog and the innumerable subtleties found in character faces and the environments that bring such depth to the narrative. While it's too early to say with certainty, if the level of quality with the final two episodes continues to increase as rapidly as it has thus far, this may very well be my game of 2014.\n\nEpisode 4 Update\nAt this point I'm so tightly wound up in what is easily Telltale's biggest masterpiece to date, that it's difficult for me to say anything more about TWAU without sounding like the the rabid fanboy I've become. As the season nears its end and all the lose threads begin to come together, the scope of Telltale's ambition and their ever expanding skill at directing that vision into an astounding experience is showing itself like never before. Even if the final episode falls completely flat, it won't change the fact that TWAU is easily one of the most amazing games to be released this year, and something that you shouldn't be ignoring. I'm going to be sad when it's over, but that doesn't diminish my irrepressible excitement to see how it ends.\n\nEpisode 5 Update And Conclusion\nWell, it's finally come to this. After months of pushed back release dates, missed timelines, and what seemed like endless waiting, The Wolf Among Us has finally seen it's last episode and cemented itself as not only the most ambitious and fully realized experience Telltale has ever made, but one of the most brilliant games of the year! EP5 incarnates everything that has been built up during past episodes, with a captivating conclusion that provides a fitting end to all that came before, while leaving room for the series to go in any number of directions with future installments.\n\nAs a whole, The Wolf Among Us is an enthralling breakthrough for Telltale and videogame storytelling as a whole. The pacing is sublime, the plot thrilling and riddled with intrigue, and the characters among the most well written and voiced I have yet to see in a game. It's shockingly brilliant in every regard and I am truly saddened that it has come to an end, for the sole reason that the wait for season 2 will feel like an eternity.\n\nTelltale has succeeded without doubt in creating a fairy tale for a modern age, one that pulls no punches and surprises with each passing moment with the lines they are willing to cross to tell the story they want, and the means they have at their disposal to do so. It's dark, violent, ugly, occasionally appalling, but more than anything an absolutely astounding achievement that should not be overlooked.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","November 17, 2013","true","8.3"," 261 of 304 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","261","304","0","1"

Yes it is better than the Walking Dead, better\nthan their new Game of Thrones (which has a lot of potential). I\ncan't call anything Telltale does a game, because tbh there is not\nmuch gameplay at all. Its mostly an interactive story. It is more\nabout chosing dialouge options and minimal investigation than\nabout ACTUAL gameplay. Which is fine, because I enjoy their\nability to tell a good story.\n\nDo not be fooled though, the game offers the illusion of choice,\nThe game will end up happening the way it is intended to no\nmatter what you chose. The only thing is you have to choose\nwhether characters live or die, or if people hate you or not. The\nChoices in TWAU are quite good, and more than once you are\ngiven the choice of more than two options of what to investigate\nor chose. Which I like.\n\nThe characters are expertly voiced and acted. The music and\nentire setting has a real Noir flair to it, which I was instantly in\nlove with. This game has a fantastic story with an intriuging world\nfull of mystery and excellent characters. Bigby Wolf the main\ncharacter you play is one of my favorite protagonists second\nonly to Geralt of Rivia.\n\nThat being said if you enjoy what Telltale does, this is its best\nwork in my opinion.

This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)\n\nFollowing the success of The Walking Dead, TellTale continues their tradition of interactive story based games with The Wolf Among Us.  Based off the Fables graphic novels, the Wolf Among us follows Bigby Wolf the newly reformed big bad wolf and appointed sheriff of Fabletown, a community within New York City that houses a plethora of washed up fable characters.  While enforcing the fabletown laws a series of events plunges Bigby into a murder investigation that involves the entire fable community where everyone is a suspect.\n\nThe interplay between the various characters is handled well with witty banter and humorous responses that take advantage of the history behind every citizen.  Compared to the Walking Dead, the story moves along at a brisk pace with significantly less time spent in conversation hub areas requiring you to exhaust every option of interaction before being allowed to progress forward.  The fantastic story is also strengthened by the clean comic book style of 1986 new york with a solid soundtrack complimenting Bigby's search for the truth.\n\nThere are occasional fighting sequences similar to Heavy Rain where Quick time events have to be completed lest Bigby take's a pounding that can have an effect on later events.  Decisions you make also feel like they have more impact on the narrative than TellTale's other titles as it does a better job of masking the transparency of keeping you to the critical path of the story.  Having a strong central objective and antagonist also makes each episode feel more cohesive than the Walking Dead.\n\nVoice acting is top notch as every snarky remark and desperate confession carries appropriate weight. Facial animations are much stronger than the Walking Dead with less rogue eyebrow movements and a stronger emphasis on subtlety.  The contrast between the idealized “happily ever after” fables and the miserable lives they're now living as supernatural beings with real world problems creates a truly engaging story.  There's something special about seeing characters like Beauty and the Beast having marital problems after a few hundred years and needing help to pay rent to maintain any grasp on the lives they once had.  While fables are generally told as children's stories they tend to be inherently dark and primal, the wolf among us isn't afraid to push further into the grit of old fables as adult themes, language and violence are common place.\n\nDialogue options are pretty satisfactory, there were only a few times I wasn't able to respond in a manner I felt would've been appropriate and piecing together evidence in a crime scene rewards the player by making relevant connections in dialogue afterward.  Each episode is generally around 2 hours in length and worth the price of admission.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us offers a much stronger interactive experience than the first season of the Walking Dead with a captivating story, engrossing characters and a much needed fix on pacing.  Bigby's investigation has plenty of twists and turns to keep players engaged in the on-goings of Fabletown with an original premise and a morally gray protagonist that allows every interaction regardless of how violent or generous to feel natural.  While it allows you tackle objectives in different ways from time to time, the story remains pretty linear without any true divergences occurring.  The overall outcomes are going to be similar regardless of what path you choose.  Still, changing the details, and Fabletown's perception of Bigby has it's own reward.  Anyone who's looking for a great story with action, humor, compassion, a talking pig and mystery should give the Wolf Among Us a try.\n\nDon't feel like reading all of this? Here's a video version:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONxbaYRhX_k\n\nPros:\n\n+ Intriguing story\n+ Paced well\n+ Great visuals & art direction.\n+ Dialogue is well written\n+ Perfect balance of humor and drama\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Linear\n- Choices don't have a major effect\n- Limited dialogue options\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","July 20, 2014","true","12.3"," 101 of 110 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","101","110","0","10"

My first real experience with any of their recent games was last summer, when I played and enjoyed the first seasdon of their vision on The Walking Dead. For the many gamers who've played either of these titles, the format of The Wolf Among Us will come as no surprise: it's an episodic adventure game based on a comics book-series. But the setting is rather different: in The Walking Dead people, be it good or bad ones, are set agaist the onslaught of a catastrophical zombie-apocalypse, which makes the player sympathize a lot (in my case anyway) with one or more of the people. The Wolf Among Us is based on the Fables comic books, a modern-day twist on several figures out of children's stories or legends who were driven from their homelands and turned to live in New York, helped by some magic called "glamours" that makes them appear in a human form.\n\nThis setting may look like less "dangerous" at the first sight, but that's actually far from the truth. What starts out as a mature version of a story using some well-known fable characters (The Bid Bad Wolf aka The Sheriff is the you one play with), rather quickly turns into a grim, gritty adventure where nothing is what it seems and dangers looms large around every corner. Fabletown turns out not to be the safe-heaven everybody hopes for, but a harsh place in the middle of a rather coldish city dominated by the impersonal lights of neon-advertisements. Just like in The Walking Dead, actual gameplay is restricted to watching cutscenes (all of them very compellingly done) and interacting with other fables and objects. There is hardly any inventory to speak of and no puzzles: the main thing to do is to react to what is being said or happens. For this several options are given, and most of the time you have to choose your reaction within a limited timespan. This is so meticiouly done, that some decisions can be taken at leisure, while others need to be done in a split-second (just like in real life, probably).\n\nGameplay-wise, the one real difference compared to other Telltale-games lies in the amount of quick action-scenes. In these, players have to react quickly by pushing an indicated button on the gamepad (which I do recommend highly for this type of games). There are quite of lot of these "events"', maybe too many to some's likings, but for me they felt perfectly integrated. This is an action-filled world after-all, where violence seems to be omnipresent. As such, this game is definitely not for children: the violence can be very brutal and up-close.\n\nAs an example of how an original story can be interactively told in a game, The Wolf Among Us succeeds magnificently. I did not feel the same amount of emotional interaction as in The Walking Dead, but the sheer tension and the detective-like feeling more than made up for that. This is another triumph for one of the best game developers currently active.\n\nGameplay: 27/30\nGraphics: 17/20 (Telltale's engine is very well suited to the film noir-feeling this game has)\nSound: 10/10 (the sound-effects and especially the music are top-notch and help so much to give the right atmosphere)\nTechnical/stability: 10/10 (smooth and stable to perfection)\nReplayability: 5/10 (when paying good attention, there is no need for a second play-through, but that's perfectly normal)\nSteam integration: 9/10 (no trading cards but in true Telltale-tradition a bunch of achievements that unlock as you progress, making it an easy-to-get 100% game)\nPersonal appreciation: 9/10\n\nOverall score: 87/100.\nWonderful game!","January 17, 2015","true","11.7"," 97 of 106 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","97","106","2","7"

Eventually, I made up my mind and purchased this game over the weekend and I do NOT regret purchasing it at all. Not played a GREAT game in years... Any of "The Walking Dead Game" fans out there will love this game since it follows the same style and it is made by the same developers I believe.\n\nThe Story was extremely interesting along with engaging, leaving you wanting more at the end of each episode due to the excellent Cliffhangers. It is a story that makes you think, even when you turn off the game and go on another game you are left thinking about it, because it is one of those games that has such an impacting and interesting story. All of the Characters were unique in their own way, there were those who you liked and there were those who you absolutely hated. Another thing I loved about this game was the amount of choices you got. If you disliked someone you could chose to act like a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them or beat the living crap out of them which is always satisfying. Unlike "The Walking Dead" where you aren't really fearing anyone, "The Wolf Among Us" has it so pretty much nearly EVERYONE fears you which I loved.\n\nAs for how the game looks, the game looks very unique and is rather cartoony/sketchy which I enjoyed very much, it gave the game a very unique look to it along with the type of colours that were used within it. The game runs very smoothly as well and I did not have any problems with it on my Computer.\n\nAs for replay value, I did go back and replay some Episodes in order to get 100% Achievements and I feel like playing through the game again but this time, acting like a jerk or choosing different routes, choosing who to beat up and who to trust etc.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about this game was that it was pretty short. There are FIVE episodes and all of them are roughly 1 Hour 30 Minutes long so I managed to complete it in roughly 6-7 hours with 100% Achievements. Hopefully if there is a Season 2 then there will be more to come (I do believe a Season 2 is being made).\n\nOverall it is just one of those games that you can't get enough of, I DO recommend buying it.","November 21, 2014","true","8.7"," 83 of 92 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","83","92","0","0"

Episode 3 now seems to focus more on time, where to go first. Playing as Bigby gets more immersive due to the higher amount of more action, choices and of course, as ruined in the art, the wolf form. While only appearing once it really does show the image of Bigby letting go. So much so I went back and replayed that final scene 2 times to reach a consensus on the ending.\n\nThough only on its first episode, I think this will turn out to be a great game/episodes/series/whatever. The games has a very intriguing story which comes from a series of comic books, the characters are well written especially Toad. The art style is the same comic book feel as Telltale's other series/things The Walking dead. One thing that is really intresting comes with that there is no moral compas character like Clementime, which leaves all descisions to be almost made without direction. This game will be just as good as TWD and I hope people play this.","October 12, 2013","true","40.3"," 92 of 115 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","92","115","0","3"

I don't think the screenshots and trailers fully do it justice. Although the color inversion shadowing looks a very strange at times.\n\n\nIf you can't stand (fairly extreme) violence and/or swearing, you might want to pass on it. Though if you tolerated The Walking Dead on this point, you'll be fine.\n\n\nA few other considerations:\n\nThe choice making in this game seems even less consequential than in The Walking Dead. This doesn't particularly bother me, but if you're expecting a branching story line, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nI think there were more QTEs (Quick Time Events) than in The Walking Dead. This doesn't bother much either. I see it as a way to make the game feel more interactive and keep the user engaged and paying attention. Works well enough for me. I'm not expecting a deep gameplay challenge with a title like this.\n\nBasically every main character is flawed somehow. Defiling your memory of beloved story book characters is part of the point here. You might not end up truly liking any of the characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/250320/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","New York City in the 1980s was a miserable place, and from the first few moments of The Wolf Among Us you can feel it. Even worse than the sticky heat of the city is the plight of the Fables, famous characters that appear in stories like Snow White or The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, exiled from their Homeland and forced to live among human "mundies". Placing storybook characters in a modern city is a neat enough premise, but it's the simple and elegant investigative storytelling that makes the five-part series a joy to explore.\n\nIt's up to you playing as Bigby Wolf to keep the Fables from being discovered, and to keep them from hurting themselves too much. The former Big Bad Wolf, Sherriff Bigby embodies the noir detective with a dark past and a heart of gold, but his character fortunately never strays too far into hard-boiled cliche. Well, he does drink quite a bit, and smokes cigarettes constantly, true to type but he's got one of the Three Pigs sleeping at his apartment, which isn't. And when the pig calls Bigby out on his lone wolf demeanor, it's extremely apt.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us is a highly cinematic point-and-click adventure that consists mostly of interactive cutscenes. When you interrogate people, you have a limited time to choose between 3 dialogue options; if you let the time run out, you stay silent and let the other character continue talking. How you go about examining crime scenes and how you treat other characters effects how the story plays out. If you threaten a character, they will remember it and treat you differently next time they see you. Sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure book.\n\nEven if you use a controller, your interface is a cursor that moves around the screen and lets you interact with people and objects, examine clues, and fight. Like everything else, the combat is cinematic. Tap a certain button or click an object in time and watch the cutscene, or get your face knocked in.\n\nAt first glance, the graphics for The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us are almost identical, but this is actually where the two games start to differentiate themselves. Telltale's The Walking Dead seems to have drawn more inspiration from the show than the comic. The slightly softer shading and muted tones make it the more 'realistic' looking of the two; while The Wolf Among Us has much heavier cel shading and highly saturated colors that make it look like a hand-drawn comic. This isn't to say that the graphics are anything short of amazing- they really capture the gritty comic book atmosphere without being overly cartoony- it looks like a living, breathing comic book. Speaking as someone who normally hates motion comics, Telltale has set a new standard for comic book adaptations.\n\nIf you're not a big reader, you won't need you to run out and read every issue of Fables you can get your hands on before playing Wolf Among Us- they make it as user friendly as possible. For the uninitiated, Telltale has included the Book of Fables- every time you come across a new character or concept, an entry is added in the Book of Fables that fills you in on their backstory in the Fables universe. Wolf Among Us has Bill Willingham's seal of approval on it to be part of the Fable's Universe. So if you're already an avid reader, there you go.\n\nFor all the Fables fans, there's obviously a lot of familiar territory here. 'Faith' is similar to the very first Fables arc where Bigby Wolf and Snow White solve Rose Red's murder- a great hard-boiled detective story where they piece together clues and interrogate fantastic characters in order to get to the bottom of a grisly mystery. Keep in mind that The Wolf Among Us takes place twenty years before the first Fables story, so all of our key players are a little rough around the edges. Snow White is only Ichabod Crane's assistant, and she isn't sure if she's cut out to be a public servant. Depending on the choices you make as Bigby, you can be gruff-but-well-meaning, or you can smash and intimidate your way through your leads, not caring where the collateral damage leads you.\n\nAs I always do with multiple choice games, I had to do two run-throughs where I take opposing paths. Each episode takes about 2-3 hours to run through, but once you take your first bite into the story, you're hooked. Episodes of The Wolf Among Us end with a 'to be continued' trailer just like The Walking Dead, and I can already see how both of my save files are playing out differently- it was like I was watching two completely different trailers. Telltale has perfected their episodic formula.\n\nThere's a lot in The Wolf Among Us for Fables fans to get excited about. And if you're new to the series, it's just as good an introduction as reading the first tradeback. I enjoyed the game so much that I did two run-throughs one after another. Either way, play The Wolf Among Us. You won't regret it.","April 22","true","54.3"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","0"

Without spoiling, it's some kind of mix between Harry Potter, fairy tails, and a film noir.\nI found the story amazing, and I'm glad I bought the game late enough to play all episodes in a row at once ! (I finished the game in barely 3 days).\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is the exact same as the other Telltale games I had played (TWD S1&2). It just worked a bit better here, since this game is more based on investigation than TWD, and it really fits with the point and click aspect. The combats, dialogues, and investigation are still great, but once again, the choices you have to make don't have a real inpact on the story... whatever you choose, the main story elements will stay the same.\n\nPerformance\nRuns ok on my 4 yo laptop, even on high settings.\n\nStyle / Graphics\nOnce again, it's the exact same thing as what I was used before with the developer. I love it, it looks like an interactive comic or something.\n\nReally one of the best single player game I've played, and the best narrative one for sure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elderven/recommended/250320/","elderven","ElderVen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elderven/","184 products in account","Do you like comics? Do you like a good story and gameplay? Do you enjoy great acting?\n\nWell good. You chose right, then.\n\nI'm not ashamed to admit that I'm not a fan of The Walking Dead. I hate it. Zombies just are not interesting, nor are the characters in it. This is absolutely not TWD, but something that can be enjoyed by a simple lover of the cinema. One of the genius things that Telltale seems to do with these games is create a beautiful, full movie that you can interact with, with generally minimalistic animation. They tend to not even use mocap, as far as I know. But, somehow, they can create fully realized characters on your screen.\n\nPlaying as Bigby Wolf in this film-noire-esque game was an absolute delight. You could choose to live up to the name "The Big Bad Wolf," or toss it out the window and prove that you're "not as bad as everyone says you are."\n\n\nGraphicsThe first thing you'll notice going into this game is the "cell-shaded" models and hard-outlined background and textures.  This design choice serves to put you into the genre. The story of "The Wolf Among Us" is a prequel to the comic book series "Fables" by author Bill Whittingham. Even if - especially if - you've not read Fables, this game is still a wonderful ride. Any lover of the graphic novel medium will be sure to appreciate the art and design direction, and the wonderfully crafted comic-book characters. Bigby Wolf can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sure, and he tends to do so, but he can also be a tender sweetheart, just following what he thinks is right. I'm also not ashamed to admit I chose whatever option would please Snow. What can I say? I'm a hopeless romatic. Anyway, if you're a fan of comics, you're a fan of The Wolf Among Us.\n\nGameplay and ChoicesYou may have heard that this game, and other Telltale Games, use QTEs (Quicktime Events) to put you into the action. While the usage of QTEs can upset most people, because it seems like a needless difficulty meter for a game that doesn't need it; I truly appreciated the use of QTEs in TWAU (The Wolf Among Us). The Quicktime Events were NOT overused, nor were they needlessly difficult. I felt as though they DID put me further into the story - which, by the way, was wonderful. The rest of the gameplay is based on making, generally, one of four choices, each with it's own tone and consequences to your relationships with the characters: Your choices DO matter, though not always in the way you expect. You will often be presented with two or three very clearly important choices, and those have immediate consequences. Sometimes, it may result in the death of another, or the hatred of a friend. Your choices put you further into the role of Bigby Wolf.\n\nActingThe acting in this game is oddly phenomenal. As an actor myself, and simply as a person who observes things, you can tell within the first few minutes that each character has a personality both vocally and visually. They move differently, speak differently, and express differently. Bigby Wolf and Snow White, being the most notable ones, have great voice actors and facial expressions as you progress through the increasingly dramatic twists and turns. I highly recommend you see for youself.\n\nStoryThe story of TWAU is set before the story of the Fables comic series. The Adversary, a villain with only a name, has driven the Fables out of the Homeland and in the world of the mundanes, or normal people. They create a town, funded by a murderer, and attempt to make sense of their new lives in the mundane world. Fabletown is set in New York, and takes on a film noir style tone and setting. The law in the town is in disarray - people who need help aren't getting it, and people who get it aren't needing it. With Assistant Deputy Snow White, and Sherrif Bigby Wolf being the only truly active members of the city, not much gets done, and its citizens are growing ever in debt. Fables have to keep up a magic spell, known as a glamour, to remain to be seen as human (those who don't look human already, that is). Those who can't afford a glamour are sent to the farm, where the animal-like Fables see it as a prison, and the humans see it as a vacation home. With the increasing conflict between Fables classes, money issues, and lawmaking, it's not wonder that a single spark can set the entire feigned peace of the town ablaze. Take control of the story, and make it your own, as The Big Bad Wolf.\n\nConclusionOverall, this game was a masterpiece. Sure, it wasn't an original IP, as are most Telltale Games, but it was a worthy expansion to the Fables universe and a wonderful standalone story. I sincerely hope you consider buying and playing this game, and I hope Telltale creates a Season Two. Now, if you excuse me, I'll be purchasing the new Wolf Among Us graphic novels and single-issue comics, as well as reading the entirety of "Fables" and "Fairest!"  10/10. Peace.\n\n\n\n","December 14, 2015","true","33.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

The game-play is similar to The Walking Dead - mostly story with the odd QTE.  There isn’t much to do, really, and the focus is very much on watching the story unfold. Of course you influence the story, but at the moment it's difficult to say by how much. Only the first of five episodes has been released.\nI’m not sure that releasing a game in small sections is a good idea. Well, it might be for the game producers, but the first section is really short - only a few hours of play, which really is a little disappointing. In future I might consider waiting to buy games like this when all the sections have been released. Recommended? Yes, most certainly!

The final episode is out now and it's time to review the whole package.\n\nYou're playing as the Big Bad Wolf. You are the sheriff of Fabletown and you have sworn to protect the city and the Mundane people (normal humans citizens) from the Fables. You have to make sure Fables wear glamour (basically a disguise) to make them look human.\n\nYou are investigating a series of murders throughout the five episodes and it gets more and more interesting along the way. You meet a lot of famous Fables during the episodes like Bloody Mary, Beauty and Beast and the crooked man. There is many more as well and in the main menu you can read up on some backstory, which is really helpful if you're new into the fables and the characters.\n\nEven if you haven't read Bill Willingham's comic book series, called Fables, you will still understand the story. However it's certainly good if you have some knowledge of Fables like Big Bad Wolf before going into this. The story about the Big Bad Wolf, the red riding hood and the three little pigs is a common tale at least here in Sweden.\n\nTelltale have changed the quicktime events around from The Walking Dead and added some new features. The Wolf Amoung Us is nothing like the Walking Dead except for the fact that it is a point and click game. It tells a more gritty and dark story then the walking dead and the graphic style is different. It's different in a good way.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us have a fairly cheap price tag for quite many hours of enjoyment. The voice acting is really good and so is the look and the feel of the game. A very solid game that I would recommend to anyone that's looking for a great story and for fans of point and click games in general.","July 10, 2014","true","16.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","2"

Will definitely continue to update the review until I feel like I finally have enough to have a bigger picture of the whole game.\n\nIn light of Episode Two's release, I am willing to upgrade my review to a recommendation, but only just barely. The release was delayed for a much greater amount of time than most players had anticipated (about four months), and all of the admittedly minor problems of the previous episode and the more pressing problems of the game's episodic structure as a whole still stand.\n\nEpisode Two is just about as short as the first episode (around an hour and a half average), and this is furthered by the fact that it lacks many of the features that the first brought to the table. There is no story branching to be found here, no particularly challenging puzzles, and very few QTE-driven action sequences. While this may seem like negative criticism, it really does actually help to drive home the focus on the game's story, which very much starts to heat up here.\n\nThe episodic structure of the game is still a mark against it, especially considering that now Telltale have not only released development of this game alongside The Walking Dead 2, but have begun work on two completely new games based on the Borderlands and Game of Thrones IPs. It feels like they may have bitten off a bit more than they can chew, and it shows at points in the game. Some scenes for example that you may have seen at the end of the first episode's preview section will turn up in the second, though even though the dialogue will be the same, the location of the scene will be completely different.\n\nAll in all the game is a very good dialogue-based Adventure game, albeit one with a rather questionable development model. It is worth picking up, but if you can borrow it off your friends or play it off someone else's box, that would probably be the better choice. Logically speaking, it would still be best to wait until the full game is released, but I do feel that there should be enough here to justify a purchase, even if only just so. My issues with the game's release model and its developers do not detract from the fact that this game is defintely worth playing, whether or not it is worth actually buying.","December 1, 2013","true","17.4"," 107 of 176 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","107","176","0","3"

Should I say it's enchanting? Is it magical? Is it mysterious? To all those questions I would say: yes, it is. But it's so much more than that.\n\nOnce Upon a Time\n\nThe Wolf Among Us tells the story of Bigby Wolf, once the big bad wolf from fables long lost in history and now the Sheriff of Fabletown, a group of (dis)enfranchised fables from all sorts of folklores and fairy tales (like up to Norse mythology and horror stories). The stories that go across Fabletown are not of the 'happily ever after' form, though. Many fables are either in debt, or crossed the wrong shady figures. The ones that do well are either blind and ignorant for the lower fables' troubles, or have their own separate shady agendas.\n\nThere Lived a Wolf\n\nIn this small community hidden in New York by a magical barrier and the use of 'glamours' (magic used to change one's identity into someone else in terms of appearance), Bigby must solve a crime that will soon make his mind churn like never before. You will have to make decisions that leave you unsettled or thinking for a long time. You might make choices you come to regret later.\nAll in Telltale's fashion of their amazing episodic stories of course.\n\nWho Ruled The Land\n\nFrom slapping people, to doing a bit more than slapping, or choosing to intimidate people by wrecking in general or to make them see reason by being reasonable, everything will have an effect in the end.\n\nWill you be a bad wolf and strike fear into the heart of Fabletown? Or will you come to terms with your past and become the protector of Fabletown, being loved by the community?\n\nThe choice is yours, so make it count.\n\n\n\nWant to have a general impression in terms of actual gameplay of The Wolf Among Us before you buy it? Or do you want to watch a full playthrough of the game to see different choices, outcomes and reactions to them?\n\nCheck out a full playlist I did with my partner Wessel on our YouTube channel for Otter & Weasel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLezRH4vOzOnj-Di3LHjbevoba04A_ea2J","July 10, 2014","true","24.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I don't think it's quite as good as that, but it's still a fun and engrossing story.  Filled with great characters and memorable set pieces, I definitely give this a thumbs up.\n\nBut it seems there are a million reviews all stating how great the story is an everything, so I'm going to nitpick a few things that will hopefully prove more informative.\n\nI  would call this a choose your own adventure game opposed to a point and click game.  You basically enjoy the story and make decisions along the way.  Each chapter has one or two "action" set pieces that consist of QTEs that I'm not even sure if you can fail.  The decisions are important though.  Some are clearly favored to one perspective while others are more ambiguous as to their outcome.  Yet others are just "eff you, I'm the Big Bad Wolf."  Some decisions will lock you out of entire areas to investigate.  There is an inventory, yet it's pointless, you never have to combine items or use the right item on the right background object.  There really aren't any puzzles to solve.  So like I said, it's more a book than a game, even though it's a damn fine one at that.\n\nI also didn't feel like the story lived up to the conclusion of the first episode.  The rest of the episodes are good, but they never reach that "holy s--t!!" moment at the end of the episode one.  The season does end with a rather spectacular action sequence, but then the ensuing conversations and final decision kind of drag on, losing that intensity.\n\nBut again, just nitpicking.  You should definitely check it out for yourself.","August 12, 2014","true","10.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The premise sounded interesting, but not enough to play immediately. Now that the first (and probably only) season is over, I decided to try it and discovered a very polished experience, more personal and gritty than The Walking Dead, and also more engaging.\n\nArt direction is simply astounding. The graphics are superb, quality-wise. Even if you don't like cel shading you have to admit the devs did a very good job, and the comic book-like drawings set the atmosphere delightfully. Sounds and music are also top-notch. The lip-sync is perfect and the voice acting professionally convincing.\n\nGameplay-wise, the experience is immersing and compelling. I did not encounter a single glitch, lag or bug. The controls are simple and work fine, even though I would prefer to use E instead of Q for the action sequence QTEs. Divided by episodes and chapters, it can adapt to long play sessions as well as 15-minute rounds.\n\nWhere this game really shines is, of course, the story. Drawing inspiration, direction and lore from the original books, there's much more to be seen that can be noticed at first sight. This provides a wholesome world with fleshed-out, mature characters and an interesting background, connecting seamlessly to the parent storyline. Be not mistaken, this drama is not for children. Also, be prepared for a shocking shift in the way you'll forever look at your classic fairytale characters. Many of them are here, and there's no "happily ever after". Illegal drugs and magic, prostitution, exploitation, murder and a very important dose of gore and violence populate this game/visual novel/point-and-click RPG-ish adventure. If you're into dark fantasy, rough drama and noir mystery-solving detective stories, this might be right up your alley.\n\nTell Tale Games at it's finest, and another very nice gaming experience. This game was met with universal acclaim and there's a reason for that.\n\nHighly Recommended.\n","January 20, 2015","true","7.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The game picked quite a few interesting characters from stories we might have heard when we were younger. As someone who never read any of the comics it was interesting to see the end, however I can't tell how close the game was to the comic books.\n\nYou can tell that something odd is happening in this town and it does not take you much time to find that there might be more corruption and dirty secrets that you would have imagined. Another point that can help you getting into the game's mood is the soundtrack of The Wolf Among Us. As soon you start each episode you can listen something that really merge the story and the music into one form making a great combination and by having this tune right at the start of each episode really helped me getting in the mood, just like the lights from Fabletown did, as odd it may seem.\n\nIf any of you like to combine certain games with certain times of a day or seasons than I must say that, while I finished this game with a sunny weather this is a game to be played in the cold winter after a long day with some warm coffee or tea on your side. To me, there are outside conditions that can affect how immerse a game can be and playing a game on Summer is really different than playing on Autumn or Winter. But this is just a side note. I recommend this game to anyone who may enjoy the usual Telltale game or even for a light gamer with low experience in gaming mechanics who is just looking for an interesting story with some plot twists as well. It took me around 9 hours to finish the game without going back to get all the Book of Fable entries in episode 3, 4 and 5 and my best time with the game was during the very first episode and the last one.","August 17, 2014","true","9.2"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","2"

And no, not because I pretend to be a wolf myself too. And you may say it would be boring to play the detective when we see enough of that on TV. But eventually you want to know everything about the bad guys that hurt you, and you have the company of nice female characters who help you with your investigation and whom you can befriend. Gotta say, the latter kept me liking the game even more. :)\n\nThe story combines the world of fables with the all the good and bad things of the real world in an interesting way, I'm really I'm impressed, especially after finding out I could be the Big Bad Wolf, and I would meet Snow White, Beauty, Little Mermaid, The Woodsman, and other interesting characters.\n\nCharacter development\nYes, you can influence the game a lot, how you treat others and how they'll treat you, your actions will have an effect over the continuation of the story. Obviously, that system cannot be perfect, otherwise the number of possible outcomes would lead to a combinatorical explosion. But luckily they put in just enough choices and consquences that will keep the game interesting.\n\nBecause you usually have 4 choices to pick from, the game feels like the quiz show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" but without the aids and I think you'll lose more money than you started with. :) Nevertheless, I like that sometimes I  have to think about what to do next.\n\nGraphics\nThe worst part of the game to be honest, but it would be very bad to judge a game just by its graphics. After all, in the end what matters is if you enjoyed it or not. And at least, less powerful computers can cope with the game. To describe it in short, the foreground objects and people have detailed graphics, while the backgrounds are mostly dull and boring. This cartoonish appearance is still good enough for my taste, although I can understand some people just won't like it no matter what you say to them.\n\nMusic\nI'm not a guy who puts much effort in paying attention to details, but I think the music of the game is fine. It's not bad, but not super good either. I play the game for the story, and all the music has to do is accompany it by blending in well to the game. And there I saw no error.\n\nGame Controls\nThe game can be paused by pressing Space anytime, which is a lot of help coz you aren't given much time to decide on your next action. Which is bad because very often I have this problem that I haven't finished hearing the conversation (or reading it for that matter), and I already have to click. And if I don't the game usually picks silence (not responding anything), which is often not what I want. And if you screw up, at least you can restart from the last checkpoint. That doesn't help much though if you are forced to listen over the same conversation in full length. You can't just quickly skip sentences like in ME3. Too bad, but I can live with it. A few times I picked up more information that way, which felt rewarding.\n\nSummary\nIf you feel like a wolf, and you want to play a casual game, that you can pause any time you want, that you can stop anytime you want (it is preferred to wait for checkpoints though), you just want to be part of a story, relive the fables to some extent, and you just want some adventure with some action in it, without too many and too hard puzzles to solve, then you will enjoy this one. Sure, the artwork could have been better, but the game is cheap enough to counter that disadvantage.\n\nI enjoyed the game a lot and I will finish it. I might even replay it to act differently and see what happens.","June 27, 2015","true","21.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Your choices matter and will change and define the story you experience.\nPurchase "The Wolf Among Us":\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/250320/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nWhen it comes to quality story gameplay, you can't go wrong with Telltale Games. and "The Wolf Among Us" is no surprise to be one of the best story driven games on the market.\n\nThe game takes place in Fabletown, New York, after all the fairy tales' characters had escaped the woodlands to live a modern life, leaving everything behind. You play as Sheriff Wolf Bigby, who was in the past the Big Bad Wolf from the Little Red Riding Hood story. Throughout the story you'll investigate the story of the Murder of two Prostitues -  Holly the troll and Faith (A.K.A Donkeyskin).\n\nAtmosphere\nThe game's atmosphere is amazing. there's always this noir feeling to it and you just want to keep playing for "just 10 more minutes".\n\nStory\nThe game sucks you into it's amazing atmosphere and story. It'll question your moralities and decision making abillities. You will have the option to play as the vicious bad cop, or be kind (each is satisfying on its own). You will get emotional.\nWhether it's the brilliant voice acting, the absolutely AMAZING writing or the fantastic story, this game is not one you will forget after you're done playing it.\n\nGraphics\nSimple, yet sophisticated. Cartoon-ish, which fits the game perfectly since the game's about fairy tales and stories.\nNot many graphic options, but it doesn't really matter in this game, where the main focus is on the story telling abillity.\n\nFinal Score - 10/10\nThis game left an impact on me. the kind of impact that, once you finished the game, you know there isn't any game like that, and you wish you could play it for the first time again.\ni hope Telltale will give us a  2nd season of this marvelous game.\nBuy it now!","April 26","true","9.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","5"

A world where pigs can smoke, and the wolf hunts the Huntsman. Based on the Fables comic books, the game depicts a series of crimes committed in Fabletown, which you, as sheriff Bigby aka The Big Bad Wolf must solve. The story is just great, intriguing and with a lot of twists, there is no doubt about it, and the fact that you're to choose what and when happens just makes it greater, even if this does not apply for all choices made during the game. The voice acting is marvelous and the artwork is spectacular. The facial expressions are also much more realistic than in TWD or any other Telltale game so far.\n\nEven in a positive review, I usually try to cover also the negative sides of a game, but this time Telltale guys gave me no chance for it. There is nothing i didn't like, nothing that didn't feel appropriate, not a single aspect i could complain with.

Gameplay is what you'd expect from a Telltale game, so not many complaints there. All I can say negative about it is the fact sometime there are a few visual glitches that can detract from the overall gaming experience, although if you save and quit those usually disappear.

The Wolf Among Us continues that trend as it opens up the world of Fables, an 'adult' take on Grimm Fairy Tales that were watered down by Disney over the years.\nIt's based on the Graphic Novel series and is set before the series starts, so it doesn't 'spoil' anything if you want to get into the comics long term (which are due to end issue #150 - the end of 2014).\n\nIt tells the story of Snow White and the Big Bad Wolf as they try to live and blend into the normal (Mundy) world of New York. They do this within their gated community, and glamour spells to make them appear as human as possible. It's an interesting take on what for most will be familiar characters, backstories and interactions with each other and the game does a good job of creating a sense of realism to this strange fantasy world.\nIt's dark, gritty and sleazy.\n\nThe game is mainly a based around a 'Point and Click' style world, with a few Quick Time Events thrown in. However, don't let that put you off the game as the QTE work well within the context of the game, and can add a real sense of suspension and tension to a situation.\nThe PnC elements work well within the detective/crime solving nature of the game too, as you play as Detective Bigby (Big Bad Wolf) as he tries to solve the issues of Fabletown before they spill out into the real world.\n\nThere are a few minor issues that are perhaps starting to become Telltake trademarks in their own right regarding save and choice strings becoming corrupt. However these are for the most part rare, and can sometimes strangely be solved by simply restarting the game.\n\nIn short; I enjoyed this game, even if it is little more than an interactive story. The characters and writing is strong enough to carry that interaction, and the presentation of the game world draws you in and makes you feel like your choices matter in the long term.","July 17, 2014","true","8.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","4"

The two games, structurally and mechanically, are basically identical - the gameplay is primarily dialog-driven with a few action scenes thrown in occasionally. The only small difference is that there are absolutely no 'traditional' adventure-game puzzle solving bits to be found here - this is purely an interactive "choose your own adventure" story, basically.\n\nThe game is an adaptation of a graphic novel series about fable characters that live hidden in our world. I didn't know anything about the source material going in and I enjoyed it a lot, so knowing any of the background is clearly not a pre-requisite to playing or enjoying this game. You play as Bigby Wolf (a.k.a. the "Big Bad Wolf"), the sheriff of Fabletown. The main storyline has you investigating a murder, and without spoiling anything, let's just say you encounter a variety of interesting characters and places along the way. It's a fun ride. The game is split into 5 episodes, all of which have now been released. The first episode does a great job of setting the stage, and although the following episodes vary in intensity and quality, overall everything is pretty good, and the story concludes in a satisfying way.\n\nOn the technical side, the graphics and voice acting are outstanding. I ran into one bug near the end of the last episode, but reloading from a previous checkpoint fixed the problem. Hopefully this will be patched soon. Other than that, I had no other issues.\n\nThis is a must-play if you enjoyed The Walking Dead adventure game, even if you don't know anything about the comics. If you didn't play The Walking Dead but have an interest in adventure/story games, you may like this (though I would suggest perhaps trying TWD first, just to be sure). Overall, as a fan of both Telltale games and the genre as a whole, I really enjoyed this, and hope the series continues.","July 13, 2014","true","8.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

So, is the third time still the charme?\n\nYou play as Bigby "Big Bad" Wolf, the sheriff of a New York district housing fable creatures exiled from their realm. Anyone even vaguely familiar with DCs Vertigo imprint (which publishes the Fables series this game is based upon) will feel at home, right down to the font of the subtitles. The basic theme is essential Vertigo, in that myths clash with gritty realism and vice versa. Although in this case, the normal world doesn't intrude much upon the Fables cosmos.\n\nTo disguise themselves from the humans, the fable creatures use a glamour spell. The deceptive nature of these glamours fits well with the unfolding detective story; unfortunately, the gameplay does not so much. Even more so than in TWD, it is about multiple-choice dialogues and the occasional QTE-driven action scene.\nThere are absolutely no puzzles or riddles whatsoever to be found in this point & click adventure game about a detective trying to solve a murder mystery. So, if this sentence sounds wrong to you, you may have a problem with fully enjoying this game. For me it took away much of the tension: I didn't care much about missing clues, since there really weren't any to be missed; I didn't care too much about my decisions either, since I felt more like a spectator than the driving force.\n\nYet TWAO is far from being a bad game. It is well written, with a mature and intelligent story, interesting characters, great looking visuals, good voice acting and musical score. It's just missing that certain edge. It's got character and charme, but also lots of glamour.","December 29, 2014","true","12.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Characters are based off of fairy tales, but each has its own unique 'humanised' personality complementing their fantasy persona. This adds depth to each character, allows for some creative (and sometimes unexpected) scenes that also has the benefit of adding greater weight to your decisions. The consequences of your decisions remains an important feaure of WAU & you will also find at several points you can only choose one location (out of several) to explore, each giving you a different clue or story arc to experience each time. It was also really interesting to see where the journey would take you, as you try to solve the mystery progressing through the episodes; Well written story!\n\nI can certainly say that after playing WAU, you will never look at your childhood fairy tale characters the same again! :)\n\nQuality of the animations, voice acting, art direction (including the colour palette choices) & camera work really come together to create a unique experience that immerses you into the gritty & violent world that's been created. I was somewhat hesitant to get this one after Walking Dead S1 (even though WD would have to be my GoTY for 2012), as I wasn't sure if Telltale could pull off another classic, or perhaps more to the point, if really the main reason I liked WD was simply the genre & being a fan of the TV Show. Turns out I was wrong! I could even argue WAU is a better game overall, only really lacking to a degree on the emotional impact that made WD a game I still remember so vividly to this day.\n\nThe story is more complex than found in WD, littered with clues along the way & subtilties in much of the dialog. This did make it more difficult to follow when having to wait a couple months between episodes, but now with full release it would not be an issue.\n\nAlthough the voice acting is excellent, I did think that some of the dialog was lacking. Some scenes just seemed to boil down to a heated swearing-fest exchange of 'effin this and effin that'! Not that I am offended by such things, but gets a little repetative & some better work could have been done to use such words more for emphasis, than all over the place. Most of the dialog was good, mind you, but parts seemed a little average. Perhaps the comics are also like that, I don't effin know! :)\n\nCertainly not a story to share with your kids; it is disturbing at times, often sinister, with some very dislikable (yet utterly memorable) personalities. That includes (at times) the infamous Bigby 'Big Bad Wolf' Wolf, who you play as!\n\nNow with a few of these interactive adventures under their belt, Telltale have proven they can replicate the experience & even improve on the core design! Great story telling, great experience & overall another quality production that is hard to fault.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","July 24, 2014","true","11.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","6"

I love the story (even there are many sad parts, hard fights, cruel things, nothing what never was be done before but it has its own style and feels unique with the many fairy tails and the many strings). You dont play much, the investigations are not much, the choice are rarely and change only less, sure there could be more ways, more things to change, more ways to answer questions in details but its fine, its hard enough to choice between 4 choices or even 2 (who you run behind, who you capture and such things). In the whole game are hard decissions to make like in Walking Dead 1 & 2 and you dont want it and dont want the time runs down for chosing 1 of 2 or more dilemma wrong possible ways. Good thats  all only a game, but represent the whole crime injustice world so well. Its hard to find the truth, if it exist, to do the right things and not make a mistake or wrong choice only because the evidence are not there or exist or are manipulated, not let someone free who order kills or kill/imprison someone who doesnt  anything. There are to many that are free that make with her dangers further that already had to be stop and others are for the mistakes of others unfree. Hard harder i dont want be sheriff. So many lovely characters, nice design of places.\n\nOnly thinks i dont like is the game is for me to short even 8 hours is nothing much, i had fun, it has quality but if someone is good it cant be long enough. Some people are getting most time over. So its damn it hasnt even more to play or get The Wolf Among Us 2 released yet (sure you never can be sure something goes good further). What i miss too is the TRADING CARDS, buts its only a little weakness. I would love if TELLTALE GAMES would get GERMAN subtitles.\n\nThanks the big atmosphere, great people, you think everyone could behind all of that and all are mysterious things doing i give this game because i love fairy tails 97 %. If the game would be 10 hours long, Faith would´nt be dead, german language support and it would has trading cards i would give the game even 98-99 % PERSONALY. Its my own opinion, so choice yourself and look  Lets play, show a trailer, play it at a friend or some hours of family sharing and then decide if you want support the developers or not. I am  happy to support this game with that money i choose what you think it is worth, how many you would want have if its your and other work and buy it or not. Thank you for reading/ your time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deisophia/recommended/250320/","deisophia","Deisophia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deisophia/","324 products in account","Telltale Games have managed to produce another cleverly crafted game adaptation from a comic book franchise. Running on from their success with The Walking Dead Season 1, The Wolf Among Us us based upon Vertigo's Fables comic book series wherein Fairy Tale characters live amongst the normal "mundane" people of New York City in a small gated community. Like the comic books, The Wolf Among Us, attempts to recreate the historical 'Grimm' aspect of such tales, and intentionally un-Disneyfy them. At the same time as it does this The Wolf Among Us re-establishes the relevancy of Fairy Tales in the modern era much like the comic book series managed to do, creating cautionary tales instead of feel-good stories.\n\nAlthough the game stays true to the ethos of the comic books, it suffers slightly from the theme of detective noir it initially represented itself to be. The game combines elements of point and click exploration with QTE's and dialogue choice. It's a mixture that should lend itself well to an investigative game, but the lack of environment interaction leads to it not really feeling like an investigative piece (It's less CSI and more  Criminal Minds), instead the investigation occurs through half-truths lies, intimidation and coercion that Bigsby employs to garner information from residents of Fabletown. This creates a quandary as very little information is ever given to the player, leaving you feeling fairly lost in the investigative process, and being pointed in directions by other characters, who may or may not be telling the truth. It's a great technique for creating an aura of suspense and mystery but fell a bit flat when episodes are released two months apart which negated the suspense. (In other words I recommend a play-through now when all episodes are available).  It also negated the creation of plot-based assumptions by the player which it could then overturn at a later phase, i.e. no ability to create a plot twist but this proved to be unnecessary anyway as information was still being revealed right up until the end of the game.\nThe game does an excellent job at overturning character stereotypes based on traditional fairy tale roles, instead encouraging us to understand the characters portrayed and not to judge based purely upon existing prejudices. The morality choice is again present as in The Walking Dead and can be a way to encourage aforementioned stereotyping intially only later overturning the player's prejudices through further interactions. It is this ability to challenge existing concepts and ways of interaction that makes this game a "mature" game, regardless of adult-themed content. The characters themselves are intelligently re-imagined, causing reflection on our own previous assumptions, and interpretations of the old rhymes and stories, an aspect that has been carried over from the comic books. In fact the reinterpretation of these characters is what gives this game a meta-cognitive feel, as it carries its theme of appearance vs reality.\n\nWhere The Wolf Among Us does shine above and beyond its sister game is in the QTE's and combat sequences. They are far more immersive, and one feels a great deal more in control of the situations, even when initially surprised by the beginning of the event. It also serves to characterize exactly why Bigsby is a character to be feared, in short the game puts some bite into Bigsby's bark.\n\nIt's a brilliant game that manages to serve up an intriguing story whilst simultaneously re-inventing player perceptions of classic characters. I highly recommend it!\n\nEdited: Spelling, italics and clarity","November 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The Wolf Among Us is an absolutely fantastic story-based adventure game in the same vein (mechanically speaking) as The Walking Dead.  Your choices alter the incredibly in-depth story and offer a variety of ways to play the main character, Bigby Wolf, all of which lead to consequences which often have a ripple effect throughout the entire narrative.\n\nThe game takes place in Manhattan in a secret community composed of the many 'fables' that we've grown up knowing since we were children.  The Three Pigs, Snow White, The Little Mermaid, and other all make appearances throughout the game and you get to see a grittier side to them than we're used to.\n\nAll in all, the game was an incredibly well-written and kept my interest from the moment that I turned it on.  I spent a large portion of two consecutive days playing the game and that was only because of the fact that by mustering all of my willpower I was able to quit the game and save it for later.

Whether it be through hard thought, reckless impulse, social pressure, or just a glance at the timer ticking down, each decision made is yours alone, no matter how proud or ashamed you make yourself. Gameplay-wise, you're simply putting 1's and 0's into value operators. Reality-wise, you're creating a story and a world.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us doesn't buck that trend. Hard choices abound, and, somehow, the people you meet express lives more dark and depressing then we saw from a zombie apocalypse. Trying to raise a child, not having enough to pay the rent, being bullied: the strange and extraordinary residents of Fabletown are suffering from very human problems.  It's not hard to sympathize with most Fables we meet, and we want to see their stories to the end.\n\nThat, however, is the game's biggest problem: if you want to find out what happens next, be prepared to pick up some comics. I've never seen a game's story rise so high to fall so low, and that's saying something.\n\nThis isn't to suggest some conspiracy theory about this being a twenty five dollar advertisement for the graphic novels. In hindsight, I realize you can't take an epic tale such as a comic series with over a hundred issues, stick someone in control of the series' main character, and expect your choices to reflect on someone so definitively pre-made. While playing as Bigby, you can make some pretty clear-cut demonstrations of his power as effective judge, jury, and executioner, but the game doesn't even try to make citizens react with any sort of concrete stance to your actions. This isn't because Telltale is lazy or incompetent, but simply because their hands are tied. You can't kill off a canon character, you can't even change who they do or don't like. The game's story is flawed at a conceptual level.\n\nIt's a real shame that what I'll remember the most is how I feel right now, ten minutes after watching the credits roll, because, while The Wolf Among Us is a mere shadow of what it could've been, I won't totally forget just how captivated I was in the midst of it all. Make no mistake about it, this game is a labor of love. Most of the dialogue is among gaming's best, and I've seen award-winning movies with characters less human than these Fables. While the animation brings you back to Playstation 2 days, the art design is personally my favorite in any game, ever: we've seen cel-shading before, but this truly is a moving, breathing comic book you can play. All of this makes for for an incredible jumping point to a potential Game of the Year.\n\nHowever, in a game like this, story is everything. In the moment, you'll be interested, you'll be invested, you'll actually care. This is why it can't simply end like it does: the grand reveal, the moment everything is explained incites not shock or cries, but acknowledgements, "Yes, that does make sense." All your investment, all your time spent in the Fable's community, is for the moment alone. After the Walking Dead ended, I spent days thinking about my choices, what I could've done differently, what I learned about myself. After The Wolf Among Us ended, I simply felt sad for the characters I'd shared time with. Not because of what happened to them previously, but because I'll never know what happened next. I'll never pick up the comics; not out of hate, but out of disappointment. The Bigby displayed in those books and the Bigby I crafted over hours of commitment are two entirely separate characters. I want to know what happens next almost as much as I want to completely love this game, but when the curtains close and there is literally not a shred of closure to be had, I can't help but feel used. I look forward to Telltale's future projects and still have faith in them, but the brief vertical slice I had of such a vibrant and interesting world, one that held such absurd promise, has eventually left me wanting and sad.\n\nI understand how, to the uninitiated passerby, it may seem like I'm making too big a fuss over an ending that's only the small part of a larger narrative. If you don't understand where I'm coming from, picture this: you're watching a movie at a theater, but the projector breaks down fifteen minutes before the end credits. Now, imagine that you've been watching that movie for thirteen hours, and it starred your favorite actors and was made by your favorite director. And every single copy of that film is now broken at that part. But, hey, you can still read a comic version created by completely separate people, and a comic that may change the protagonist from a murderous vigilante to a gruff but fair detective.\n\nThere'll be people who're okay with that, and if you're one of them, great! By all means, enjoy this intro to a larger universe you can spend hours upon hours with. Seriously. However, if you're like me, you'll want the major character and plot arcs to at least somewhat resolve within the medium you started them in, as a reward for your investment. Like me, you'll be disappointed, and I'll point you instead in the direction of The Walking Dead.\n\nHowever, to end on a note of positivity, I can safely say that The Wolf Among Us is my absolute favorite game I wouldn't recommend to a friend.","July 8, 2014","false","10.9"," 217 of 394 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","217","394","6","12"

Can't go wrong with that.\n\nNow, for the good stuff...\n\n- Bigby is one of the most awesome, troubled, badass, deep, complicated, admirable protagonists you could imagine. He's like Wolverine only gives even fewer ♥♥♥♥s. You'll have a man-crush on this guy after playing the first 10 minutes of the very first episode.\n- The story is just classic hard-boiled fiction. No-holds-barred power trip that's got more plot twists than the entire series of The A-Team. And it's dark, and it's brutal and just generally it's a great piece of storytelling.\n- The "choice and consequence" element may not have as far reaching consequences as you may expect, but it's more about self-discovery. It's about Bigby and his moral stuggles and you, as the player, has the power to choose how he deals with all that ♥♥♥♥ that's being thrown at him from left and right. It's a quest for moral victory and as such, it delivers superbly.\n- Visuals are great. Stylised after the comic book, the game feels like a grotesque, cartoon-ish representation of our own corrupt little world. I wouldn't trade the graphics in this game for any modern, life-like look. It just looks and feels like it's supposed to.\n- Voice acting is just awesome! You can tell so much about the characters just by listening to how they speak. You'll find yourself imitating Bigby's voice in your head in no time.\n\nNow for the bad:\n- Nothing. Null. Nada. Zero. Zilch. There are no bad things that can be said about this game. Whatsoever.\n- There's this one glitch at the very end of the game, but it only happens sometimes to not very many people. It's well worth checking out though, because it's one of the most amazing glitches I've ever "suffered" from! So I don't consider it a negative.\n- It's short. Just kidding. No it's not - for not even 20 quid you get 10-15 hours of solid, easily replayable entertainment. It's like one of those movies you keep coming back to year after year.\n\nIf you haven't played it, you damn well should, even if you're not a fan of choice and consequence, or even adventure games in general, even if all you play is CoD or DotA2, just buy it and play it.

You do not have to constantly worry to push the game forward knowing you will lose nothing if you choose 'wrong'. This way, you can concentrate on choosing who you want to be. The choices you make are about struggling to become more human, to control animal instincts or just being Big Bad Wolf all the time. You write another, your own, story with the options you choose.

You play as Bigby Wolf(Big bad Wolf) who must find a murder amung their kind. With the help of Snow White you soon find out this is deeper then murder.\n\nThe game follows the typical Telltale style that made Walking Dead such a hit. Putting story first then gameplay, you are quickly drawn into the world. While the game offers you some  tough choices to make, it really only offers minimal changes that all will come out to the same outcome(but another character will "view" you differently).  The only real choice is the end game one, that effects how the story will end.\n\nYou basically move scene to scene with talking to other characters or clicking on objects to investigate them. Every so often you will have a big action sequence that will have a minimal quicktime event taht will consist of pressing a directional button, moving the cursor to a point on screen and clicking, or tapping a keyboard key. All very easy and not frustrating. It is more an interactive movie, then a game to  be honest though.\n\nWhile I waited for the last episode to be released before purchasing, since I hate waiting on cliffhangers, that really would be my only gripe with the game. There was also a glitch that when loading the last scene of the game it caused the game to glitch out and throw me through random parts of the story with just me as a walking head and not being able to walk more then a few feet.\n\n\nThe Verdict:\nA great game, that is highly worth the money. Was one of my top games of 2014\n\n","October 15, 2014","true","8.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

As in pretty much all TellTale Games, the choices you make might not affect the global ending, but it does affect the way the story is told to you.\n\nWill the story be about the Big Bad Wolf's redemption, or will it be a story of violence in Fabletown? The choice is yours to take. The only "downside" is, maybe, the lack of gameplay; TellTale Games make an excellent job at telling us a story, and they are great point-and-click, but I would have loved some true puzzles or riddles.\n\nAnother great game from TellTales, if you liked The Walking Dead or Tales from the Borderlands then you should love it too.\n\nMy only recommendation to the developpers: please, try to get out of your comfort zone and add some puzzles to flesh out the games, or, at the very least, more variety to how the game plays.\n\nRating; 8/10.","January 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

It seems like many games are episodic these days, so I'm glad that I got this when all 5 chapters were completed. I have to say that I did enjoy it. I really liked the work they did on integrating fairy tale characters (fables) into our world (mundies). The idea of "glamours" too was interesting. Gameplay was good, with a nice pace to follow the storyline. I really liked the graphics, even though (or in spite of) they were 2D (reminds me of the good old days).\n\nThere were some bugs though. Choices I made in one chapter sometimes were screwed up in the next -- the game didn't save properly perhaps. This happened two or three times. Then in the final chapter, the screen had "blank choices" which i couldn't select, and the scene kept looping. I had to exit to the main menu 3 times before it finally loaded properly on the 4th. If i exited the game entirely, I'd probably have to go through Chapter 5 from scratch. The game doesn't let you save on the fly, but only autosaves at key points.\n\nDespite this, I enjoyed playing the wolf among us, and recommend it! But I'm only rating it 6.5 because of the bugs.\n\n6.5/10.0","February 6","true","10.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I just finished the last episode of Season 1, and I can honestly say I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.\n\nI think most of us have played The Walking Dead, another Telltale Game, and it is possibly what drew you to The Wolf Among Us in the first place, so I'm going to compare it a bit to that.\n\nI love The Walking Dead. It had a compelling story which was all at once wonderful, exciting and heartbreaking to play. However, the choices you made along the way, led us all to the same ending no matter what. There wasn't much value in giving it a replay. There were decisions, but too often that decision was "choose between letting so-and-so die, or so-and-so". And it made me feel like a terrible person the entire game because it felt like it was IMPOSSIBLE to do the right thing, to make everyone happy, or anyone for that matter, and someone was always resenting the ♥♥♥♥ out of you for letting their loved one die.\n\nTWAU corrects this completely. As Sheriff Bigby Wolf, there are so many decisions you will be faced with which will alter the outcome of the game 100%. I'm terrified to say anything more for fear of spoiling anything for anyone, but you will notice, when certain choices come up, there would have to be a completely different arc created to honor your choice. You can be Good Guy Wolf. You can be Bad Guy Wolf. You can fall somewhere in between the two extremes. You can do the right thing. But you don't have to. Whatever you want. And if there are future seasons, your choices will have to stand, because well... they are that impactful on the story.\n\nThe story, which, by the way, is excellent! Season 1 was dark, deep, well woven and action packed. I feel bad mentioning anything more than 5 minutes into the game because I don't want to spoil ANYTHING.\n\nPlease, do yourself a favor, hit "Buy", "Install Now" and "Play" ASAP. I paid $8.50 during the sale, and I'm concerned I'm going to be arrested for robbery at that price.","July 8, 2014","true","10.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","5"

With fairytale characters secretly living in the normal world ever since they exiled from the world of fables centuries ago, sheriff Bigby Wolf comes across a murder case which has him investigating a conspiracy against all the inhabitants of Fabletown.\n\nPros: This film-noir detective story has truly excellent writing, as you're constantly faced with a variety of decisions that shape the story arc in a unique way, while your relation with each character you come across evolves. Nothing is black and white, and whatever choice you make from multiple options will have unforeseen consequences, for better or for worst. Character reactions and expressions are deeply realistic, and you'll want to revisit the game multiple times to find different outcomes, constantly finding a new surprise around the next corner as the plot unfolds. Graphically, the cell-shading perfectly captures the impression of a live graphic novel, an art style that couldn't possibly better represent the atmosphere.\n\nCons: The story remains linear, and although you have multiple branching paths, you remain limited to going where the plot will take you next. There is a bit of staggering in some of the animations, as well as occasional awkward silence in between dialogs. Furthermore, every choices are timed, and while that may add to the realism of an action sequence or conversation, you're often left with very little time to consider what your options are and what may come out of these. Some of the options are a bit misleading, as it isn't always clear what the tone of a dialog choice is beyond the words they express. Gameplay is limited to quicktime events and clicking on things. There is a well-known bug you're likely to experience at least once, where a scene starts offering repetitive "This choice is blank" dialog choices that can only be resolved by re-doing the previous scene hoping it doesn't bug again.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.\n\nI got extremely involved with the story, the first episode was enough to get me hooked. Telltale truly has refined the "decision matter" storytelling to near perfection, all delivered with excellent voice acting. While I'm cooling off from my first experience, I can't wait to play it again and try things differently. I am already recommending The Wolf Among Us to everyone I personally know, and am doing the same to anyone who will read this.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","May 21","true","11.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In fact, I might go as far as to say, that it may very well be my favorite "Point & Click" game of all time! No small feet as I have loved many... But do not be fooled by the term "P&C." It is so much more! It's cutting edge! There's hard hitting gritty action and drama worthy of Classic Noir, Suspense, Mystery books and films, all done with a modern twist. There's political themes,  and the ever present struggle of the have and have nots, the rich and the poor. Steamy undertones of lust, desire, and love, mixed with rage, pain, despair, and loss are all fighting their way to the surface. Murder and brutality lurk around every corner. Full out violence and carnage can happen at any moment. The atmosphere seems charged with electricity every scene and at every turn.\n\nGameplay is absolutely a dream of seemless movements, mixed with fast reaction times, both via hands and of the mind. Every choice made while playing, fully impacts and reverberates both within and without the figures of this brooding environment. There are no bugs of any kind that I could find, no delays, glitches, or frozen screens. The artwork is simply breathtaking. The voice acting is sublime throughout, only adding to the believability of the characters and the world they inhabit.

Mystery and character depth were aplenty as almost all the fabletown characters were not as clear-cut as they originally seem to be. I liked that a great majority of the cast got somewhat deep backgrounds which helped shape the decisions I made throughout the game. The game also incentivises multiple playthroughs of each episode (in the form of achievements) which is a plus in my book.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is how it got weird near the end. As fans of other telltale games may be aware of, choices you make determine how characters view you at later points of the story. Well I skipped from good to bad (in general) at random times so the characters became very fickle in how they viewed me near the end. It felt unnatural to have character A go from supporting me to dissing me after just 2 or 3 panels. It was quite weird. Other than that, the game was a stellar experience.\n\n- great story\n- amazing set of characters (+ depth)\n- QTE weren't as bad as I anticipated\n- delicious mystery\n\nI'm looking forward to another season or maybe other new telltale games dealing with similar material.","July 9, 2014","true","12.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","9"

Do you want to play a game with kludgy mechanics, involving really dodgy action sequences and lame quick time events? Do you want to play a game that may break several times while you're playing, resulting in all of your game choices saying "This choice is blank", requiring you to stop, exit, and restart the game? Do you want to play a game where you have only a bare illusion of player agency and no actual meaningful impact on the story whatsoever? Do you want to play it in 90 minute sports every two or three months as each of five episodes are released over the span of nearly a full year?\n\nYou very well might. Despite all of these telltale Tell Tale Games traits, The Wolf Among Us manages to compensate for all of these failures (which are repeated in every one of their modern games, so far) just enough with a really entertaining story set in a noir 1980s, where you play Wolverine who is tasked with protecting Fabletown. Great art style, color pallete, and voice acting join the actual story in making it worth playing with what would be intolerable failures in a lessar game.\n\nDue to the miserable save system and the difficulty in remembering the 90 minutes you played after two or three months each time, this is a title best enjoyed after all five episodes have been released (as is now the case). That way, you can play the entire thing in a couple of sittings without as much risk to your game save and you can keep up with the story.\n\nIf you're interested in a compelling story that keeps you interested in reaching the next beat in it, The Wolf Among Us is probably worth the sticker price, for most people. If you're unsure about it, you should definitely consider picking it up during a sale. I'd only suggest avoiding this title if you have played enough of recent Tell Tale Games to know that you really dont' have the patience for the inherent jank of their products. Otherwise, if you still have a little patience for that, it's a fun ride.","August 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/recommended/250320/","PhyreMatrix","PhyreMatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/","941 products in account","This is by far my favorite TellTales game. The characters are flawed yet intelligent. The story a gritty mystery shadowing a slightly more common tale of people just trying to make it given the harsh hand they're dealt. Where the bureaucracy is pretty much no help and often hardly different than the criminals they're trying to find. I enjoyed this far more than the more popular Walking Dead series. There was far less stupidity going on in this game and no one pretends to be innocent.\n\nLike many of their recent games you have to deal with the consequences of the choices you make and the story really pushes you to make some tough ones. Not always life and death so the urgency and to choose the lesser of two evils seemed to weigh less on my conscious. The writing was excellent and in the en some characters really do surprise you. As Bigby you're automatically branded as the bad guy and everyone expects the worst from you. So it's really easy to fall in line with what everyone expects you to do or you can choose to rise above it.\n\nAnd surprisingly this game gives you many opportunities to let the Wolf inside out it'll take you longer to rise above it. At the end you don't really feel like a hero but realize that what you do is often a thankless job but you do your best anyway. But trying to be an upstanding role model certainly didn't detract from all the violence and action that happens. Luckily you don't die easy.\n\nMy only complaint if there was one would be I would have liked it if the game explored a bit more of the interaction between the Mundies and Fables. The only part we're ever exposed to that crossover is when Bigby is at a police station being interrogated but that scene is only a very small part of one chapter. Or if we had some reason to go to the farm. I really hope there's a season 2 of this series. I love the reimagining of Fables it almost makes me want to check out the comic myself. Anyone who's a fan of adventure games or even of the comic in general should play this title. You'd definitely get your money's worth and it'd be time and money well spent.","June 30, 2015","true","10.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For instance, I had hatred for Toad and Crane and I only started the game. It's really cool that you can make Bigby (the main character) similliar to you, because you can choose which things to say or do.

One of the primary reasons is the character that the user plays.  Bigby Wolf, also known as the big bad wolf, came from a time and place where blowing down houses and eating people was his every day life.  Now he lives amongst mundane folk and other fairy tale creatures that are disguise (glamored) as humans; thus, it is important to remember that the player is NOT calling all of the shots.  Its safe to say that the general gaming populous has never eaten another living being, nor blown down the houses of three terrified little pigs.  That being said, the player has some choices that will feel like his or her own, however, the majority of the decisions are based upon the mindset of a half werewolf attempting to adapt to a "normal" life.\n\nIn a game like The Walking Dead, it is much more upsetting when the player is left with an ultimatum that doesn't make sense for an ex civil war teacher, but who's to say what is going through the mind of the Big Bad Wolf?\n\nWith every new play-through, there seems to be more and more hidden character development.  While the choices and content may seem a tad more limited in TWAU than in TWD, the truth is just the opposite.   In the latter episodes of TWD, the early portion seems  more and more obsolete. TWAU brings up choices that were made early in the season, and is also forced to work within' certain boundaries, for it cannot do anything that will break or set the story off balance for the graphic novels.\n\nNow that this game is fully released, I couldn't recommend it more.

The environmental variation really accentuated the cell-shading and was an improvement over Telltale’s other title The Walking Dead.\nThis graphical choice also lended itself to the expressive countenance on the game’s memorable cast.  Quick and responsive facial reactions helped draw me in to the story and care even more about these intriguing characters.\nLighting was also aided by the use of cell-shading.  Numerous situations in the game were made much more ominous due to the placement of the light sources.  One scene in particular involved a TV’s casting glare that flickered across a brutal crime scene.\nThe musical score was quite memorable and assisted greatly in the “immersion” factor.  I found myself particularly enjoying the unique title theme music and, like the rest of the game’s score, found a strong correlation to it and the emotion and intention of the character on the screen.\nBeing a game about fables, it was quite fun trying to guess all of the storybook jumpers before they “revealed” themselves.  I considered it a bit of a mini-game, as there was a book of fables that updated after you met each new fable character.\nSome neat easter eggs were present during unsuspecting moments, that always put a smile on my face.  I’d be surprised if anyone caught the Lost reference.\nThe statistics behind what percentage of players chose each branching path in the story was an enjoyable read after my play-through.  Knowing I was the minority or majority in a decision choice, led to some interesting personal retrospective.\nThese key choices also proceeded into branching story-lines that seemed much more drastic than the ones in The Walking Dead.\nI’m a big fan of episodic gaming, especially when it is done right.  The same things that kept my brain glued to a television series on Netflix thinking, “Oh man!  I have to see what happens next” are present in The Wolf Among Us.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nContextual controller displays were not always intuitive and often led to an incorrect button press.  Most of the time these inconsistencies were only present during the quick reaction moments of the game, which was unfortunate to the say the least.\nCheck out this example, which displays a left trigger input for the door on the right.\nWhile probably not a negative in most folk’s book, but the gore and gritty realism was quite jarring and seemed out of place sometimes.  Profanity seemed frequently unnecessary and often made me wince at the screen.\nI enjoyed the detective portions of the game and just wished there was more to interact with and deduce.  I would have liked being able to try and piece together more of the crime scene on my own (i.e. combining inventory items with areas of interest or carefully crafting the motive from the evidence present in the scene)\nThis is nit picky (sorry Rod), but the subtitles were sometimes hard to read against certain backgrounds.  I like being able to check the subtitles in a game, if I’m not sure what the word was, but the game made a lot of them difficult to read.\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nAs I mentioned above, this is definitely a mature title.  Frequent use of profanity and numerous visuals of gory violent acts made me sure to keep the children far away while I played.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nI sure did.  It took me a little over 2 hours to complete the first chapter.  Thoroughly enjoying every minute of it too.  The story was just as good, if not better than, The Walking Dead’s and I will be waiting eagerly for the next episode.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\nI recommend that folks purchase the season pass for all five episodes, as the first episode seems to be only a taste of what is to come.  I will of course review each subsequent episode and update my recommendation should it be warranted.\n\n$24.99\n\nor\n\n100% of current retail value of $24.99\n\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com","December 3, 2013","true","3.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is based on the universe of Fables, which I have no knowledge of whatsoever. However, I now realise it has a lot of memorable characters from fairy tales and well known books. There are countless references to them throughout the story, and I found them funny. To be honest, it is hard to take the game seriously when you consider where the characters originally came from.\n\nThe story is, sadly, not as strong as the Walking Dead Games in my opinion. There is a character in the game who is quickly established as an a**hole and he is used in one of the games plot twists. I didn't find this suprising at all, but then again, there are less characters and locations in this game, which I find to be a strong suit of The Wolf Among us. It helps seperate the two. You will talk to the same characters many times, and you will visit locations that will quickly become familiar to you. Also, the ending did not offer much closure on the games many unanswered questions. This setups a second season quite nicely, and I do not see this as a bad thing.\n\nThe game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard in a video game. Almost all of the lines are memorable, powerful, and superbly written and acted out. Some of the voice actors from the Walking Dead can be heard here too (Dave Fennoy, Lee and Gavin Hammon, Kenny). Dave takes up a polar opposite role by being one of the bad guys, and Kenny plays the Beast. While Dave plays his character superbly and differently to Lee, Gavin's lines are not acted any differently to the Walking Dead. He sounds the same. This is, of course, a personal complaint. The best actor in the game, hands down, is Adam Harrington who plays the Main Character, Bigby Wolf. I have no complaints about him; every line is excellent.\n\nThe Wolf Among us also goes down the Adventure Game route more with the inclusion of the Book of Fables. Some of the entries are unlocked by exploring certain areas or taking different choices. I like this, as it offers replayability, something unheard of in any previous TellTale game. The game can play out in vastly different ways depending on your choices. They all have a very noticable and serious impact.\n\nFinally, this game is more action orientated than the Walking Dead. There are many QTE sections in the game, and they are the best I have ever played. Never before have I been intense pressing Q and moving left and right. No spoilers, but there are some awesome fighting sections in the game that makes you feel every strike made.\n\nOverall, The Wolf Among Us shows that Telltale is improving their unique genre of games with every release. It is intense, meaningful, weird, disgusting and brutal and is worth every penny. 9/10.","January 10, 2015","true","10.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You play as Bigby Wolf A.K.A The Big Bad Wolf from many fairy tales, the game has many colorful characters all from various fairy tales and myths i.e Snow White, The Woodsman, Big Bad Wolf, Ichabod Crane and many many more. I loved the story because it brough the fairy tales we were all told as a kid but brought them into a deep dark adult world and showed what it would be like if these characters were real.\nThe controls are the same as the other Telltale games so if you've played any of them you should know mostly what to expect though I think this one did the controls better than The Walking Dead series as far as the action sequences go.\nThe story was great and had quiet a few twists and turns early and often I was really surprised I enjoyed this game as much as I did and it definitely blew away any expectations I had before playing it.\n","December 30, 2014","true","16.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

The fable community keeps itself hidden from the mundies (regular humans) and as Bigby, the Big Bad Wolf, you act as their sheriff. When a fable turns up dead you start to investigate who might be behind it, and discover things aren't as simple as they may appear.\n\nThe art direction, voice acting and music in this game are fantastic, combining to create a slick and gorgeous package that feels a cut above the presentation of prior Telltale games. Like other recent Telltale games, the focus is less on puzzles and more on story and interaction. The content is engaging, well-written and you'll be pulled into the thick of it and eager to piece the mystery together.\n\nThoroughly recommended.","July 12, 2014","true","11.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The Wolf Among Us is set in a world full of fairy tale creatures from our favorite fables, all from Snow White to Red Riding Hood. This might make it sound childish, but it is gritty, mature and captivating game held together by a superb story.\n\nYou play as the Sheriff, known as Bigby, as he attempts to keep order amongst the fairly tales. But, it doesn't get so easy when a young working woman ends up dead on his doorstep. This sets up what turns out to be a big and complicated story. Across a series of five "episodes" it's up to Bigby to unravel a conspiracy involving nearly all people of Fabletown.\n\nDespite being a detective story, there's very little detecting to do in The Wolf Among Us, which is a bit disappointing. Instead, the game focuses on deepening its mystery and forces you to make tough decisions. They accomplished this quite well.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us lets you play your character as you want to. You can either be a compassionate Sheriff or a complete jerk. There was no moment where it felt like they pushed you toward either path, letting you choose the way you want to play. But unfortunately, it felt like no matter how you chose to play, the result would be the same. This does not necessarily mean that the game lacks something, just that it did not feel like that your actions truly mattered in the end.\n\nTelltale has once again created a stunning game, filled with rich characters and a exciting story that makes you come back for more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/250320/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","The Wolf Among us is a story based detective mystery. It is very similar to the Walking Dead in base mechanics like a heavy reliance on quick time events and plenty of dialogue.  The game takes place in New York, in a certain section in town where fairly tale characters live and appear human due to an expensive magic they have to acquire unless they want to be sent The Farm which is said to be like a prison of sorts. You play as Sheriff Bigby who was a former murder and is now tasked with keeping the  fantasy tale characters know as Fables safe. Bigby has quite a temper so even if you try to play as a saint in this game he will occasionally still be a jerk which adds to his character. This is not a game for kids. The cute talking animals are quite foul mouthed and there is plenty of pretty graphic violence and heavy subjects during your investigations.\n\nGameplay is bare-bones. Fight scenes are just Quick time events as I've mentioned though they are pretty fun to watch since some Fables have super strength and all of them are very resilient to damage which leads to some pretty violent lengthy fights.  When given control of the character you can interact with a few predetermined items and talk with characters. There are never really any puzzles or actual investigating which I found rather disappointing considering the plot revolves around mystery. Most of the leads can be found simply by talking or plain assaulting a suspect. It is very linear and when you are given a choice where to go most of the times you will go to the place you didn't pick afterwards anyways. Your choices to play as a “man” chasing redemption through justice or a psychotic tormentor are pretty cool since sometimes you just really want to maim someone instead of arresting them.\n\nThe artstyle in this game is superb. The town looks really run down and the neon soaked streets just add so much charm. Cell shading really fits the game perfectly. Everywhere you journey to is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, odd mystical creatures or plane unsavory hostile sorts. You never really meet any one normal and only see regular humans on the background in some scenes, never interacting with them. When Fables show their true forms more often than not they look horrifying but lucky your character Bigby is more than capable to take most of them on. Also there is nudity and pretty detailed gore which fits the gritty tone of the game but once again I must say do not be fooled by the screenshots thinking this is a game for children.\n\nThe sound track is amazing and definitely one of my favorites of 2014. It is a kind of fusion between moody, techno and mystery which fit the game like a glove. Voice acting is pretty good as well which is a must for such a heavily dialogue driven game. One thing that caught me off guard was the same actor that plays Clementine in the Walking Dead plays a child frog called Toad Jr. Having just played the walking dead it was plain odd seeing a frog talk while Clementine's voice comes out of its mouth. Nothing wrong with that, just something I found funny that I wanted to mention. Sounds effects are pretty satisfying too. Sounds great when you throw or get thrown several feet through the air and break a wall and its to the appeal of the super hero like fight scenes.\n\nAs to be expected from Telltale the story is the best part of the game. You never really know what to expect since the world is so odd and unique. You start off investigating a murder but as to be expected things quickly become much more complicated. It starts off pretty strong but the villains don't really do anything else bad after the first episode which makes you lose some interest as you simply investigate because it is your character's job and to play the game you bought instead of being actually invested in the mystery and the culprit. Don't get me wrong it's a decent enough tale but quickly loses steam and it takes quite awhile to regain some. It's just too bad that a mystery game ends on a cliffhanger which leaves you completely unsatisfied. Characters themselves are all memorable with very different personalities and oddities.\n\nIn the end I'd say this is a very enjoyable game for those looking for a good story and an odd world that you will remember long after you beat the game.  I did experience a glitch twice that made me go exit to the main menu due to not being able to pick any choices in dialogue but those all happened right after a quick save and hence was a very minor issue.  Don't be expecting to be using brainpower during this title though. It is heavily on rails and you will discover everything through talking and quick time events. If you are fine with that then I can see no reason not to suggest this game. This a very unique experience that should be tried by anyone that loves story based games.","February 10, 2015","true","8.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

With a gripping plot, and characters easy to sympathize with you will not regret spending money on it.\n\nThe first episode of The Wolf Among Us showed us something new from Telltale. For the first time I've actually felt like I was in the game.. Like I was Bigby. It made me feel like I'm part of the story which no first-person game has ever made me feel. The third episode is the most gripping of them, and you get to see just how dark this game actually is.\n\nDefinitively going to be "Game of the Year" when it is completed.\n10/10","April 8, 2014","true","59.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Simmilar to say reading a book and you decide to skip paragraphs. But that's where a second playthrough will help fill in the gaps.\n\nSelling point for this game is seeing popular fairy tale characters in a gritty poverty stricken environment.

The game takes place in a fictional New York City borough of Fabletown, where various mythical characters live. The game starts with a murder case that Bigby (Big Bad Wolf) and Snow White must solve before the killer strikes again. Their investigation leads to a dark underworld more extensive than they ever expected and the deeper they go, the harder their choices become.\nThe game is more an interactive narrative, with lots of dialogue but there are also some light action scenes to break up the pacing. Your influence is largely felt through the choices you make, like you use your fists to beat clues out of a criminal instead of talking it out, or investigate one potential lead at the expense of another.\nThe biggest accomplishment of The Wolf Among Us is that you really get a sense of what it is like to be Bigby. There are plenty of moments where a specific action will probably help you solve the crime, but ultimately make Fabletown residents hate you.\nThe Wolf Among Us is a full interactive story.  As you progress along the narrative, you are also presented with choices. Each choice has consequences to the story which adapts based on the decisions you make.\nThe visuals looks good. Overall the colours used are bright and appealing. The comic stylings manage to emulate the look of the books to a very high degree.\nThe voice acting is amazing. Also the soundtrack is fantastic and really helps create the mood in the Wolf Among Us.\nThe Wolf Among Us offer a great replayability, it is a fantastic game. I can completely recommend The Wolf Among Us to all who liked The Walking Dead from Telltale and also to all others.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","August 25, 2014","true","14.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Devastated by this tragedy Bigby prepares for his quest to find the culprit behind this terrible crime with the help of his old friend Snow White (He also has a crush on her & who wouldn't she may be animated but those ♥♥♥♥ & warm personality can drive any man mad with lust *howls at the moon*) while Bigby finally gets his violent personality back like any badass should (His past is really sad if you read the Winter Wolf fable & probably one of the main reasons he uses violence to solve his problems) to start wrecking havoc on any liars that cover up for the bad guys.\n\nFrom rampage to rampage (I won't go into detail because Bigby fights a lot of people) Bigby & Snow discover that a long crime war has been around for centuries started by Fabletown's professional mob boss The Crooked Man (If you paid attention in school there was a nursery rhyme called "There Was A Crooked Man" which is the same crooked man from the rhyme brought to life by Mr. Willingham) who is obviously the biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥ from using scare tactics on his hired help, getting other fables like Tweedle Dee & Dum to do his dirty work, Stealing from the poor, Corruption in the government (Crane was in charge of that) & lots of other crimes that would get you executed.\n\nShocked by this news Bigby yet acts more of a badass to find proof related to all the crimes to catch the biggest fish in the sea (Violence included). After finding proof, killing the Crooked Man's henchman, capturing the mob boss himself, got the crowd supporting Bigby at the trial & punishing Crooked Man order is restored in FableTown so Bigby can finally relax for now. If Bigby wanted to he would have celebrated & maybe get lucky with Snow but we'll save that for another time we'll just let Bigby Drink & Smoke alone. (I hope you enjoyed my version of the story since I can't explain everything about the game)\n\nPros:\n\n1. Badass Main Character\n\n2. Good Story\n\n3. Mature\n\n4. Depressing atmosphere\n\n5.

Interesting character background stories you can read off the game menu\n\nCons:\n\n1. Some people may despise the Quick Time Events or how simplified the game is since point & click games have a history of being hard (I'm talking about the ones in the 90s & 80s)\n\nOverall if you like what you read then give some money to Telltale so they can make another game set in the Fable Universe & leave some feedback if I missed anything.","July 12, 2014","true","19.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The story is gripping, the art style is eye-catching, and the voice acting is superb.\n\nThere are a few odd glitches though. Whenever Steam pops up an achievement notification, it's always during a loading screen and it can make the loading process lag. Three times when this happened, it glitched out the game to where it would skip one or more scenes, immediately thrust me into a dialogue choice, and every option would be blank. Thankfully, the autosave feature is well-implemented, so I can just return to the start menu, continue the story, and proceed as normal. One other odd thing is that in many of the action sequences, if you are playing with a 360 controller, if a prompt comes up to press the right trigger (or vice versa) you can hit the left trigger and it still registers as being the correct button. This isn't necessarily a negative, since many of these instances give you barely any time to react, it's just kinda weird.\n\nOverall, 12/10 game.

This guy had so much depth. He's the sheriff a symbol of good and authority but yet his fable (The Big Bad Wolf) Stands for destruction and devestation. That mix makes the ultimate character.\nUnlike the walking dead the characters you meet are in real problems like debt. They have to worry about a shady employer than a zombie. When you interact with them you feel for them, you want them to be happy. In the Walking Dead you know its a ♥♥♥♥ world all around you and you try to make the best out of it but in the wolf among us you really feel they can make it in this world and they deserve a happy life. I can tell you that every character in this game has a purpose and a meaning. Whether you hate em or love em you'll know em.\n\nChoices:\nThe Wolf Among us choices are the best. Even though they may come in a loop and you really can't decide what happens in the situation you. The best part about the choices in this game is tied with your character, Bigby. You can either be the "Big Bad Wolf" For an evil playthrough and shock terror into your allies and enemies like your fable is. Or you can be the good guy, try to show fabletown that your different and here to help for a good playthrough. I'll tell you first hand when you show your good theres no better feeling.\n\nSide Note to TT:\nOne thing I have a beef with in TT games is romance, call me sappy but they bring it on themselves. In the wolf among us and several other TT games they set you up for love interests, maybe multiples. There is never an option to expand on those feelings for a character. They even blatenly point out that a character likes another or they interact in a certain way indicating that they like eachother but there isn't an option to even give em an affectionate hug or kiss. I think in future TT games there should be more options to have relationships.\n\nStory:\nThis story had me tossing and turning in my sleep.

But it seems that developers learned their lesson, tightened up their writing, and finally have gotten familiar with their cellshaded engine.\n\nI'm not a big fan of comic series which this game is based upon, but authors managed to stay true to original characterisation and even given some supporting characters more depth. Voice acting is also surprised me, while not phenomenal, it was really good.\n\nSo on a plus side we have:\n1) graphics - it really looks like a comic, and some scenes are screenshot-worthy;\n2) voice acting - like I said, not phenomenal, but surprisingly good;\n3) plot - it's hard to describe it and avoid spoilers at the same time, but I almost wish that it would have been AU instead of\nprequel; it stays true to characterization and setting of the original Fables, and simultaniously gives surprising depth to secondary, and, to lesser extent, main characters.\n\nThe game has a few minuses though:\n1) length (I realize that it's an episodic game, but an episode should be more "meaty", IMO);\n2) console controls (it really shows that the games were developed with a controller in mind, and not mouse + keyboard; mouse acceleration is awfull, and controls are sometimes awkward);\n3) the fact that it's a prequel (if they are to stay true to the story, then they just can't kill characters which later will appear in the comics, it somewhat ruins the element of surprise);\n4) music, especially the main theme (most music in game is forgettable, but "DUN... TU-DUN. DUN... TU-DUN. tim-dam-dam." main theme is just grating).\n\n****/*****","January 2, 2014","true","18.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Literally. In fact the gameplay is mostly made of Quick Time Events and Dialogues, and both are very important because everything you do or say will lead to consequences, and this is essentially the core of the game as you will really see sooner or later what your actions or words lead to. The lack of actual gameplay is really overshadowed by what the story tells you as it will literally keep you glued on your chair trying to solve the situation and get some answers. But the game will keep you where you are as it will reveal more and more, even though you're practically not doing much in terms of gameplay. The fact that your decisions influence how the story evolves, potentially gives great replayability to the game as you can take different choices in more new runs just to see how relationships or events change, even though the basic plot remains the same. Not to mention the fact that once you reach the end you can still re-play the game to better understand other situations or dialogues or references.\nThe game has an episodic structure, which seriously helps to shock and impact more the player with story revelations or cliffhangers and I find this kind of structure essential for this purpose as I believe it wouldn't work in a different classic way.\nSo, yes. It's all about the story, but how couldn't I mention the art of the game? Starting with the soundtrack, it's made of thin but effective background music and amazing opening and close credits themes everything with an 80s mood. Visually the game has a great art, starting always from the artistic opening titles in each episode, and the game itself with a Comic look mostly due to the cel shading effect, but also colours, a great characters design and detailed ambiences that gives the game an impressive and coherent visual impact. I really have appreciated the voice acting as well, great voices, performances and accents.\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY & STORYTELLING. Yes, this game's core is the story itself which I can't spoil, amazing and surprising, not to mention heavily influenced by all your choices made during your run. Not to mention the way the story is being told, with all characters, dialogues, and situations shown with precise camera settings and so on. Everything supported and enforced by an episodic structure, which helps giving more focus on the story than the gameplay.---CONs--- GAMEPLAY. Gameplay is really simple and basic, there are no actual riddles, and even though you can move and click to make few actions it mostly reduces to Quick Time Events and dialogue choices. I actually didn't mind about it too much as the story is the real core of the game, but I could have used some more action, be it moving and fighting or be it clicking for riddles\nBUGS. I've read of lots of people having crash or freezes, but none of those ever happened, and I'm playing on a Win 10 x64 laptop, one of the worst compatibility situation. I can't really confirm any of those. What I can do is tell of the HUGE glitch I've witnessed (as many others, you can read about it in the steam discussion, watch out for spoilers) at the very very last chapter of the final Episode (5), where consecutive dialogue boxes keep saying "This choice is blank!", and then you pass from a previous ambience to another without being able to do anything with incomplete and floating part of characters models. And this is a very common glitch, which was never fixed, and it's quite ridiculous. Luckily for me loading the checkpoint again was enough to play the correct final chapter without any glitch.","May 23","true","10.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is something I have not experienced before, not on this scale. The Walking Dead is not even close. what really intensifies the decision making is the protagonist of Bigby Wolf. A crude anti-hero that you can role play a bit with. During my first playthrough, I chose a direct route, I had the opportunity to violence when it became so - and the blood flowed. A private investigator got a taste of my fist, another man's face I introduced into a glass bottle and then I tore an arm off. Because I'm the big bad wolf.\n\nAs the rhythmic music flows, I wander aimlessly around while dark figures pass me by. My white shirt is rumpled and unkempt, with sleeves rolled-up. My black tie is loose, but I do not care in the slightest. The neon purple lights cast sharp shadows on me and framing my bitter facial expression. Then I fall into the darkness, my eyes shimmering yellow for a moment. I lead the cigarette to my lips and takes a puff: it brightens up my face ... My name is Bigby Wolf and I'm Fable Towns sheriff.\n\nIt all reminds me of the series Once Upon a Time. We are in a city populated by mythical beings disguised as ordinary people - refugees from the city that obviously is not quite as it was told to me as a small child. Fable Town was a promised new beginning but the oh so familiar bureaucracy is hard on the less fortunate. It is a painful story that already after the first episode feels hopeless. No happy ending in sight, just dark storm clouds.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us is an interactive story where the gameplay takes a back seat . Even more than in Telltale Games last Games, The Walking Dead. Most time will be spent in the dialogues and quick time events, the fact is that the game is full of them. In such a dialogue driven games, it is essential that both the voice actors and the script is good. With a broad smile, I can say that Telltale Games has outdone themselves many times over. Nothing sounds contrived, it is an exceptional performance.","March 9, 2014","true","9.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Well, unless you're for some reason not fond of the visual style Telltale's been using, can't stand the copious amounts of cartoony gore, or simply hate fairy tales, except this one definitely lacks a happy ending.\n\nSpeaking from an artist's perspective, The Wolf Among Us blows The Walking Dead completely out of the water in terms of visual narration (well, we're obviously not talking a brown and muddy zombie apocalypse here), it's a lot more colorful and cinematographic, and the attention to detail in some shots is mindblowing - I could barely prevent myself from hitting F12 every time another pretty picture popped up on my screen.\n\nHaving previously never read the Fables comics that the game is based on, I cannot speak for the faithfulness of the adaptation, but I can assure you that Telltale's writers took great care that the player/reader never gets lost in the story: you don't have to resort to looking up information in order to familiarize yourself with ANY of the characters, or the setting.\n\nIt's very difficult to speak about the story without spoiling it one way or another, so let me just draw a quick comparison of this game to The Walking Dead one:\n\n- More action. Game is packed to the gills with quick time events. Expect a lot of frantic button mashing, especially when you're not expecting it.\n- More gore. TWAU is a game practically soaked in blood. You'd think TWD would be more gory due to the whole Zombie Apocalypse business going on, but it makes perfect sense in the end as TWD takes a far more realistic approach. TWAU? Expect fountains of blood gushing out. On top of a pile of torn off limbs. It's okay, it'll all heal back anyway! Now let's do it again!\n- More talk. Remember that this game is a hardboiled detective drama. I wouldn't say it has puzzle elements per se, but you do get to conduct a few interrogations and listen to some teary-eyed claims, which is a welcome change of pace from ripping people's limbs off and beating them to a bloody pulp with said limbs. Or vice versa.\n- More choices. Don't get me wrong, the game still does not allow you complete freedom, but the impact of your actions/words feels quite a bit more severe than in TWD. Game continuously forces you to choose between several options, thus adding quite a bit of replayability value. And that's great.\n\nAll in all, it's quite a thrilling ride, and, considering its ending, I'm fairly sure we're not yet done with this story... Not even one bit.","December 8, 2013","true","9.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's based on the Fables comic book series. You play as Bigby Wolf, or The Big Bad Wolf, who is sheriff of Fabletown. It follows through a string of connected murdles that lead through an unpredictable story that's witty and deceptive. There's so much to love about this game, you can go into it knowing nothing of the comic series, as I did, and still get so much out of it. It's perfect as a prequel and it definitely sparked an interest to check out the comics.\n\nThe story is strung together throughout all 5 episodes, and Bigby really shows why he's called The Big Bad Wolf, he makes a perfect sheriff and can definitely back up his bark with his bite, which episode 5 showcased completely what he's capable of if pushed to his limits. I thought episode 5 brought the season to a perfect close, but also leaves the door open just enough for a second season.\n\nThe controls are easy, choosing what to say when prompted, exploring environments is fun and rewarding, and the script is perfect, especially Bigby's lines. It made me laugh, made me cry, made me sad, and I really felt like I connected with the characters and Fabletown. I really feel like this is Telltale's best work and that's saying something, considering how much I love The Walking Dead.\n\nThere's nothing I can really say is wrong with the game, the choices you make seamlessly weave the story along and I felt like my choices affected the story in a way that felt very personal. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes comic books or fans of Telltale Games, or even if you liked The Walking Dead game....no not Survival Instinct. But definitely give it a try! You won't regret it. It has an amazing story, the graphics are beautiful and really looks like a comic book. The Wolf Among Us deserves so much more mainstream attention than it has received.\n\nTL;DR  One of the best story based games I have ever played hands down. They need to make a sequel to this game.

They continue with their steady decline away from it in the effort to focus on storytelling instead, as if the two are mutually exclusive somehow in their mind. Having said that, The Wolf Among Us manages to deliver a compelling story, if a bit blase for the fans of the detective genre, which manages to keep you engaged and its structure as a mystery seems to work really well with the now alredy tried-and-true episodic format. Extremely well-realized main character benefits from having relatively diverse dialog options which help define his personality along the way, whether he ends up as a chain-smoking stoic or someone else depending on your choices. Supporting characters succeed at being memorable, with couple of exceptions, and help propel the game further with possible future twists and turns hinted towards by the game's system messages.\n\nIn the end, this is a game bearing Telltale Games' characteristic hallmarks and flair - you know what to expect length-wise, characterization-wise and you're already crossing your fingers for another season.

It takes place in the world of the Fables comics, where characters from myths and fairytales are alive and living in modern-day New York. Through the course of the game, you make choices through dialog trees and point-and-click adventure gameplay, which can cause (mildly) divergent paths throughout the plotline, making the game's experience your own. The story itself deals with a noir-esque mystery, where you take on the role of Sheriff Big B. Wolf, aiming to solve a murder.\n\nThe game, taken as a whole, is very well crafted. Voice acting is top-notch, and there's some rather subtle lore and information spread throughout - it was wholly enjoyable and I highly recommend it. The one negative that I would say about the game is that there are a large number of action sequences which use QTE to resolve themselves, so if QTE are not your cup of tea, that may drag down on your opinion of the game. It's difficult to get into much greater detail without delving into the plot itself, which is the whole point with these games, so I'll leave it at that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabezs/recommended/250320/","jabezs","Jabez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabezs/","668 products in account","So this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.\n\nI still think The Walking Dead ep1 was better overall, however TWAU boasts a much better opening chapter/your choices have a larger impact upon the guaranteed events/the setting allows for some very interesting things you wouldn't be able to try in a post-apoc WD-universe game. I still love Lee/Clem, but playing as the Big Bad Wolf was assuredly just as fantastic.\n\nIt's set itself up for a really good sequel - one with a proper plot continuation, that draws heavily from the comics, which are also amazing. The game has loads of iconic moments, and true badassery you can't find in many games nowadays.\n\nOnly negative things I'd say:\n- You don't appear to be able to get all of the Fables entries/collectables by naturally going through it; aiming for a particular character needs to be broken occassionally if you care about the 100%.\n- Because the dialogue you select isn't EXACTLY what Bigby says, if you're not 100% concentrating/reading it several ways, a few accidental choices could be made. :'(\n- Due to the nature of only being able to have so many responses, a lot of the time you're really wanting to say something that there just isn't an option for (tho the genre can't really avoid this tbh).\n- Episodes 2 and 3 are pretty short, and not as good as the stunning 1, 4, 5 - TellTale appear to have grasped back their quality, after a rough patch (probs coinciding with the GoT/Borderlands/other TWAU eps' release dates/TWDep2/etc).\n\n\nOverall, buy it... You really have no reason not to; the price is so low when on sale, and although you won't rack as many hours as you will on some other games, each hour will almost always be far more emotional/interesting/etc than far too many other games. I had a lot less hours on this, than I did TWDep1, but it felt just as long - it has none of the walking about to find clues/puzzle solving/long character dialogues that TWD had, and replaces it with much more action/narrative; both are still great. A nice feature that almost replaces the puzzle solving is how you can be wrong - the game openly invites you to guess at suspects/etc, and if you haven't been paying attention to what has unfolded before you, the story can change nicely.\n\nggwp telltale","July 8, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for those kind of games. Once again, Telltale games has revitalized the entire genre with The Wolf Among Us.\n\nI purposefully kept a blind ear and eye to every single bit of information/reviews/videos when it came to this game and what it was about, until the moment I could play it for myself. I was more than pleasantly surprised to discover it was based on the comics I have been reading and enjoying for the past few months--The Fables series. And I have to say, it really does the comic book series justice, both in style and character.  But don't worry, even if you've never read the series you can easily delve deeply into the world this game presents.\n\nWho doesn't like a good murder mystery? It's even better when you get to take the role of detective (or in this case, Sheriff), sniffing out clues and interrogating suspects, piecing together evidence bit by bit. In this case, you are none other than the Big Bad Wolf, who has been assigned to bring law and order to Fabletown: a magical and rather grisly place tucked away in New York, where many creatures of legend and fairytale characters have been exiled to live. As you can expect, not everybody plays nicely with each other, and pretty soon things end up bloody.  I love how the game really gives you complete control over your character's personality and detective skills, though it could be frustrating at times when you come to realize something major yourself...only to wait and guide your character to eventually come to the same conclusion.\n\nMost point-and-click adventures let you explore freely and take your time, it's all rather leisurely. And although there is plenty of room to explore around Fabletown, taking your time really isn't an option. At all. To me, though, this only adds to the tension and excitement you feel as the story unfolds. The game is highly cinematic in nature, so that if you step away or stop paying attention for one moment....you could miss a critical clue, lose your sway in a conversation, or worse. You must constantly be on your toes and ready to make decisions that help shape the way your character is perceived and solve the case. Not only that, it makes the game nearly impossible to want to stop playing, and that's a very good thing. I found myself glued to the seat and highly focused for each and every episode of this.\n\nThe game reminds me of an old noir crime movie, with plenty of seedy characters, red herrings, blood, sex, brutal fistfights and relentless twists and turns. It's highly intellectual and really forces you to think for yourself, but I guarantee you will always be second-guessing yourself throughout, playing back old conversations and situations to make sure you did the right thing.  After all, the game is filled with varying choices, and it's these nuances that not only add to the first time experience of playing--but also offer replay value.\n\nI won't spoil the end, of course, but I will say only this: If you played the game as intensely as I did, you won't be able to stop thinking about it for at least a few days. And the best kinds of games are the ones that haunt you and stay with you like that, in my opinion.","July 14, 2014","true","12.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Its unique setting with downtrodden fairy tale characters living in an 80s New York (courtesy of Bill Willingham's Fables) seems to be a perfect match for an adventure game - or a visual novel with Quick Time Events (which I believe is a more accurate description of Telltale's adventure games from the past couple of years). Is it better than The Walking Dead? I personally think so, but only because I like solving murder mysteries. Both games are good in their own right but while one explores the human condition against a backdrop of zombie apocalypse, the other provides a grittier, seedier epilogue to fairy tale characters we grew up learning about as kids.","July 20, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What you end up with is not entirely dissimilar to a\nfilm, the story's direction influenced by the choices you make.\n\nThere's a real sense of agency in these choices. You take up the role of Bigby Wolf, investigating a murder case as the sheriff of the local community of Fabletown. As you go about your investigation, touching the lives of the various characters you run into, you will see them respond to the calls you make. What do you do when you see a friend break the law? How do you respond when people disrespect you? How far are you willing to go to get answers? These are all questions you will answer through your actions, and the characters respond accordingly.\n\nThe cast of characters is vibrant. All of the major characters have a realistic and unique personality, which makes their thoughts and actions easy to relate to, while making them all stand out from the rest in one way or another. This way of writing makes sure that even with a relatively small amount of time spent interacting, you will always have a clear idea of who someone is and why you should or shouldn't like them. The voice acting is also of a very high level. Telltale veterans like Adam Harrington, Erin Yvette, Gavin Hammon and many others bring Fabletown to life in a way that that is unrivaled in the industry.\n\nAll in all, The Wolf Among Us is nothing short of a fenomenal experience. With it's accessibility, well written story and impressive characters, this is one game you should not miss out on.\n\nThis review was written at a time when all five episodes were released.","July 8, 2014","true","21.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike the other works from Telltale Games, this game doesn't take inspiration from a popular movie or game franchise, instead it crafts a very original setting (inspired by a comic) where classic "fables" left their lands to move in New York City, where they have to hide their true nature.\nThe game follows "Bigby", the Big Bad Wolf from the "Little Red Riding Hood" tale.\nBigby is the sheriff of "Fabletown" and he'll have to collaborate with other fables to uncover the macabre mysteries of fabletown's underworld.\nThe Wolf Among Us is a very intriguing thriller which explores a darker side of the classic tales we heard as kids and dips everything in an insanely well designed neo-noire atmosphere, mixing the classic detective movies from the 1950s with a stylish 1980s appearance and music.\nVery highly recommended, specially because of it's undeniable originality.","January 16","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The characters are all based off of the fairytale characters I grew up with; the Big Bad Wolf, Snow White, the Beast, Ariel, and the list goes on. Most of the time the game doesn't flat out say who these characters are either, so it is a fun guessing game to see whom you can pick out, and who you need to speak more with to discover their true identity. Like I mentioned before, all of these characters are fictional characters from fairytale land, however, they have moved from the "Home Land" to Fable Town. All of these characters must use something called a 'glamour' to keep them disguised as a human, so they can hide amongst the other humans, unnoticed.\n\nThings start to get a bit messy when a series of murders are brought to the attention of the Business Office. You play as Bigby Wolf, trying to gather as many clues and trying to form as many relationships as you can to help you uncover the truth behind these murders. Are they related? Who is to blame? Is it something much bigger than a few murdered fables?\n\nI recommend this to gamers of all abilities. I have said in other reviews, I am a beginner gamer, and I was able to complete this game series with little difficulty. However, for more competitive players, there are options for many achievements as well as unlocking information about all the fables that you could meet throughout the game.","November 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

The game's art direction is very interesting with a mix of comic style, and cell-shading (in the classic Telltale way), and all the characters are intruging and fun to interact with. I often found myself scrounging for more lore on each character, and as a completionist (albeit with little patience), I found it easy to get all the items and get all the achievements with only a couple replays for a couple chapters.\n\nAlthough the game gives you choices to make, let's be honest and say that this is Telltale... And we all know how consequential most choices actually are... That said, it's always interesting to see how character react to a-hole Bigby in contrast to "good" Bigby.\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxing game with nice soundtrack, the occasional QTEs, and a very enjoyable story. I'd highly recommend this game. I'd also highly recommend reading the original comic if you're looking for more in the Fables universe and good ol' Bigby.","February 25","true","29.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Here they find out that things are hard and hardly end 'happily ever after'. This is the background of a gritty and dark Telltale adventure where your choices make the story and helped with some quick-time events make this an action adventure too.\nThe main character is Bigby Wolf, the big bad wolf from the fairytales who is now the sheriff of 'Fabletown' and has to deal with the growing discontent of the fairytale creatures who find it hard to live as 'normal'  people. No one trusts him and everybody is scared of this beast with his bloody history. And then the unrest really starts when a murder is committed. As the story unfolds you discover that this runs way deeper and will influence the very excistence of Fabletown and its inhabitants.\n\nI really enjoyed this story, although I sometimes got frustrated by the quick-time events and the short time-period you are given to make your choices. But the story was so gripping that I finished chapters 3 to 5 in one go.\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone who like story driven games and I guarentee everyone who has read their fair share of fairytales you'll have fun recognising every character and the way they are portrayed in this modern-day fairytale.","September 21, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/250320/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","This game is supposed to be a prequel to a comic book series called Fables. It is about all sorts of fairy tale characters we know (e.g. Red Riding Hood, Beauty and Beast) who live among us as they were forced to leave their home. In Fabletown (which is part of New York) they try to blend in with the humans (who they call "mundies") and for those not having human form it proves to be difficult: an enchantment called "glamour" is a must to change forms, otherwise they are sent to "The Farm" which is not exactly a place any Fable wants to be.\n\nThe game takes place in the '80s and the player assumes the control of the Wolf from Red Riding Hood. Big Wolf - or Bigby - acts as the Sheriff of Fabletown and is set out to solve a crime that ended in the death of one of the Fables. He is aided by Snow White and other fairy tale / folklore characters we may or may not recognise.\n\nNow, if you have already played a Telltale adventure game Wolf Among Us will be familiar to you:\n\n--- there are a relatively few places where objects can be picked up or interacted with (we have the option to investigate our surroundings while the rest of the game gives us a mainly film-like experience with lots of cutscenes and dialogues)\n--- your inventory does not really get full of items and if an item can be used with another one in the environment the game tells you that\n--- there are lots of characters to speak with and during conversations you have a limited time to pick an answer - these affect the relationship you have with these people and a choice can often have dire consequences\n--- due to the availability of choices a 2nd or even a 3rd walkthrough can easily yield you new results (the changes can even affect the end game)\n--- during action sequences quick-time-events are common but the pop-up buttons are easy to hit - this is not a difficult game (the main idea here is the immersion)\n\nWolf Among Us sports an interesting story and it entertains you from start to finish while you try to find the killer of Fabletown. Since prior to this I played the Walking Dead series I can make a comparison between the two: Wolf has more action sequences and while there's drama it certainly is less emotional. Oh, and make no mistake: just because it is about fairy tale characters gore and violence (along with cursing) is common.\n\nFor fans of Telltale adventure games this is a recommended title - for newcomers it's also worth checking.","July 23, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can either allow Bigby stay as the big bad wolf or try and turn a new leaf with the dialogue and action options, I personally tried to turn over a new leaf but sometimes someone just needed a little threatening.\n\nOn top of this the design of the game from menu screen, to each episode of the game, and the credits is lovely. My favourite character designs are Bigby Wolf - the subtley of his changes and his final form are great - and Bloody Mary - her true form design is so good; the sounds accompanying her when walking, and how she shatters. I'm just insanely impressed with how well this is put together.\n\nIts fairly straight forward to complete the game with 100% achievements but there are a few things that you might miss depending on choices you make - some areas you need to pick to go to a certain destinaton first - but there are guides that'll help you figure out what you're missing and which chapters you might need to replay at the end.","August 17, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I will even admittedly say that I may have even enjoyed this series more than TellTale's famous The Walking Dead series.\n\n--Final thoughts at the bottom--\n\nGameplay\nThe game play is reminiscent to TellTales other adventure games. You progress through the story by investigating areas to find useful information or a way of proceding to the next area. Their is no complex puzzles or anything to get you stuck as the game is heavily story related so it tries to keep you progressing.\n\nMost of the gameplay is about carefully choosing your response to conversations or story event where you must choose between doing X or doing Y. Quicktime events fill in alot of the action parts and add to the intensity.\n\nGraphics\nThe cell shaded art style fits perfectly into this world they have created. The characters are well drawn and animated, some feel very recognizable. The facial movements and body movements look good, however some people still seem to walk like they have a stick up their butt(This is an issue I have with all TellTale games).\n\nThe world they have created sets the perfect setting for how the story takes place. The amount of detail they went into on some of the level design is very well done, even in places you arent around for very long. Its nice to see them still put the detail in to make this feel like a live breathing world.\n\nAudio\nThe sound is done very well in The Wolf Among Us. The background noise and ambience was well done. The music is superb for the style they are going for in this game. The theme song kinda reminds me of Farcry 3: Blood Dragon music. The ingame music was very good at setting the mood for the events happening as well as for the areas you were exploring.\n\nThe voice over work is phenomenal and is what brings this story to life. The voices chosen for each character fit their rolls perfectly. Not once did I hear any voice that I thought to myself "that doesn't fit". The emotions are portrayed very well through their voices and sucks the player into the story. Top notch voice acting all around.\n\nStory\nThe story is where this game really shines. I must admit I was never really interested in this game, nor did I really here to much about it, other than "Its good". So I went in knowing nothing about the plot or anything. Wow was I blown away by what I experienced.\n\nIt takes place in a place known as "Fabletown" which is a small community of fables built on the outskirts of a real world city(I believe its New York). This community is build up of Fables who have left "The woodlands" and have moved into city to live in a real society. However when murders start happening, fabletown turns to terror.\n\nYou, Bigby Wolf, AKA the big bad wolf, being the sheriff must hunt down and get to the bottom of whoever is behind it. One way or Another. This is The Wolf Among Us's biggest feature. The choices. Every choice you make in this game effects the story severely, even more than TellTales other games. In the walking dead when you madea choice it always felt like no matter what you did it would still end up being the same result, however the wolf among us does the opposite. Every choice effects how people in fabletown view you, which in turn effects trust, reliability, story arc changes and much more. You begin to really care about the characters. You begin to take more time with decisions, knowing that what you do could make characters love or hate you and this could effect how useful they are to you down the line.\n\nThe story progresses very fluently and keeps you wanting to know more. Their are loads of plot twists that will keep your mind bumbling for more answers. Just when you think you got it figured out, *BAM!!* plot twist. my only complaint about the story was that it was rather short, I played through all 5 episodes in less than 8hrs.\n\nFinal thoughts\nAfter going into this game knowing nothing about it other than "its good", I must say I was blown away by the world they created, and The story had me hooked and thinking about it even when I wasnt playing. The way this game makes you care for its characters is incredible and the obsolutely phenomenal voice over work brings them to life with a voice. The animation and level design is gorgeously done in TellTale's signature cell shaded art and everything plays very smooth with a smooth looking framerate, which is I know alot of problem had with the first season of the walking dead.\n\nIf you are looking for a game with a unique world and setting, with an amazing story. Then you will love the Wolf Among Us. If you are on the fence about this game, its definetly worth the buy. For a game I wasnt expecting much out of, I must say I think this may be my favourite game created by TellTale(Yes even better than the walking dead).","January 28, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike the other works from Telltale Games, this game doesn't take inspiration from a popular movie or game franchise, instead it crafts a very original setting (inspired by a comic) where classic "fables" left their lands to move in New York City, where they have to hide their true nature.\nThe game follows "Bigby", the Big Bad Wolf from the "Little Red Riding Hood" tale.\nBigby is the sheriff of "Fabletown" and he'll have to collaborate with other fables to uncover the macabre mysteries of fabletown's underworld.\nThe Wolf Among Us is a very intriguing thriller which explores a darker side of the classic tales we heard as kids and dips everything in an insanely well designed neo-noire atmosphere, mixing the classic detective movies from the 1950s with a stylish 1980s appearance and music.\nVery highly recommended, specially because of it's undeniable originality.","January 16","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The characters are all based off of the fairytale characters I grew up with; the Big Bad Wolf, Snow White, the Beast, Ariel, and the list goes on. Most of the time the game doesn't flat out say who these characters are either, so it is a fun guessing game to see whom you can pick out, and who you need to speak more with to discover their true identity. Like I mentioned before, all of these characters are fictional characters from fairytale land, however, they have moved from the "Home Land" to Fable Town. All of these characters must use something called a 'glamour' to keep them disguised as a human, so they can hide amongst the other humans, unnoticed.\n\nThings start to get a bit messy when a series of murders are brought to the attention of the Business Office. You play as Bigby Wolf, trying to gather as many clues and trying to form as many relationships as you can to help you uncover the truth behind these murders. Are they related? Who is to blame? Is it something much bigger than a few murdered fables?\n\nI recommend this to gamers of all abilities. I have said in other reviews, I am a beginner gamer, and I was able to complete this game series with little difficulty. However, for more competitive players, there are options for many achievements as well as unlocking information about all the fables that you could meet throughout the game.","November 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Jedina ozbiljna zamjerka koju imam protiv inače vrlo dobro realiziranog spoja klasične avanture i interaktivnog filma po uzoru na Fahrenheit. Možda još malo više slobode u razvoju radnje ne bi škodilo budući da je igra za razliku od The Walking Deada djelovala nekako skučenije, usmjerenije. Vjerojatno je to samo moj dojam, no opet... igre bi kao interaktivniji medij (gotovo) uvijek trebale težiti nekakvoj otvorenosti i slobodi djelovanja. Inače, ostatak posla je zbilja odlično odrađen - atmosfera kao spoj klasične bajke i noira je nešto nesvakidašnje, likovi su vrlo životopisni i uvjerljivi, VA je na trenutke zbilja odličan, a priča je realizirana sa svim elementima nečega što želiš progutati do samog kraja.

Let's speak clearly: it's a great hommage to this comics series, both respectful and capable of adding to the original. The game is an adventure game that works as a serial, with strong characters and a solid thriller story. The game's not about difficult enigmas our strange environment but it's more about trying to tell a story in an unprecedented format (except for The Walking Dead game). And it does a great job at it. Really, being the main character, choosing your answers, your way around and chasing who you think is the suspect has a real impact on the way you enjoy the story. Once again, a masterpiece for Telltame Games.\n\nCompared to The Walking Dead\n\nThough very similar to The Walking Dead (which I enjoyed), this video games series seems better to me. Despite its link to childhood themes (fairy tales coming to life), it eems more mature and works around topics like : taking responsability for your action or passion versus reason. It sure isn't as much of an emotional roller coaster as TWD. More of a philosophical tale. Besides, this one definetely has more interactivity than TWD","July 8, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

That's why we will inform you with those neat "XYZ will remember that" boxes.\n\nAlso we really love to delude you into buying the thought that "every decision can have enormous consequences", even though in the 9 hours you will play this game, there are only like 3 occasions were this statement would really be the case.\n\nNo matter what you do, the plot line will always head in the same direction, at the same speed. There's no branching path or shortcut at all. So even if you connect the clues the game gives you, you may wait a very long time till your ingame character does so. The choices you can make are once again very limited.\n\nSo much for rambling about the bad points. Now onto the good stuff, which imho fortunately outweighs everything mentioned previously.\n\nThe game is based on the DC Comic Series "Fables". Once you are into the game you immediately got that gritty noir vibe going. It's atmospheric, stylish and quite unique in the gaming sector. The cell-shading graphics fit that base very well. From what I can tell the voice acting also is very professional and completely flawless.\n\nEven though the story tends to be stereotypical at times, the characters are believable in their own motivations and actions. There's no black and white run-of-the-mill evil villain to find here. It's almost like the story arc - just like the artstyle, the music and voice acting - is once more another plattform for the twisted and crazy, but often still very likeable characters to shine through.\n\nI played through the complete game in about 9 hours and the standard price would be 22,99€ in Europe (Tier 1). That is a lot of value for your money, considering that this game feels more like watching an entire season of an interactive series then anything else.\n\nHere you go. The 'Call of Duty' of adventure games. Just like Activision took the essence of action games and multiplied it by 10 for the sake of entertainment, while leaving out the more interesting aspects of gameplay, Telltale do the same thing in their own genre. It's extremely dialogue-heavy and entertaining, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay.. go look somewhere else.","December 9, 2014","true","10.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Tell Tale did a great revamp with the point and click adventure genre and what truly shines for their newer instalments are the players dialogue and action inputs that affect that story as you progress.\n\nPlaying as Fable sheriff Bigby Wolf (The big bad wolf) you have a bad reputation for having a temper and violent tendencies. The games theme is based around judgement of character and lets you choose to whether live up to your tenacity or redeem yourself in the folks that you serve and protect.\n\nAlways thinking about your actions and seeing your consequences unfold blurs the lines of good and bad and that's what makes TWAU really stand out.

All I knew was that it was in a smilar vein to the excellent The Walking Dead games and had the same developers. I was rather delighted by an absolutely fantastic surprise of a game. An ultra-violent film noir mixed with a fantasy world.\n\nThe story sounds odd on paper but is very smart and oozes style. Basically, it's about the classic characters of fairy tales (Snow White, The Big Bad Wolf, Three Little Pigs, Beauty and the Beast, etc) having to leave their magical homeworld to escape destruction and they settle in Manhattan, in an area called Fable Town. Use of a drug called "Glamour" conceals their non-human form (if they are non human, characters such as Snow White and Beauty don't have to) and if they cannot afford Glamour, they are sent to a rural enclave, some would say prison, known as The Farm. The well off and high-ups live in an apartment complex called The Woodlands, whilst the under-classes and wretches of society live in the impoverished fringes. It's a world much like our own, far removed from any magical connotations. Don't think of the themes as being child friendly too. It's a very mature game with mature themes, with violence to boot. Think of it as the characters of Disney in the world of a film noir murder mystery.\n\nFast forward to the modern day. You play as Sheriff Bigby Wolf, aka The Big Bad Wolf, who is tasked with keeping law and order in Fabletown. He's a typical hard talking, hard living, gritty detective of classic film. A serial killler, a completely new thing for Fabletown, is on the loose and you have to stop him. During this investigation many questions are raised on class boundaries, injustice and the hardship faced by citizens of Fabletown. Bigby's moral compass is tested and sometimes he fails to keep the wolf inside him from coming out, quite literally. It's enthralling.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to The Walking Dead. It's a point and click adventure focused on player choice and story. I think it rises above Walking Dead in that the story is more compelling, the characters more interesting and overall the artistic license gives the writers more room to maneuver and craft a better story. The art direction is absolutely fantastic too. The game looks lovely, with animations being a much improved area. The soundtrack is brilliant, very subtle but never fails to convey a particular mood or sense of place.\n\nThe first episode was about 2 and a half hours long and I enjoyed every minute of it. One of the best story based games I've had the privilege of playing and if the rest of the episodes live up to this then it'll be one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nHeartily recommended. Near perfect in what it sets out to achieve.","December 14, 2013","true","10.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

Gameplay is greatly paced during the fight scenes, but not so much when you are given free roam. If you are however looking for a great universe with great story, characters and dialogue.. well, you need not look further.\nWith episode 1, The Wolf Among Us is looking like it will be a fantastic episodic experience to play through.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qXJcpciM5s","November 27, 2013","true","10.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I was therefore excited and nervous in equal shares about picking up and playing this game - these are characters I have known and loved for several years, thrown into a new medium. Let's face it: I was either going to love it or hate it.\n\nI loved it. I've just finished it - around 10 hours of pretty much straight through gameplay. I was hooked the whole time. I'm already thinking about booting it up to play it again. What if I'd made X choice instead of Y? What if I hadn't ripped someone's throat out? What if I had thrown that guy down a well? Etc., etc.,...!\n\nAnyway, to the game itself. It's an immersive blend of reading a book, playing a game and watching a film. There's very little to be done in the way of first-person character control, but that's not what this game is about. It's all about making quick decisons and watching how the consequences play out - what you decide to do and when you do it really does change the direction that the story goes in. Your actions do spread through into the later story - your decisions really can come back to haunt you!\n\nThe gameplay is extremely simple; "point and click" with limited controls to learn, though there are elements where your reactions do come into play, usually to click the mouse or press a certain key. The game does "hand-hold" you; it pretty much just walks you through what needs to be done, but not everything is predetermined - your decisions are key and you don't resent the lack of being able to wander around "sandbox style", this really isn't that sort of game. Experienced gamers and novices are put on equal footing, as there's nothing competitive about this game. It's all about decisions and consequences and character interaction. So, if you're wanting to go running around freely blasting stuff, this probably isn't for you. But then, if you're looking for cutesy fairy stories, you won't find them here either; this game is not for the easily offended! These fairy tale characters are into all of the mundane vices you'd care to name, and you can really buy into the world rendered here, despite mentions of magic mirrors, trolls, witches, talking animals and an alcoholic winged monkey who works as a librarian...\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous, all of the characters look like they stepped straight out of the books I've read time and again. The "comic book" styling associated with the graphic novels translates wonderfully into a gritty film noir atmosphere. It nicely compliments these familiar fantasy characters having to make the best of the mundane world. The sound track is brilliantly woven into the animation it accompanies, and the vocal acting is spot on. The next time I read the Fables series I'll be hearing the character's voices as represented here, it was so convincing. The game makers have studied their source material extremely well and it shows. Well done guys, you get an A+ for doing your homework properly.\n\nOne of my favourite features of the game is that the lines between good and evil are so blurred you'll soon find your moral standards shifting all over the place - one decision might have you giving money to a hard-luck hooker to help her out, but in the next scene you might choose to rip someone's arm off. You can choose, in a way, who to help and who to save. You will question whether you made the right decision, but the beautiful part is being able to play this again to make all different decisions and see where the game takes you next time.\n\nThe only minor negative with this game for me (and it really is me nitpicking) is that there are a couple of minor bugs in chapters 4 and 5 that meant a few scenes played out of order, but resetting to my last save point fixed that with relatively little bother. And, if you're into earning your achievements, then I'm afraid all the ones available in this game are story-related, so the "achievements" actually feel pretty arbitrary as all you have to do get them is play through the story a couple of times. That aside, unlocking and reading the character profiles is a nice touch and some of the content is taken straight from the Fables books, another indicator of the accuracy of this game that will appeal to Fables fans.\n\nDespite my enthusing about the series, though, you really don't have to be a Fables fan to play this game - in fact, it makes a great introduction to the series as it's really a prequel to the books. If you are familiar with the series, you should be more than happy to add this game to your library and play through it to see these wonderful characters come to life. If you're not familiar with the series, even if you're not into graphic novels, you might well get some twisted enjoyment from seeing your childhood fairytale characters in a grim and gritty re-rendering, such as "Georgie Porgie, pudding and pie, kissed the girls and made them cry"... and is now a seedy tattoed pimp who runs the Pudding 'N Pie strip club.\n\nMy major decision now is whether to go and read the books again, or replay the game... it's that good, it makes me want to go straight back to the world of Fabletown all over again. It's like a fantastic film/tv adaption that immediately makes you want to re-read a much loved book. As I say, I've just finished the game and I can't wait to play it through a second time.\n\nIn fact, I'm going to stop typing this review and go play the game again. If anyone wants me, I'll be out of touch for the next ten hours or so. Possibly twenty, if I decide I want to make a third set of choices...","July 12, 2014","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game plays similarly to the Walking Dead in that it's a point and click game where you have various dialogue choices as well as other choices to make that effect the story of the game. The Wolf Among Us is based on the Fable series of comics. It's set in a part of New York inhabited by the characters from the nursery rhymes and fairytales such as  Snow White and  Mr.Toad. All these mythical characters had to move to our world after there Homeland was destroyed.\n\nIt sounds like it might be a story for children but anything but with the characters inhabiting a gritty dark world where they have to deal with inequality and poverty and the politics that go with it. In the game you play Bigby (The Big Bad Wolf) who is the sheriff of Fabletown. He gets embroiled in a murder case and indoing so finds himself caught up in the politics of Fabletown itself as he tries to solve the crime.\n\nAs already said the gameplay is very similar to the Walking Dead as is the comic book style of animation which looks great. The games main strength is it's story which i found enthralling and it really hooked me in. The characters in this game are brilliant as well and you'll meet a lot of memorable characters from the fairytales you would have heard as a child. The great thing is the characters are all very realistic in that they have their own problems like being alcholics or struggling to pay rent and feel a lot more fleshed out than the more 2 dimensional characters they are in the old fairytales.\n\nThe Good:\n-Fantastic story with some really characters\n-Game looks nice with that comic book style of animation\n-All episodes are released now so no waiting a month or two for the next episode.\n-Game has decent replay value as it's worth playing again but making different choices to see how it changes the story.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Not a lot really. I suppose the only one i can think of is that the gameplay is identical to that off the Walking Dead. Wold have been nice to see some new ideas introduced in this area.\n\nOverall I loved this game. More than i enjoyed the Walking Dead. I know this game will mostly appeal to WD fans but this is really great in it's own right and should be a must-buy for anyone looking for a game with a great story. Especially now all the episodes have been released. 10/10","July 9, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sheriff Bigbie - the hero - is a bit of an archetype: brutal, taciturn, with his rough edges, his cigarettes and his bourbon, but it's one I enjoy.\n\nPrepare to investigate some gruesome murders and dive into the darkness of Fabletown.\n\nCareful if you're operating with an AZERTY keyboard, make sure to configure it as a QWERTY before starting, as (as far as I know, but I didn't look far into it) you cannot change the commands and part of the game relies on your ability to press the right key quickly.","July 15, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Noire set in a fantasy based world. This is the most accurate description of this game. It's definitely a gritty and dark Detective Noir flick but in a game format.\n\nI intially bought this game during last year's sale just because the Steam sales were average and this was one of the few games that went on sale that I didn't own and felt like giving a shot. This was probably one of the best decisions I could make. This game has made it into my top 5 games of all times.\n\nThe game has intense action scenes, legitimate choices that end up changing everyone perception of you in the world of Fable - whether you're The Big Bad Wolf, or the misunderstood tough guy. Wolf Among Us keeps all elements of a great mystery, just when you think you know WHODUNNIT - the stakes are changed. Every episode builds completely towards the ending, as there are no filler episodes, each is filled with teeth grinding suspense, heart pounding action, and a weird romance between the main character and Faith. I enjoy the fact that this game rarely tends to hold your hand and if you fail in doing something then you are subtley pointed in the right direction.\n\nOne of the biggest issues in this game is the choices, in the sense that some are actually pretty hard to make. I've spent probably about an hour all together with the game paused and me sitting back in my chair in contemplation of what to do because this game really does test your morality, it gives you [The Right Choice] and [What Should Be Done] simultaneously. After beating the game I saw myself sitting here biting my lip hoping I made the right choices for the citizens of Fable.\n\nAs stated above, this game earns a full two thumbs up from me. It is definitely in my top 5 and I recommend EVERYONE to purchase this, even if not on sale. It is worth it.","December 20, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Buy it. Favorite TellTale game to date.  And that's considering I played their Walking Dead game. Film noir meets a mysterious point-and-click adventure within the world of Fables. If you liked Walking Dead, this is much the same thing, but mystery and replacing the gun with, well, the wolf among us.\n\n...please don't let that line steer you away. I will say, tiny con. If you want this game, get it for the price of $15, which is three episodes. Episode 2 is, regrettably, the low point of the game. Does that make it bad? No, by no means. It just does not shine in comparison to the others. Episode 4 falls flat in the same way, but manages to learn from the Ep. 2 mistake to make it at least a tiny bit better. Effectively, you'd be paying for the price of three really fantastic episodes: the start, the middle, and the finish, while the other two episodes act as building blocks so that the next episode is entirely that much better.\n\ntl;dr - Seriously, buy it. It's flaws are omittable because this game is a fantastic 7-10 hour experience, and while I would reccommend it on sale, I would suggest to buy it at any price to support TellTale for their fantastic work.

I truly feel as though I am creating a story and drastically impacting the tone of it, where in TWD I felt like I was just managing relationships. The setting is interesting, full of history, and it is all in the background for the most part. The story is intense, with somewhat frequent actions sequences and a great feeling of risk-reward scenarios, and you are truly shaping how Bigby--the Big Bad Wolf--is seen among society and how people react to him. 10/10 so far (still waiting for 5).","June 29, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you liked Telltale's "The Walking Dead" you'll definitely like The Wolf Among Us. It's the same basic mechanics and emphasis on writing. TWAU is a bit more "racey" than TWD imo (bit o nudity and related themes, somewhat more violent), so head's up if you're touchy. All the episodes are out now, so if you pick it up in the future, you won't have to wait months between episodes! :D\n\nAgain, mechanics are very simple: choose what to say, how you meander around, and occasionally QTE sequences. The QTE sequences don't feel as grossly out of place as they do in some other titles, and the checkpoint system is very forgiving. It's all about story and all about writing. Personally, I love how the adapted the art style to this title.\n\nI won't detail the story, but the premise is an investigate drama. You represent the law, and you are trying to figure out what is going on in the background and why.\n\nI completed two full playthroughs and very much enjoyed the experience.

You can't skip the "next time on The Wolf Among Us" parts after you finish an episode. If you are like me and surprise is a big part of your enjoyment in games, these unskippable previews feel like spoilers.\n2. If you're not playing on PC, there's intermitent lagging.\n3. There are some choices, but gameplay can feel linear, a lot of choices lead to the same results, and game hold your hand in terms of find clues and stuff via showing delectables targets over items you can interact around. It might be better if game gave you a reasonable time limit when finding clues/searching for evidence and your lack of finding everything created different results. But maybe as a developer that might be too complex a thing to do, idk.\n\nGonna close by saying TWAU was awesome. I liked it better than Walking Dead because it introduced a new universe that you couldn't find on TV (lord knows how many zombie themed shows/movies we've seen recently). The big choices DO feel like big choices when you are making them, and the experience is like being part in an episodic shows ala Game of Thrones, True Detective, etc. I loved the universe, the art is beautiful, and the scripting gives every character some depth.\n\nI think Telltale is making some good interactive viewing for us video gamers, but they still have lots of room to grow. If Chrono Trigger on SNES can do 13 endings, they can do multiple endings too! Oh and I seriously suggest waiting for an entire season to come out before playing, I did so and playing through the entire season with some drinks nearby was nice :D","July 27, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was dark, immersive, and perfectly paced, with a stellar setting, and great characters.\n\nIf you've played any other Telltale games, you know what the score is: the majority of the game is picking what to say, to whom, and when, with the odd quick time event thrown in for good measure. Fortunately, the dialogue in The Wolf Among Us is almost flawless, the voice acting superb, and the QTE well-utilised - much more so than in TWD, for example.\n\nThe game builds slowly, with the first few episodes heaping on characters, clues, and difficult choices. It burns quite slowly in this way for a while, leaving you chasing a growing number of suspects, all the while unsure if you're actually measuring up to the task before you. The hardest decisions you make will be the ones that are only slightly different shades of grey, and, for most of the game, it's never obvious which is the "right" choice to make.\n\nThis all changes in the season's finale, though. After chasing your own tail all over Fabletown, the final episode is an explosion of revelations and action. The rising tension cultivated throughout the previous episodes gets shattered and replaced with some of the toughest decisions of all, and a climax that is bittersweet at best. Whilst you definitely feel you've earned /a/ victory, it certainly isn't easy or pain-free, and you're still left in the dark as to whether or not you did the right thing as the credits roll. But that's fine - the beauty of the game is that it concludes in a satisfying way without giving you an answer.\n\nShould you play The Wolf Among Us? I don't think even Bigby would struggle over the right answer on this one. It's a stylish, mature, and often-violent look at fairy tale characters in our world, and it's more than worth the asking price.","December 4, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm sure we all grew up watching some sort of "fable" or what have you or at the least we understand who they are. For example, the big bad wolf, snow white, three little pigs, etc. Now imagine them all in an adult like setting pretty much fighting crime and/or  being the main cause of it, to me that is just a well thought of way to incorporate our childhood to adulthood and that is what "The Wolf Among Us" has done.

Take for example the transitions from one scene to the next, and the facial animations; they're executed extremely well in comparison to many of Telltale's other games.\n\nBesides that the world of fables within The Wolf Among Us is extremely intriguing and the game as a whole touches on many mature themes and problems with modern society while still being ultimately grounded in a fantasy world and allowing the player to step in the shoes of the big bad wolf.\n\nFrom my perspective if you want a thrill ride like The Walking Dead you're looking at the wrong game, but if you want a better told more interesting story intended for a more mature individual you should buy The Wolf Among us. It doesn't hurt that the action sequences available within the game are ultimately better executed as well, you just have to be patient sometimes before you get to them.","July 30, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can't skip the "next time on The Wolf Among Us" parts after you finish an episode. If you are like me and surprise is a big part of your enjoyment in games, these unskippable previews feel like spoilers.\n2. If you're not playing on PC, there's intermitent lagging.\n3. There are some choices, but gameplay can feel linear, a lot of choices lead to the same results, and game hold your hand in terms of find clues and stuff via showing delectables targets over items you can interact around. It might be better if game gave you a reasonable time limit when finding clues/searching for evidence and your lack of finding everything created different results. But maybe as a developer that might be too complex a thing to do, idk.\n\nGonna close by saying TWAU was awesome. I liked it better than Walking Dead because it introduced a new universe that you couldn't find on TV (lord knows how many zombie themed shows/movies we've seen recently). The big choices DO feel like big choices when you are making them, and the experience is like being part in an episodic shows ala Game of Thrones, True Detective, etc. I loved the universe, the art is beautiful, and the scripting gives every character some depth.\n\nI think Telltale is making some good interactive viewing for us video gamers, but they still have lots of room to grow. If Chrono Trigger on SNES can do 13 endings, they can do multiple endings too! Oh and I seriously suggest waiting for an entire season to come out before playing, I did so and playing through the entire season with some drinks nearby was nice :D","July 27, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I truly feel as though I am creating a story and drastically impacting the tone of it, where in TWD I felt like I was just managing relationships. The setting is interesting, full of history, and it is all in the background for the most part. The story is intense, with somewhat frequent actions sequences and a great feeling of risk-reward scenarios, and you are truly shaping how Bigby--the Big Bad Wolf--is seen among society and how people react to him. 10/10 so far (still waiting for 5).","June 29, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have yet to read the comics so I won't venture on the subject of how faithful it is to the source material, but as a standalone, it's good. The ambience is that of a film noir, and the dark take on fairytales characters is a pleasure. It's exciting to place them and their tales, and see what the creators made of them. Sheriff Bigbie - the hero - is a bit of an archetype: brutal, taciturn, with his rough edges, his cigarettes and his bourbon, but it's one I enjoy.\n\nPrepare to investigate some gruesome murders and dive into the darkness of Fabletown.\n\nCareful if you're operating with an AZERTY keyboard, make sure to configure it as a QWERTY before starting, as (as far as I know, but I didn't look far into it) you cannot change the commands and part of the game relies on your ability to press the right key quickly.","July 15, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Take for example the transitions from one scene to the next, and the facial animations; they're executed extremely well in comparison to many of Telltale's other games.\n\nBesides that the world of fables within The Wolf Among Us is extremely intriguing and the game as a whole touches on many mature themes and problems with modern society while still being ultimately grounded in a fantasy world and allowing the player to step in the shoes of the big bad wolf.\n\nFrom my perspective if you want a thrill ride like The Walking Dead you're looking at the wrong game, but if you want a better told more interesting story intended for a more mature individual you should buy The Wolf Among us. It doesn't hurt that the action sequences available within the game are ultimately better executed as well, you just have to be patient sometimes before you get to them.","July 30, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you liked Telltale's "The Walking Dead" you'll definitely like The Wolf Among Us. It's the same basic mechanics and emphasis on writing. TWAU is a bit more "racey" than TWD imo (bit o nudity and related themes, somewhat more violent), so head's up if you're touchy. All the episodes are out now, so if you pick it up in the future, you won't have to wait months between episodes! :D\n\nAgain, mechanics are very simple: choose what to say, how you meander around, and occasionally QTE sequences. The QTE sequences don't feel as grossly out of place as they do in some other titles, and the checkpoint system is very forgiving. It's all about story and all about writing. Personally, I love how the adapted the art style to this title.\n\nI won't detail the story, but the premise is an investigate drama. You represent the law, and you are trying to figure out what is going on in the background and why.\n\nI completed two full playthroughs and very much enjoyed the experience.

The game is set in a fictional New York City where you (Bibgy Wolf) are the sherriff of a secret part of New York called Fable Town, where you enforce the laws and protect all of the town's citizens.  And if you cannot tell, this game is full of fairy tale characters ranging from old myths, to goblins & trolls.\n\nThe game is also based upon a comic book series I had not heard of until I heard of this game about last year, and soon after I had heard of this game's existence my sister had gotten Fables: Deluxe Edition vol. 1 from her old boyfriend, and I "borrowed" it from her big library of books and had a bit of a read.  It got me interested in what the game was about and had this urge to play the demo on my PS3, and after I played it I was extremely excited for the day that this game came down in price on Steam...that day finally came one morning during a Steam Summer Sale and I purchased it immediately...I can safely say, that that was a wise choice, as this was quite possibly one of the best story-based game expriences since The Walking Dead.\n\nI love the graphics.  The cell-shading was a great choice for the game as it fit the comic's art style and if you look at the game from a certain distance, you could swear that you are looking at a comic panel.  I think Telltale did a marvellous job re-creating the look of a comic really well, and at the same time, capturing the comic's noirish tone and style.\n\nThe voice acting is amazingly done, with Adam Harrington nailing Bigby in both voice and tone, while also putting his best into the character.  He easily did the best job out of all the other voice actors in this game, and I salute him for his great performance.\n\nThe writing and story are also really well-done, as per usual from Telltale at this point,  and really put you in the mind of the Big Bad Wolf.  The writing is smart, and occasionally kind of hilarious, adding just that little bit of that trademark Telltale humor...sort of.  And the best part about the story is that it isn't confusing...it's easy to understand and if you haven't read the comic, then you don't have to worry about not knowing everything about this franchise's lore because this game's chronologically set before the events of the comic...THANK YOU, TELLTALE!\n\nAnd I really like the characters...especially Toad, because...he's a toad, 'nuff said.  But I also really like Bigby, because he is a well-written character with an interesting personality that almost any gamer can enjoy getting to know.  And all the "villians" always try to worm their way out of just about every situation you throw them in, and I punch them in their faces every time, and I find the villians incredibly well-written, (especially one certain villian that I won't spoil) and it makes making important decisions even more thought-provoking.\n\nOverall, this is a great mystery story with fantastically well-written characters, amazing voice acting, great soundtrack by Jared Emerson Johnson, astounding atmosphere and terriffic art style...that's why I recommend The Wolf Among Us.","July 8, 2014","true","36.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It was dark, immersive, and perfectly paced, with a stellar setting, and great characters.\n\nIf you've played any other Telltale games, you know what the score is: the majority of the game is picking what to say, to whom, and when, with the odd quick time event thrown in for good measure. Fortunately, the dialogue in The Wolf Among Us is almost flawless, the voice acting superb, and the QTE well-utilised - much more so than in TWD, for example.\n\nThe game builds slowly, with the first few episodes heaping on characters, clues, and difficult choices. It burns quite slowly in this way for a while, leaving you chasing a growing number of suspects, all the while unsure if you're actually measuring up to the task before you. The hardest decisions you make will be the ones that are only slightly different shades of grey, and, for most of the game, it's never obvious which is the "right" choice to make.\n\nThis all changes in the season's finale, though. After chasing your own tail all over Fabletown, the final episode is an explosion of revelations and action. The rising tension cultivated throughout the previous episodes gets shattered and replaced with some of the toughest decisions of all, and a climax that is bittersweet at best. Whilst you definitely feel you've earned /a/ victory, it certainly isn't easy or pain-free, and you're still left in the dark as to whether or not you did the right thing as the credits roll. But that's fine - the beauty of the game is that it concludes in a satisfying way without giving you an answer.\n\nShould you play The Wolf Among Us? I don't think even Bigby would struggle over the right answer on this one. It's a stylish, mature, and often-violent look at fairy tale characters in our world, and it's more than worth the asking price.","December 4, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Light on puzzles and inventory, linear but will remember dialogue decisions to offer slightly different progression. The graphics are spot on, voice acting is perfect and character models and facial animation is top notch. It is a beautiful and thrilling title to play.\n\nWhat is isn't however is a traditional adventure game. The majority of dialogue prompts are time based, there are also quick time/button bashing sequences which are terrible on a touch pad. Controller or mouse is a must. It's a game that will require full attention and not allow time to decide on what to say, which I like but worth being aware of if a traditional point and click is what you are after.\n\nHighly recommended.","September 16, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Wolf Among Us is an excellent multilayered mystery narrative that involves all your favorite fairy tale characters in a much darker context than you remember them. Like most Telltale games it’s more interactive story than game, one that is pretty much set on a predetermined path, but the specific choices you make can lead to some pretty crazy variations here and there and the final episode's last few minutes are still a subject of considerable debate among fans. If you're looking for a casual story-driven game with a cool art style you should pick this game up; prior knowledge of the Fables universe isn't necessary but I suppose it doesn't hurt.","May 17, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, such notions proved unfounded shortly into the first episode. The Wolf Among Us is a prequel to the Fables comic book series which I've never read; you truly don't need to in order to enjoy this game. The Wolf Among us portrays various fairy tale characters tied together such as The Big Bad "Bigby" Wolf, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and one of the Three Little Pigs in "our" world; in a noir-esque downtrodden section of the Bronx. This game may ruin your childhood; in the world of Fables, ever present is prostitution, murder, and drugs amongst other crimes.(If you've ever wanted to see the Little Mermaid pole dance topless, then this may be the game for you, you degenerate perv.)You play as Bigby, the sheriff of Fabletown who must solve a string of murders which is something of a very rare occurrence. As to not give anything away, I will not say anymore. The only downside that I can possibly think of, albeit small, is the somewhat abrupt cliffhanger of an ending which there are various theories floating around as to what it could mean. However, there is supposed to be a season 2 to The Wolf Among us. Regardless, if you liked The Walking Dead game(s), what Nolan did for Batman in terms of realism, and/or you’re simply a kinky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to see fairy tale characters degrade themselves, buy this game.","June 25, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The story is interesting, entertaining and morally ambigious. It is how the player reacts to the moral questions that decides where the story is going.\n\nThe Bad:\nOne of the biggest shortcomings of this game is its limited interactivity. Sometimes you seemingly just listen to conversations and watch events unfold for minutes at a time, without having the chance to effect change. Worse, even when given the chance to make a choice, it is often only cosmetic. The other problem I had were the numerous quick time events, they felt simplistic, and a contrived way to create tension.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThe story and moral choices are what makes this game entertaining. Though the game struggles to offer meaningful interactivity in many situations, and is a tad heavy on the quick time events. I hope Tell Tale Games can look to their excellent Walking Dead Season I to improve upon that in the next season for Wolf Among Us. Don't think its worth the full price, but definitely worth a consideration when it is on sale.","July 10, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

It's similar in structure to The Walking Dead games (also developed by TellTale), in that it's more of an interactive movie than a classic point-and-click adventure game, but that's just fine by me. With such a story-heavy focus, it's a good thing that The Wolf Among Us has an absolutely superb story (as well as fantastic voice acting).\n\nThe basic premise is that all the fairytale/fable creatures and characters (The Big Bad Wolf, Snow White, Jack (and the Beanstalk), Tweedle Dee and Dum, etc.) are displaced from their original homeland and now live incognito in the slums of 1980's New York City. They have to hide their magical nature from the "mundies" (mundane, normal people), and in the case of non-humanoid fables, have to buy expensive "glamour' spells to appear human. You play Sheriff Bigby Wolf (like "Big B. Wolf", geddit?), ostensibly solving a murder mystery, though things quickly become more complex. The game deals with the issues of political corruption, prostitution and human trafficking, torture, as well as a heavy dose of considering whether the ends justifies the means (and depending on the situation, you might be surprised at what you choose).\n\nA lot of the choices you make aren't black and white "good vs. evil" choices - they're just choices, with various different and very real consequences. Your choices and actions affect how different characters react to you and how the story plays out in pretty major ways.\n\nIf you enjoyed The Walking Dead (game), or just enjoy good stories in general, I highly recommend The Wolf Among Us.","July 9, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not sure how I managed to avoid any advertising / hype, but after Telltale's previously excellent zombie adventure, I didn't need to consider for long.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was how good the game looked. The comic book-styling seen in The Walking Dead is taken notch further, with heavier contrast and brighter colors, painting very vivid film noir-look, accompanied with appropriately smoky and moody soundtrack. Easily the most stylized adventure by Telltale so far.\n\nMost observant eye may catch some familiar animation frames from TWD, but such detail is lost to the imaginative and lively character cast. It's this godforsaken bunch of familiar storybook characters on the junky Brooklyn backdrop that I really started growing into. The trope isn't especially new, with McGee's Alice and also Batman Arkham series having played with the idea, but instead of gothically twisted version of themselves, being thrown in the middle of Chinatown(the movie) works itself to much juicier drama (and healthy dose of brutal violence).\n\nI wasn't previously familiar with the series, but the game does good job introducing you to the universe, with both pacing and further reading. Although the writing in the game is as serious as any good noire story is, it does leave some space for character's to self realise on the absurdity of their existance, where a bunch of comedy is derived from.\n\nThe gameplay is familiar 80% dialogue with some QTE'ish action thrown in. The action scenes seemed to take a bit more cues from the yesteryear's Jurassic Park, but kept the rumble short and sweet. Kudos for the game to cleverly disguise a puzzle in form of dialogue I didn't realise I was doing until towards the end.\n\nAs the end credits rolled, only thing I felt bad about was that I didn't wait long enough, that I could've just hopped straight to the next episode.","October 23, 2013","true","46.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That alone is pretty much enough to sell it to me, and it delivers on the promise of dark, gritty twists on classic characters while also involving you deeply in the world around as it unveils itself right along with the mystery you're tracking.\n\nIt's mature and has plenty of adult themes, but it doesn't indulge in these things just for the sake of them. The darker content fits very well with the sleazy underworld it's showing to you, and the writing and acting are consistently excellent from start to finish. Mystery, black humour, sudden brutal violence, and a great cast of weird, slightly crazy characters makes this one of the most enjoyable worlds to dive into in recent years. Telltale really knows how to capture a fictional setting well, so if you're into point and click adventures with emphasis on story over puzzles, you can't go wrong with this one.","September 18, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not too loud to annoy me ear. Not too silent for making sleepy.\n- The story: Even the game is based on Story driven but Choice matters, and a lot of plot twist involve. Replayable ability makes a strong consideration based on achievement and community of TellTales.\n- Gameplay: The interaction is not much but very satisfying, and the ground gets strong effect of my choices.\n- Other: Playing as the strongest character is just cool as its finest.\n\nCons:\n- Alot of emotion confuses me, and moreover, too hard to consider which choice to pick.\n- Sometimes, bug and glitch appear and make the choice boxes blank.\n\nUltimately Strongly Recommend: 10/ 10","November 8, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's dark, gritty, violent, and well written.  As soon as the game starts within the first 5 minutes, you really get an idea of how the tone for the entire game is going to be.  The characters are all well written, and the voice acting is well done all around.\n\nAs you go throuth the games 5 episodes, you will be forced to make a lot of choices, and often times the game doesn't give you a lot of time to think which makes the siutations that much more tense.  These decisions have very serious consequences that last over the course of the entire game.  You will find youself regretting choices, and wondering what could have happened if you had chosen another course of action.  At the end of each chapter the game gives you a break down telling you what % of the players made the same choices you did which gives an interesting point of view.\n\nThe game ending for me at least was very satisfying, maybe if I had chosen differently I would have felt differently, but this is really an amazing game overall, with potential replay value in going back to replay the story and make different chioces just to see how the decision have a ripple effect on other events.

The graphics work well with this environment, and should even work with APU graphics.  As with other Tell Tale titles everything is polished, works well, and thought out.  It is a well engineered game.\n\nThe last episode is really disappointing.  The boss battle is laughable the way it ends, I'll spare you the spoiler details, but you will laugh.  After the boss battle the game ends with about 30 minutes of talking with various characters as the story wraps it self up.  It was very anti-climatic.  The second, third, and fourth episodes were the best.  The first and fifth were slow and uninteresting.\n\nOverall, The Wolf Among us can feel like a chore.  A bit like watching a movie that started good but lost your interest.  But the middle of the series was so good I have to recommend this game.  Its worth a play.  Many of the decisions that you have to make will leave you with regret, and that's what makes Tell Tale games great.","July 26, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is based off the Fables graphic novels, which is an amazing concept. I love the game's style, humor, plot, characters, and I would also say writing if it had been more thought-out.\n\nIt's a game entirely devoid of common sense at times: "Why would you do that, Bigby? What's wrong with you? Why you can't you ___ or ___!". Well, why? Because I was almost murdered an abundant amount of times, because these people are suspected of murder, because I'm just trying to get information, and etc. And, the dialogue is based off these outlandish notions that have no sense to it.\n\nIt's not a small issue, but extremely prevelant, so much so that I find myself stuck with these or similar thoughts almost every single scene in the game. There's a whole lot of whining, going circles and circles, in a story that's otherwise extremely interesting. Still, it's a very nice adventure I'm glad I took.\n\nEdit done to cut down on unneccessary length.","July 9, 2014","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/recommended/250320/","dracosummoner","dracosummoner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/","180 products in account","A tremendously well-crafted prequel to Bill Willingham's "Fables" comics, Telltale's interactive story The Wolf Among Us is a murder mystery on the surface, but it quickly becomes an engrossing character drama and an often subtle indictment of a deeply unjust society.  The fairy-tale inhabitants of Fabletown, a magical community in modern-ish New York City that must continually conceal its existence from the mundane world, are guarded by one Sheriff Big Bad "Bigby" Wolf, who makes his best effort to keep his inconsistently grateful brethren from tearing each other apart ... at least, if he wants to.\n\nThere's not much traditional gameplay, but it does as much as it needs to: you can move Bigby manually in small environments and click on objects and people to interact with them.  You technically have an inventory, but you generally don't need to manually drag objects to use them in the environment; special context prompts pop automatically when needed so you don't waste time with trial and error.  Fights and action sequences are quick-time events, sometimes with "did you remember which door the bad guy used" challenges, but most of your time is spent watching cutscenes and making choices in menus.\n\nIf you haven't played a Telltale game of this sort, dialogue usually gives you up to four choices and a realistic but lenient time limit.  Bigby is a deeply interesting character who genuinely wants to do the right thing for a community that isn't always honest or trusting, but he doesn't have a lot of patience or decorum, so whether you play him as sort-of-compassionate or brutal and merciless, it feels plausible either way.  Choices sometimes follow more of an intelligent/"what's-the-point"-stupid dichotomy than straightforward good/evil as it is, but it's worth noting that a few isolated sections feel railroaded for the sake of drama.\n\nMany of the most interesting aspects of this role-playing come in the form of Sheriff Bigby's adherence to Fabletown law, which makes logical/pragmatic sense but often interferes with the day-to-day lives of the community, especially its poorer inhabitants who often have trouble affording the spell needed to maintain the human appearance that allows them to keep their home.  You can choose to selectively enforce or effectively loosen some of these laws, but the game maintains its morally gray atmosphere by making pleasing everybody impossible.\n\nYou're arguably better off the less you know about the comics, because as a prequel, some of the choices in The Wolf Among Us are consequential to how the game plays out but are rendered moot very early in the books.  You meet a wide variety of fictional and supernatural characters whose interpretations and stories (such as how Beauty and the Beast are getting along, which ties into the well-focused plot) feel very adult without coming across as unsuitably 'edgy.'  The story gently introduces the rules of the setting and the attributes of its characters as it goes, and the most interesting thing about this magical community is how utterly realistic it feels, such that you might not notice some of the more fantastic aspects until stray lines of dialogue point them out.\n\nGraphic content is usually handled well: some fights and other scenes are intensely and shockingly gory (ever set a protuding bone via QTE?), and the sexual content and its impacts on the storyline are introspective and often disturbing enough to keep from feeling like needless fan service.  The language and--if you're not used to this from the story universe--the smoking seem much more gratuitous but are probably the dialogue's biggest "flaws," so to speak.  Performances are astonishingly well done all around, especially from the few child characters, and some characters feel more likable/less standoffish here than they do in the early Fables volumes.\n\nThe characters themselves are generally everything except boring: admirable, treacherous, cynical, rage-inducing, sympathetic, admirable, heartless, psychotic, selfish, perverted, resourceful, and even funny on a scant few occasions (often more than one of these at different times) in what is otherwise a very serious tale.  You'll be encouraged to feel a wide variety of emotions, usually without feeling like the story is stretching for or depending on them.  You'll probably have your heart broken more than once, and while the story has its share of twists, the journey and the conclusion feel satisfying even as the first episode is arguably the best and probably the longest (about two hours when the whole set took me roughly six) and most informative of the five.\n\nAt the end of all episodes except the last, there's a TV show-style epilogue that sets up the events of the next installment, and each episode shows you how your choices compared to other players', no matter whether a given dilemma was popularly difficult to resolve or wound up heavily tilted toward one outcome.  You can revisit individual scenes in an episode--the game will note when this overwrites your progress--so you don't have to replay the entire thing to see different outcomes, fill up the secrets gallery, or recall how a certain moment played out.  The characters have their own little biographies that are well worth reading, even as some of these showcase the same events in very different lights, and these segue well into the books if you do (and in my opinion should) go on to read those.\n\nWith a wonderful and thoughtful story designed to appeal to adults who can accept its mature and intense subject matter, incredible art design that easily looks as good as the comic it's based on, and plenty of replay value (even if you can't bear to play Bigby as dim or 'evil'), The Wolf Among Us is a more than worthy entry into the Fables universe.","April 11","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's what.\n\n✓ Good story with loose ends\n✓ Nice, fitting soundtrack\n✓ Great characters\n\n✗ QTE abuse\n✗ Choices matter? Not really\n\nVerdictTake a bunch of fairy tale characters, turn them into humans, put them in New York trying to live like normies, have the big bad wolf as the sheriff trying to keep the order and the result is The Wolf Among Us.\n\nThe game is inspired in noir novels, so there's a lot of mystery and violence. It's completely story-driven, and as usual with Telltale games, you have to make choices that will shape the story around you. Sounds great, right? Well, it has its cons... for starters, when you try to fix arguments like a civilized gentleman (see: punching the fables unconscious/ripping them apart), there's a lot of QTEs, which makes the game a painful experience with a controller. It's a point & click, the only thing more casual than this genre is mobile gaming, so naturally it should be playable with a controller, right? Wrong. I found myself switching to M+KB for the "tense" bits, and controller for the rest.\n\nThe story is quite linear too. The game constantly tells you "X will remember that", "X noticed that", "X is now afraid of you", and etc, but it doesn't matter. Choose whatever you want and don't waste your time trying to be a good cop... pretty much all the key events are the same and both endings are identical.  And speaking of which, I think The Wolf Among Us has a great ending; it leaves things open enough for a second season, but it's also left to interpretation so fans can make theories and discuss what they noticed throughout the game.\n\nI recommend it, but don't expect it to be as good as The Walking Dead.","April 1","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game can be beaten in around 6 hours.\n\nTL;DR version:\nNo gameplay Bad\nGreat voice acting Good\nShort on lore/content Bad\nCool setting Good\nEpisodic release Bad\nGreat characters Good\n"Fake" choices Bad\nConsequences in character reactions Good\nLong version:\nSo you see 11 hours in there? These 11 hours are actually 8 as I left the game open and went to go do some irl business. And anyone who knows me, knows I take my sweet time when playing games, exploring every nook and cranny and pretty much trying to see everything there is to see, sometimes restarting from checkpoint just to see this different location to get the codex entries. That should give you some idea as to the length of the game. At a healthy pace you'd finish it in around 6 hours, and that's accounting for repeating unskippable intro.\n\nThe absence of gameplay is really unnecessarily shortening the game. It could have been done with action-style navigation, with lots of secrets and lore (audio logs, diaries, you name it), maybe even side quests. It could have really used some puzzle solving, maybe recreating crime scenes, all that stuff. It could have and it would have been much better for it, but instead they decided to spend money on long QTE fights/chases and stuff. The game is very popular and costs quite a lot for it's length, so I highly doubt putting some extra dosh into gameplay to elongate the experience would result in any notiable losses for the devs, they just didn't do it because they didn't want to stray away from the formula they know well.\n\nThe meat of the game: dialogues and characters are good though. I played Walking Dead (the first season) and I didn't like it and didn't even finish it mostly because of how boring and annoying the two main characters are. This was not just my complaint and TellTale took it to heart with Wolf, creating a set of amazing characters, the most amazing of which is the primary character duet: Wolf and Snow. They have very complex histories and relationships and it really plays towards sucking you into the world and the story. There's even some sort of hint at a romance there, but it's just a hint though - while well-written and thorough, there is no really in-depth exploration of any of the characters in the game. Not even the primary: the Wolf.\n\nChoices in the game are mostly fake. Aside from "Where do I go" choices, most of the options result in minor fluctuations of the lines without actually changing the story or content in any way. This is no Witcher 2. That's not to say there's no consequence. Sometimes characters will support you in an argument or "argument" if you are nice to them. Stuff like that.\n\nBut it's not like you make a choice between colouring blue and colouring red. Most of the time it's more like colouring or not colouring at all, and the main plot revolves around you either being good or bad. Again this is no Witcher 2. Also about Witcher 2: this game has no failure states. You will proceed with marginally different outcomes regardless of how well you perform in the "fights".\n\nI don't read comics and I didn't know what to expect going into this one, as I knew Telltale are good at making plots, but I didn't like Walking Dead. Wolf Among Us impressed me with it's unique settings, it's interesting mix of fairy tales that I heard when I was a kid and extremely gruesome Noire-style scenes. I mean you get to literally fix an open arm fracture, stick claws into eyes of a famous fairy tale hero that all little kids heard of, or rip limbs off people. Not to mention seeing "Little Merimade" as stripper in a club. Talk about ruined childhood...\n\nIt's an awesome game that seems very skimped on content and has no gameplay. I would not recommend it at it's full price, but definitely would recommend it with a discount. Even 25% off is a good enough discount to justify the purchase. I am not a fan of this episodic releases, games aren't movies and this crap really breaks the pace, so now that this season is done, would be a nice time to purchase it.\n\nIt's definitely better than Walking Dead in almost every single respect: better characters, setting; while having just as good and sometimes better voice acting, animations (admittedly most animations are manual and it's not a physics-based engine, so impacts and movements might seem a bit floaty) and definitely better locations: they have  more meaning due to the detective story premise.\n\nThe ending answers almost all questions, but is still a cliffhanger so Season 2 is most likely on it's way. I hold no hopes that it will actually have gameplay, but it should be interesting nonetheless. So good luck to TellTale and have fun solving this case to the players.\n\nPS: I suspected the right person all the way to the end! Yey! I'm such a good detective (although the game made absolutely NO effort whatsoever to reward or even acknowledge that fact, when the truth is revealed)...","July 13, 2014","true","21.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Telltale are AMAZING at what they do, now I've only played Walking Dead and this title (No Sam or Max but I did play BTTF breifly) and I personally thing the way they are going about things in the two games I majorly played is amazing. The story telling is amazing, The graphics are gritty and realistic, the background noises and soundtrack is amazing, The voice acting is incredible probably the best I've heard in any game (I really like the voice of Toad)\n\nOne of my favorite things that I just loved was when you would have an intense start to an episode and it just rolls into that bad ♥♥♥ theme song. It's just such a cool feeling, makes you feel like your really dictating a TV series.\n\nPros\n\n- The story is gripping and the Fables universe is a great setting\n\n- All the charcters are well voiced and loveable.\n\n- The timed responses are a great mechanic, really puts pressure on the situation\n\n- Soundtack and SFX are so well done (The theme to each episode is just WOW)\n\nCons\n\n- The one thing I could find in this game, and it isn't even anything really big is the tiny audio glitch in the first episodes theme....but that's just me being picky. It isn't even really that bad either considering the entire game.\n\n\nTelltale MAKE SEASON 2!\n\n10/10","June 29, 2014","true","36.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

The first episode is actually its strongest, with a great blend of a colorful cast of characters, some nice investigation, a strong noir atmosphere, and the ability to miss out things due to the choices you make. Sadly the game never really follows up that well from such a great opening, though Episode 3 gets mighty close. The atmosphere is still fantastic but the writing and gameplay waver. The characters eventually devolve into being dumb petty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, which to be fair is accurate to the comics, but it’s disappointing because Telltale seemed to be not doing that in the beginning. Investigation and interactivity is reduced to minimum post Episode 3 and your choices tend to not be taken in account that well. Plus the ending can end up be anti-climatic and kind of pants on head stupid if you don’t make the right choices.\n\nTWAU pretty much ended up in the same boat with TWD Season 2 in that its rather clear to me that after the lead designers of TWD Season 1 left the company Telltale is really struggling to get that magic back. Regardless, TWAU despite its flaws is still well worth playing.","September 30, 2014","true","15.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well, let's get started then!\n\nI want to preface this whole review by saying I am not a point and click fan.  I had never played any point and click games prior to TWUA (including TWD).  I had also never read (or heard of the comic Fables).  I heard alot of good things about TWUA and was kinda on the fence about it.  On one hand the visuals looked slick and the story sounded interesting, but I had never played a point and click and thought they were mostly boring.  Well, it went on sale last summer and I figured "what the heck".  WOW this game blew me AWAY.  I am a big movie buff, especially the "Coen Brothers" films, famous for terrific screenplay and writing as well as memorable characters.  TWUA is like a Coen Bros game.  No, really.  ALL of the dialogue is real.  None of it sounds canned or corny, it is visceral and tremendously voice acted.  The characters are one of a kind, each with their own personality.  I really don't want to say too much about the story because I don't want to spoil any of it.  It is best going in knowing as little as possible.  This game is a masterpiece, however it is very much a "mature" title.  Alot of games get the "M" rating but make no mistake this game earns it.  It has lots of violence, language, and deals with very dark subject matter.  However, the game doesn't just throw all that in there just to be "cool".  It all contributes to the overall atmosphere and tone of the story, and deals with said items in a sophisticated manner.  It was one of those games I powered through in 1 sitting.  After each episode I just HAD to see what happened next.  Every moment you haven't experienced this game you are doing yourself a disservice.\n\nEDIT: If you are still on the fence about purchasing it you can play the first episode free on the app store (iOS and Android)","January 21, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Faitytale characters? Really?

I found the story to be very compelling and after making my way through chapter 1 I was immediately hooked and couldn't stop playing. I just had to know what would happen next and who was behind these murders.\n\nThe voice acting was great as were the graphics, the soundtrack and game playability. The storyline came together really well, although I admit Chapter 5 was a bit of a letdown, I just expected more than it was and for it all to wrap up a little more coherently.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/250320/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account","Once upon a time, in a land far away... actually, in modern times and in the middle of New York City, a community of fairytale-characters is living a life in secrecy. From Snow White to Beauty and The Beast, you know the tales. Being supernatural beings, they resort to a form of magical enchantment called "glamour" to appear human. To break the spell and show one's true self is strictly forbidden and would pose a threat to the entire community. The Fables, which is the name the residents have chosen for themselves, are kept in line by their own communal government, and there to enforce its will is the sheriff, Bigby Wolf aka The Big Bad Wolf - The protagonist of The Wolf Among Us and your character. Trouble is brewing in Fabletown, and Bigby is out to investigate.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is your typical Telltales game. If you played The Walking Dead, you know what to expect from The Wolf Among Us, which uses the same mechanics (quasi-quicktime events with button-mashing, mouse-controls and a lot of dialogue).Of course this also includes the typical Telltales-style of graphics, utilising a hefty amount of cell-shading to give it that cartoony/comic look. This is an adventure-game more than anything else and, as usual, the player's choices are heavily advertised to cause a great impact on the game's later story. All dialogues have a multitude of possible answers for you to choose (including silence) and characters you talk to will remember how you have treated them in the past.\nThe Wolf Among Us is an interactive story, and you choose the details.\n\nBefore I blindly recommend this game to everyone, I should mention that it is not yet complete. In Telltales-fashion, TWAU is released episodically, with a delay of at least a month between new installments. You do get all of them for free after purchasing the game, but keep in mind that as of now, only the first episode is out, with the second one coming out in early February.\nApart from this minor inconvenience, TWAU is well worth a look. The story so far is very interesting, has enough twists and shock-moments to keep you interested and really makes you wish for the next episode. Being based on the Fables-comics by Vertigo, the game has a very unique setting that should offer a fresh experience to all those who did not even know about the franchise (including myself). If you enjoyed how The Walking Dead played out, give this one a shot.","January 18, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I did enjoy the game and its story, but I feel like the pros and cons evened out\n\nPros:\n- I loved Bigby. I thought he was an excellent protagonist. One of my big gripes with games is when the main character isn't likeable. Bigby is a misunderstood bad guy turned good, and I think it worked well. The choices in the game also let you tailor Bigby to the kind of sheriff you want him to be.\n- It's a classic Telltale game. Episodic, story rich, and has choices you can make in the game.\n- The end of every episode left me wanting more. Luckily I bought the game after all the episodes came out.\n- Even though the game's idea isn't an original one, I still loved it. Fabled characters trying to adapt to the real world.\n- Wonderful voiceovers\n\nCons:\n- Even though I fell in love with Bigby, I disliked pretty much every other character except Toad and his son. I don't know if that is Telltale's fault or the comics, but I literally didn't care about most of the cast of characters.\n- The story kind of fell apart toward the end. It just got weird, and I felt it went downhill once Bloody Mary and the Crooked Man started playing a role. Also, Bloody Mary is probably one of the worst enemies I've ever witnessed in a game.\n- The illusion of choice: your choices in the game don't affect the story at all. The game hardly adapts at all to the choices you make.\n\nI say buy this game, but don't have high expectations.\n\nAlso, there are no jump scares.","October 30, 2015","true","8.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That's why the question "Well, how's the game?" sounds absolutely dumb. The first episode is great, full of investigations, dialogues and combat (remember, that we play as Sheriff, infamous known as Big Bad Wolf). Telltale also made another step to non-linear plot, because now even events within one episode can turn it one way or another - like with "new" feature of timing (there are 2 places where you have to be urgently, and you have decide where will you go). Now it's not "Save one or another, and he'll die 5 minutes after" dillema from TWD - your choices really matters... Or the illusion is way stronger - it's hard to tell about that now, after just one episode.\n\nAfter all... If you like interesting plot with many twists, hard choices and good dialogues with great characters (some of them were taken from DC Comics) with a sweet taste of violence (there are many really violent fights, and some of them are avoidable) - come and get it.

A little alert might pop up to tell you something like:\n\n<!> You told the truth\n\n<!> You connected the evidence\n\n<!> Snow will remember that you took her side\n\nOf course, a more honest alert might sound more like this:\n\n<i> Your decision has been carefully recorded for posterity and immediately flushed down the toilet\n\nNothing you decide in this game matters, which wouldn't be a huge deal except for the fact that decision making is the sole game mechanic. It's tough to give players real choices because it requires a lot more content for the same amount of play time. Other games have run into this issue and some have found innovative solutions.\n\nThe Stanley Parable leaned right into it, making the very concept of player agency part of the story. Gone Home, a game in which literally everything that happened happened before the the protagonist even entered the narrative, built uncertainty and used environmental storytelling keep the player engaged. Wolf unfortunately has no tricks up its sleeve to balance its series of pointless "choices."\n\nMaybe the biggest problem isn't that the choices aren't meaningful, it's that the game won't let you forget how meaningless they are for even one second. Between chapters it asks the player to sit through a recap of the previous chapter and a preview of the next, both of which serve as reminders of how linear and immutable the plot is. It's as if the game wants to constantly remind you about all of the events that are going to happen no matter what you do.\n\nIt doesn't help that the plot sometimes feels like an arbitrary string of red herrings and unconvincing fake-outs. We may see a character shot in the chest in one scene, only to to be told in the next that they're fine because of magic or whatever. In a fictional universe where the rules of magic are never totally spelled out, these kinds of deus ex machina moments are inevitable and they don't need to ruin the story, but too many of them in a row can make the stakes just seem very, very low.\n\nIt's kind of a bummer because there are some great things about the game. The voice acting is perfect and the writing faithfully recreates the weird, gritty fairytale world of the comics. The art is also pretty much dead-on in matching the comics while adding some dynamic elements, although some of the character movements push it into the uncanny valley. You can also expect to spend a few minutes on google trying to figure out how to fix the game's totally hideous lack of anti-aliasing (luckily it is fixable).\n\nI marked this review, "not recommended", but my thoughts on it are more mixed than that. I do intend to finish the game, I'm just disappointed.","January 4, 2015","false","6.5"," 45 of 88 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","45","88","2","3"

It takes place in the tough world of Fables based on a DC/Vertigo comic book series. It's mature and captivating. The heroes in the series face unique challanges every day and the main character is a very likeable character, even though apparently everyone hates/ fears him. I can't wait how the series will end and I also hope that Telltale will continue to produce games in this world. I really love the graphics as well having this comic book feeling.

As a person who has been collecting Fables trades for years it was pretty great to see the characters fully animated and voiced. Also the setting in this game brought me way back to the very first Fables story; in the comics Bigby has come pretty far away from being the noir detective that he started out as, but playing The Wolf Among Us zapped me right back to those days in a really good way.\n\nThis is the first Telltale game I've played that's structured like this, and to tell the truth it isn't so much a game. It's more of an interactive experience or a visual novel, seeing as there is no way to lose. Even if you make "mistakes" along the way you will still be pulled through to the end. Just like real life things come to an end whether you get stuck or not. I like this style of Adventure game because of those very reasons; since the game is built more around the main character's social interactions than solving obtuse puzzles, finishing conversations and examining everything becomes a priority.\n\nThe writing in this game is probably it's most blairing selling point. It starts out being very cut-and-dry, with the backbone of the story being interesting but not something that seems like it would unfurl into a five episode adventure. But I was delightfully surprised by how much more invested I became with each episode I played, and by how cleverly each episode led into the next. It's got a great sense of itself, and the way the writers eerily reveal each facet of the mystery at a steady gait made me anxious and suspenseful over each unreleased episode.\n\nOne of the most important features of any game for me is immersion. How easily I become immersed in a video game dictacts how long it will hold my interest. Even though The Wolf Among Us is about an established character with a very strong voice, I found myself falling into his shoes so easily. There were times where I would stay his hand instead of letting him get violent, only to find myself exhausted with being nice and wishing I could just let him thrash the next person he met. I think in large part the immersion came from the character's body language and voicework. Hearing the furstration in Bigby's voice when he couldn't crack some skulls made me frustrated, and then finally getting into a fight with someone who truely deserved it felt extremely cathartic and helped me blow off a lot of stream that I wasn't even entirely aware I had built up.\n\nBut as much as I love this game, it does have it's faults. Majorly it's stop-and-go nature. This game is structured like a TV mini series and you have to wait for the next episode to be revealed just like you would on TV. Call me a curmudgeon but I kind of liked the old way of buying video games. Since there's nothing to hold you up in any given episode it dosn't take more than an hour to play each one; you are being pushed from scene to scene only getting a few moments to stop and get your bearings. The urgent quality of each scene mixed with the culled timeframe of episodic gameplay makes a very odd experience when combined and all told I kind of wish it was just one seamless game.\n\nThe fact of the game moving too fast can also be faulted to the tiny window that you have to make each of the dialogue choices. In other games when it comes to dialogue imputs you are given a scene frozen in time to give you as the player enough space to mull over what the best course of action is, but in this game you are given a sliver of a window, sometimes only a few seconds. There were a few times where I had to click the first choice I read simply because I wasn't given the time to mentally brew over everything that could happen as a result, and others where my mind was so scrambled over what to do that I didn't click anything though I would have if I had been given enough time. The characters react to every facet of this dialogue engine, from the amount of time it takes you to answer to the choices you decide to make; this makes the game incredibly compelling because you're never entirely sure how deep it goes, whether a character's reaction is simply cosmetic or if there's something in the game's engine that lets you feel the ripple effect of your own choices. But while I like the feeling of the game and the world in it being alive, I hate the fact that it seems to get the better of me more often then naught.\n\nThe choice to add the timed dialogue feature is also confusing to me because of the way it tally's player choices and gives you the percentage. When I look at the list after completing a chapter I get frustrated when I see it say "you and 67% of players chose to..." for a choice that I did not feel as though I conciously made.\n\nAll of it's faults aside, this is an incredibly well-built experience that I have reccommended to all of my friends. So I thought I would just type a little thing and reccommend it to you too.","June 5, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh what's that? the mundys or normal people don't believe in fables anyway so there would be no point hiding it? WELL ♥♥♥♥ YOU.\n\nBasically there's some murders, Bigby is the badass sheriff and he has a short temper and sometimes gets really ♥♥♥♥ing angry and turns into a Wolf, this guy ♥♥♥♥ing wants to get to the bottom of it but more murders happen then some twists then some murderous twists then a backflip summersault sideflip murderflip twistflip happens. Yeah it's basically like that, It's point and click and much like the Walking Dead series it is suprisingly good, I mean I've always hated point and click games, to be they were the equivelant of sucking crap out of a dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a blocked straw, but Walking Dead changed that then I played The Wolf Among Us, which I actually concider the better story.\n\nSo all in all you should play it, If you like blood, drinking, ugly as ♥♥♥♥ characters, and in the latter episode cartoon ♥♥♥♥, then I suggest you check out this great title.","February 16, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game was amazing, it really followed the Fables storyline(The Wolf Amoung Us is the preview to the comic books called Fables), I noticed a few characters who were in the game and not in the story. Bigby Wolf was so badass, he did his job and always tried to do the right thing no matter what the cost. I wish more people would read the books. The humor was dark and funny, the city was controlled by the crocked man. It really fit the detective parts of the first book. I am excited for season 2, I hope they keep following the story of Fables. I give this game a 10 out of 10 for sure.","December 31, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You muddle around a twisted mature style version of a fairy tale cast of characters. You play as the Big Bad Wolf, Bigby. There are not as many choices in this game, and it seems like no matter what you do the story is shoved into the same direction. In comparison to the Walking Dead play style, there was more play and less watch, where as The Wolf Among Us has a lot more waddling around and dialoging needlessly just to have all your answers handed to you eventually whether you figured it out for yourself or not. The art style is amazing, the characters are all interesting, and the story is compelling, however, the gameplay falls short. I remain entertained with this series due to the storyline and art, however, you may find yourself playing Bejeweled while you're waiting on figuring out why in god's name you even have an inventory when there's nothing to do with it. I do recommend this game,it's worth a play. 9/10","February 16, 2014","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Through dialogue, scene investigation, and the occasional fight scene, I experienced a world that is well thought out (thanks to its source material), endlessly intriguing, and just plain gorgeous. The use of fairy tale characters and myths sets the stage for light familiarity with all of the characters, but turns your expectations for nearly every character on its head. The characters feel less like beasts and princesses and more like people who live in the real-world that is sprikled with principles of a fantasy story, which makes for an incredibly realistic experience of characterization and conversations between characters in an otherwise impossible setting.\n\nThis game may certainly not be for everyone, but I would most definitely recommend it to any individual looking for an alternative experience in gaming that is combined with the quality of a cable television series. I'm excited to play through the game a second time to discover what will occur differently upon making different decisions.

Your main character Bigby Wolf has to investigate a series of gruesome murders linking to someone targeting fairy tale creatures. What unfolds is a conspiracy that will shake the foundations of their world.\n\nI love TellTale Games! Therefore i might be biased. But in all honesty, this is a damn good game.\nThe question is should you buy it?\n\nWell, it depends on what you are looking for in a game. I personally love games for their storylines and this game gets top marks for that. The film noir-esque atmosphere, the design and environments all work in the game's favor and build an atmosphere that really complements the game's story.\n\nBut, the question still remains. What do you look for in a game.\nGameplay comprises of Quick time events and some point and click style stuff. You pick dialogue choices which influence the story.\n\nFor those of you familiar with TTG's formula, this is nothing new. For those of you who come in expecting puzzles, you will be disappointed.\nThis is more akin to a çhoose your own adventure book' or an interactive movie than a classic point and click game.\nFor me, that is not a problem. The story was epic and satisfying. The characters felt alive. The action sequences well paced and your decisions can have a real impact (even on the survival of some characters).\n\nBottomline:\n\nIf you are familiar with TTG's formula and like it, or if you are looking for a game with a good story or you are a fan of the original comic series, Get the game\n\nHowever if you are looking for a puzzle laden point and click game than this is not what it is.\n\nThe game has a fair bit of replayability, just to see what different outcomes you can get, which people you can save.\n\nMy Recommendation: Buy it!","December 7, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I can't say I like the way they handled the main villain, I think one of the big sequences in episode 5 is pretty ridiculous and dumb, and Bigby despite starting out fairly relatable loses that character trait as the story progresses.\n\nOn the other hand, though, the writing is generally strong and the characters all have distinct personalities, Bigby is an enjoyable protagonist, the Noir atmosphere is done very well, the art style looks really fantastic, and it does an excellent job of acknowledging your decisions. In the end, for any issues the game has, it more than makes up for it.","December 19, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those of you familiar with The Walking Dead  game made by Telltale Games will definitely enjoy this game. The game plays very similarly in many aspects such as quick time events and the same style of conversation choices. This game takes a fun twist on the Fables you grew up hearing about and takes it to a very dark place. The twists and turns of the story will keep you on edge and keep you playing. Each episode has lasted roughly 1 & 1/2 to 2 hours so far so in the long run i'm assuming it'll be 8-10 hours of gameplay total for an entire playthrough. Telltale Games continues to deliver with another unique story and entertaining game with The Wolf Among Us.

The story is the main point and the gameplay evolves around it, which I'm fine with as they do it well.\n\nThis is a great game for fans of the Fables graphic novel series. I haven't enjoyed the last couple story arcs of the comic, but the writers of this capture the early series feeling very well. This is also just a good game if you want to play through a good story. Some of the in-jokes will go over your head but I don't think it will make a diference.\n\nI really hope they make a season two, if they can keep up this level of writing.","June 4, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bungaroo/recommended/250320/","Bungaroo","Bastion#1161","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bungaroo/","605 products in account","So, I just finished this game, a couple of hours ago, then I got up. Went to the kitchen, and poured myself a big cup of coffee, would have loved some black tea, took a long shower, talked with the people around the house for a few , and now I'm all cooled down, I'm ready to write this damn  review.\n\nThe wolf among us, is what I , as a fan of the fables comic and story-line by vertigo, found this game to be delightful, I'm not a big fan of tell tale games. But when I heard the big bad wolf would appear in a game, I bought this faster than the speed of light, and here are my toughs on it.\n\nWe are in New York, there ain't better place to find a story than new York, and what amazing story it is, we find yourself in the shows of Bigby wolf, the big bad wolf of the fables. In what we call a official territory called, fable-town, where the characters of fables, like snow white, toad and badger, a magic mirror who forces you to say rhymes if you wanna talk to him, etc. and our wolf friend, being one of the biggest, meanest and strongest creatures in the Fable world. He plays the role of sheriff. Weird place of putting a person like him, with the past he haves, taking care an looking for the safety of those he used to terrorize back in the good old days.\n\nThe story is good , and that I said up there is all I'm giving you. I will not rob anyone of the right to uncover this story by himself. And the game being only story, is like taking the foreshadowed betrayals from call of duty. Whats the joke. So, right ahead dim saying this, DON'T look it up, dont watch lets plays, don't freaking watch a friend play it, this is a game that will make you do decisions, and your decisions are important, at least some of them are.  The way you play, changes parts and bits of the story, things that seem like filler content, will come up as a major plot device in the later parts of it, nothing is trivial. And if you feel conflicted about a decision, believe me , its intentional.\n\n\nPros:\n-game holds a long story, with chapter-like spread, that will keep you on the edge of your seat more often than most current games are capable of.\n\n-Deep characters with human like emotions, and inhuman characteristics, this is a thing for those adult that loved fables as kids, and wish to have a more adult twist and insight in their stories.\n\n-writing is very nice, simple, yet adult oriented, big words and deep talking don't make a adult story, the theme and the situations does, remember soul reaver? Think of that, with less theater.\n\n-action shots all the time. Between the long periods of talking and interaction with what I think must be the cast that most personality haves in a telltale video game. You'll have to play the rougher part of the sheriff job. Quick time events everywhere, and for me, in a game of this kind, its okay to have a lot of those.\n\nCons:\n\n-characters are different from the main comics. The act different but its not that much of a difference. Since time indeed makes people change, some of the characters tend to show hints to their development in the future.\n\n-graphically speaking is an inferior game, at this day and hour I think most computers can run it from factory, but id does have its requirements, they comic style is seamless, yes, they ould have done better. With the kind of company they are working with. I mean we are talking DC comics here. Vertigo to be precise . V from vendetta, Sandman, that kind of quality demands more work than they put on the graphics aspect.\n\n-the illusion of choice in many of the situations they could have added more approaches. It tends to end in: A) you do what you must to progress the story. And the game snaps at you for it. Or B) either choice would end down the same path.\n\n\nAll in all. Would I give this game a 100? no. but its very damn close. Id say 80/100 ,","November 16, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As with all TellTale games, the story is influenced by the decisions you make throughout the game. The Wolf Among Us is based off of the FABLES comic series, written by Bill Willingham. The series deals with various characters from fairy tales and folklore, referring to themselves as "Fables" who have been forced out of their Homelands by "The Adversary" who has conquered the realm. The Fables have traveled to our world and formed a hidden community in New York City known as Fabletown. Fables who are unable to blend in with human society (such as monsters and anthropomorphic animals) live at "the Farm" in upstate New York.\nI couldn't help but to start reading the comics because I didn't want the story to end.

Even as I had solved the mystery, and that believe held right up until the end I suddenly got hit with a line by a character right at the end which completely turned everything around. The Mystery had been solved, but now it had grown even larger with but one line.\nAnd the court room scene which seemed to go on and on with every moment feeling I had the upper hand then nothing at all just kept my eyes on the screen unblinking, watching as all the decisions and incident I had been part of coming to my aid or against me.\nAnd in the end I feel that I made the right choices and will always make them, though unlike the Walking Dead I'm curious to see what would have occurred had I made different choices.\n\nWith great intrigue, quirky and original characters that had evolved from fairy tales (yeah I know that might sound like a contradiction) and a dose of film noir style action The Wolf Among Us is the best Telltale game yet to be made.\n\nIn a world where fairytale characters escaped in an Exodus to our world (the mundane as they refer to it) its never a happy ending and its a real treat watching all our favorite story time characters having to be hit with real world issues and how they have tried to adept. It gritty yet pleasant, emotional but exciting.\n\nFrom start to end and even after from that final line I have mentioned a couple of times already that made me want to follow on makes me glad I brought this when the steam sale arrived and yet leaves me wishing I had purchased it from the start.","November 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a way it's hard to compare the two because even though they very simillar each is distinctly unique.  While The Walking Dead played with a lot of emotions and character attachment, The Wolf Among Us deals more about a view of justice and how it affects the world around you.

The Fable comicbook series was something I've never heard of, but I was aware of public television attempts to accomplish similar settings; A mash up of fairytales trying to coexist in and stay relevant in modern urban or cityscape setting. It's a more reoccuring fixation in the past few years, this retelling of fairy tales trend, and it's interesting to me personally in many ways. How do our fairy tales hold up to modern values? If confronted with modern day problems, how would they react? If given a different prespective are the villians still so evil and the heroes still so good?\n\nIn this game, those questions are both confronted and addressed pretty well and is a good source of the story's' power over it's audience. Unlike other retellings and reimaginings, the Fable characters are both very aware of their histories as storybook characters and constantly make the audience aware of the traditional versions of their stories. Instead of the writer rewriting the characters so that they fit new sterotypes, the characters look upon the original grim versions of thier tales as a harsh sort of history that most of them are trying to move on from. It works very well.  The personal struggles with change, pain, sadness, and most notably in the main character's  case, regret add's to the story's harsh and mature tone in a very belivable way.\n\nStory wise, the genre is mostly a murder mystery, dipped in the sheep's clothing of a fantasy. The player takes charge of Bigby (yes, the Big Bad Wolf himself) who, after the fables fled their respective world and established they're community in the modern world, was charged with the task of law enforcer. Of course, one of the story's biggest pulls is the contridiction of that. Bigby was and is still seen by most of the other fables as THE villian and nobody really trusts him. Internally, Bigby also struggles with himself, he is raw power combined with a dark animalistic nature, but he is also incredibly lonely and sick of it. The player guides Bigby's actions throughout the season, both shaping the progress of Bigby's internal struggle and solving the external murder mystery.\n\nAdding to the story's power is the artwork and voice acting. The art is cell shaded just right to that of a harshly lit comicbook. It feels almost like a colored in noire film and reflects the gritty, angry, mood of the stories setting. The voice acting is brilliant, clear and very emotional. Telltale did a great job in this one.  I loved every bit of this tale.","August 3, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnMZ/recommended/250320/","CapnMZ","Mass Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnMZ/","46 products in account","After playing The Walking Dead, I thought a game with this kind of gameplay couldn't get much better. I was wrong.\n\nStoryAs you'd expect from a story-driven game, the story is magnificent. You get sucked in from the very start, and once you've completed the game, you're still sucked in. That means instant black hole in your life. The premise of the game keeps you pondering all the way to the end, only to at the end realize you still don't really know a whole lot. I love it when games or movies do this; they give you food for thought far beyond their own lifespan. I guess this possibly leaves room for a second season of the game. Fingers crossed.\n\nCharactersI haven't read the Fables comics yet, but after playing The Wolf Among Us, I sure as hell will. When I started playing I had no clue the characters actually come from fairy tales. Now don't go thinking "Whaaat? Fairy Tales?", because they're not quite as teeth-rotting as your average fairy tale characters. They're your favorite fairy tale characters, dressed up like your average Joe, turned bad-♥♥♥. Each and every one of them has a sort of compassion factor and they all beg for you to know more about them. One night I ended up Googling half the cast! (One of the characters led me to Reddit NoSleep and got me watching really awkward things...) Furthermore, it's interesting to see how Telltale incorporated the characters' original stories into the game, to the point that because of the characters' original stories, you start wondering what is really going on.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is nothing special and it simply fits the game's style. You're basically watching a very long movie, which requires user input. This user input mostly comes in the form of your reactions to certain situations, laid down in four choices at the bottom of your screen, with a timer. You select a choice before the timer runs out, else the game has a default reaction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnMZ/recommended/250320/","CapnMZ","Mass Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CapnMZ/","46 products in account","After playing The Walking Dead, I thought a game with this kind of gameplay couldn't get much better. I was wrong.\n\nStoryAs you'd expect from a story-driven game, the story is magnificent. You get sucked in from the very start, and once you've completed the game, you're still sucked in. That means instant black hole in your life. The premise of the game keeps you pondering all the way to the end, only to at the end realize you still don't really know a whole lot. I love it when games or movies do this; they give you food for thought far beyond their own lifespan. I guess this possibly leaves room for a second season of the game. Fingers crossed.\n\nCharactersI haven't read the Fables comics yet, but after playing The Wolf Among Us, I sure as hell will. When I started playing I had no clue the characters actually come from fairy tales. Now don't go thinking "Whaaat? Fairy Tales?", because they're not quite as teeth-rotting as your average fairy tale characters. They're your favorite fairy tale characters, dressed up like your average Joe, turned bad-♥♥♥. Each and every one of them has a sort of compassion factor and they all beg for you to know more about them. One night I ended up Googling half the cast! (One of the characters led me to Reddit NoSleep and got me watching really awkward things...) Furthermore, it's interesting to see how Telltale incorporated the characters' original stories into the game, to the point that because of the characters' original stories, you start wondering what is really going on.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is nothing special and it simply fits the game's style. You're basically watching a very long movie, which requires user input. This user input mostly comes in the form of your reactions to certain situations, laid down in four choices at the bottom of your screen, with a timer. You select a choice before the timer runs out, else the game has a default reaction. Your choices are remembered by the game and could affect the story of the game, thus the game is tailored by your choices. The controls are simple button clicks, and occasionally bashes, and walking around in certain scenes. I don't really like the walking around using a keyboard, it works a lot smoother using an analog stick. (Hint: Click an objective twice to walk there faster.)\n\nGraphicsSome people love 'm, some people hate 'm; cel-shaded graphics. I, for one, love them.

What ruined it for me is that at the very end it tells me that I should read the comic to find out what happened next. Why?\n\nThe walking dead tv show is immensely popular but is it's own entity and doesn't have to follow the comics much at all.\nNo disrespect to the comics but the artistic style of this game doesn't even resemble the source material.\nReading the comics after playing through this masterpiece is like buying a new bicicle and then deciding to use the stationary one at home. It just doesn't compute.\nAll I have to say is that there better be a season 2 or this game could be leaving fans at the altar. Comics look interesting, but aren't the same as a game where you get to choose what happens next and get to play so many different ways.

This game is worth every penny and I am suprised that it isnt more... the whole game is emotional and twisted...

If you DIDNT like twd game you still might like this. It's a point and click, so that alone is a hit or miss with many people. It has a pretty interesting story though at some point it felt sort of slow. There's enough twists and turns to keep it interesting! I didnt really have attatchment to many of the characters to be honest, I just kinda wanted to see what happened! But i guess its hard to have attatchment when most characters are murder suspects.  Had pretty ok music too, and the voice actors were great. Some of the facial animations felt kinda weird but other than that it was pretty technically solid. Definitely worth poking your head into, in my opinion, Bigby is a great character and it's made me want to read the comic books. Though, telltales episodes are a bit shorter than they used to be, so $25 bucks a LIIIIITLE more of a hard price to recommend it at. Get it on sale.

A combination of maltese falcon meets the wire, Wolf Among Us firmly places the player into the shoes of gruff no nonsense sheriff Bigby Wolf as he has to navigate the seedy underworld of fabletown amidst the squalor of 1980's New York to either reaffirm himself as king supreme of bad dudes everywhere or as a miscast man trying to make up for the pain he's inflicted upon his fellow fables in years past.

And I haven't regretted for one second.\n\nSo why is that?\nThe game is full of fantastic characters from fairytales that we were told as kids, characters from Disney movies (or Disney movies based on those fairytales more likely), and while it is a weird fantasy, it is still marvelous to think these characters somehow got into our (the human) world, where they all try to survive with what they have, and trying not to cause a disturbance.\n\n..

Clickable items are shown with orbs, and most things to discover really aren't too far out of reach of newer players of the genre. The game also has a mode where you can turn that off if you want a challenge, but on your second playthrough you most likely remember where everything is, so if you want to go with this option, I'd do it on your first playthrough.\n\nA lot of really cool characters, top notch voice acting, and some genuinely intense moments (although I've found that they are far more intense in the Walking Dead games by Tell Tale which I would also really recommend checking out). The graphics, while not going to be something that take advantage of your four SLI Titans, are bright, colorful and undeniably charming.

Also, I should note that I'm vaguely familiar with the comic Fables, but I've only read an issue or two of it and that was many years ago, so I approached this game more as a fan of The Walking Dead than a fan of the Fables franchise.\n\n[EDIT: Second episode is out. I'll probably rewrite this review later because boy it's long, but I will say I enjoyed the second episode but not as much as the first--it feels shorter and the choices didn't have as much weight to them. I still like this game so far but it definitely feels like they had some problems trying to write the second episode.)\n\nSo, let's get straight to the point: Have you played The Walking Dead? Did you enjoy it? Then honestly I don't think I need to say anything more. Pick this game up. The same excellent writing, acting, and use of choice within the game is here, and in fact I feel like the illusion of choice and action sequences in this game are a big improvement over TWD. It's not just as good as TWD, in my opinion--it's BETTER. Whether or not the rest of the episodes will keep up with that is hard to say, but based on the first Episode alone this series has a much, much stronger opening than TWD. I'm hugely looking forward to the second episode, maybe even a little more than TWD Season 2 (and that's saying a LOT for me, since I consider the original TWD one of my favorite games of all time).\n\nBut what if you played the first Walking Dead and DIDN'T enjoy it? Well, then I can maybe still recommend this to you...depending on why you disliked it.\n\nDid you dislike it because of the lack of gameplay? Then The Wolf Among Us probably won't change your mind. Although gameplay has been tweaked here and there, at it's core is still very similar to TWD in terms of its focus on interactive dialogue and choices than any other gameplay. There are action scenes here, and they're actually much more fun to play through than TWD--both because the controls, as I mentioned before, are a huge improvement over TWD overall, and also because it's just more fun to get into a fistfight with a fairytale character using some well though out quick time events than it is to try to deal with clunking shooting of (thankfully) slow-moving zombies--but in the first episode there's maybe three or so in two hours of gameplay, so that's still not really the focus.\n\nHowever, if you disliked TWD because you're not as fond of the world of TWD, then I highly, highly recommend you give TWAU a try. This is certainly still obviously made by the same developer, but the world of Fables just feels much more different than TWD. It's still gritty and dark, and characters do die, but I do feel like with TWD franchise as a whole you can start to get a little tired of the constant death and overall gloomy tone focused on the depravity in "human nature." Not that there isn't depravity to be found here--the first episode alone deals with themes like prostitution, incest, suicide, murder,  organized crime, and corrupt governments--but it feels less enevitable here. Some people are stuck in bad situations, but not all. Some people make bad decisions, but it's just that--bad people making bad decisions.  The world in this game is dark and gritty but there's less of a feeling that things MUST turn out poorly. (Also, no zombies. I like zombies but even I'm getting a little tired of those in games at this point.)\n\nTo finish off, I'd like to list off some things I did and didn't like about the game, being as concise as I can be. (As you can probably tell, I'm not very good at being concise, but I'll make an effort.)\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful visual style. Sort of 80's styled noir, with lots of jewel-toned colors, paisley textures, stylized shillouettes, etc. There's some really cool character designs to be found, too. I particularly love the design for the bartender at the Trip Trap--both when she's in glamour and when she isn't.\n\n-FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC voice acting. Seriously, nearly every character is just pitch-perfect. My favorite is Mr. Toad.\n\n-I love dark fairytales and fantasy being mixed into modern settings. The Fables world seems like a fantastic choice for a Telltale game like this.\n\n-The choices here feel like they have more weight than they did in TWD. It's hard to say how much of a difference it'll have in future episodes, but there's one choice in particular that seems like it'll have a really interesting consequence for later parts of the series.\n\n-You can actually fail here. I didn't ever reach a game over myself, but they exist, so you do want to keep on your toes during quick time events. I feel like that creates more tension during the gameplay so I'm glad they went with that rather than David Cage-ing it and just force you onto rails.\n\n-Bigby's a really fun, interesting character. (In fact, his anti-hero ways and struggles with his anger have partially inspired me to go back to TWD and try out playing Lee as a bit more dark and violent to see how that character can change.)\n\n-The animations are more fluid and less clunky than they were in TWD season 1.\n\nCons:\n-There's some weird graphical hiccups in the game sometimes where a character will be doing an animation and snap into place for the next animation in the middle of another one. It's not that bad, but it can be pretty distracting when it happens.\n\n-I'm not too fond of how you interact with objects. When you hover over, say, a door, you're given options to interact with it--like kicking it open, knocking, talking through the door, etc. To do this, a circle pops up with your different options on different sides, and you have to hover over the side of the circle that's labeled with the action you want to make. I thought maybe that you'd be able to use WASD or the buttons on the controller to select from the list, but...no, as far as I can tell, you can only do it by moving the mouse or thumbstick in the right direction, and it can be a bit of a pain trying to line up the cursor with the right action and sometimes it's not even totally clear exctly where in the circle you need to be to do it. (I used keyboard + mouse, which I recommend, because I've heard it's even more of a pain with a controller.) Luckily you're not really on a time crunch when you're using this mechanic, but it's still a little unintuitive. I really hope Telltale makes it so that in later episodes you can use WASD or the buttons on the controler to decide what action you take once you're within the circle, I think it would flow better.\n\n-I don't really like how shadows look on characters in this game. I think what they're going for is sort of a water-color effect--as the shadow spreads across the characters, a sort of inky, desaturated shadow blooms out over the characters. The thing is, at least on my PC, the edge of the shadows were noticably hard-edged and square-like when the character was close to the camera (particularly on Bigby) which made it look like a low-quality, pixel-y texture. It's not noticeable when the character is farther away (or moving quickly), and it's entirely possible that it's a problem on my PC's end, like i don't have the right drivers updated or something. Still, since my computer can handle the game with the settings turned up to high it was disappointing to see something like that.\n\nOverall any critique I have about the game feels more like nitpicking. This won't be for everyone, but if you like the choose-your-own-adventure style of video game (or "interactive experience" or whatever you'd like to call it) then as long as you can handle the mature content I highly recommend it.","November 27, 2013","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Telltale could be on for another success if the quality of the work continues throughout the remaining four episodes. As a first episode, it succeeds at pulling players into a different thematic experience than The Walking Dead, and should make people excited for what is to come from the rest of the season.","December 1, 2013","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is an adventure game based on a comic book series written by one of the principal writer's of Image Comics, 'The Walking Dead' series. The adaptation for television is now a blockbuster tv show. The gist of the 'Wolf Among Us', series is that Fables have been forced to update themselves in NYC, and you are the Big Bad Wolf, and Fabletown's Sheriff. There has been a murder in Fabletown, and as Sheriff you have to play the gumshoe and solve the case. Simple gameplay, with lots of story. Finally, your decisions, wise or otherwise, have a large effect on the results of the game. If you like the genre of this game, then its well worth the try.","December 25, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
