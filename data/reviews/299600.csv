I am mainly playing this game on my Vita where I have about 15 hours in at the moment, and I am still only scratching the surface.\n\nYou might be rightfully concerned by the negative reviews, and many of the points concerning the UI and controls are valid, but note that many of the points have been addressed within hours, and  after one day many of the issues have already been patched !\n\nThe developers respond to almost any form of criticism in the forums and in these reviews. This, in combination with the fact that the issues that kept people from getting in to the game are easily fixable, makes it very easy for me to recommend this game.  I know I am repeating myself, but do yourself a favour and try the game, if all that is keeping you from it are people that bash the horrible UI. It has been enhanced after one day and I am sure it will be completely up to par with modern games soon.\n\nOn to the game itself:\n\nThe theme is a mixture between modern fairytale, the Discworld and classic fantasy RPG settings. It works very well in my opinion and in the story mode everything comes together as more than just a skin for another roguelike. The dialogues are usually quite short, but there is a deeper story that slowly unfolds after some initial standard type quests.\n\nThe progression is linear in the beginning, since at that point you can only go to places where you currently have missions, but the world opens up more and more as you progress. At first I was frustrated to not be able to go back to some places, but it is a mechanic that keeps you from farming the same difficulty dungeon again and again, which is the same for almost every roguelike (where you can go back to previous floors but they will remain empty once you looted and killed everything).\n\nThe core gameplay is the most important part of course, and it is simply addicting. Combat leaves a lot of space for strategy, since you have both a melee and a ranged weapon (as well as spells and bombs) and additionally pets can deal damage and tank enemies. Every enemy type behaves differently and uses lethal skills that you have to learn to evade. Different weapons behave differently (e.g. spears hit two fields in front of you instead of just one). There are elemental attacks and resistances/weaknesses you have to exploit.\n\nThe flow of the game is faster than many other roguelikes I've played, even faster than Dungeons of Dredmor (which I adore by the way). The action feels very satisfying with some nice bullet-time effects when you kill enemies or land critical strikes. Skill and spell animations are sometimes mind-blowingly cool, like tiles jumping up and down in a circle around you.\n\nThere are typical roguelike mechanics like traps, special rooms, hidden treasure, shrines, teleports, unique (named) enemies and much more, but also some unusual mechanics like hidden rooms or blocks you can push around. Explaining the latter would spoil a lot because it is part of the game to figure them out.\n\nAs a nice addition there is fishing and crafting, the former needs some rework to be more fun, the latter becomes an important part of the game when you advance further and have to manage the many parts of equipment you can have.\n\nThe graphics have been compared to tablet/mobile games, I can somehow see where this is coming from, since the sprites seem to have been created via pre-rendered models, but I suggest you just look at the screenshots and evaluate that for yourself. In my opinion the environments have a level of detail and beauty to them that is unrivalled for this style of 2D games.\n\nTo address some of the complaints:\n- "Diagonal movement is difficult on controllers." True, definitely needs some recalibration or the Shiren/Izuna solution, where you have to press a button to move diagonally. Surprisingly this did not get in my way very often.\n- "It is hard to see what is behind walls and you can get stuck in sticky situations." The style of the graphics leads to confusing situations, but you can use the mini-map (especially the enlarged one) in sticky situations to make tile perfect decisions and execute them. An option to display a grid with some color coding for traversability would help here.\n- "Controls are bad." They are fast and need getting used to, but that is all. After an hour you feel right at home and I prefer them being as fast as they are. An option to adjust speed would be cool though.\n- "UI is broken". Some things are more tedious than they need to be, like shopping and comparing equipment, and I do not like the item description display (showing equipment stats that are never used for materials and consumables like in Disgaea is something I hate!). But everything can be done quite fast and the large and small hand-drawn icons for every single item really great! I can see very small changes that would make the UI as good as any other game, but at the moment it keeps the game from getting the amazement it deserves.\n\nAll in all it is a must buy, and I hope that the constant efforts of the developers in the recent days will change some of the reviewers minds, since a lot has been addressed or is being addressed at the moment. The core gameplay is a 10/10 for me, but the UI prevents me from giving the game the perfect score for now.","November 6, 2015","true","9.5"," 87 of 101 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","87","101","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RollEqualsCute/recommended/299600/","RollEqualsCute","Calamity Kitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RollEqualsCute/","482 products in account","As someone who kickstarted DFS, I have to admit that I'm impressed with the game so far. Considering this is Grimm Bros.' first game, it's a lot of fun and has a lot of charm packed into its story. It's got flaws (the UI, the crafting), but roguelike fans should still get a kick out of it.\n\nPROS:\n- Three game modes (Story, Survival, Endless Labyrinth)\n- Two difficulties (Normal and Hardcore/Permadeath)\n- Unlockable characters in Endless Labyrinth\n- Controller support (and it feels great now, thanks to patch)\n- Pets to collect, up to two in your party\n- Crafting and fishing systems to play around with (fishing bug has been patched)\n- The dungeon areas have a lot of little secrets\n- Devs are listening, taking in feedback, and releasing patches to fix major issues\n\nCONS:\n- Crafting UI is awful.\n- Menu system needs to be reworked\n- Not enough information in battle\n- Dungeons can feel "cluttered" and sometimes tricky to see/escape\n- A lack of keybindings\n- Storage space is small\n\nSUBJECTIVE:\n- The game can be difficult as hell (For me, a huge pro)\n- The aesthetics (bright/vibrant colors!)\n\nHaving put some time into it, I can definitely recommend this to fans of the roguelike genre. The combat mixes in melee with ranged. Pets provides some tactical advantage since it allows for flanking/backstabbing, and they have leveling independent from your own. You've got a rage meter, magic spells, and a crafting system to play around with. Scattered throughout the dungeons themselves are traps, switches that benefit or harm, rare merchants that sell crazy stuff, switches that create surprises when hit in the right order, and more.\n\nAnd now to clarify some of the cons.\n\nMost of these are small gripes. Admittedly, a lack of keybindings does hurt the game, especially since you're forced to navigate the (rather simple) menu in order to access Inventory, Equipment, Magic, etc. Adding keys to individually open up these specific menus would be great, but it's a small issue since the menu is easy enough to navigate. Also, you DO have storage space - but it's not terribly large and you may run out of space fairly quickly. Fellow packrats, be warned.\n\nThe crafting UI, on the other hand, is just plain bad. Your learned complex recipes (gear and such) are on the left-hand side and this is fine. However, simpler recipes such as creating planks out of raw wood, or the number of zinc required to make an ingot, are absent. Either memorization or documentation is needed for these, unless I'm missing something obvious. Additionally, you can only craft one item at a time. When crafted, it's required to move the finished product out of the "completed" slot before crafting the next one. It's tedious as hell and really needs to be modified.\n\nAdditionally, the menu doesn't need an Inventory screen. It's redundant when compared to the Equipment screen. Combat, while a lot of fun, also just doesn't give you enough information on your enemies and pets. You can't check individual pet HP, you can't scroll through enemy HP to prioritize them (a problem when in a crowd, since it could be a bit tricky to make out which bar belongs to who). I'm still wrapping my head around terrain bonuses, which would have benefitted from some kind of mouse-over or something. In short, the UI needs love. Lots of it.\n\nCLOSING:\nOverall, I personally feel that the game feels FUN despite its flaws, although (once again) you need to be a fan of roguelikes. This game is *hard.* If you enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor, Izuna, Shiren the Wanderer, etc. then there's a good chance you'll enjoy what's here.\n\nThat and the idea of Red Riding Hood traipsing through the woods, cheerfully murdering monsters is an idea that appeals to me.\n\nAs stated before, this is Grimm Bros.' first game. It's kinda rough, it's by no means perfect, but it's a solid title. I gave the devs my money and put my faith in them, and I've got faith that they'll keep updating/supporting this title by making it shine even more. Patches have already been shoved through the pipeline and they're checking their forums as well as Steam's.\n\nWill update this review as necessary.\n\nEdit: Added some details on the dungeon-crawling and removed the detail saying that DFS has farming. There is NO farming, I was writing this at 4am and had just finished a surreal dream about Kevin Costner. Also, my biggest cons have been patched, so huzzah! DEFINITELY recommend it now!","November 4, 2015","true","7.1"," 86 of 114 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","86","114","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctorsleem/recommended/299600/","doctorsleem","doctorsleem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctorsleem/","453 products in account","First, let me address some of the issues that people bring up.\n\nIt's turn-based like old rogue games. Each time you move or attack, the enemies move or attack. You fight in the cardinal directions, so you need to be smart about your positioning. All of this is as-designed. Making this a real-time game would make it a different game. If you're looking for something real-time, then you'd need to look for a different game. Part of the fun is predicting enemy actions and movements, making a deliberate choice, and being surprised. Related, you can't turn on a grid, but really, how hard is it to mentally overlay squares on the map?\n\nThe UI is not fantastic, but it's not horrible, either. Press a key (U) to open up the high-level menu, then navigate between inventory, equipment, crafting, etc. Sometimes it's easier to use a mouse within some of those sub-menus. I don't understand how this is all that different from Skyrim. It's not the pinnacle of user interface design, but I don't think it should be seen as a show-stopper.\n\nPeople are also complaining about the pet AI being bad. But again, to me, part of the fun is trying to predict the AI, which, like real intelligence, isn't completely predictable. I've found that with some careful consideration, I've been successful in making things align such that my pet is kicking ♥♥♥ with me most of the time. Again, it takes some strategy.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is suffering from the same problems that many roguelike games are suffering from: some gamers just don't "get" these types of games. They expect something different. These types of games are not for everyone. But at least this one has a Classic Mode that allows you to save your progress to learn how it works before going hardcore.\n\nI played for two hours last night and can't wait to get back into it tonight. This game is oozing strategy. Heaps of items, >500 crafting recipes, lots of fun to be had with equipment and skill combinations, challenging positioning gameplay, random world generation, lots of stats. Anyone that says that there isn't enough content for $20 is out of their mind, if you ask me. Some of these reviewers have like 5 hours into the thing. That's $4/hr. C'mon.\n\nIt takes time to learn games like this. I remember picking up Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and it felt like I was studying in school or something to learn how it worked. But it paid off. You'll find similarities in this game if you've played Stone Soup before.\n\nYou'll need to be willing to put a little time into understanding how this game works. But it's worth it.","November 4, 2015","true","3.5"," 54 of 71 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","54","71","3","4"

I just can't recommend the game, though. I love roguelikes and have played a number of them (Caves of Qud, ToME, DCSS, etc.), and this game isn't nearly as fun as any of those. The controls are akward, the UI is clunky, the missions are boring, and it's hard to even see what is going on. I gave it a shot, and was sorely disappointed.\n\nEDIT: Developer responded, apparently they have updated the game. I won't be playing it, though as I was turned off by the initial release and refunded the game. Hopefully the kinks were worked out and the game is as good as it seemed it was going to be prerelease.

As we know amazing art assets does not create an amazing experience. I can see a lot of poor decision that the dev team made for convinience( like given more ephasis to the portability of the product) by sacrificing game experience itself.\n\n-Front Ortho-cam is rather unefficient to handle multiple overlaying scene objects that are more than one square unit tall.\n-No key shortcuts or key remaping options (after all you dont use keys on a tablet or phone right?).\n-There is a lack of user feedback and tons of redability problems.\n\nThat said the art would be the only thing that could justify the current price. If you are not art an art oriented person I would suggest you to think twice before purchasing this title.\n\n=====================Second Edition==================\n\nHello Ash and Grimm Bros Team,\n\nIt is nice to see that the dev team is willing to improve the current product and hear the customers’ opinions and observations. Since you took the time to take my opinion into account I would be more than happy to provide you a more detailed answer.\n\nBefore getting into those details I want to express that I’m aware of the complexity that is involved on the creation of any interactive media product and how difficult it is to create an accurate user-product dynamic. I do apologize for my English as well, since it is not my first language. With that said, lets begin with the answer you requested me.\n\nUSER FEEDBACK RELATED ISSUES:\n\nCut-Scenes:\n\nWhen watching the intro cut scene I saw no “press <input> to skip” kind of message so my first thoughts were that transition between one cut scene image and the other one was automatic. Then the dialog stopped and it didn’t advance automatically. Hmmm…maybe I should press a key but which Key? There were no clues to figure out the key that I should press. I wanted to see the intro cut scene so my concern was: “what if I press an input to close or skip the whole cut scene instead of advancing to the next part of the cut scene”. I tried pressing space, enter and a bunch of other keys. But the game wasn’t asking me for a key. It wanted me to perform a click. Too much user-guessing right from the beginning.\n\nGame Mini Map:\n\nA mini-map’s main functionality is to allow the players to locate themselves on it. That means that you main focal stress on a mini-map should be the convention that represents the player on the map. A yellow pixel on top of equal sized brow pixels are not the best pallet and form choices to achieve this. All the other secondary elements on the mini-map (NPC and items) are more visible than the main character’s location itself. Conventions take a while to figure them out since there is no visible map legend to take a look at. Also it would be nice to be able to see key level features on the minimal like where are the local-zone teleporters located.\n\nParty health and stats:\n\nMoment to moment feedback of you party member’s is a must have. I can only see my party members’ health-bar briefly when moving from one tile to another one. Why not showing it always to allow the player to take more accurate decision and weight the risks before moving.\n\nKey bindings:\n\nIn the beginning I thought that there were no key shortcuts on this game. Then I read in some forums that apparently there is some key shortcuts but not much information about them. The game should include a control scheme section to be able to see the possible inputs for the user.\nAlso the ESC key functionality could be a little bit more practical. Open main menu and close menus will be a more common setup for this key.\n\nCurse Skull Icon:\n\nI didn’t notice when it was added to my screen or for what reason. I thought maybe is the time that I have to complete my quest. Then I notice that I ran out of time but I didn’t failed the quest. Then my conclusion was maybe is a period of time in which the undead enemies spawns. But again I was misled to believe that because of the undead iconography. Then I notice that it didn’t appear again. Long story short the 4th time I got cursed was when I realized that that Icon was meant to be the curse duration GUI representation element.\n\nChosen Path for the main character:\n\nIf you give the players the ability to move by clicking on the ground at least show them which path is the one that the AI is going to choose since the best path decided by the AI is not always the path that the player has in mind or would like to take. Moving by clicking is rather risky since the player is not able to forecast which path the AI is going to pick.\n\nREADABILITY RELATED ISSUES:\n\nOverlaying Objects:\n\nI can see how important was to create non-square art assets to maintain the overall aesthetic of the game. But, the proportions of the objects combined with the chosen orthogonal perspective create a lot of undesired overlapping. I can see that the current solution allows the player to see the main character through the front objects by reducing the opacity of the last ones but the low opacity is not enough to see the immediate surroundings of the player. It is really difficult to spot obstacles, path and items on dense vegetation areas were a lot of overlapping occurs.\n\nInput inconsistency:\n\nIn terms of inputs there are some dynamics that are natural for the user to expect. One user input equals to one outcome. If the user press the movement key once he or she would be expecting for the character to move one step on the map instead of two. The same can be said on the menu. If the user press the down key to go to the next option it should go down one step not two.\n\nVegetation and Terrain coexistence:\n\nThe Vegetation and the terrain does not integrate well in terms of creating a clear paths for the player to follow. Sometimes the vegetation can spawn in some places where it would give the impression that the player reached the boundaries of the map but is only an illusion created by the graphic composition on screen. This can be rather annoying if a target or objective is located on an area that is only reachable through that path. This is one of the biggest risks of leaving the level design to a procedural process. It can work very well sometimes but other times it could go really wrong.\n\nUI Usability:\n\nTrying to open the options menu is rather risky if you miss the button. The icon that brings the in-game main menu has a rather small clickable area and size. If you miss the click your character will walk towards the border of the screen no matter how far it is and how dangerous it is. You could step over several traps or get into undesirable fights. Also it would be nice to be able to close the menus by clicking outside them instead of closing each menu one by one.\n\nOnce again thank you for hearing my observations and I will look forward to see the evolution process of your product.","November 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 128 of 201 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","128","201","6","4"

The fighting can get as hectic or as slow and methodical as you want it to be. If you want to treat it like a game of Gauntlet, you can, but you'll get cut down pretty quickly, because some of these monsters are vicious, and invisible with AOE attacks or subtle but deadly sapping attacks. Like a floating cloud of pixies that floats in your blind spot and sucks you dry, or an ice spirit that spawns out of a random stalagmite and destroys your whole party with a frost blast. Or all of that plus a ghoul, a skeleton in a wedding veil, some giant golems, either attacking you or patrolling, or sleeping, or stepping on hidden traps so you don't have to. And you were just innocently trying to gather some soil samples, or deliver a package, or find a particularly rare and delicious fish in a hidden pond. It's a tough world, luckily you have friends.\n\nAnd pets. I love the pets, they can learn tricks, and level up, and they're pretty helpful. If you lose your pets, you better change your position in your chair and move close to the screen because it's time to ♥♥♥♥ing focus. That's when you can become easily overwhelmed by a bunch of low level enemies. But some might consider the pets a crutch, because they definitely are a game changer. Without them watching your back, you will need to run most of the time and use more bombs and range weapons. But then again the pet AI is so dumb that you will need to jump in save your wolf friend at times. I prefer to think instead of dumb AI its just a stupidly brave wolf-dog that gets in over his head sometimes, needing you to jump in front so he can jump in from behind.\n\nYou can also hire an NPC party member to watch your back. Or you might luck onto a wandering hero and follow them through a dungeon, grabbing whatever loot and treasure chests they seem to ignore. Or you can just go around breaking people's stuff and trading the scrap in for gold. I guess these beds and dinner tables belong to the monsters? Well they're now a bunch of metal rods and boards I can sell or craft.\n\nThere is also crafting, tons of loot, a lot of underlying mechanics I haven't figured out yet, random encounters that are fun, and a plot in there somewhere. A whimsical kind of humor and a female protagonist that is cute and sassy but not overly snarky or an a%-hole, like a real stand up, kick ♥♥♥, and fall down with a bottle of dragonberry rum kind of lady.  Just don't overdo it with the booze health items, or she'll black out and lose control and go ax murderer berserk, which might get you out of a jam, where she kills everybody. Or it may get you to the Game Over screen if the enemies tactics are too deadly. Like projectile and AOE users are immune to disorganized melee attacks, even if she is extra durable and deals out extra berserker damage. Its an interesting dynamic and adds to fun game play either way. Just make sure to save periodically. Or live dangerously and play in Hardcore rogue-like mode.\n\nI have no problems recommending this one. It's fun, it s quirkly, it's got a lot of "game" to play around with. It's not perfect, the graphical representation of doors and portals and some distances can be a little confusing at times, or you might miss something. The blind-spot/shadows of perception mechanic can also hit or miss with some. I happen to like it, especially with the lighting that comes with dynamic time of day and weather changes. There isn't much I don't like about the game, the UI is a little clunky, but I use the mouse to get around it. Between the mouse and the gamepad, I get by and have a lot of fun.\n\nThe game could use some polish, but I like it how it is, and am enjoying it quite a bit. Give it a try if you like rogue-likes or games like Azure Dreams or Izuna the Unemployed Ninja. If you like dungeon crawling and collecting weapons and leveling and leaving a trail of dead, this game is for you.","November 8, 2015","true","12.6"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","0"

It’s the perfect entry point for players who like the idea of roguelikes but who have been put off by other games with bland, minimalist graphics and impossible difficulty curves. It might even be enough to appeal to Diablo fans looking for a similar, but less frantic turn-based experience.\n\nMake no mistake, this game can be difficult and you will die - a lot. Unlike the more hardcore roguelikes, however, Dragon Fin Soup has an active save system that somewhat mitigates against the difficulty. (Roguelike purists can turn this off for a really punishing experience.)\n\nDragon Fin Soup has a wonderfully dry, restrained sense of humor - without rubbing it into your face or overstaying its welcome.\n\nAll artwork is simply stunning. Every monster and NPC has a lovingly detailed portrait as good as any caricature artist that I have ever seen. Overall the art is vibrant, colourful and cartoonish - perfect for a backlit monitor – something that in my view we don’t see enough in a world where everything is apparently supposed to be dark, gritty and sepia toned.\n\nYou can tell this game is a labor of love, demonstrated by the many ‘trivial’ details, such as balls in the home town that you can kick around, the fact that you can fell trees in a row by having one falling tree crash into another… and another, and the selection of cheesy fully vocalised songs sung by the entertainer in the tavern.\n\nAnd I haven’t even mentioned yet the enormous loot table, pets, fishing, the detailed crafting system and a kick-@rse female protagonist.\n\nI can be a critical reviewer but I am struggling to find much to criticise here. About the worst I can say is that the lack of an in-game tutorial is a shame (mitigated, to some degree, by a series of dev hints accessible off the main men).\n\nDragon Fin Soup has been maligned by a selection of reviews since release due to a range of day-one bugs and other problems. With the most recent patch (1.07, 9 Feb 2016) the vast majority of these complaints have been resolved. It’s a shame that as a result of early hickups this game will likely struggle to find the audience that it deserves.\n\nDragon Fin Soup reminds me of why I love computer games.","February 22","true","3.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Combat feels satisfying, crafting is intriguing, map generation is interesting enough, and the art is just so damn beautiful! What's not to love here?\n\nI will admit the UI and control scheme do have their fair share of issues; but as of Day 2 the devs have already pushed a patch that fixes some of the more glaring problems, which is huge in my book.

Very optimistic for the future!\n\nDon't be so quick to judge by the bad reviews, and don't purchase expecting an epic, expansive rpg experience.

Here is why.\n\nI was one of the kickstarter backers for this game. I was aware from the screenshots what kind of game it will be but I took a risk and backed it anyhow. The way the game is built is like it is one big Final Fantasy tactics map, but unlike that kind of game, the "step by step" map system is active even outside of battles. This may be frustrating at times but also fun as it gives you the feeling that you are playing the game the whole time, as opposed to feeling that you are playing a challenge only when battles arise. At times you will find the movement clunky, especially if you are using joypad, but you could always use the mouse to select where to go and she will go there automatically, or u can destroy the trees and obstacles in your path to create your own path, collecting loot as you do so.\n\nIf you can get past the clunkiness and accept that the game was intentionally created this way, there is a deep sense of fun and involvement. I like the world and the idea. A drunken "red riding hood" and her pet wolf working as mercenaries for hire while also trying to discover her past. The artwork, character and mood of the ambient music makes u feel very involved. Remember, when you feel stuck or can't get past some place, that means there is something u need to do or figure out. Whether it is a puzzle or simply needing to destroy the obstacle down to keep moving, any obstacles or "clunkiness" in the game is intentional. It feels this way.\n\nOverall it is a fun experience if you want to try something new and wiling to get past the default preconceptions of how a game SHOULD be. The obstacles and clunkiness are no different than the frustration one feels when you play the original megaman games and you realize that you can't duck. :) It is part of the game\n\nAlso knowing that this game was made by 5 indie developers, they did quiet a good job. Also the artwork and world inspired by the Grimm Brothers' tales really connects to me. :)\n\nTo sum up\n\nPros:\n-Lovely Artwork\n-New Idea\n-Involving gameplay\n-Interesting Music\n-Loveable characters\n-Nice contradiction between a colorful world and a moral-less culture\n-You get better at it the more you play it\n-Some puzzles are not explained and you feel a sense of satisfaction when you figure them out on your own\n-It feels like one big game as opposed to separate layouts for battles and walking the map (turned based environment, like one big chess board)\n-Tons of looting. There is crafting too but haven't tried it yet. :)\n- Even though it is a rogue-like game, the default storymode offers you an option to restore when dead as well as saves, so you have the choice between playing a normal game in story mode or a permadeath game in survival mode. :)\n\nCons:\n-Not what you expect it at first to be\n-the clunky turned based movement takes you off guard at first\n-no tutorial whatsoever. The instructions are with the manual included with the game. I got it as a kickstarter backer. Not sure if it's included with steam purchase (update: discovered the manual exists in the main menu under the title "Read or Die" :) )\n-can make u feel confused at times and wondering if you are doing the right thing\n-puzzles not being explained can be frustrating to some people\n\nOverall if you give it a chance you find yourself enjoying it. There was definitely effort invested in this game. I personally enjoyed it. Feel free to see which cons and pros matter more to you before you purchase it. :)\n\nI personally give it 7/10 :)","November 4, 2015","true","6.3"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Although in a classic sense, DFS is a good example of a modern take on the roguelike/lite genre,a few things feel a bit lackluster in the complete package. The campaign mode is enchanting, but incredibly repetitive. It follows a simple formula that boils down to "do a few randomly generated "go here, do this" quests, then receive something to advance the story". While this isn't really a problem, it feels like it's delaying the storyline unnecessarily by making what should essentially be "sidequests" into a necesary part of the game.\n\nThe randomly generated modes of the game offer great fun in a nicely digestible format. If you're itching for something to sink a few hours at a time in without excessive frustration, this may be your ticket. If you're looking for a deep, complex roguelike such as ADOM or ToME, the lack of options may feel a little restrictive.","December 10, 2015","true","13.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The game became incredibly replayable, especially on the Survival modes.\n\nWith that said, when the game launched there were problems with the UI being a bit clunky and recipes were hard to come by, but the developers are very responsive to player feedback and the UI was patched to perfection and recipes reworked to be shared between all playthroughs.

Quick note to people playing this atm, I would suggest reading up on the in game manual guide to get a better sense of what all the status ailments are and stats on your hero do.\n\nPROS\n+Humor, for example, each piece of loot has a tiny line of description. I found a shield with poorly written handwriting on it and the description something of the likes of: "May have been written by a dyxlexic person."\n+Tons of Loot with an accompanied slot on the hero, such as earings, ring slots, head slot, cape slot? (for her hood?) the type of ammo she equips, her gun (shotgun, rifle or handgun,) and it goes on and on.\n+As above, you can customize your "loadout" so to speak, and choose if you want a more defensive approach, instead of dual wielding weapons, perhaps you want to use a sword and board approach. While you may do less damage, your shield will provide you the proper defenses necessary. You can also choose what type of ammo you want to use. There are a plethora of ammo types with their own strengths and weaknesses (perhaps even elemental attributes later on in the game?)\n+Tons of crafting, there are a ton of recipes to be found in all the maps. While crafting isn't necessary, I can already tell I will be at an advantage if I choose to.\n+Exploration is rewarded, every map that is randomly generated (as far as I am aware of) has nooks and crannies filled with crafting recipes, potions, or random loot.  The more your dig the more you may find.\n+Artstyle is amazing, there are three levels of zoom during the game. You can zoom out to see a large portion of the map and your hero, or zoom in really close up to get right in the action. Each enemy is well drawn in game and their hero portrait reminds me of games like Jeanne D arc or Tactics Ogre for the PSP. Love love love the art design, and what is amazing is that is was done all by one guy.\n+Day and night effects really effect the game. As you progress through a quest and time passes by, the map gets darker as it gets later. When it gets really dark, it can make things difficult to see. A cool feature in my opinion that isn't done in many games.\n+Weather effects! So far I have seen sunny, rainy, and windy effects. It makes the world you are slaying monsters in feel a bit more alive as everything isn't so stagnant. The weather effects really are great! Hopefully there is snow later on!\n+Random events as you travel from quest to quest. So far its just bandits trying to steal your money, you are given the option to give them your gold or fight them to the death to keep it.  Hopefully these random events change up, but I liked that there was some random element to the game.\n\n\nIndifferent\n+- Dumps you in to the game world without really a tutorial or a quick learning guide. What does MP do in this game? What does each stat mean on your hero? Why should you craft? You gave me a wolf at the start of the game as my pet, it attacks monsters, is there anything else to it?\n+-There is a ton of loot in the game, and as far as I can tell none of it changes the appearance of your hero. While I can understand that would be difficult to implement, it really would have brought up the immersion to your hero one extra notch. Like in Zelda Link to the past, when Link gets a different color tunic, he changes to red or blue link. Or in Diablo where your weapon and armor constantly change your appearance. What you see in the trailers is what you get, red Robin (the name of our hero in this game.)\n+-I am at the point where monsters are getting really tough and all the potions I bought from the shop are not restocking. They haven't restocked at all during my first three hours, and to be honest you kind of need to balance slaying and quaffing potions from time to time throughout each quest/map.  Without potions, you are going to die sooner or later as there is no block mechanic in this game.\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n-So you are pretty much a mercenary for hire, where you go get odd jobs for money at the local pub.  Story starts off super slow, at the two to three hour mark is when you start learning about the protagonist Robin, for an RPG (and roguelike) that is a bit on the slower end of things. The first couple of hours you are just doing a couple fetch quests and kill quests from some dude in the pub, and without a sense of purpose of why you are going on these missions there really is no value you what you are doing. I was asking myself, why does gold matter, why do I want to progress to the next level?\n-Soundtrack is decent, but whats more upsetting is the sound effects. The trailer narrator is poor and that is also the intro of the game, but what is hands down unbearable in this game is the monster sound effects. All of them sound like they come out of a speaker then recorded back in to the speaker. There isn't a precise sound with them, they sound muffled and sound really low quality. Furthermore, many of the monster sounds all blend together and when they make their noise each time they attack you, it can be annoying at times.\n\nWrap up: I had my eyes on this game many years ago and have been following along on it ever since.  I am having fun with the game more so now that the story is opening up. Yes the fetch quests and kill quests at the beggining make you wonder why exactly you are doing it, but after the first story sequence I am more inclined to press forward. I do like exploring each and every map for the goodies. There is a certain rewarding feeling of leveling up your charachter and equipping new loot along the way. For people that love loot and customizing their hero, this will be a rewarding game for you. I feel like if you know there is going to be a slow start to the game, I would say pick it up!\n\nIf I get the time I will definitely add a quick lookish video tomorrow letting you visually see what it is I am talking about. I haven't even gotten a chance to dive in to the rogue like modes (that is initially why I was interested in the game in the first place many years ago) or the endless mode. There is a lot of content here to be had, perhaps Grim Bros should have really nailed one gameplay option?","November 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","29","45","0","0"

Naw, it's straight up old school Roguelike gameplay, and I love it.\n\nI keep picking up hints that this is a game made by people who love video games, just little references to other games here and there.  This makes the game very enjoyable for me.\n\nI'm actually playing it on a computer that's not at all deisgned for gaming (a bargain bin, single core laptop) and the game is playing just fine, minus some lengthly loading times.  Since it's a turn based game I can't see this being much of a problem.  So good job!\n\nMy only complaints just far, echoing some of the others I've read, is that there's no way to rebind keys.

I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from. Maybe the recent updates fixed a lot of problems that I never saw.\n\nI'm about 6.5 hours in to it and like it quite a bit. You are based out of a small town and go on quests that the towns people give you. Most of the the quests are a stand-alone rogue-ish missions with one or more dungeon-type levels (some are outdoors). You can fail missions but you do not permanently die unless you select hardcore mode or whatever it's called.\n\nOne of the main things I like about it is the number of gear slots. There are about 15, including four rings. You are not showered with loot but there is enough to keep it interesting.\n\nI'm level 15 and only have 2 skills so far. I'm not even sure how I got them. There are a bunch of slots for skills so I assume there are many more but I don't know how to get them.

It feels like a casual game and a bad port and something that could be fun.\n\nI hope the devs polish this a lot.  The PC release needs to play well on a PC.\n\nLet's start with some basic things, controls.  Though the devs have stated that the pc is their primary platform, they don't play by longstanding pc conventions.  What do you expect 'esc' to do in a game for pc? Nothing? Oh, wait, it exits menus, but does not bring up an options menu with load and save and most importantly - quit?!   How about "alt-tab'?  In full screen, nothing, nada, zilch.  That's not right. In a roguelike, dungeon crawler, rpg, etc, pushing the "i" key should bring you to your inventory.  And it should be customisable.  These are only a few of the issues.  All in all it feels like a bad port made primarily for gamepads or touchscreens. I play with mouse and keyboard and have the option of a touchscreen.  Touchscreen is too tedious and not precise enough for the action.  Mouse and keyboard are awkward.  Moving by mouse click will have you fined your hard earned gold when you accidentally cut down city trees (Protip: some things are worth smashing in town once you have some money to pay for it).  Moving by WASD and QEZC for diagonals is much better, with enter for attacking the selected target, though that requires the occasional mouse use to point your character in the right direction.  For a game that require precision to survive, the controls don't always allow it.  Then there's the camera...\n\nThough the difficulty ramps up appropriately for its genre, it doesn't feel very satisfying when you die or lose your comrades to clicking on an iceblock instead of the ghost next to it.  The terrain needs to turn transparent at a distance, not when standing directly under/north of/next to it.  And it seems that this "feature" is used in the dungeons fairly often to hide treasure and treasure rooms.  I found myself playing by the minimap too much, which just can't be right given the work put into the look of the game.  And sadly, once you remove that aesthetic, DFS doesn't compare well to other roguelikes out there.  The limitiations of the character, the apparent lack of content (linear progression), and the awkward controls really let it down.\n\nOh, and the fishing minigame is broken out of the gate (to be patched soon according to the forums.)\n\nThe menus UI must be improved.  It can easily be slimmed down.  There are three, possibly four, screens that could be combined into one.  The inventory screen is pointless; it might as well be merged with the equipment screen.  The pets screen could be merged too, since your pets are just another item.  The other item management screen, crafting, has its own issues - far too many clicks, no recipe automation - and realistically could be merged with inventory too, though that might confuse the already awkward controls.  One glaring fault in the crafting menu is no easy transition to equipment.  If I make something worthwhile I probably want to put it on as quickly as possible.  There is wasted space on the left hand side, why not have my equipment over there so I can try on my new stuff?  Or, if that isn't feasible, and I admit it would start to look a bit too cluttered, how about a button that brings me straight to my equipment menu like the one that the redundant inventory menu has?\n\nCrafting is dull, awkward (again) and a bit of a grind.  When you finally do make something interesting you probably can't use it for some time.  I have some cargo pants that must wait to wear because I was half the appropriate level when I made them.  Finally putting them together was a genuinely exciting moment.  But now I must be very patient.  To wear cargo pants... As far as awkward goes, it is far better with mouse than with gamepad.  But it can still be imroved.  Right click, shift click, alt click, ctrl click,middle click, even double left click could move the ingredient into the crafting station.  Instead we right click the ingredient, move the mouse to find the occasionally different location of the move ingredient button, then left click that button.  You do this over and over again to level up your abilities to craft something that might be useful.  You can slowly drag and drop too, but both of these options are inferior to a simple double or single click.\nThis particular problem has been solved, before.  Why are we reinventing the wheel of inventory management with every game?  The right click context menu of move, eat, exit menu, and trash is unnecessary and slows every process down.  Perhaps it works for gamepads but it's a step backward for the rest of us.  A trash can in the corner works fine for the few times you need to use it.  I doubt it requires the 25%-33% attention that the right click context menu affords it.  And the buttons moving around are just... aweful.  On the far right hand side, I have to be very careful not to throw my gear away, because the context menu buttons are suddenly in a different place to account for the side of the screen.  And they change based on edibility.  There are no takebacks for trashed items.  Combine that with the massive amounts of item sorting for successful crafting/ingredient storage = headache.\n\nSkills also need improving.  They have short descriptions but no NUMBERS!  I must open my equipment, look at my wall of numbers, exit to the game, use the skill, open back to my equipment and then compare to see what it did.  Why not just tell me in the first place?  Once again, this problem has been solved before.  The devs say it is not a casual game, but the text only descriptions of skills says something else.  Skills are also gained entirely at random, which brings me to leveling.\n\nLeveling.  This is where it feels most casual.  Sometimes I get +1 attack from a level.  Sometimes I get +1 in six or seven other areas too.  It isn't obvious why this is happening.   I assume it is based on what skills you have used.  This leads to the following scenario:  if you spent a character level (or ten)  doing very well and killing enemies before they can damage you, then you won't improve your armor skills, leaving you out of luck later on in the game.  Your character doesn't progress in any other way.  There are no skill trees, classes, abilities, perks.  None of that.  You find random skills in crates.  For a game with an "adult humor" veneer, that feels very immature in a game design way, not much substance, it starts to veer into a territory that is very shallow, very...  casual.\n\nCombat is hampered by all of the above.  Also, when you heal or find an item or skill, there is a very annoying popup (can i get a popup blocker for this game?) that hangs around for a little too long.  It is directly over your character, stopping all action.  Put that information to the side where it belongs, color coded to show health and items different from damage rolls.  There are also obnoxious popups for leaving areas.  If I walk through a doorway I don't want to confirm.  If I speak to a vendor I don't want to confirm.\n\nAll in all, this game seems to have gone through production without quality feedback.  Some of these design choices are obviously wrong for the medium.  Escape should bring up an options menu so we can quit easily (and seek a refund, perhaps).  You don't hide it in a submenu of to the side.  Furthermore, game design according to the popup ads industry is a huge annoyance for everyone.  Keep things smooth.  It all leaves me my scratching my head, and by the length of this review, for clearly too long.  That said I am still trying to play it and I am having some occasional fun.  There seems to be some fun to be had here, but the tools to scratch that itch are all wrong and somewhat painful.  Much of this is cosmetic. Some is substantial.  For me, it is death by a thousand cuts.","November 4, 2015","false","20.1"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","26","45","0","0"

You are interested about the flaws ofc, right? But let's start what makes Dragon Fin Soup so delicious and pretty addictive. I have mostly played the story mode.\n\nFirst thing which hits the honey spot for me is the atmosphere of the game. The charming and pretty unique graphics and the sweet ♥♥♥ soundtrack makes me grin, and even those together makes the game's fantasy world feel unique and alive.The level of detail in the game is pretty impressive too; furnitures inside houses + lot of detail on all the models: like character models, deep crafting system, tons of stuff to equip and use, minigames, traps and secrets etc. There are also three game modes; Story mode which is more like regular RPG and  then endless labyrinth + survival modes where you can unlock more characters and play those more like roguelike game.The humor of the game is spot on with funny equipments, references to other games and tv shows, and goofy characters. Most of the characters are also pretty memorable and the main character Red Robin is one of them + she is pretty damn likable too.\n\nThe flaws what I can think about after the updates are; No key binding option in the game yet (you can remap the keys from config file though), a bit clunky options menu (and some other menus for some ppl) and the weather effects and other effects makes it sometimes hard to see what is happening in the game. The devs have been pretty active though and they plan to update the game further what I have heard, so some of these things might change for better in future.\n\nThis game is damn charming and, if you like turn-based RPGs/roguelike games, you should pick this up. Especially, if the game is on sale. However...because this is a niche game and have some flaws, the game isn't everyones cup of soup. That's why I highly recommend you to check out the tutorial video of the game which gives you pretty detailed idea how the game works. :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4LIpIxYOW4\n\n+ This guide for basics is good way to get you going.\n...and also remember to check the guide in the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551595759","April 18","true","5.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I will have later to google around to understand what is the rage bar for example.\nAlthough there are little flaws, the game seems really funny and I like the graphic style. The absence of permadeath in the normal campaign is a bonus as I like to play a roguelike but without the stress that my next step will be the last one. For whoever instead loves that adrenaline, is plenty of other modes I didn't explore with increasing difficulty and permadeath.\nThe combat works quite well but YOU HAVE to read the manual because is not overly intuitive. Another thing I noticed is that when you walk the objects in front of you fade to keep the focus always on the main character. You have to get used to it because it could mean that you try to reach a destination towards the bottom of the screen and get stuck before realising there is an obstacle in front of you.\nBut as I said nothing here so far tells me that this is not a game I would recommend.

They both do exactly what is needed and compliment each other. Decent core gameplay that is quite fun once you understand what is going on.\n\nCONS\n\nNEEDS TUTORIAL. Not everyone has time to read through a manual, or can remember it all. There are many mechanics working together that need to be explained in a methodical manner. Simple way to incorporate into the story are: flashback sequences, training areas, or simple pop up boxes when you first encounter a  new mechanic.\n\nYou can get stuck behind seemingly invisible walls randomly, only to realise that a part of the environment is in front of you, but it has turned invisible to show you where your character is. Once this is destroyed you can continue.\n\nThe opening sequences heavily imply of an overall lore and a story to be told about the main character. Yet 3 hours in, I have yet to actually start anything resembling a main quest. All quests so far have been essentially side quests. There was even a moment after around 2 hours there was story progression (expected to be given a proper quest) I was then told to do more side quests...\n\nOverall the main issues are all related to the game mechanics not being explained to the player. This would sort out 80% of issues. It's all the little things that add up, like the fact that within 20 mins of starting the game I had minus 64 gold because I accidentally caused property damage... This was not explained. Or I have died in battles with no idea of how I died. Or why I can't use a power crystal thing to upgrade a weapon (even after following on-screen instructions). Or how I assumed I could sleep in my bed to recover HP (but can't), however health recovers outside of battle slowly (never explained).\n\nOnce this is fixed, and story/plot progression is sorted, this would be a great game.\n\n\n\n","November 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Sadly if i had given up on day one like a lot of others, they might not have seen what the game is really like. But overall it has a complexity to it that you don't see in a lot of rogue likes.\n\nSo for me the Pro's would be\n\n-Crafting, while complex unlike a lot of others that require a lottery of luck to get the pieces you need it gives you the opportunity to explore and destroy almost your entire surroundings to find what you might need to make the gear you want and what you don't find through luck you can often times buy from npcs.\n\nThe con of that system though is this\n\n-Though the crafting system could be happier if just when on that screen right clicking an item would send it to the crafting forge instead of click and drag.\n\nThe pro's of fighting are\n\n-It tells you pretty much at the start, you can move and even shoot diagonally up to a point with certain weapons. The pet system for tanks and sometimes even higher more sustained damage than you have, they heal quickly and while you can only have two you can carry more pets in your inventory should one be knocked out. Pet's don't die they can be revived in town, while i cannot say for certain this is the same in endless dungeon or survival mode that just means you have to be more protective and careful just like any other rogue like game.\n\n-Weapons all have their own way to fight with them, some have multiple attacks others just one harsh hard fit, axes swing realisticly all around you and spears pierce through targets in a line.\n\nCon's of it sadly are\n\n- Not being able to easily distinguish pet's health bar, your own health bar apart from enemies. Being different colors might help but for now it's easiest to just look below at the bigger health bar for you but that doesnt help your pets.\n\n- Sometimes it can be hard to see if an enemy is on the same line as you to attack it horizontally, but the minimap does help you figure that out as well partly.\n\nOverall though from what i've seen the game is rather fluid, it punishes you at times but if you are careful and have a mind for rogue likes and learn how to cheat your way out of circumstances, and there are times I do recommend running to find that nook and cranny you need to fight those hardest of enemies, or to get back and regenerate your health because of something unexpected, if you like rogue likes give it a shot when it's on sale because so far i've enjoyed my time with it and the quirky characters to it and even if you just play it because it's a rogue like while I can't say as of yet it will get as many hours out of me as "faster than light, rogue legacy, our darker purpose, binding of isaac" it will make me play it to completion and likely play through it again through the non story modes afterwards for a true roguelike experience.\n","November 13, 2015","true","20.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I really really do. I got hyped for it when I saw it at PAX Prime the past two years cause the story and character(s) seemed fresh and new.\n\nUnfortunately, for the price I paid, the game is severly lacking. The UI is clunky, the crafting system is burdensome and impossible to manage (500+ recipes /all/ of which have to be learned by discovering them in the world if you don't look them up on random forums). The story line hasn't progressed and currently I'm level 33 without any idea of where the writers/developers planned to progress the story.\n\nIt has been a never ending series of fetch quests and rescue missions and none of them progress the story. Not being able to map keybinds is also frustrating as there are quite a few menus to make use of. The manual is extremely short and not nearly detailed enough. I still have no idea the purpose of the rage bar or what monster defenses are like. I'm hack and slashing through combat hoping for the best even though I'm a min/max player.\n\nRobin is such a cool and interesting character but this game doesn't do her any justice and she doesn't get nearly drunk enough (plus the dialogue feels flavorless). Has literally felt like I'm continually going back and forth to the den of evil over and over again and I'll never even get to andarial... if you get the d2 reference.\n\nI will definitely revisit the review if any of my suggestions are taken into account but in the mean time I have to shelf this game since it's not just doing it for me. I'm surprised none of these issues (and others) were considered considering how many times this game was "delayed" for release.\n\nAlso I still have no reason why I ate a pair of leather pants that seemed pretty good.

Most of the enemies go down by clicking mouse button and using 'health potion' untill they die. I was hoping for more tactical approach where you needed to think what to do next. The game has bombs, ranged weapons and spells, but you don`t need to use them. It is easier to just spam left mouse button. The ammo is limited and it is too much hassle stocking it or switching between ammo types. Bombs are somewhat usefull because they do lot of damage.\n\nSpells? Basically I am 11h in game at level 32 and I have found 3 spells. Two of them are useless and just give a little protection against certain elements. One of them gives damage boost, but you also take more damage. If they gave me some usefull spells at the beginning it would spice up the gameplay or maybe even somekind of special attack. No such luck.\n\nStory is a lackluster. Basically you do random chores until you get something story related. The chores are mostly about rescuing some random person and then getting 500g as reward. Resurrecting a pet costs 10k gold. You get jack-smith with 500g.\n\nWith minor changes the game would have gotten positive review from me. Biggest problem is that it is repetive, and no new tools are introduced after 30 mins of gameplay.

Thank you to them for that. If the game drastically improves, I will be back.\n\nI was quite excited for Dragon Fin Soup, but sadly I am a bit dissapointed. To sum up my feelings and issues with the game, I believe the developer team tried to capture too-wide of an audience (ie. they apparently are using nearly all platforms). When you overstretch like this, I think quality is lost. Trying to find balance between catering to a hardcore roguelike market as well as traditional console RPG people, and not mention perhaps mobile crowds.\n\nFor example, they brag 'roguelike' features, but as everybody knows this is a buzzword that gets thrown around too loosely. As I explain below, they do improve on some features from that genre, but it falls short in other areas and of overall being totally addictive. Another issue is that the graphics look uncomfortably close to mobile, with few-frame sprites and such. The artwork that is there is really good, but not in an indie-hit kind of way. Perhaps the game is amazing after 10 or 20 hours, but from what I have seen, I am not sure I am willing to sit through much more.\n\nPros:\n+They totally nailed finding a great mixture of turn-based gameplay while making it look smooth and real time. When things get hectic, you can get all stratetic a la ToME, but when running across the map you would never guess its turn-based.\n+Artwork is quite good, although it reminds me of mobile.\n+The story is quite charming (at least <2 hours in).\n+Seems to have a lot of depth (and the developers claim this), although I cannot speak past what I have played\n\nCons:\n-The fundamental controls could use some work. For example, you cannot attack diaganol, which is a fairly staple function in  classic roguelikes. Controls are not rebindable (c'mon this is a PC game for nearly 20$). Keyboard shortcuts were not listed anywhere that I could find (...Which should be really accessible), and they were'nt always the best design choice. If we are supposed to play this for 60+ hours, it better be comfortable.\n-All of the trees and bushes look beautiful and are fun to interact with at first, but end up feeling like garbage you need to wade through on the map.\n-Music IMO was meh. Once again probably great for mobile standards (Yes, I know this is not a mobile game... Yet).\n-Walls often covered chests up - walls should probably gain transparency when you are near.\n-Icons on the minimap are really too small. Even when you push 'tab' and it gets larger, it does not help much.\n-A very minor 'Con', but yet a point: the developer team may be too small to actually be able to handle and push forward this game on so many platforms. What you get now is probably what you will have forever, sans some minor bug fixes. I know this is a full version, which is cool, but I don't expect the kind of TLC that games like Crypt of the Necrodancer recieved.\n\nReally, I could overlook some of the issues if the price-point weren't so dang high. I bought on HumbleBundle and therefore cannot refund - I have buyers remorse at this point. I will play a bit longer to try to find some magic that I missed, but at this time I cannot recommend this to my Steam friends.","November 4, 2015","false","1.6"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","23","47","2","7"

Using a shotgun and certain abilities feels pretty satisfying, but the melee combat is pretty bland.  It lacks the depth of a good roguelike, and there are certain things that keep it from having the flow they were looking for.  The crafting system seems big and complicated, but honestly I don't care enough about it to really want to use it.\n\nThe story mode is pretty boring and honestly not that great from what I've seen so far.  Endless mode is a bit more fun.. but for that, I feel like I have a dozen games that do this type of thing 10x better.\n\nControls/UI:\nIt feels like it was made for consoles/tablets first, and haphazardly ported to PC.\n\nYou can't rebind the controls, and if you want to use a controller, you have to go edit filenames to make sure the included controller preset file for your type of controller is named _controls.csv... and you better hope they included a preset for your controller, since there are only like 4 availible.  I'm not kidding.  This is VERY LAZY on the developer's part, and I imagine some users who aren't so great with computers will struggle with this.  In-game menu, please!  Is that so much to ask?\n\nThe keyboard controls are wiggity-whack.  Why can't "I" be inventory?  E for equipment?  Q or L for Questlog? S or K for skills?  You know, like most roguelike/lite games?  You can move with QWEASDZC, the numpad, the mouse, or the left-stick on the controller.  Facing different directions is easy enough on controller, since you just use the right-stick, but to turn with the keyboard you have to hold space and press a direction.  It's very clunky.  I hear an update is coming soon that will allow users to rebind controls... via (you guessed it!) an INI file.  ugh.  Again...  IN. GAME. MENU. PLEASE.\n\nThe controls are much more bearable with my 360 controller during actual gameplay, but are slow and annoying to use in the inventory menus.\n\nThe UI is full of big buttons, and menus that pop out of the sides of the screen.  It looks like a tablet game.\n\nYou have 3 levels of zoom. "way too close" "okay, but I'd like to zoom out maybe just a little" and "way too far away"\n\nSound:\nThe sounds and music are pretty good.  Not great, not bad.. just alright.\n\nGraphics:\nKinda pretty.. pre-rendered 3D-esque sprites.. nice shaders and effects.  It looks pretty nice, though sometimes walls and other objects on the terrain just get in the way of me seeing what I'm doing.  The graphics are one of this game's strongest aspects.. but sometimes the big sprites and terrain objects are just too much.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion... Wait and see if the devs get their act together on the controls... and maybe see if it goes on sale or something.  At this time, I wouldn't recommend it.  Certainly not at full price.","November 3, 2015","false","3.4"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","0"

Because of this, the game feels rushed.\n\nThe UI and controls are somewhat confusing for me at first but I quickly got accustomed to it and I currently play mainly in keyboard.\n\nFor a rougelike game, it is missing monster encyclopedias. The guide in-game is not detailed enough.\nThe quests are somewhat a chore. I only played for 3 hours but when the game fails to hook me on their story, there is definitely something wrong on the pacing on the quests.\n\nThe graphics and artwork style is really nice, but you're going to need to get accustomed on the map to notice the nuances of where are the traps are activated and if there are objects blocking your path and etc. There is no rotate so you definitely need to somewhat focus on the map. It is turn based so there's no need to rush.\n\nAI is not good, I would rather have all my companions on manual mode than relying on AIs, especially if I wanted to play on permadeath mode\n\nThe combat log is plain, it's just white, not even colored to differentiate ally, enemy names, damage values and status ailments received/inflicted\n\nFinally, no steam cloud save support atm.

In the end, I got a refund due to the the underwhelming experience the few minutes I played this game gave me.

I'm not going to complain about the common issues. Since everyone else has complained about stuff like the UI and clunkyness and everything, there's no point in doing so. DFS feels like it doesn't know if it wants to be an RPG or a Rogue-like. You save your game in town (and there's a bit of an auto-save feature when you leave town), you level up and get stats and allows you to use items of your level, and you generally do RPG-esk stuff. Then you go and do a quest, which is where the roguelike stuff comes into play. Standard turn-based, map stuff. You do stuff, then the monsters do stuff, whatever. It doesn't seem that terrible on the surface, but it's how these two elements mix together.\n\nThere's a backstab system, but for a good portion of the monsters, it's hard to determine where the back is (you just have to assume, sometimes). The inability to equip any weapon or time you come across can really mess with you, especially if the item in question would help you not die. Exploring the entire map seems to be a mistake (much like a rogue-like), but if you don't, you'll be underleveled and under-equipped for the next quest (and I haven't found a good way to grind yet). If you die, you are reverted back to your last save, losing everything you had gotten that far (no progress after death, which is very unlike a rogue-like) and you can spend upwards to 20 minutes on these boards, only to screw yourself, die, and then lose everything.\n\nI'd like to give this game more time to develope, see if after a few patches some of the issues with it are addressed, but right now I can't recomend the DFS because, currently, it just isn't fun.","November 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

Sorry Grimm Bros.)\n\nFirst off, I want to explain why I did ask for a refund.\nThe bugs, oh the bugs. I've had to delete my game 4 times over that course of time because of my Story Quest not triggering, or because the dungeon I just finished killing EVERYTHING in, had no Exit Portal. Even saving, going to Title Menu and entering again did not show and Exit Portal which is VERY frustrating.\n\nThe Combat, while different and innovative it feel so urgent. In cases of multiple enemies on the screen you constant feel that "Oh s%!#, Oh s%!#, Oh s%!#" motion because they actually know how to double back and attack you in the back causing critical hits and getting you killed.\nBecause, you will die alot, because it's nearly impossible to get healing beverages early in the game.\n\nSo I just bashed the game to the ground, what did I like though ?\nThe graphics are pretty great, the sound assets are okay but annoying after just a single hour due to repetition. The music is so short and it's on a loop, after that 1 hour I just muted the game because the looped music was just annoying to me.\nI just keep going don't I ?\n\nWell, my best tip is - Do the research before purchasing Dragon Fin Soup. Watch some reviews on YouTube or your preferred source, get some gameplay videos in as well, I don't think you can get too many spoilers, the maps are randomly generated so every save file is going to be different, however it can be seeded just like The Binding of Isaac.\nAnd if you do purchase it, you can still ask for a refund if it wasn't worth it for you.\n\nWill I come back if the game gets updates ?\nMaybe, it depends. I'm the kind of person that doesn't come back to anything if I get dissappointed by it, so I more than likely won't unless Grimm Bros. patch out the bugs.","January 3","false","3.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

I noticed I could click a food icon when interacting with a shovel.

If you want hardcore challenge like I did, stay away this game is rediculously unfair.

I am a huge fan of tactical games and rougelikes in general. I don't know what it is but don't let the pleasing art style deceive you.\n\nPros:\n-Great artstyle\n\nCons:\n-Combat is lack luster and generic from the start with very little strategy as far as rougelikes go.\n-Despite the wonderful art the music is soooooo compressed and terrible it is hard to listen to for more than 5 minutes.\n-Terrible controls\n-Inventory is a travesty\n-No way to access game options while playing, you have to save and quit to change the options.\n","November 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

Has great art and graphics, lackluster story and characters, and the gameplay is confusing. There's no real options in the game, the menu system is odd, and having what you want happen in the game isn't always an easy thing. It's hard to see anything as there is little transparentcy when you are behind something. Clicking something doesn't always result in you going or attacking what you clicked on.\n\nAs a kickstarter I had high hopes, and was disappointed. If someone had no experience or knowledge of it, I think the gameplay would be a huge turnoff right away. I'll likely try to get through some more of the game and hope it improves, but I wouldn't recommend it as it is.","November 9, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","0"

Too many wonky design choices for me to want to dig deeper.  The voice-over at the start...sounds like poop.  Why even have it there?  The filters obscuring the screen half the time, the messed-up controls.  The animations are disappointing.  The actual assets are nice, but everything is implemented in a way that makes the whole package look sub-par when compared to similar games (bizarre "fog" overuse, jerky animations, etc.).\n\n","November 10, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","9","0","0"

Slight bias since I backed it, but I am not in the least disappointed with this game. It was everything I expected and more.\n\nInstantly, the OST and beautifully twisted and unique artwork draws you in. In game, the zoom made it wonderful for somebody with severe visual disabilities like myself. You start playing as Robin, Red Riding Hood all grown up... and pi$$ed... in both senses of the word. Drinking vast amounts of alcohol heals our heroine, with the looming horror of her becoming uncontrollably drunk and comedically psychotic.\nI cannot rave enough about this. It's what an RPG should be. Beautifully crafted, diffecult, tactical, inventive and thoroughly extensive. Get it. Guarenteed instant addiction and the next ♥♥♥♥ knows how long of your life taken. The 5 person Dev team has done an excellent job (and unlike a lot of politically driven ideologues who like to infect the indie game market with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, these guys actually came through with the kickstarter.) DFS is a title I hope will not only mean a great future for GrimmBros dev team, but revive good RPGs.\n5/5","November 3, 2015","true","124.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original one is at the end of the post. Of note is that anger affected me as I wrote the original one.\n\nThe developer took some time but eventually got around to replying to my emails and making sure I got my keys. They offered solutions and were open to keep helping if there were any troubles. While it bothers me to have backed the game and gotten my keys a week late, after those who bought it at release or got it for free with PS+, ♥♥♥♥ happens and it doesn't seem to me like these issues were a consequence of these guys being lazy and/or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They seem to be a pretty nice bunch of guys/gals from my interactions with them.\n\nAs for the game itself, they are indeed working on many of the issues. I've read some of the patch notes and it seems they're actually working on improving the PC version, unlike so many developers nowadays who throw out a turd and leave it as is.\n\nThe art is beautiful and the universe engaging, inspired by stories we all know and love but managing to differentiate itself in an interesting way.\n\nAs for how the gameplay has improved, I'm really busy so I haven't actually gotten around to testing it with the latest patches. I will however recommend it now for I'm convinced the game will eventually, if not already, be in a decent state.\n\nOriginal review: Backed on kickstarter and never actually got my keys. Didn't even get a reply from the mails I sent them when they were asking people wth the issue to contact them, so be wary of these guys. The UI is also ♥♥♥♥ for pc, doesn't work well with mouse and keyboard at all. It's easy to tell they completely focused on consoles and PC was just an afterthought.","November 10, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"
