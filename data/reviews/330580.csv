Not that "Depth" is bad, it's a good game.  But this...this is a truly nerve-wracking nightmare of marauding sharks.\n\nIt proceeds at much more realistic speeds than "Depth", and also looks better.  The feeling of actually diving is much more realistic as well.  The game is rock stable and highly immersive even in Early Access; from the rhythmic sound of your regulator as you breathe to the gorgeous underwater scenery, to the outstanding modeling and animation of the sharks.\n\nThere are plenty of maps, and a number of different game options including a single player mode.  Multiplayer is up and running.\n\nOne of the best bargains on Steam.  Highly recommended.   Grab it now because once people start discovering this title, the price will likely go up.  This is going to be very popular, and it desrves to be.\n\nLighthouse Games has truly produced an underwater masterpiece.","January 27","true","3.9"," 115 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","115","130","10","4"

The boat left, and I was down there in the blue. There was an old Russian sub, and it gave me the willies.\n\nAs I swam, I saw shapes in the darkness. Big ones. I start to panic.\n\nRocks. They were rocks.\n\nOne thing they don't teach you in training: it's quiet down there. You see, they train us all at once, so we get used to the noise.\n\nBut it's quiet. So quiet, you can hear your heartbeat. And your thoughts echo in your head. But you can't speak; you've got scuba gear on, and furthermore, if you speak, you know that THEY will hear you.\n\nThen I saw moving shapes. No, scratch that; I HEARD them way before I saw them. When everything is still, the tinest movement is audible.\n\nThey were indistinct, far away. I didn't dare move; I just watched.\n\nManta Rays. Two kind old Mantas, out for a swim. I relaxed.\n\nAnd then I felt something pass me.\n\nIt was monstrous. Its skin was black and scarred with harpoon-marks and shark-tooth scars. Its shadow blocked out the distant, indistinct, iridescent sun.\n\nA shark.\n\nI raised my harpoon gun confidently, despite my terror; this thing was HUGE, but that meant it was a big target.\n\nI dodged it, effortlessly; it was big, lethargic, and not-too-aggressive. I killed it.\n\nSomething darted between my legs. I could feel my heartbeat begin to race; like an infernal pump in my ears. Thump thump, thump thump, thump thump.\n\nIt bit me. I blinked and reeled from the pain, spinning to see what had attacked me.\n\nIt was a Mako.\n\nAnd it wasn't alone.\n\nI began to swim up. That's when I learned it.\n\nI'm afraid of heights. I'm afraid of submarines. I'm afraid of big, indistinct shapes in the distance of that savage, silent deep.\n\nAnd I'm afraid of sharks.\n\nI neared the surface and saw the magnitude of my predicament; Six Makos and a Tiger shark had followed me, circling gleefully. They could taste my blood.\n\nI screamed. I begged the sky for help.\n\nBut the sky has no reach in the Deep. That's Death's dominion.","September 7, 2015","true","1.1"," 107 of 142 people (75%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","75","107","142","54","6"

The sharks actually behave like a predator in real life. They just lurk in the shadows waiting for the right moment to strike. Stopping the sharks from getting too close is only half the challenge, you also have to watch out for everyone else on the map because it's deathmatch which means every man for himself. And if that wasn't hard enough you have to watch your oxygen supply because when it gets low you have to go and find the oxygen supply and there's only one in the map.\n\nThe graphics are not the best and some of the sharks look a bit off but overall this is a good cheap game that just hasn't been realised yet I hope it gets popular eventually!","November 24, 2015","true","1.4"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","44","59","5","0"

NEVER compare this game to depth. They are both have completely different styles. This game is more slow paced than depth. Sharks don't go as fast as a bull with spice up its ♥♥♥ while pumped with steroids right after it snorted an assload of crack and divers don't go as fast as F1 racing cars filled with jet fuel with jet engines on them. You get new weapons by picking them up throughout the map. Sure there aren't many weapons, but that's because this game is in early access. VERY early access. This is one of those games that I actually think will get out of early access and not stay in early access for long ♥♥♥ periods of time like other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games. This game actually requires you to get oxygen that is scattered around the map so thats pretty neat. Since the game says "Deathmatch" in the title, that means the goal of the game is to kill the sharks while killing other divers as well so there are no teams really.\nThese devs are also adding this thing called Predator Mode which, as it sounds, lets you play as the Predator from Predator the movie the shark. You can play as a Great White Shark and command other sharks for now, but I assume that the devs will add more different sharks to Predator Mode. Only one person can be a shark at a time. (I think)\nSorry for the short review. All in all, this game has a whole lotta potential and I hope to see this game become successful. There might not be that many players, so bring along a couple of friends to play with you.The only bad part of the game is getting that one achievement where you will send a message to ALL of your friends and then getting almost all of them to chat with you saying how it sounds like a phising link or whatever. Devs, I suggest that you guys could make  it where you can send that message to whoever you like instead of everyone you know. Thats my only complaint. Please don't put in  microtransactions (boosters, premium currency, etc), but stuff like cosmetics is ok.

Also bear in mind that depth is not an early access title, but a complete and finished product.\n\nIn Shark Attack Death Match 2\nThe graphics are far better.\nThe game seems alot more realistic as in diver and shark speeds. But most importantly this game scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. The ai will act like sharks. Sometimes they will go straight past you others they will maul you when you least expect it. Where as depth is good fun, but did not scare me like this did.\nObjectives are simple, as the title says Deathmatch. There are another couple of game modes as well.\n\nHopefully someone will hold my hand so that i can actually play the game. Seriously creeped out about single player survival. Was laughing so hard when i quit the game.\nAs i literally just joined, a great white was right there in front of me. I killed it with the basic speargun. Then a tiger comes in for the scrap.

There's also co-op survival agains AI sharks already in the list and predator mode (player as shark) soon to come. I've faced the absence of my native screen resolution, though there are many variants in the menu. Main lacks are small content amount (game is still a work in progress) and few players online.

Though 'Stranded deep' and 'Depth' have tried to recreate the AI of sharks, this game by far gives the most realistic depiction of shark behaviour in a video game. The Great White (one of a number of shark species) will bump, bite or tear you to pieces. The beauty is the sharks have random attack patterns. Thus you could be swimming alongside one and it won't bother you until you aggravate it. However at other times the shark will straight out attack you. The attention to detail is impressive and the audio design really makes you feel as though you are about o be guzzled by a man-eater. There are currently 4 maps, which even include a submerged New York metropolis with prowling Great White sharks. If your interested in underwater games and wish to battle it out online with fellow divers or shark AI (players will be able to assume the identity of a shark soon) then this game is for you. As it stands in its Beta format I'd give this game a 9.2 as it brings a refreshing level of realism to animal AI and the combat is very well done. You will die a lot, but a global ranking system is in place to keep you coming back into the abyss where nature's apex predator awaits you.","May 28, 2015","true","36.5"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","26","35","0","0"

This is a multiplayer focused game and it's tumbleweeds everywhere, 100% barren, no-one is playing it, you can spend countless, fruitless minutes waiting for someone to join you in a game with no luck. And the single player portion is a joke and a bad one at that, as of right now it's just the survival mode which is just wave after wave of 2 or 3 not-so-smart sharks roaming around and that's it, really, nothing more than a badly disguised training mode. There are no bots, no other divers to shoot or compete with and no other modes, so it gets tiring and boring super fast. The few maps there are somewhat decent in the graphics department, especially the interesting Tsunami one featuring a flooded piece of Manhattan, but since the action is nowhere to be found you just explore them in a few mins and then you've seen everything there is to the game. The rest of the maps are pretty empty and small except for usually two big objects like say a sunken boat and a WWII bomber or some anti-ship mines floating around, not much to get excited about.\n\nIf you're looking for some underwater action, get Depth instead or wait for a full release of this game before trying it out, till then... don't even bother. The most worrying thing with this title is that the description in the Steam page says it's BETA when there's not much content to begin with, it is playable for the little it has and I didn't encounter any issues while I played like some have complained but gameplay wise, again, there's just almost nothing to enjoy and what little there is it'll have to be by yourself, not anyone's idea of fun.","September 20, 2015","false","1.2"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","37","57","2","0"

The graphics look pretty great. Beautiful environments and the sharks look great. That being said...there's really nothing to do. I've only located two weapons at this point to utilize. There's no map, or anyway to differentiate where you really are in the environment. You swim to far in a single direction and it directs you back to the action....But what action is there? It's difficult to locate your opponents and the sharks do nothing but swim about lazily even when you attack them. Overall it's pretty much a pointless game at this point.

Very rewarding to duel with someone while watching the Great White sneak up on them and then eat them...even if you don't get credit for the kill;\n\n- Survival - also fun.  Haven't played co-op yet because my friends are lame and haven't bought it yet (see the above-listed con, and it's parenthetical injunction), but the single player is both fun and sufficiently challenging that while it isn't a mainstay, it's worth trying every so often.\n\n- Predator Mode - HOLY FREAKING CRAP it's amazing.  One of you player the Great White and commands the other sharks.  Your goal is to eat as many divers as possible before being killed.  Whoever kills you becomes the Great White, and thus it cycles, except that while the divers are trying to kill the shark, they are also sniping and potshotting each other to make sure no one else gets the shark.\n\nGreat game, very enjoyable, only con is the server population, and you can help fix that by buying it.

First of all, the environments are beautiful and haunting! There's a real sense of urgency when the sharks are around you because the music is fabulous at enhancing the atmosphere! The gameplay itself has a slight learning curve as you're swimming as opposed to running around, but once you get the hang of it; it becomes very intuitive! The action is nonstop. My only beef is that sometimes the great white appears quite early and it's almost impossible to kill, BUT that is not a negative strike.

(Of course this is an Early Access title, but expect a lot of attention to be given to this great game.)\nBut. You can actually play as the Shark. Predator mode. This sounds great. 1 person be the shark. The rest hunt him or be hunted.\nEasily this price tag makes the game More than worth it.\nAfter quitting to go write this review, I did notice that you can even customize your character.

The maps are all very unique and interesting to explore. I personally like the one of an underwater New York City which even includes a statue of liberty. The graphics are good, better than Depth, there I said it.\nI personally find that the single player mode becomes boring very quickly therefore I think this game’s success will ultimately depend on the multiplayer mode (death match). The game currently has a very low player base meaning most of the time you will find no servers to join. You can create your own but on most occasions I have had nobody else join. I really hope that more people join this early access game as I cannot see myself returning to it if single player mode is my only option.\nOne small suggestion; I think they should add the option of being able to kill the other sea creatures.

Take an FPS, put it at the bottom of the ocean, fill the arena with viscious sharks, and this is what you get. It's a unique experience that I can't say I've really had anywhere else. Moving through 3D space adds a new level of depth to your actions. You don't have to worry about an enemy hiding behind cover on top of a building, you have to worry about an enemy floating over your head. While 3D movements might not be new in the space shooter genre, it is a unique addition to the FPS realm.\n\nCurrently the game consists of a deathmatch mode, and a solo-survival mode. In survival you have to battle it out for as long as you can against hordes of sharks. At the time of my writing this I have been informed that co-op survival will be out soon, and I can assure you that's going to be a new level of fun.\n\nLastly, if you're the type of person who likes to support cool indie devs, this is definitely something you want to get behind. Just look at the fourms; the devs are always interacting with, and taking feedback from, the community. I've even played a handful of games with the devs myself.\n\nP.S. If you'd like to try this game out before dropping money on it, I highly recommend grabbing the demo or paying $1 for the first game on your 360. It will give you a good feel for how this game plays.","June 4, 2015","true","12.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Add other players, either to help you or to fight against and it becomes even more fun.\n\nEven though this game is still in early access gameplay feels very polished and realistic. Environments, player models and sharks look fantastic while the effect of blood in the water looks even better.\n\nShark Attack DM 2 can be more terrifying than many horror games. The sudden start of the music telling you a shark is near and not seeing it, turning around to look in it's opened jaws;  needing to refill air while there are sharks all around and not having the time to deal with them nor the option to swim fast as that will certainly make you run out of air; chasing a Great White and suddenly hearing Bullsharks snap at your feet, loosing sight of a shark in the shadows because of the blood filling the water... There are many moments like these that will make your heart beat faster while you start to panic...\n\nIt all adds up to create a very immersive game so I highly recommend buying it!","August 30, 2015","true","11.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Talking a while ago since then, but I do recall seeing something that I thought had some potential.\n\nNow I play the new game here on Steam and that still holds true.\n\nThe scenery is, quite frankly, beautiful.  Even if you set the graphics to the lowest they can go, its still really really good and pretty to look at.  Environments to are also pretty good and, I would dare say, fitting to underwater combat.  The controls are nice and solid as well, so thats a good thing.\n\nOf course...the sharks.  They look so damn good!! especially when you get up close to them....and you will whether you want to/like to or not.  A really neat little feature that I adore is the battle damage suffered by the sharks when you attack them.  Ranging from blood trails to seeing actual scars and chunks taken out of them from where you hit them.\n\nOf course, being Early Access, you don't get a whole lot to play with in game, though thats going to be updated soon.  Also, yes theres bugs and fixes coming as is true with this sort of release.  Its expected, but it doesnt put off gameplay.\n\nSo far so good though, I got no complaints and I'm really looking forward to the extra goodness that will be added to this over the coming weeks/months/however long.

How about dying from lack of oxygen on a semi-regular basis (in spite of the fact that the ocean is apparently teeming with many a full, diverless air-tank)?  And most importantly of all, do you enjoy the frustration of wasting tonnes of harpoon gun ammo TRYING to shoot sharks at close range and completely failing?  If you answered "yes" to at least two of the above, Shark Attack Deathmatch 2 may be just the game you've been waiting for.\n\nI am, of course, just being a bitter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so in acknowledgement of the fact that there's maybe a few people out there talented enough to actually stay alive longer than five to ten minutes in this hard-as-all-♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥er of a game, I'll mention some of its good features.  The graphics are awesome, the maps are genuinely interesting - hell, even occasionally inspired (sunken New York, anyone?) - and the sound is awesome, too.  On the whole, the atmosphere is absolutely fantastic and the underwater worlds perfectly immersive.  The problem?  Well, maybe there isn't one.  Or more to the point, maybe the problem is ME.\n\nRival game Depth at least attempted to be SLIGHTLY more than a "deathmatch", but true enough to its title, that's literally all this one seems to be...well, that and a "survival mode", which as we all know is just gamer lingo for "single-player deathmatch".  Man, I so badly want someone to make one of these first-person, scary shark games with a STORY.  If you make a game like that, and make it as GOOD as this and Depth admittedly manage to be, I WILL MARRY YOU AND HAVE YOUR BABIES.  Even if you're a dude.  Hell, I'll even be the woman, if such a compromise has to be made.  What the ♥♥♥♥ is with the uber-popularity of all these multiplayer games, anyway?  Don't any of you people like YOURSELVES?  Or do you just not have any REAL-WORLD FRIENDS?  WHY CAN'T SOMEONE MAKE A TOTALLY ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME SINGLE-PLAYER SHARK GAME?!  I love games.  I love sharks (well, okay, only in a they-totally-scare-the-bejesus-out-of-me way, but you know what I mean).  I WANT A SCARY, TENSE SHARK GAME WHICH ISN'T A DEATHMATCH.\n\nOh, and before all you clever ♥♥♥♥♥ start asking me why I bought a game with "deathmatch" in the title just to write a review complaining that the game IS a deathmatch, for the record, a friend gifted me this.  And even after the semi-disappointment of Depth, I was still excited to start 'er up.  But upon finding that this was considerably HARDER than Depth, and attempting to consolidate this with the equally indisputable fact that I'm basically pretty ♥♥♥♥ at video games, I have to say that I'm going to declare Depth my favourite of the two games.  If for no reason other than the fact that I actually managed to KILL some sharks in that one.  Which is a pretty cool thing to be able to do in a shark-killing game, right?  And yeah yeah yeah, I know that's just a cue for all you smart ♥♥♥♥ers to point out that if I only exercised a little patience, or failing that simply (and not to mention magically) "get gud" at the game, I might achieve my holy grail and actually KILL A ♥♥♥♥ING SHARK.  But you know what?  Right now I really couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed.  And I'm on mutha♥♥♥♥in' HOLIDAYS at the moment, ya'll, so if that ain't sayin' somethin'...\n\nIn conclusion, definitely recommended to anyone who fancies themselves any good at these kinds of games, or indeed to anyone who just fancies a quick, immersive dive into a truly believable underwater kingdom before being unceremoniously "murdered by a shark" (the game's words, not mine).  With little doubt, the best shark-feeding simulator liable to be released on Steam this year.  Oh, and PS...good luck finding a multiplayer game to actually JOIN.  I think I managed to MAKE such a game, but alas, I was the only thing remotely resembling a HUMAN BEING in it.  But I guess it is only in Early Access, so with a little luck we'll see that particular comment of mine become null-and-void in the near future.  I have a suspicion I will revisit these waters, sooner or later, but for now the ♥♥♥♥ing sharks can just go hungry.  FINNED, FISHY ♥♥♥♥ERS.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","June 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","5","8","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lumpo/recommended/330580/","Lumpo","{SSQRL} Lumpo!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lumpo/","425 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFun game with a ton of promise. Pretty much the only downside to this game currently is a lack of a solid player base. If you enjoy Depth, you'll definitely enjoy this game. Currently only has 2 game modes, TDM and a coop Survival Mode, and more modes are planned.\n\nPros:Sharks\nThe sharks are well coded and add a lot of tension to the traditional TDM fare. Always fun when the music spikes in letting you know a shark is hunting you, as you start frantically scanning the murky blue for the predator. Sharks don't always attack you, they're always there, but not necessarily always an enemy.\n\nProjectiles are incredibly satisfying\nConsidering you're shooting spears through water, you need to lead your targets a lot. This makes one on one fights sort of like a dance, as you both try and hit and out maneuver each other. This leads to there seldom being what could be described as a "cheap kill." Kills are earned, and are always satisfying when you nail a partifularly tough shot on an oppenent. Players looking for a shooter that requires some skill to excell will not be dissapointed here.\n\nGraphics are superb\nNot much to elaborate on. While an early access game in content, it definitely doesn't look like one. Levels are detailed, models are nice, and the lighting is great. If you find yourself wishing Depth did a better job capturing the look and feel of being underwater, you should be happy here.\n\nFantastic Developer Support\nThis is a big one. This game is being developed by 2 people who are very passionate about this game. They are always looking for player feedback and will respond to any questions or suggestions you have. If you're having trouble finding someone to play with, just ask JonesJonesie one of the developers and he'll gladly play some rounds with you. My interactions with the developers of this game foster a lot of faith in that they will do whatever it takes to make this a good game that people enjoy. It's clear they will continue to support this game well into the future, this is their baby.\nCons:Lack of player base\nDespite how much good there is in this little game, this is presently a pretty huge con. I tend to pop in whenever I sit down on my computer and seldom is there a game currently going (which is why my play time is low, just not for lack of trying), and I've yet to be able to play a round with a full room. Hopefully, this won't be a problem in the long run, as it is a fun game when you can get a few people together and have at it underwater.\n\nWeapon Variety/Customization\nIf the ability to tune and customize your characters gear to your liking is going to make or break a game for you then this might not be the best time to jump into this game. More gear and weapons are planned, but at present there are only 2 guns (which are well done and satisfying in their own right). It does make the game fun in that it's a level playing field, but it does lead something to be desired in the way of variety. This will likely be remedied as development continues.For the price, this is a great little game that deserves a much larger player base. Hopefully this game catches on and the community can thrive as it deserves.","August 22, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In my opinion if you like games where you enjoy seeing how long you can last against endless waves of enemies. This game maybe for you.

For an Early Access it game it runs quite smoothly. It is basically an underwater FPS with sharks that roam around and kill you!\n\nAt the moment there is a survival game mode and Deathmatch on the multiplayer mode. More modes will be unlocked later on such as Team Deathmatch,Capture the flag and Be the Shark mode.\n\nWeapons at the moment only include two. A one shot harpoon and a automatic harpoon. Yet again more weapons will be introduced at a later date.\n\nThe best part for me is the tense battles you have with your opponents. Both of you firing your harpoons, flying past each other both praying that your spear will hit and kill them! Then all of a sudden a shark may come out of knowhere and tear you to shreds! Amazing.\n\nWhat I would like to see is some music in the game. It seems really quiet so maybe some epic music would be welcomed!!\n\nSo as it stands I would recommend you buy this game. It has great potential to be a really good game and I'm sure with feedback from the community it will only get better.\n\nHere is a video of me playing a whole online Deathmatch game (and sucking really bad haha)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HK8rNPblRzc\n\n","May 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Other creatures look nice and the shark physics are excellent! Enjoyed so far in survival mode but needs more players for multiplayer as not had a game available yet. Be good to see this one progress. Like the oxygen idea makes it more intense. Be good to see blood linger in th ewater a while longer like a cloud and have other sharks attrack to it - possibly have a blood cartridge pickup to distract sharks etc? Lots of ideas for this game. Nice to suport indi devs too. I'm new in the indie app industry and my debut app just came out on apple/android called: blast off bob. Check it out if you're into indie space/astronaut games.

I already play a game similar in effort to this, called "Depth" which I'm sure many people here know exists, and this game is markedly different as of right now but not in a bad way.\n\nIt's cheap, for one. $2.50 for a game that's still in development is a steal. It's Early Access, so you get to play this game as it evolves into what the developer envisions. The developer regularly interacts and posts replies to community hub posts in regard to the game and questions about it all the time. Go to the community hub and look for yourself... that's pretty nice if you ask me. It shows that the developer is both open to feedback and also probably enjoys helping others enjoy what I'm sure will shape up to be a good game.\n\nDepth is largely finished by now, with the developers just adding more content and DLC here and there like tie-ins and new maps. This game, though, is not. Don't expect it to be. It's very basic and rudimentary at this point - it's humans, who move slowly in these underwater conditions, surviving against waves of sharks rolling in from the outer reaches of the map. It's not exactly a "jumpy" game but it doesn't need to be right now.\n\nI hope this game turns out really well. I don't regret buying it, especially for what I paid, I don't mind supporting developers' efforts to make the game they wanna make, all I ask in return for purchasing is that they finish the game and they make it something cool. This has the potential to be something cool. They've already brought in a co-op survival mode and will be adding an adversary mode soon that lets you control the shark(s) on the map.\n\nIt isn't as gorgeous as the new Star Wars game, and it isn't boring like stupid little "retro" 8-bit indie games, but it's a niche game. It's a deathmatch game with SHARKS vs HUMANS. It likely won't get millions of players as a player base in the future but I don't care if it does or doesn't, I only care about whether the game keeps getting better or not and so far it seems like it'll continue to grow and become something of its own.\n\nPick it up if you can get it for a cheap price like I did, cause I know some people avoid Early Access games out of fear or distrust.\n\nMaybe my review will help someone, maybe it won't. I like the game either way, and I wish it luck cause there really aren't enough DIFFERENT types of shooters out there. The world doesn't need another ♥♥♥♥ing military sim shoot 'em up like Call of Duty anymore.","December 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

Originally I had had my eye on Depth. However, this went on sale and after skimming through the clips presented, I noted that SAD2 seemed to have a lot more detailing in its surroundings life plant life and fish. So I gave it a shot. This game really is beautiful and the sharks? OH MY GOD. Freak me out every time. Even when I find a little hide away where they've only got one opening to get in by, a few of them always manage to rush me. I see them coming, I know it's inevitable, but it still makes me screech and freak out when they do!\n\nThe only thing I could ask for is a no shark mode. Or maybe even a find the shark mode? Like there's one big, elusive shark and you're supposed to spend your time gathering ammo and oxygen and try to find the thing and then kill it before it kills you once engage? I don't know. I figure it's a stupid thing to ask for a no sharks or docile sharks mode in a game literally callled SHARK ATTACK, but the scenery in the mutliple layouts options this game has is so beautiful and I love the wild life, it would be so awesome to just be able to relax and explore it.\n\nEither way, highly recommended, can't wait to see what any additions might have in store, but awesome game as is.","October 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMNANTS/recommended/330580/","IAMNANTS","Tbiaecnh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMNANTS/","24 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEpic Game. Awesome graphics, lighting, and I cannot wait for predator. I prefer Depth over this, I can land a few decent kills, but comparison from my progress from playing as a diver in Depth, I can rack up 11 kills. Sharks have awesome graphics in both games, slightly tilting more onto this game when it comes to mako or tiger shark. If you want controlled killing and gameplay, intense gore, harsh violence, and dark, scary places that sharks tear you apart? Go for Depth. A sad part about Depth is you can't go to far without getting torn apart from sharks, and you cannot kill other divers, Depth is for team players or friends who want to beat each other. If you want free roaming without getting torn apart, savage, gritty, and brutal combat,  lesser gore, and violence, go for Shark Attack Deathmatch II. The bad part about Shark Attack Deathmatch II, is that you have to worry about getting mauled by your friends, and also air. Shark Attack Deathmath II is definitly a better choice for those who prefer free roam killing, savage combat, and FPS over intense graphic blood, gore, violence, and horror FPS. Vice versa for those who prefer intense graphic blood, gore, violence, and horror FPS. Now an organized chart will show more.\nDepth:\nCONS:\nLittle roaming capabilites; Move 5 steps out of the room and a great white will rip you to bits\nHorrifyingly horrifying in some parts, such as when you light a flare just to see a shark lunging straight for your face, or when you hear a horrifying scream coming from your left, you turn and see a shark lunging and you. Note that this exact same thing also appears in PROs for people who like horror\nIntensely gorey (Bad for some people, but this might also appear in PROs)\nSignificantly more fun to play as a shark\nChallenging to learn, incredibly hard to master\nPROs:\nIntense TOGGLABLE blood and gore\nSavage Combat (not as save as this though)\nW.I.P Review\n\nEDIT: I am growing to like this game more, so I will edit my review.\n\nIn the end, Depth wins. This game is a 8.77664/10, close enough to 9/10. Kudos to the devs who made this wonderful, epic game.\nBut, since Shark Attack Deathmatch II is still in early access, who knows, maybe one day it will top Depth.","September 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Why? How many people get contacted by real game developers huh? Well I got contacted by this game developer, had a nice discussion, shared ideas of what can be done to promote the game and what contents could be added. I realized these guys have not abbandoned this game and they still working on it. This game has potential and it looks really promising, so now these people need to reclaim back their playerbase. I even got 4 damn game keys from a game developer (lol) ! And yeah I shared the keys on forums and I hope player community will grow. If the devs havent abandoned this game, then players shouldnt abandon either. Keep up the good work and we're waiting for future updates ! :)\n\n\nThe game has nice graphics, nice maps and it creates a great atmosphere with the feeling that there are sharks circling somewhere around you and may attack you out of nowhere. However the game lacks contents like more weapons, or some kind of skill system, or level system that would give you some stats benefit, it lacks more shark types, maybe bigger explorable maps at least for singleplayer. This game is great for killing time if you have nothing else to do for couple hours but thats about it. You gonna become bored pretty fast with it, and the most imporant thing that should be mentioned is that the multiplayer game is DEAD. Forums are dead, there have been like 400 reviews over almost 9 months. You join an empty game and you get that feeling as if this product has been abandoned not only by players but also by the developers. I'll be glad to change my review into positive if something changes in the future, but for now I don't recommend this game to anyone, unless it's on sale. Basically you'll just buy a singleplayer game with nothing else to do just sit in a corner, shoot sharks with 2 harpoons and wait for time to pass.","March 15","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

After playing for a few minutes, I can already tell there isn't much point of revisiting this one. Fairly one sided gameplay with the scales being tipped in favor of the predators far too much.\nAs for realism this game has beautiful graphics (while you can look around before dying at the hands of or should I say 'teeth' of some player controled terminator with fins.)\nSharks of different species unrealistically pack together. Such as blacktip and great whites. With how much damage it takes to kill one shark you start wondering if they found a sunken ship that had both Quad Damage, and the Invulnerability sphere.\nThe lack of an effective startup weapon only leaves me to believe that every diver in the game is psychotic. Better to have made a game about hunting lions with a olive fork.\nBefore you say "You can get other weapons" yes, there are other weapons you can pick up, but, only if you can get to them before losing an appendage to serrated teeth or the air in your supply ("'tank'? Might as well be a inflated trash bag with a straw.) running out in three to four minutes.\nNo spectator mode so you can't get a sense of how to play before offering yourself up as chum. Single player has no real goal except to survive as long as possible before dying either from lack of air or being "Murdered by a shark, although it's not really "murder". Maybe you'll actually get to kill a great white before running so low on ammo you can't kill a sea slug with whats left.\nOverall this game looks great but needs ALOT of work. I wouldn't suggest buying it unless it's on sale or that they patch it to even out the game play.\nOf course this is just my opinion. Yu may buy it anyway and think it's great, but it's your risk.","January 24","false","0.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Jonesjones or something?\n\nAnyways, back on topic.\n\nI'll give this game a moderate score. Nothing negative I wouldn't expect, you know? Nothing ground-breaking, and not fully developed like Depth, but it's a start.\n\nFirst topic, first impression.\nI started out with a random lobby, because I didn't mind where it began. Within seconds, I was in a lobby. Brownie point.\nSo I see the sharks, minding their own business. It was a Great White, actually. To be honest... It was intimidating, yes, but not spooky like snorkelling chills I usually get when I'm next to a trash can of teeth and death. It just lumbered around aimlessly, even when I shot it. It was like punching one of those aluminum baloons in wal-mart; it's attack was so slow that there was absolutely no way it could deal damage. I knifed it to death with jonesjones watching lol.\nThen I see that someone died, and checked out the game size. It was just the two of us, plus jones. Jones basically just popping around here and there like anyone would do in their own made world. I felt a ping of envy there.\n"Deathmatch" seemed so unfair due to the fact there's a gattling gun box sitting in the open that can be defended easily by a guy with a gattling gun. I felt bad for the other player, so I just stopped the massacre and declared a truce. He obliged, then we just jammed out to "Ocean Man" while pretending we were riding the ♥♥♥♥ing great white.\nI mentioned it to jones that the AI needed improvement, and reccommended he play "Stranded Deep" to get that creepy vibe that game gave you when you were being stalked. He said he'd check it out.  I also mentioned that there isn't a "turn your head, then your spear follows you" type thing you would be more likely to do, but I'm sure they may implement that later?  Also, a panicked reloading animation would be nice.  I just imagine the diver swinging his head around to view the environment before even having the gun near ready to shoot, then take like 3 seconds to actually prep a decent shot.\nHe left immediately after, so I left as well. I checked out all the lobbies, and it turned out that the other guy and I were the only players on. Nobody is playing this game? That sucks. Reviews seem decent.\nSo I decided to take his advice and play "Survival."\nThis is where I could see the negative sides of the AI, big time.\nFirst one I noticed were no indications of where things were. I panicked trying to find the ammo box.\nSecondly, the sharks don't have a sense of tactics. They just lumber in circles around you until they hope to catch you by surprise, which includes basically swimming slowly and biting too soon, which causes you to just Disney bounce off of their nose. I may have played with that for a few minutes.\nThirdly. Makos are pretty much the only thing that make me check my surroundings, since they just charge you head on.\nFourth, the sharks don't follow you that easily. For a guy wearing flippers, you are RIDICULOUSLY fast, faster than anything in the game I've crossed. I mean, I've fed makos, and those f*ckers can disappear with your arm before you know what time it is.\n\nMy over-all score for a new game...\n......\n.....\n\n.....\n..\n....\n7.5/10\n\nArt is nice, could use some work, AI is sloppy but can be fixed, and for a 2-man dev group, I'm impressed. I'll keep this one on my list to keep an eye on.\nUntil then, I'm going to go back to SD for a bit and see how well I do against the land-shark glitches.","February 3","true","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I don't understand how people get so scared. I personally am irrationally afraid of sharks to the point that when I go to the beach, I can't get myself to go more than knee deep. Hell even in some video games I avoid water for fear of included sharks. With that being said, I was surprised when I first saw the shark but after that it was pretty chill. Little sharks and music give away the fact that the big one is nearby. It's a neat game, ill play some more and probably have to update my review. I dont even have an hour played, but I did recently play a match as a shark and went 10/0 pretty easy.","February 12","false","1.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I've always wanted a game like this, its not trying to be Evolve with a shark or L4D2 with sharks. Its about OP great whites and divers, it makes the sharks strong enough to make you afraid but not so strong that its impossible to 1v1 them (I do it all the time, 1v1 predator mode).\n\nOverall:\nI cannot reccomend this game enough if you want a shark vs human game to play with your friends. And for those of us who miss Shattered Horizon, this is also a 3D FPS albiet underwater instead of in space. The sky is the limit for this game, and these devs are very active in the community. 1v1 predator mode is my favorite way to play this.\n\nRegarding lag:\nI play with friends from China, no lag, and I live in the US, no lag.\n\nRegarding graphics:\nSurprisingly good, the shark animation and overall meshes are very good. Diver customization exists, although its only colors at the moment.\n\nI'd compare this game to Guns of Icarus in terms of value, IE, very very good value for the price.","February 17","true","1.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You can of course going around killing sharks for points to try to avoid PvP, but maps are kinda small, so good luck with that.   2 servers are usually up, and you'll probably find a game almost full (8 max).  Imagine being in a home aquarium with up to 8 players and the goal is to swim around shooting each other for 20 minutes.  That replay factor is up to you.\n\nStarting gear:\nYou get a knife and a 1 shot spear gun.  You can find another one, which is basically an ammo refill, or a gun that will shoot some a little faster.  There is also a health to pick up, and oxygen that needs replenishing.\n\nAt this state, I would not recommend.

Bad choice. I can not manage the main menu of game, nothing works. When I choose any line, cursor must be above to get right line I need. Then after I got in line I wanted , button "back" does not respond and I have to press Alt +Esc and force the game shut down. OMG. I can not make any changes in player´s setup, not any other options in parts of menu either. I reported to developer and got response ( fast, that is good ! ) to try in windowed mode. That mode works and developer promised to fix.\nI started game. Well, deathmatch. With only 2-3 players in-game? People, have a common sense, OMG ! I joined to 1 available game, 1 player killed other in 2 minutes and "game over"  . You can not start private game or any game in multiplayer cause minimum 2 players needs. If you do not have anyone to play coop, you screwed. Then I tried "quick game", could play some more time: Killed by shark (-10 points), Killed by shark (-10 points), Killed by shark (-10 points)....  Then other player joined, greeted me and while I was trying to save him from shark attacking him from behind and replying to his question on chat, he killed me. Awesome! New way (or maybe not, I never did it ) to kill players : "talk to them on chat while 2-3 sharks around gonna eat them and kill" (helping hand for sharks). Then proper killer was killed by shark and we returned to lobby. I had to leave...  I do not see any sense of PvP in this game. What a sense to play 1 minute, only 1 bad weapon, useless knife, 2 flash granades, sharks are impossible to kill, only I could kill 4 sharks in  about 1 hour of gameplay?! And this  -10 points for die? Then I tried single player survival, 1 map only, I was not able to kill  even 1 shark. Sharks move too fast, weapon does not make damage in most intents, then they come in group 2-3-4 or you do not see any other close but you killed instantly. I got frustrated and left. No idea, how some on youtube could kill more than 3 sharks in short time. So ...I would not recommend this game.\n","June 2, 2015","false","2.3"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","23","7","31","4","5"

Shoot other divers while hunting and avoiding sharks. While not a huge budget game, aside from a few archaic aspects, the look and design is pretty solid. I can't imagine its a game many people would play often, but its a nice game to add to the collection.\n\nSee my video of this game HERE.","August 4, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It needs more players, and more gear/weapons,\nBut for 6 € u cant make anything wrong, the athmosphare is already great and the sharks look awesome, the white shark looks even better then in depth.

I like the fact it is diver on diver with an added varity of sharks, some being harder then others for example bullshark doesn't take too long to kill then the great white which is built like a brick wall using pretty much all my current ammo to kill.

I've played both mp and survival, both are a really good time. The graphics and the sound are leaps and bounds better than anything you would expect from an EA title in the 1st week. The sharks are a good threat and distraction during mp and in survival it gets insane. Once all the other game modes are released this will set the standard in underwater fps games. So, if you like fps's, sharks, deep dark murky water, feeling the panic as your taking your last breathe, even more so the panic of the great white coming to eat you and awesome music to chill your bones.?.!..?. then at $7.59 is the asking price right now, and I'd pay 2x's easy for this game!
