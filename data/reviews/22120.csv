It's better than Amnesia. Now before you get to the hate let me just say that I adore Amnesia. It introduced me, as it did so many others, to Frictional Games' work. But once I finished it up I wanted more. I was lucky enough to see this package come up during one of Steam's classic Halloween sales and decided to snag it. For some reason or another, I started Black Plague first, and I couldn't have made a better choice.\n\nThis game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notes. But this one does what I hope Soma (Frictional Games' next title) will do again - make a great story.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investment.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","December 12, 2013","true","5.9"," 59 of 59 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","59","59","0","0"

You still play as Philip, in his search for his father and the truth behind the mysterious events in the Greenland mine.\nWhile the game preserves most of the features from the first episode - like exploration, puzzle solving and stealth - the combat system has been completely removed. Personally, I think that the lack of ability to fight back makes the game a lot more tense, especially because of the very creepy enemy design.\nHowever, enemy variety is still quite poor, but for one there is a lot less of them than in the first episode, and I've never felt that enemies were there just for the sake of it.\n\nThe plot really develops in this episode, it's well written and interesting. There is a lot more interaction with characters, and some of them may even "grow" on you (pun intended), and the whole setting is much more twisted than it was in its predecessor.\nVoice acting and dialogues are also much better, while sound assets, musical score and graphical capabilities remain pretty much on par with Overture. There is also a lot more variety in level design and in the overall environments. While it's not that important, it's worth mentioning that the AI is still fairly simple, and that it's not particularly difficult to lose pursuing enemies.\n\nIn general, it's a great sequel, especially in it's story. While it's scarier than Overture, it doesn't rely on jump scares, but on it's fantastic atmosphere. Definitely play it if you like horror games, but make sure to play Overture first for the complete experience.\n\nClick here to read my Penumbra: Overture review\n\nMore reviews on my Tumblr page.[megaskylight.tumblr.com]","April 25, 2014","true","4.7"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","1"

Thick atmosphere, creepy experience. Good and clever puzzles without being too hard, but more challenging than in Amnesia. You can tell some good thought went into the puzzle design. The unkillable enemies arent as annoying as I expected, you can handle them with a bit effort or run from then in most cases. Story is also intriguing, finally you can make something out of it, more clear than  in the first part.\nFurthermore, really appreciate the way the story is told: Reading notes, checking logs etc. Very fitting for a game like that.\n\nGraphics arent too hot, especially for today standards, but you cant really say it aged bad. Enemy animations look a bit clunky, but overall the whole thing works for an atmospheric horror game like this.\n\nAfaik there is no way for steam to get German language for all the text, which might be an issue for some people.","June 30, 2015","true","13.3"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","37","38","6","1"

(It even has a few emotional moments!) Even though at the beginning there is a short recap of the events that took place in Overture, I highly recommend playing the first game first in order to have a full understanding of the story. (You can only buy the package containing both games, so why not give it a try?)\n\nBoth games are similar in terms of gameplay, but Black Plague improves a lot on about every aspect of the first game, making it more solid. There is no direct way of fighting with the enemies in this installment, so the combat system, which, in my opinion, wasn't that awful, should no longer be a problem for those who complained about it. Another important aspect of the game are puzzles: being the second episode, Black Plague is also filled with intelligent puzzles that require reading (in-game "notes") and thinking, but this time they are just a little easier than those found in Overture.\n\nThe graphics may be a little outdated, but there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't break the immersion; they are decent and have successfully created a terrifying atmosphere that will constantly make you scared of the unknown. (For that to work at its full potential, I recommend lowering the gamma a bit, until you can't see anything in places without any source of light.) With its impressive sound design and voice acting (at least for a low-budget game), the developers managed to create their own world filled with few, but believable characters.\n\nFor such a low price, I can recommend the Penumbra games without a doubt! This package is a must-have for every horror enthusiast, as it delivers a frightening experience!","April 13, 2015","true","6.0"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","42","46","2","0"

In fact, it turns out, this is not the final episode (as Requiem includes further chapters) but for me it seemed like the final chapter of his adventure.\n\nThe story now continues and tells us much, much more. Running and hiding is even more frequent and from this episode we can clearly see the couple of places that inspired Frictional Games to make Amnesia. The game is also somewhat longer.\n\nSince this is an essential part of a great survival horror trilogy, look for discount on the trilogy pack (if there's any) so that all episodes can be purchased at once.

Every time, I feel more of myself inside.”\n\nPenumbra: Black Plague is the second of three episodes in the Penumbra series. While continuing the compelling storyline from the first instalment it also improves the characterization of the protagonist. Furthermore, the excellent music background contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are challenging and enjoyable, without being illogical or forced.\n\nWithout the awkward combat system of the prequel, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.\n\nTrivia:\n\nPenumbra: Requiem is the third and last episode in the Penumbra series. Originally intended to be a trilogy the series was reduced to two episodes due to unidentified problems with the previous publisher, Lexicon Entertainment. In the end, the third instalment came in form of an expansion pack in order to tie up loose ends and put the focus more on the puzzles.\n\nAmusing quotes:\n\n“Is the emergency figurative or literal? A figurative emergency might, for example, involve an undersupply of coffee to the vending machines. A literal emergency, on the other hand, might involve flesh eating monsters rampaging about the facility.”\n\n“So… you are running around with a human body part in your backpack, and I am supposed to be the bad guy?”\n\nAchievements:\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements.\n\nChronology:\n\nPenumbra: Requiem (PC)\nFirst-person adventure game\n(Horror) – 2008\n\nPenumbra: Black Plague (PC)\nFirst-person adventure game\n(Horror) – 2008\n\nPenumbra: Overture (PC)\nFirst-person adventure game\n(Horror) – 2007\nLink to Steam review for Penumbra: Overture.","May 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","36","42","0","0"

Penumbra points out the pefect imperfections of human nature. Dark areas with whispering, slithering, crawling and screaming in the background allows for a more "intimidating" experience. Enemies are fuel for nightmares, conjured up from the fears of fellow humans. The general atmosphere will make your heart pound and make you sweat. The good ol' fashioned jumpscares (how few they are) will last in your memories and well, deep into your dreams. Nightmares* excuse me.\n\nNow, the ONE (1) bad thing I had was not game-ruining; a simple lighting error with the shader. A simple fix of course. Lower the shader resolution to medium. Bing, bang you're back in action!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/22120/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Penumbra: Black Plague is a sequel to Penumbra: Overture, an adventure horror game with more realistic physics for more immersive interaction. It was released in 2008, year after original, and yep, still made by Frictional Games, but this time under different publishers. They say that under pressure from old publisher Frictional Games turned what was intented to be trilogy into duology, Black Plague concluding the series. It's unknown how much from planned two last episodes was fit into Black Plague, it could be possible that something important got cut. Thus some people belive the ending to be a slight cliffhanger and want Penumbra 3 to happen, while others just view it as a proper bad ending of sorts. I am leaning toward the latter.\n\nYou may notice that Steam store says "Gold Edition". It means that it includes Requiem, an expansion pack. Which you shouldn't think of as Penumbra 3, as it's just a set of puzzles that were cut from Black Plague without horror. Or big story. That, and maybe not cut, can't say for sure.\n\nSo, as far scary, it's a step up from Overture. Or step down. Now, instead of fighting it out with dogs, developers decided to remove weapons fully. Instead you will have the infected roam the corridors, who look like creepy zombies. And you will not be able to fight them directly, instead your only options is to hide and avoid them. Which is supposed to make it scarier. If forget that they aren't terribly efficient killers as you can just outrun them easily and not even bother with hiding sometimes. Oh well, always hiding would have been too annoying for me.\n\nYou aren't alone this time either, as the world feels more filled with other characters. Mostly human corpses that Overture lacked so much. But you will be accomplished by one sarcastic voice which isn't exactly enemy but not ally either. From one point it also brings in creepy hallucinations. Thankfully nothing that screams into your face. But then he and his sarcasm pop-up often enough that I can't help but to feel that at times game felt like a thriller with black humor rather than proper atmoshperic horror.\n\nThe story of the game on other hand is enough to make you play it not because of atmoshpere but to know what is going on and what happens next. It's not just about being alone and reading tons of notes. Things are happening right in front of you and plot twists around, as it finally get revelead and tells you slowly what is actually happening, while Overture was barely hinting at things. It was exciting. For horror-adventure.\nSounds and music were good at what they were supposed to do as well. Mostly tension. Sometimes paranoia. And sometimes relaxing in a locked little room, deep in a unknown.\n\nPuzzles felt more refined as well. Or at least they felt more fitting into main flow. Still got a bunch of standard puzzles and puzzles that make you use said physics. And throwing bricks to break stuff. And combining inventory items. Even if slightly less experimental than original.\n\nBlack Plague is a much tighter dark narrative, much less about wandering in the dark alone, but still with nice atmoshpere and horror. A worthy conclusion to duology. Or main meat of it. Depends on preference.\nBy the way, if you find all 10 statues in the game then you will be given a password. You can use it to play a simple Space Invader-like game on one of the in-game computers. Or you can open game's folder and use it on super_secret archive to unlock bonus materials.","October 18, 2015","true","7.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCompanionCube/recommended/22120/","YourCompanionCube","Sturmgeist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCompanionCube/","103 products in account","This is an atmospheric first person survival horror game at its best. Combat is there, but almost completely obsolete against your enemies. You are much better off using stealth and tactics. *Thinking*. Using the environment to your advantage. This is a real horror simulator where you are the victim, the target. You are not a survivor, you are not a well-armed super-soldier blasting his way through zombies, parasitic creatures, mutants, and the hordes of hell.\n\nBefore I go ranting about how to play this game and how it is so different from the common horror shooters that are actually *fun to play* and inevitably drive you away from a well-spent ten bucks on this game...\n\nYou're locked inside a building where nobody is your friend and all your enemies have bigger d*cks than you. In fact, they're so proud of their d*cks they're willing to display them, with a facial expression that says "look at my big ♥♥♥♥ while feeling so inferior, saddened in your depression that even the big f*cking worm prefers me to you. That if any girl were around, she would see that your ♥♥♥♥ was so inferior to mine."\n\nOf course, you won't be looking at their face or facial expression, because you will be so distracted by the sheer, immesne size of their d*ck. Even when they try to kill you, you will not be able to help but look at the big, red, erect thing between their legs. You'll find yourself running away from them, maybe turning back to catch a few glances... and then finding yourself going back to get another good look.\n\nYou also run into these strange objects that Philip (Yes, your protagonist's name is Philip...) feels the need to masturbate with. He even goes out to say “Every time, it’s harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.” at least *one* time in the game. I must say that it's quite an experience. I feel more of myself rushing out too... I don't want to pull out. I want to keep going. Now, back to talking about the game:\n\nThis is not FEAR. Instead of being r*ped (because steam doesn't like the R word) by an 8 year old girl and killing ghosts in slow-motion, you will feel utterly helpless as large, gray skinned men beat you to a bloody pulp and get their bloody pulp inside you. You won't care, because you'll still be distracted by their d*ck.\n\nThere's a story, somewhere, along with schizophrenia and some rather tense moments. However, it would be better without the schizophrenia and split personalities, which get really damned annoying at times and totally ♥♥♥♥ the entire sense of terror and fear. Imagine getting off really hard and having your uncle walk right in and say "Oh yeah, I used to do that all the time." Not only does it kill the moment, but you want to stop and never do it again. Think of your dead great grandmother watching you masturbate and laughing at how you're doing it so "wrong". It really kills you.\n\nSorry, back to the game. Well, no, I've just about wrapped it up and concluded it. You'll have some "half-life" type puzzles involving physics (Placing blocks on a lever is the extent...) and some resident evil style puzzles involving pushing boxes around. That's about it. You might find the combat system to be fun if you're really bored. You can throw boxes at enemies to try and kill them (Boxing Match). This will allow you to inspect their large d*cks more closely.\n","October 7, 2014","true","8.5"," 73 of 129 people (57%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","57","73","129","29","0"

I never even heard of this game until I completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Both Overture and Black Plague are very good. I personally sided with Overture just a little more, simply because I liked the feel of the mines. Although I do have to hand it to Black Plague, the story was enhanced. This survival horror has so much to offer with the variety of thing's to find. Or if your a completionist (like my self) you can look every where in the vast mine and really delve deep in to the story. In my mind this game exceeds Amnesia because the deep thought and emotion Philip feels towards objects, scenery, and creatures is so realistic. It made me feel as if I were Philip, only more terrified. The puzzles were very well thought out, some very hard. Most games have their downfalls though. Such as Penumbra was more about the puzzles and story, rather than the horror. I admit, I jumped twice. Other than that it was not to scary. The ending was very suprising and I would reccomend it.

There are also very few bad reviews, so hopefully this will give people a more rounded impression of the game before they buy it.\n\nOne of the main characters is supposed to be this really omnious dude but they got someone who sounds like Bernie Sander's (US politican wish a hard Brooklyn accent) greasy brother to do the voice acting--it's completely immersion breaking.  That character is also incredibly obnoxious, it's more like dealing with an annoying child instead of.. well, what it's supposed to be.  That might have been the point, but I don't know how keeping a metaphorical fruit fly around the character's ear is supposed to contribute to suspense.\n\nThe story went out of control toward the end, think sorta like M. Night Shyamalan.  Some people might like that; I think it's poor writing.  It's almost on the same level of bad as The Village.\n\nThere's no combat in the game, which can be a positive, but all of the enemies are just really weak and slow, so it turns out to be more of an annoyance.  They also put them in your face so much you just aren't afraid of them by the end.  Of course as the game progresses more and more show up, so it's just.. more and more annoying dudes that you have to dodge and weave..\n\nThe game has boss fights.  A story focused non combat game has boss fights.  They're as terrible as you can imagine.  There are also really gimmicky auto-kill areas in the game that don't entirely make sense.  It feels really jarring to go from being chased around by actual entities then in other parts just outright dying if you don't get the puzzle right or if you're mediocre at platforming.  That's not horror, especially with how dying is handled.  It just turns into a quickload cycle until you get things right.  While that might work in something like Silent HIll or Resident Evil, that's not good gameplay for a strictly story based horror game like Black Plague.\n\nA lot of people really really like this game, and more power to them.  The game has a really cool atmosphere and the environment is interesting and creative.  Opinions are opinions, take what I have to say along with what everyone else is saying and come up with your own decision.  A lot of the fluff/extra parts of the game are really good, but the core--the story and how it's told--is awful.  That's why I don't recommend this game.\n\nEdit: Added an actual review.","October 8, 2015","false","7.5"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","5"

Penumbra Black Plague is an EXCELLENT game. Frictional Games have really defined themselves as experts in the horror genre. The first game, Overture, was good but it lacked the horror we experience in Black Plague. In Overature, you can fight your enemies with various tools you find throughout the environment. While this was a good idea in itself, the physics based movement/interaction coupled with combat made for an incredibly clunky control scheme. However, in Black Plague, you cannot fight your enemies. You can either run and hide, or die.\n\nMost people know Frictional Games for their work on Amnesia: The Dark Descent. People believe that this title set the standard for horror games. But to really see what horror is like, you need to go back to Amnesia's roots, which all started with The Penumbra Series. Black Plague does more than just scare you. It makes you question reality. It makes you wonder what really is possible, and what is just the making of a nightmare.\n\nYou start as a Philip, a dangerously deranged man who has just been to hell and back during the first game in the series, Overture. You wake up in an a prison cell, your mind completly fragmented, with no recollection of how you got to where you are. You have to put the pieces back together through notes, puzzles, and exploration. As you make your way through the abandoned facility, you realize that your shattered memory is not the only thing you need to worry about. There is something much more terrifying thats lurkes the hallways. As you duck and dodge through a multidude of enemies, you must figure out the reason for the madness that is happening all around you.\n\nAs you uncoover more secrets and start getting your memory back, you realize that you can no longer simply escape. You discover a sinister plague, something that has taken control of not only everyone around you, but yourself as well. You must find a way to stop it from spreading to the outside world. You must destroy it! Stricken with insanity, voices insulting and deterring you with every step, as well as the many grotesque creatures that patrol each corridor all add up to a horror game that is a cut above all the others.\n\n9/10 - A near perfect horror experience\n\nYou will thoroughly enjoy the horror that this title has to offer!

Unlike the console horror stylings of Overture, Black Plague feels more akin to, say, System Shock. A combatless System Shock! Does that make sense? Anyway -- the writing is surprisingly much more jokey and generally funnier than in Overture. One particular character sounds entirely like a devilish old early-days Stephen King antagonist, which may or may not be to your liking. Ahem. All in all, this is not the sequel I expected to play after finishing Overture. For one, all that humour kind of scares away all the horror.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/22120/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.\n\nPenumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd game in the series. It improves upon many aspects of Overture, and is the best of the 3 games.","November 3, 2012","true","6.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Really, why haven't you bought it yet? Seriously? So, Overture is a truly well-done game, as the 2nd game Frictional Games, the makers of the Amnesia series and the upcoming Soma, started out with a Penumbra 2006 Tech Demo. (available for free on Frictional Game's site so try it out if you aren't sure about getting it) Then, because of it's rising popularity, they created Penumbra Overture. I really don't want to spoil anything, but it has one of the best atmospheres in gaming. Your father died. You have found a letter left by him, talking about a security deposit. You go to it, and find a note that tells of a faraway place. You go there, and you get caught in a snowstorm. So, you find a buried hatch, open it, and fall into a mine. You have to find a way out. One thing leads to another, and you are stuck in a mental hospital. That, is how they chose to start Penumbra Black Plague. And, I am only halfway through Black Plague. So, 10 DOLLARS FOR 3 FULL GAMES.  and, why get Amnesia for 20 bucks when you can get the first 3 games for 10! Oh, and the games are really good.","February 9, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a great horror game, and my personal favorite of the penumbra series. It had some jumpy moments and the first time you encounter an infected can be very heart racing, but not the scariest game ive ever played. Amnesia was a little more scary because you cant lose the "monsters" as easily. But, i actually recommend this game (or series) over Amnesia because the enviornment is better/scarier. This game had amazing physics and the puzzles were extremely fun. Amnesia has a story but the objective of the game is not to beat it, but to immerse yourself in the enviornment. But penumbra has a story that is meant to be beaten, not to roam around and light candles, and its about immersing yourself in the chilling enviornment. I highly recommend this game it will be worth every penny. WARNING: DO NOT LOOK UP A WALKTHROUGH UNLESS ITS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!

Gameplay is heavily based on puzzle-solving and navigating dark corridors where you have no idea what's lurking around, no companions met face-to-face and real time inventory, meaning you can't just open your backpack and remain worry free from the attacking Tuurngait while trying to figure out if something you're carrying will kill it (fact: you can't kill them). My main gripe is with the subconcious alternate personality in your mind, Clarence, and how he ruins the atmosphere of the game with his grimy wise-guy voice. Running out of room: Penumbra is not nearly as scary as Amnesia, but it gets the job done well enough.","January 8, 2012","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiiInfer/recommended/22120/","DiiInfer","Dii Infer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiiInfer/","239 products in account","Penumbra Black Plague is an improvement over its predecessor Penumbra Overture. Instead of fighting random animals, you will encounter mutated humans. Unlike the first game, there is no possibility of combat against them. You are defenseless against them, upping the ante on terror and suspense. The music is still excellent and the controls are solid once you get the hang of them.\n\nThis particular package, Penumbra Black Plague Gold Edition also includes the final game of the trilogy, Penumbra Requiem. Unfortunately, it is the worst game in the series -- easily. In this game, I never felt any suspense but mostly frustration because it was loaded with convoluted puzzles (the worst part of the series) and completely lacking any monsters, therefore no sense of being followed (the best and scariest part of the series). I didn't feel a need for wrapping things up with the main character's storyline, which is what Requiem does essentially. Requiem's biggest sin is the fact it centers around the main character completely as opposed to continuing the plot from the previous game, leaving no room for any scary moments whatsoever.\n\nOverall, this game is worth the purchase. Personally I think the series ended well with Black Plague, as there was closure in its conclusion. But if you want to play the whole series for the sake of completion, go for it!","January 19, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Or TWO games, rather!\n\nOne word of warning about Requiem, though:  It's pure, 100% puzzle-solving.  Well, okay, a couple of treacherous bits of jumping and timing here and there...but apart from environmental hazards, there's no way of dying (i.e. no "enemies")...which makes it less of an action/horror game than the others, and yet oddly spooky and suspenseful in spite of all that.  I still spent a good deal of the game half-expecting something nasty to jump out at me, but alas...!  I would in any case heartily recommend this pack to anyone who enjoyed the first Penumbra and/or Amnesia, though would suggest that only those who enjoy the puzzle-solving antics in and of themselves proceed to Requiem.\n\n(Oh, and don't attempt to play the latter if tired and grumpy, 'cause there's head-♥♥♥♥ing aplenty.

The voice acting was superb throughout but while the humourous moments helped lighten the mood faster in order to regain that "SHOCK" moment more often, I felt that this rushed approach wasn't well executed nor received.\nThe total removement of the combat system is what I think makes this game far superior than its predesseccor. You have to run and hide rather than club your enemies to death.\nThe best thing about Black Plague was by far its script, it never fails to keep the player both captivated and horrified. The end message was well thought out and delievered although the overall shortness of the campaign may disappoint the die-hard fans who were looking for something a bit longer.\nOverall, this game is superb and fully deserves your time and money.","July 14, 2012","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere, while normally good, is at its best when there are no enemies to worry about, since the persistent monster patrols quickly become tiresome. The puzzles are the real star here, and while there are a few stinkers that refer back to the "logic" of early-90s point-and-clickers, they're normally quite tactile and satisfying to complete thanks to liberal use of the physics engine.\n\nBlack Plague, then, is nowhere near as impressive as either Amnesia game when taken as a whole. Still, its flawed story is perhaps the most ambitious that developer Frictional Games has created yet, and its (mostly) enjoyable while it lasts.","February 17, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That being said it relies a pretty good amount on you playing the game properly and not just sprinting through it as fast as possible.\n\nAnyone that played Overture (you should play Overture first) will be glad to know that there's less chase sequences in Black Plague. Some of them I couldn't tell if I was actually being chased or not, I wasn't gonna risk it so I hurried anyways. No hordes of spiders chasing you through small tunnels at any rate.\n\nThis game is kind of similar to A Machine For Pigs oddly enough in how it handles the plot, I suspect Chinese Room took a lot of inspiration from Black Plague in how they designed AMFP. Though don't get me wrong there's a plethora of ways to die in Black Plague, unlike AMFP which you basically had to try to get something to attack you.\n\nIf you enjoyed either of the Amnesia games you'll enjoy Penumbra as well, you just have to keep in mind that it's an older title running on an older engine.","February 8, 2014","true","6.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrPingy/recommended/22120/","MrPingy","Mr. Pingy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrPingy/","130 products in account","Black Plague was a good survival horror game that you might not want to play at 1 am while alone in the dark.  The plot really advances the story of Penumbra Overture and is also emotionally captivating.  I really enjoyed this one, if being scared for 11 hours can really count as an enjoyable experience.\n\nI do not, however, recommend Requiem.  The best I can liken it to is if George Romero made the zombie horror movies Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, but then made Day of the Dead a musical romance about vampires.  Let me be perfectly clear, Requiem is not a survival horror, it is a puzzle game, and not even genuinely creepy.  Half the time it isn't even clear what you're supposed to be doing with the puzzles, you just kind of see there is something you can do and then do it, and everything seems to work out.  Without giving anything away, it felt like an afterthought and I don't think it added anything to the story.  If anything, it was an anti-climactic buzzkill with a convoluted story that did nothing to advance the series.\n\nUnless you like platform jumping and puzzles for the sake of puzzles that have (mostly) no discernable purpose, stop at the end of Black Plague and use your imagination and decide what you want to happen from there.  Since Black Plague is 2/3 of this package I still recommend it, even if my review was very critical of Requiem.","July 10, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Except when I was looking for something later in the game called "substance 65" and a hacksaw, and a gas mask. Anyway, the only monsters that chase you are these weird alien-infected things that used to be humans, and the things that jumpscare you are some hallucinations. One last thing, there is a game before this one called Penumbra: Overture. GET IT. I don't know if I got a collector's pack because I got a deal or because they are just selling it like that now, but either way, PLAY OVERTURE FIRST.

The game takes place in an underground research facility that is actually built above the mines from Penumbra Overture. In the facility you will encounter infected, the infected are very good at tracking you down and sensing the environment which means if you aren't careful you will be spotted. The game is different from your typical story driven fps as once you are spotted the only option is to run and find a new spot to hide or escape the area.  Monsters and a creepy setting isn't the only thing stopping you from progressing though, the game is filled with various puzzles for you to overcome using game's physics engine. The puzzles never seemed to difficult except near the end (which I wont spoil here) and I always felt a sense of accomplishment when figuring out a puzzle. Overall it's a very cool game and worth the $10, it will leave you wanting more but sadly the third chapter Requiem is nothing more than a money grab so only pick up Black Plague and Overture.","August 20, 2014","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/22120/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Penumbra: Black Plague is quite simply, a continuation of Penumbra: Overture. It might as well be considered one single game. The engine seems to be the same used in the first game, and most mechanics are identical. The atmosphere continues to be dark and creepy, with the addition of some new surprises that surface throughout. Everything is basically the same, with only the plot and storyline developing further. The one major improvement in comparison to Overture is the amount of thrills found in this iteration. There seems to be more action and more atmosphere overall, which makes the game more enjoyable, more creepy and a bit more scary. The story progression isn't as interesting or original as in the first game, but at least it has much more detail and much more depth. The voice acting also continues its high quality performances. Loading times are atrocious and much longer than in the first game, which tests patience. Some of the puzzles included in this game aren't as logical as in the first. The unintuitive puzzles are more complicated and mostly involve trial and error during a particular segment of the adventure. There are also more absurdly hidden items and mechanisms, which makes this game much more difficult in terms of its playability as an adventure game. There is also more interaction between the player and other characters in the story, which quickly dissolves the feeling of being a solitary person in a creepy and scary locale. The developers decided to get rid of the melee combat instances completely (found in the first game), which I agree is for the best and makes the game more tense and more fluid. There are way too many interruptions for plot development voice acting. Without ruining the experience with spoilers, I will say that these voice acting pauses occur almost at any given time, without a focus on storyline turning points. They can get a bit distracting at times. Not having the ability to engage your enemies in melee combat makes the game so much more tense and exciting. The ending is very good and adds to the story rather well. Penumbra: Black Plague is better than Penumbra: Overture in every way, as it corrected some of the developers' mistakes and made the gaming experience more enjoyable as a whole. This is clearly the best adventure game I have ever played; totally exceeding Penumbra: Overture. Once again, the game runs a little bit short, but I suppose it is of adequate length after all, since it is an adventure game with lots of theme and mood. I am now looking forward to the third part in the series.\n\nPenumbra: Black Plague is good.\n\nPenumbra: Requiem is the third game of the series, and this one focuses its gameplay strictly on puzzles. The atmosphere and theme are still there, as the main character returns to where the first two games took place for some finality in the plot. All plot turns are done in what seemingly feels like memory flashbacks, and some more information is entertained concerning the characters of the overall story. This iteration of the series is not scary, and does not provide the player with any creepy or surprising moments, as the main objective this time around is to solve puzzles. While this is a departure from the previous two games, it is rather enjoyable, even for someone like myself who does not prefer to solve puzzles for fun. Some of the levels later in the game are much more difficult than in the beginning. They do not scale up the difficulty gradually. Suddenly, the puzzles are very complicated. The minute details you are expected to spot are very well hidden, which makes some of these later puzzles frustrating and unreasonably time consuming. I'm not sure how viable the comparison is, but Penumbra: Requiem reminds me of Portal. You are in need of some keys, which in turn, opens a portal to the next level. Even though this third installment of the series is an attempt to complete the story, I am a bit disappointed to say that it does not. At least it does not end the story clearly. This goes along well with the first two parts, and leaves the player wondering, and\nhoping that all ended well. Being the shortest and more complicated of the three, Penumbra: Requiem was fun for a puzzle game, and it should be considered as such.\n\nPenumbra: Requiem is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And in the beginning I really thought it was better.\nBut nooo, the developers had to introduce some really annoying things. It's nice that weapons have been removed, the were really unhandy. And not useful at all in this game - not because the new, scarier-than-the-Overture-dogs-looking enemies are dangerous. They're the opposite. They are so ♥♥♥♥ing slow. Just run past them, 5 seconds later they won't know where you are.\nThen there's Clarence. Some kind of demon who possesses you in the beginning and comments everything you do. I guess his comments are supposed to be funny. They're not. They aren't informative, they aren't interesting, but they are really long and distracting, sometimes they even block the controls so you just stay and wait until he stops annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. He even spoils the most "emotional" moment in the game.\nThe gameplay, too, becomes annoying. Try solving some riddles while having to run back to a hut every 10-15 seconds so you don't freeze to death. It's not even difficult, it's just extremely tedious. The riddles become really uninspired and in the end I mostly played by a walkthrough because I was done with this piece of crap.\nAnd lo, this ending! Instead of just staying on the "horror" plain, the game suddenly ascends onto a pseudo-metaphysical plain which doesn't fit to the rest at all. I would've liked to laugh, but it was way too stupid.\n\nI'm still going to play Penumbra: Requiem, but only because it's a 100% puzzle game without annoying enemies that just slow you down instead of making things more difficult.","June 9, 2015","false","3.8"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"

Occasionally you'll have to stack some boxes to jump over laser-triggered mines (which were put up by a delusional person, judging from their locations). And mines only go off when you pass through them, they ignore objects for some reason. So you'll have to put one box on top of another. But jumping on them will often move and destroy the structure. It is annoying as hell.\n\nPuzzles:\n[Mild Spoilers] If you want to get through that door, you'll have to inject some kind of ♥♥♥♥ into your arm and pass out. When you get up, the door will magically unlock. I don't think I need to add anything else.\n\nJump Scares:\nThey speak for themselves really. The only thing the game can frighten you with are jumping images and loud sounds.\n\nAdditionally, it is just raw. There is a point where darkness literally bites and kills you.

And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.\n\nHigh points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.","November 29, 2013","false","7.0"," 13 of 56 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","13","56","0","0"

At first I thought it was a feature to add to surrealism, but then I got stuck on the wrong side of said object in a tunnel and couldn't solve the puzzle to move on.  Maybe I'm spoiled since I played Amnesia first and then backtracked to Penumbra, but..the physics failure made this unplayable for me. :(","January 12, 2014","false","0.8"," 8 of 45 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","8","45","0","0"

I gave it a try for 40min, but in the end I gave up. It's the experience that turned me away.\n\nFirst I started it to see if my Intel card can take it. Surprinsingly, it appeared to work very well in 1280x1024 (good framerate for this type of game, decent texture quality). I had to configure it from using Pulse Audio to ALSA, but that's OK. A lot of applications don't get the Pulse Audio integration right. Then I grabbed a coffee and prepared to go through this game from A to Z. I wanted to experience all its features.\n\nThe first hickup: multiple monitors. I have a second monitor connected to my laptop. The xrandr/xcb support for this is working perfectly (all applications [thus far] supporting multiple monitors have no issues). But this game simply doesn't get it right. The list of resolutions is weird (I don't know where it gets those), I can't predict on which screen it will start and if I increase the resolution past 1280x1024, it will use both monitors in one large canvas with the game centered. It's unusable. Thus, I'm stuck with a low(ish) resolution.\n\nThe game tries to start in fullscreen mode, but today it started doing a decoration-less window mode. Very unusual. There does not seem to be a truly _windowed_ mode, which most Linux users will prefer specifically because fullscreen with X is a very complicated affair.\n\nThe next hiccup: the sound. There's a constant "click", as if the game constantly misses the deadlines when feeding the audio sink.\n\nThe next hiccup: CPU usage. Even though I'm in the main menu, the application consumes 100% of my CPU time. I appears to be constanly rendering something, event though I can't see anything noticeable changing. But maybe my driver is not so stellar. Actually, I'm sure it's not. When switching from X to the terminal, the CPU usage drops to ~6%.\n\nThe game itself: I started with the tutorial. There's a step where I have to put a box into a coffin. Took me four tries to do that, because the box dissapears all of sudden. Eventually I managed to drop it in the coffin, but it made me woder if there was any QA involved in making this port.\n\nAt this point I was pretty bummed and I was ready to do something else, but I kept doing the tutorial until my system rebooted (my laptop's fans didn't keep up with the generated heat; but that's an unrelated hardware issue I have). Hence: this review.\n\nAll in all, the game looks very interesting and _maybe_ I'll try it again later, but it's a pitty that I had to step into all these issues which remind me of the Xfree86/artsd era. Maybe it works better on a desktop. Who knows,","March 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 3 of 33 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","3","33","0","1"

Opening doors is a chore in this game, if real life was like this we would never be able to leave our homes.  Then again the first room in this game is designed so badly many people never make it out of the room.  Better off the games controls are some of the worst in the industry.

To be honest, this game I enjoyed more than Penumbra: Overture, if not as much! It as well as it's prequel, Penumbra: Overture is worth the money, but this time, it just might be MORE worth it, two more hours of gameplay than Penumbra: Overture did! I strongly recommend this game to people who enjoy horror games and/or Penumbra: Overture, more fear is put into this game than it's prequel, along with more to enjoy!Penumbra: Requiem - ReviewPenumbra: Requiem isn't a horror game, but instead it's a puzzle game, it's short but it's still a fun game because of the game revolving around puzzles, but it's still not as fun as Penumbra: Overture and Penumbra: Black Plague, keep in mind that this game is only available in Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition, the game is technically a DLC that only comes with Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition. I would still recommend that you purchase Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition for two reasons; It's the only way to get Penumbra: Black Plague because Steam doesn't offer it by itself.\nBoth games are aquired with the single purchase of Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition!\n(Why not get yourself and a friend a copy of this!)  :D[/i]Penumbra Series - Review(?)Penumbra is just a generally great series to play, it will more than likely satisfy players who enjoy horror games and puzzle games!\n(Off Topic) Additional Comment\nIf some feel the need for a number scale from 0-10 on how much I enjoyed the game and based on how well it was, by all means, leave a comment down below and I'll provide number scales for games I review here on Steam's Community Store Page Review area!  :ɔ","January 15, 2013","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the first part was a cautious walk the second is a full-tilt run: tighter narrative, better graphics, excellent level design, evocative sound, great enemies and even better physics puzzles. It also has the distinction of being a game that effectively crosses genres from mystery to horror fantasy to existential sci-fi and even buddy comedy on whim (granted the "buddy" is a psychic tumor). Admittedly Penumbra isn't an entirely frightening experience for the fact that the antagonists are a vulnerable batch of evil aliens (similar to Metro's Dark Ones). It absolutely has it's moments though, particularly the unseen creatures taking residence in the Kennel's long, dark hallwalls and the moment you're locked in with a person that's just succumb to infection. Bringing up the inventory or reading notes in real time also adds a tremendous ammount of immediacy to the proceedings (try fumbling through your pockets to heal while enemies are searching for you and you'll see). There is a third episode but it's a forgettable platformer which adds nothing to the narrative, nor the impressive ending, of Penumbra. Black Plague takes the sterility inherent  to puzzle games and injects the kind of story and mood you'd never really expect it could have.","February 11, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developer listened to complaints, however (which is something I wish the bigger companies would do) and produced Black Plague, which single-handedly fixes all the major problems with the original while continuing the intriguing story that I loved so much before. No longer can you expect to fight your way out of a tight spot, so your only options are stealth and pegging it. As a result, the atmosphere can get RIDICULOUSLY intense and your opportunities to relax become increasingly few later on.\n\nIt's not quite the masterpiece of bone-shaking terror that Amnesia would become, but it's still bloody petrifying and easily worth looking into, particularly if you've already suffered through Amnesia and fancy even more abuse.","October 5, 2011","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay, it's not, but it's really annoying. Sure, Amnesia may have been a more polished experience (albeit with a convoluted story), but Black Plague introduced literally every noteworthy game mechanic that people think Amnesia invented. I also liked the story and characters better. I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds. Some of the physics puzzles may get you stuck, but it's nothing a walkthrough won't help.

The movement is pretty smooth, the puzzles are a good challenge, it scares you while pacing itself and the story is good. The game is a tad bit buggy sometimes, but glitches don't occur often, so it's negligible. Unlike Overture's stupid combat system, there are no means of self defense. This, paired with the humming of machines and flourescent lights and other ambient noises makes the environment very creepy. A major flaw of this game is the budget: it's not too long and isn't very pretty looking. But who the hell cares? I think that might be the reason this game got such a low metacritic rating. But if you judged it on how scary it is, take the the total points of the Dead Space Series, divide by three, then add 10 and that's the score this game deserves.\n\nShort Review: Scary, fun/10, definitely worth playing.","March 20, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, since this game comes with Penumbra: Requiem, I'll talk about that game in this review as well.\n\nGameplay (Black Plague): Truth be told, you should probably refer back to the Overture review if you wanna know about the mechanics of the game. Since this is a sorta episodic game, I won't go into too much detail again about the mechanics. Just know that they remain largely unchanged. What has changed - and definitely for the better - is the atmosphere. Oh man, it's a lot better this time around. Again, it's not quite Dark Descent territory, but it's pretty dang good. The extra enemy variety helps out a lot as well. Another thing that has changed for the better is the puzzle design. They do require a bit more thought than the average puzzle in Overture would, but the puzzles still make logical sense and are less prone to breaking. All in all, it's the same from Overture but a lot better. 8/10.\n\nGameplay (Requiem): If ya like puzzles and not being scared... go play Portal 2 or something. Seriously; I don't even know why this became a thing. This game is mostly puzzles with some platforming here and there, but there's no monsters. There's no atmosphere. It's pretty much Myst if you've turned the Gamma down to 0.1 or something. That's not a bad thing, though; a lot of the puzzles in this game are quite good. It's just not a Penumbra game. Also, the atmosphere... they're just taking the ♥♥♥♥ at this point. There's a Donkey Kong parody in there. No, I'm not joking. There's even chippy music. As if the game wasn't far removed enough from the Penumbra atmosphere. Again though, the puzzles are pretty good. It's just not a Penumbra game. 6/10.\n\nStory (Black Plague): A lot tighter of a story than Overture's. Clarence is a pretty neat and genuinely terrifying character/concept. Likewise, there's actually a couple of pretty heavy moments toward the end (for those who know what I'm talking about, pun well intended). Everything's pretty well explained and the ending wraps things up quite well. No need for a sequel. 8/10.\n\nStory (Requiem): ...and then this thing happened. Again, just... why? The story doesn't even take itself seriously. For anybody who bought Requiem from retail; I'm sorry. I apologize on behalf of Frictional (not affiliated). The characters are just silly, the premise doesn't make any dosh garn sense, the payoff is underwhelming, and it's just generally a mess. At least Dark Descent redeemed them. 3/10.\n\nGraphics (Black Plague): Again, a lot more of the same but better. Enemy design is the biggest standout as far as graphics goes. As for the technical side, same engine; same reliability. 4/5.\n\nGraphics (Requiem): None of the enemy design from Black Plague. At least areas are pretty varied, even if the framing device doesn't work. Again, for the technical side of the things, it's the same as Black Plague. 3/5.\n\nSound (Black Plague): I'd say it's about the same as Overture's, which is to say very good. Enemies sound a lot more terrifying now, so that's a plus. Clarence sounds proper mental this time as opposed to cartoonishly mental. Good stuff. 5/5.\n\nSound (Requiem): Way too try-hard. So much attempted atmosphere for so little worth fretting over. It gets kinda ridiculous, honestly. Ah well; it's not like anything else in the game was cohesive. 2/5.\n\nOverall scores for Black Plague are 8/8/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. Good stuff.\n\nOverall scores for Requiem are: 6/3/3/2; 4.7/10. Not good stuff.","July 15, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I am note completely sure whether there are some logical holes in it (there's a lot to consider and remember), it does otherwise actually makes perfect sense when you consider one important and central detail of the larger plot.

The puzzles you need to solve (again, like in the 1st part, they are evnvironmental for the most part) are substantially more challenging and there is  essentially  no combat in this one, rather, you need to truly make use of stealth this time around if you want to survive.\n\nAs for the umbilical gibbering manchildren things running around, I just about sh*t myself the first time I saw one (you'll know when the 1st sighting is about to occur as the character you are states that you need to hide, but I wasn't quite expecting what came walking through the door next).\n\nThe lab/research facility a majority of this entry takes place in is definitely spooktacular and the graphics and sound are stll in top form (well, maybe not the graphics but the sound for sure).\n\nAll in all this was a fun adventure and I can't wait to play the final part (Requiem).\n\nLATER (3/17/14 @ 6:30 PM EST):\n\nWell, I finally played + completed the final part (Requiem) and I have to say it was...interesting.  It kinda, sorta gave me the impression that it didn't quite belong in the Penumbra series, like it was a standalone game based, in part, on the 1st two games (Overture and Black Plague), but it was still a good game.\n\nThe puzzles were even more complex this time around and entirely environmental in nature; so much so that it should have been called Penumbra: Requiem for a Puzzle Solver.  Also, (this is a pseudo SPOILER if you read on and may throw some off from wanting to play the game at all knowing what Overture and Black Plague had to offer) there were no creatures at all save for a vague shadowy form under the water in the sewer area.\n\nOverall, this was probably my least favorite of the 3 parts in this series, but it was still fun and if you find yourself to be a hardcore Penumbra fan after the 1st two parts, then you should definitely give this one a go too!","March 16, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gives a story recap, but it wont feel the same unless you have beaten the first.\nSome parts require finding an item, that if not found quickly can lead to wandering the entire complex for 2 hours before looking it up online to find you threw a damn couch cusion over it.\nRotation motion is very difficult to do properly\n\nOverall, very good game if your into story-horror games. It improves on almost everything that was wrong with the first one. Still some issues with rotating an object or handle.\nCombined, I think the Black Plague and Overture are scary-ier than amenisa.\n\nThe Requiem addition is kinda bad.

Some of the mechanics were tweaked a little to make the story flow better but all in all the game is just a continuation of the first.

I'm an avid horror game player, and this is a top competitor for my scariest game and definitely takes the cake for my favorite horror game.\nThe only problems I ran across were technical issues in the beginning. I did need to tweak graphic options a lot but I don't have a gaming pc, and it only needed about 10 minutes of attention to fix. Oh, and it's extremely puzzle based, and I found some of the puzzles can be obnoxious; so don't restrict yourself from using the internet as a source.","March 9, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles you need to solve (again, like in the 1st part, they are evnvironmental for the most part) are substantially more challenging and there is  essentially  no combat in this one, rather, you need to truly make use of stealth this time around if you want to survive.\n\nAs for the umbilical gibbering manchildren things running around, I just about sh*t myself the first time I saw one (you'll know when the 1st sighting is about to occur as the character you are states that you need to hide, but I wasn't quite expecting what came walking through the door next).\n\nThe lab/research facility a majority of this entry takes place in is definitely spooktacular and the graphics and sound are stll in top form (well, maybe not the graphics but the sound for sure).\n\nAll in all this was a fun adventure and I can't wait to play the final part (Requiem).\n\nLATER (3/17/14 @ 6:30 PM EST):\n\nWell, I finally played + completed the final part (Requiem) and I have to say it was...interesting.  It kinda, sorta gave me the impression that it didn't quite belong in the Penumbra series, like it was a standalone game based, in part, on the 1st two games (Overture and Black Plague), but it was still a good game.\n\nThe puzzles were even more complex this time around and entirely environmental in nature; so much so that it should have been called Penumbra: Requiem for a Puzzle Solver.  Also, (this is a pseudo SPOILER if you read on and may throw some off from wanting to play the game at all knowing what Overture and Black Plague had to offer) there were no creatures at all save for a vague shadowy form under the water in the sewer area.\n\nOverall, this was probably my least favorite of the 3 parts in this series, but it was still fun and if you find yourself to be a hardcore Penumbra fan after the 1st two parts, then you should definitely give this one a go too!","March 16, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first title is set in Greenland. You arrive in the cold and seek shelter in an abandoned mine shaft. Mistake number one. You would have been better off dying out in the snow. But that wouldn't be a very interesting game would it? I'm rambling here... The expansion for Black Plague, Requiem, was a disappointment.

My only problems, though, stemmed from the fact that numerous puzzles were just too hard and frustrating for me. Namely, the dreaded three or four final levels. I basically had to keep a pair of walkthroughs open in the Steam overlay so I could finally finish the game. People who are far smarter than me wouldn't have as much trouble as I did.\nOther than that, yes, it's a good game. The plot, the premise, the backstory... everything felt much deeper in here than in Overture. There also seemed to be more substance to the enemies here than in Overture, which were just angry, mangy dogs, annoying spiders and big, scary worms, whcih seemed to have little explanation or relevance to the story.\n\nThis might be a bit of a spoiler...\nI noticed that much of what happened here really reminded me of System Shock 2. Hybrids= The Infected. SHODAN/The Many=the thing that is responsible for this whole mess. The Von Braun= The Shelter/Mines. The list goes on.\n\nAnyway, I liked Black Plague a bit more than Overture, though they were both pretty good.\n\nOne last note, be careful with the graphics settings, especially screen resolution. I had problems with double images on screen, especially with the player's glowstick. I suspect this stems from the issues with widescreen monitors.","January 4, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is much better than Overture, with combat completely removed, scarier enemies, and more varied locations. Penumbra actually has some scary moments this time. Problem-solving is generally better than in Overture, but again, logic can be inconsistent. Early on, the game teaches you that barricading doors with heavy objects doesn't work as the basic enemy simply flings the door open, but later, you have to do just that. Some sections seemed to be added just to worsen the game: a freezing outdoor segment that drains your health when away from fire, and a tedious computer puzzle involving the sorting of programs into circuit boards. If you can tolerate these annoyances, then Black Plague's interesting story and atmosphere make it a fairly good horror experience.","April 22, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can now rotate objects by pressing the C key while holding them. Also, you can now use computers to  solve puzzles etc.The flashlight is more realistic with batteries going into your inventory instead of the magic energy pile in your flashlight. To use them you click on them via the inventory.\n\n+COMBAT-The combat in Overture had the same functionality as a toaster running MS-DOS. Thankfully THEY REMOVED THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ COMBAT!\n\n+GRAPHICS-They are the same yet they are very effective\n\n+SOUND-The sound design is chilling and the enemies you encounter sound terrifying. Personally, i found the dogs from overture scarier than Black Plauge's Pingas Zombies.\n\n+STORY-The story is deep with improved characters and unexpected twists. This time you (Redacted-One does not simply READ the story!)\n\n-LENGTH-This game is short, although admitedly it is longer  than overture and will send chills down yer spine\n\nOVERALL-This game is great, its one of the best follow ups in an episodic series i hav sen.\n\nPS-Eventually you will find a computer with a program on it called "Shmup.exe" it is pasword protected.

Compared to Penumbra Overture, Overture was better for a few reasons.  Some of the scares from Black Plauge were recycled in the sense that how they scared you in the first game was what they also used in this game which lowers the suprise element, at least for me.  Black Plauge also brings in a lot of story which is a good thing for a game, but I think they might have overdone it a bit, they tried to do too much at the end. Without spoiling the end, it became very reminiscent of another popular game, story wise.  Lastly, the voice in the head was annoying and killed the mood for me.\n\nthe good news is as stand alone game not compared to the first, the game is pretty good. It' s hard not to compare to the first game though as the story runs over, and if didn't play the first one, you would be really confused story wise.

It took everything that made Penumbra:Overture Great and improved the recipe.\n\nPROS/CONS\n\n+GAMEPLAY-Gameplay is similar if not the same as Overture only this time with a few tweaks. You can now rotate objects by pressing the C key while holding them. Also, you can now use computers to  solve puzzles etc.The flashlight is more realistic with batteries going into your inventory instead of the magic energy pile in your flashlight. To use them you click on them via the inventory.\n\n+COMBAT-The combat in Overture had the same functionality as a toaster running MS-DOS. Thankfully THEY REMOVED THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ COMBAT!\n\n+GRAPHICS-They are the same yet they are very effective\n\n+SOUND-The sound design is chilling and the enemies you encounter sound terrifying. Personally, i found the dogs from overture scarier than Black Plauge's Pingas Zombies.\n\n+STORY-The story is deep with improved characters and unexpected twists. This time you (Redacted-One does not simply READ the story!)\n\n-LENGTH-This game is short, although admitedly it is longer  than overture and will send chills down yer spine\n\nOVERALL-This game is great, its one of the best follow ups in an episodic series i hav sen.\n\nPS-Eventually you will find a computer with a program on it called "Shmup.exe" it is pasword protected.

The feeling of vulnerability is what causes most of the scares in this game. While a monster slowly creeps around your area, you have to debate fight or flight very carefully due to the lack of any legitimate weapons at your disposal. This is an excellent way to drive the fear of the player to the ceiling.  All this is going on while you are figuring out rather complex puzzles and slowly figuring out the mysterious story.\n\nI highly recommend getting the collectors pack for all three Penumbra games and lots of scares!","December 28, 2011","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game I can say is easily as scary as Amnesia, While the engine is pretty dated and the puzzles sometimes make literally no sense, the whole game can be greatly appreciated for the Horror it conveys. The tension is constant due to a limited understanding of the plot and creatures, and they really drive the HP Lovecraft horror into the mystery of the story, and even after the final curtain, you will ask yourself what the hell even happened.

And that comes from a person who has played quite a lot of those.\nPersonally for me this game even beats Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the matter of story and atmosphere.\n\nStoryThe story indeed is brilliant. It feels realistic, makes you truly involved in it.\nEvery event has a cause and a detailed explanation. A very interesting one, too.\nLike in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the story is uncovered through the collection of notes and pages from diaries.\nThere are also certain heartbreaking twists in both games, possibly the reason of my massive attraction.\n\nAtmosphereReminds Amnesia, but placed at a more recent time, with more real problems at hand.\nInstead of a lantern you have a flashlight, a glow stick and flares. The flashlight also requires batteries to work. Instead of darkness and ancient spirits, you have scientific research facilities and deadly viruses. In the first game you are also able to hold and use several weapons.\n\nScaresNo jumpscares, only enemy AI. In the first game this is mostly undead dogs, and in the second game - something yet more interesting. The chase can mostly be avoided if one's good with stealth. Not always, however.\nThe game is quite scary, but it mostly comes from the atmosphere.\n\nGameplayWell-done. No casualizing, there's full item interactions, descriptions; flashlight batteries are present. The gameplay is understandable and simple, while keeping the game challenging.\nIn many ways it reminds Amnesia: The Dark Descent, except for the lack of sanity bar.\n\nConclusionA good choice for anyone interested in a good exciting story, engaging atmosphere.\nFor those who like scary spooky games - it's yours as well.\nHowever, if you are not interested in reading notes and absorbing the story throughout the game - you might as well enjoy something different.","January 12","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not a criticism; just know that if you are coming hot off of Amnesia there will be some steps backward.\n\nHaving gotten rid of the ability to fight back in Overture, Frictional Games makes a much more frightening game in Black Plague. The enemies you encounter in Black Plague are gross-looking, cannot be killed, and sometimes carry light sources to see you in the dark. Unfortunately, they are also dumb as rocks and there are plenty of objects you can jump on top of, safely out of reach, and look around to solve your predicament. At one point, I managed to glitch a mattress in a doorway to keep a monster out of the room I was in.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, there are plenty of moments that made me jump or feel uncomfortable and the plot balances "scary heeby-jeebies" with actual plot development, letting the horror set in by implications of the happenings around you rather than the monsters you find haunting you.\n\nOverall, Black Plague is a vast improvement over Overture and from a design perspective, it's interesting to see how Frictional Games went from that game on to their more popular game, Amnesia. If you like Overture, Black Plague is better. If you like Amnesia, give the Penumbra series a shot (and check out the fan-made Penumbra mods for Amnesia; they take place after the official Penumbra games).","January 30","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played Amnesia before, I believe this game feels fundamentally very similar, such as a parallel game (gameplay and mechanics are exactly the same) and at the same time very different (story, context and purpose).\n\nIn this game there is an immediate sense of danger, there is no way to avoid enemies other than outsmart them, thinking fast and finding a solution right when they suddenly appear before you (while scarying the crap out of you). Also, you are CONSTANTLY solving puzzles. There is no way you can progress without solving a puzzle in the current room, every section of the game is a maze and requires going to point A to get item X to go back and open door B. and while you are going back the monsters come in.\n\nThe story is where this game falls short. The motivation of this game is finding out what happened to the character's father, it is unknown if he is still alive. While you are at that, you get infected by an intelligent virus that talks to you (annoys you mostly) and can blurry your vision, confuse you, etc. That virus character is so annoying that made me really hate him and wish it was quickly over. Also, from Penumbra Overture I was expecting a different explanation to the existance of all those monsters, and it turned out to be a very different thing.\n\nStill, for horror game fans, it is an interesting experience, not superior to Amnesia, but fun nonetheless.","January 2","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll try to keep this short.\n\nI'll start off by saying that, on the technical side, the game is pretty darn good. The engine itself (as evidenced by its use in more recent games by Frictional) holds up very well to this day. Black Plague was released in 2008, so it's not incredibly old, but, in an age where I have to check whether or not entirely new games will actually run on my specific combination of hardware, I haven't had any trouble in the slightest getting the game to run. No crashes, no graphics issues, no slowdowns, nothing like that at all. The only problem that I have with it in that regard is that you can't change the FOV, but that's set just high enough for it to not be a problem for me, at least.\n\nA lot of the game revolves around physics-based puzzles and they've definitely put enough effort in to make sure that the physics engine works as perfectly as it should do. Objects feel like they weigh as much as they should, moving objects around isn't a chore and the game knows when you want to put an item in a specific place and locks it there without any hastle or feeling like it's doing your work for you.\n\nOn the subject of puzzles, for the most part, they work well enough. The solutions are invariably completely intuative (no, you're not going to tie a balloon to a banana and feed it to a monster to get that computer running, you're going to find working drives and format them), and, on the off chance that the answer is simplified a little so that it doesn't get in the way of the game mechanics, it still makes perfect sense and there's a way to find out how to do it. As someone who frequently gets frustrated with adventure/puzzle games and has to turn the Internet off so that I don't cave and look up the answers (i.e. an idiot), I figured everything out for myself pretty quickly, save for one puzzle near the beginning which made sense in retrospect. The only problem I have with the puzzles is that many require finding multiple specific items, and, without fail, every one of them will be hidden behind a couple of other physics objects that are stacked in an odd and very conspicuous way.\n\nNow, unfortunately, there are two very big issues that I had with the game that, while they weren't quite enough to stop me from playing, they are bad enough to me that I wouldn't personally recommend the game. The first is the story: the story of Penumbra: Overture, while not groundbreaking, was at least intriguing and subtle enough that it kept me very invested through the whole game. In Black Plague, that subtlety goes right out of the window from the beginning when it gives you a very clear and safe view of the new monster, then, sometime later, the player character develops an internal voice in his head whose main purpose seems to be to explain every plot point several times over in case you didn't pick up the hints. There were several times when I read something interesting in a note and got as far as thinking "I wonder if that means-", then he'd immediately chime in and say that that's exactly what it means, please don't try to work it out for yourself. It honestly feels like Frictional realised that they could afford voice actors for this one and just decided to throw in literally anything that they could think for them to say, no matter how dumb or obvious, on top of the quality of the voice acting giving Bethesda a run for its money. I also counted four times in the first hour or so where the player character had the exact same realisation about himself. Add in how, for some reason, they decided to throw in an almost constant barrage of downright embarrassing attempts at humour (seriously, one computer asked if I was sure that I wanted to do something, then if I was really sure, then if I was really really sure...) and I got to the point where I just couldn't consider this a horror game anymore.\n\nOn that note, my other problem with it is that it really doesn't feel like a horror game in almost any respect. It's very dark (lighting-wise), yes, but... that's really it. It doesn't take long to realise that you're in almost no danger whatsoever. I think that I came across four things in the entire game that were able to hurt me, disregarding an obvious tripwire "puzzle", and the very few enemies that you do encounter can be outrun, avoided, sneaked around and generally outsmarted with no effort at all. I appreciate the rudimentary stealth mechanics as a massive fan of the Thief series, but the enemies in Black Plague are exactly as intelligent as the dogs in Penumbra: Overture, which is to say not too bright.\n\nIn conclusion, I suppose that, if you just want puzzles and can appreciate something of an adventure/puzzle game in first person (some mechanics actually brought back memories of classic point-and-click games, but much better-polished), and can also tune out the excuse plot for those to exist, then I can definitely recommend the game because I enjoyed those parts a decent amount. If you're looking for a compelling horror experience, then, as far as I'm concerned, you're probably not going to find it here, although I've met people with a completely different opinion to mine. I'll also note that it's pretty short; it took me slightly over six hours to finish, but you get the entire Penumbra series for £7 at full price, so that's absolutely more than fair for that length.","November 29, 2015","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A couple of the puzzles felt tedious to me, particularly towards the end.  I didn't find the story to be particularly profound, though.\n\nEven more dissapointingly, I had hoped more than anything that the game would build on the immersive, horrific atmosphere of the first episode, and genuinely creep me out even more, in the same way that SOMA did.  I found that the game fell well short of this.  Maybe it was Penumbra saturation, but this episode hardly felt like a horror game at all.  For 2008 tech, the world and graphics are spectacular and hold up well, but it felt like a video game and not the horrifying universe I wanted to wade into for a few hours.\n\nFricitional -- as ever -- gets my strongest recommendation for a fun, thoughtful game that emphasizes story, atmosphere, and puzzles above shooting guns for 5 hours.","January 10","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Okay, it's not, but it's really annoying. Sure, Amnesia may have been a more polished experience (albeit with a convoluted story), but Black Plague introduced literally every noteworthy game mechanic that people think Amnesia invented. I also liked the story and characters better. I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds. Some of the physics puzzles may get you stuck, but it's nothing a walkthrough won't help. If you liked Amnesia at all, then you'd at least like Black Plague.","May 29, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The captivating nature and excellent production values of Penumbra: Overture are present in full in this sequel, and the story is brought to an interesting conclusion. I did find it less satisfying than Overture though, owing primarily to two flaws. First, the problem with the enemies has worsened, in that they are rather unchallenging and in fact I found it very difficult to take them seriously at all, certainly not as much as the plot tried to sell them. Second, there is a noticeable shift away from horror and more towards rather lacklustre sci-fi, and the darkness of the theme is broken by comedic elements owing to a certain, shall we say, character that accompanies the player throughout most of the game.","May 2","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Several of the wonky game-mechanics of it's predecessor, chiefly unweildy melee combat, have been scrubbed.\n\nThe story, progressing ever onward, is well written from beginning to end. For a game like this, with low production values and a small dev. team, to weave such an interesting story is quite the accomplishment. It even has an ending which noticeably stirs the subtle messages earlier in the game.\n\nA genuinely eerie game, though incredibly satisfying to progress in, figure out, and ultimately beat, Black Plague is a great game, through and through, and should definitely be tried out at the very least.\n\nUnless you don't have what it takes? Can you play Penumbra end to end without fiddling with your gamma? Muting your sound? Reading through walk-throughs? I highly suggest avoiding the aforementioned. To do so would be to defeat the purpose of the game, and really take from the enjoyment of it all.","July 17, 2012","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not a criticism; just know that if you are coming hot off of Amnesia there will be some steps backward.\n\nHaving gotten rid of the ability to fight back in Overture, Frictional Games makes a much more frightening game in Black Plague. The enemies you encounter in Black Plague are gross-looking, cannot be killed, and sometimes carry light sources to see you in the dark. Unfortunately, they are also dumb as rocks and there are plenty of objects you can jump on top of, safely out of reach, and look around to solve your predicament. At one point, I managed to glitch a mattress in a doorway to keep a monster out of the room I was in.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, there are plenty of moments that made me jump or feel uncomfortable and the plot balances "scary heeby-jeebies" with actual plot development, letting the horror set in by implications of the happenings around you rather than the monsters you find haunting you.\n\nOverall, Black Plague is a vast improvement over Overture and from a design perspective, it's interesting to see how Frictional Games went from that game on to their more popular game, Amnesia. If you like Overture, Black Plague is better. If you like Amnesia, give the Penumbra series a shot (and check out the fan-made Penumbra mods for Amnesia; they take place after the official Penumbra games).","January 30","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The captivating nature and excellent production values of Penumbra: Overture are present in full in this sequel, and the story is brought to an interesting conclusion. I did find it less satisfying than Overture though, owing primarily to two flaws. First, the problem with the enemies has worsened, in that they are rather unchallenging and in fact I found it very difficult to take them seriously at all, certainly not as much as the plot tried to sell them. Second, there is a noticeable shift away from horror and more towards rather lacklustre sci-fi, and the darkness of the theme is broken by comedic elements owing to a certain, shall we say, character that accompanies the player throughout most of the game.","May 2","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But before you buy, there are a lot of puzzles to solve in this game. These puzzles are very tricky, so if you don't like puzzles then at least watch gameplay before you buy. This is my favorite horror game on steam so far. I like it a little bit more than Amnesia.","June 4","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And monsters.... yeah.","June 6","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
