So (at least when i played) i logged in, walked a little and got ganked.  Logged in again ran away real fast, then found a dungeon got a couple things, died, ported back to start area, where i got ganked again losing my stuff i just found.\nThat aside...\nI was in the starting area looking at the very very dark world holding my staff, and the frame rate is so low that i thought the staff that everyone wields was a melee weapon.  After a while it started shooting the firebolt everyone has.\nThe graphics are not terrible, but they're not good, the gameplay is quite bad, the framerate is terrible, the areas are very small.\nIt's just not good.\nIf this was early access it would be worth 50 cents, but as a final version.. save yourself the disk space.","April 30","false","0.2"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","54","61","0","0"

They’ve essentially taken damn near every game they’ve ever made and tossed it onto a blender and hit $*&%##& frappe. FPS and crafting elements from Deadly Profits and Forsaken uprising. Dungeon crawl from Deadly Profits, and creature assets from damn near every game they’ve had yet all thrown together in an amalgamation of…. Something.\n\nThe area design IS new for Digital Homicide and it ALMOST looks like they put some actual (*#^#&*^# effort into the game. However, the new pretty veneer only lasted for so long and I very quickly found myself getting bored due to the lack of different levels and a very limited area to work in, as well as creatures that I’ve seen from most of their other games recycled yet again still showing Digital Homicide’s customary laziness around every single corner. However at the same time, this one really DOES appear to be different. One thing is, the damn thing WORKS! In their previous games, the crafting systems were broken messes that were barely functional at all and made me want to put my own face through the nearest pane of glass in the vain hopes that a shard would pierce my jugular and I would be allowed to bleed out in peace, never having to see or touch one of their games again. However here, it’s perfectly functional, with no encountered glitches as yet."\n\nI can't recommend this game. Not because of the quality of the game, but because of the quality of the team behind the game. Double-dealing and dirty business practices, these are the same people that have no issue reskinning games and reselling them to you as a completely new product. Until they change their ways, they do not deserve your time or your money.\n\nSee my full review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/fPtPEJKOM9Y","April 29","false","0.6"," 74 of 96 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","74","96","13","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mellow_Online1/recommended/407730/","Mellow_Online1","Mellow_Online1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mellow_Online1/","195 products in account","Yes, I originally put up a positive review for this game but, a couple of things have happened since I put up that review. It was recently brought to my attention that this game is a rip off of a game that's currently on Steam called "Counter Spell." Another reason that has made me change this review is the fact that I've found more and more issues crop up throughout the game, which is stuff that should have been fixed before the release. I understand that you guys have lawsuits that you want to pay attention to, but you're not the ones being forced to follow the lawsuits plans, you can control them because you're the ones who's placing them. That means you could have easily mde more time to fix some of the issues that have cropped up in this game, within my extra hour of playtime. I know that Digital Homicide know about these issues because they were in the same server I was in, when I was complaining about these issues. It actually hurts to put this up because I really wanted to like this game. Digital Homicide has made turd after turd and this one was actually half decent and I originally rated this a 6/10 but the rating has dropped down because of the rip off and problems which I will call out now.\n\nThe inventory screen, doesn't work half the time. The reason that I didn't bring this up in my original review was because I thought it was an issue that I was encountering because most people in the servers I was in were fine and weren't encountering any issues. But, as I looked at the reviews, I found out that I wasn't the only one encountering this issue. DH knew that this issue was apparent, because I told them I couldn't open my inventory and they've barely done anything, even when more people have complained about it.\n\nThe main problem it seems to suffer from which I discovered in the extra hour of playtime I put in was that this game doesn't seem to know if it wants to be an MMO or a single player game. It's basically a single player game and you see other players running around every once in a while. You can kill each other, I'll give them that, that's already a step up from Forsaken Uprising but the aspects that they put into the game don't really scream MMO material. The enemies that you see in world are only enemies you can see. The other players can't see these enemies that you can see, they see their own version of it. They won't see the enemies attack you or anything.\n\nThe gameplay also gets really tedious and boring the more you play so it doesn't have much lasting appeal.\n\nSome of the servers sometimes randomly dissappear off of the server list aswell isn't that right "Arcatraz" still can't believe they spealt that wrong but hey, I always make errors in my review so I would be hypocritical if I were to criticize them for that, if I didn't admit that I do that as well.\n\nIs the game just ll bad? No. I can see some form of effort went into this and I applaud Digital Homcide for that as I've criticised their previous releases for putting little to no effort put into them. I know for a fact that an MMO is hard to do and I praised Forsaken Uprising for being an OK first attempt but as a game, it was bad. With Kragmor, you've taken some of the criticism from Forsaken and you've fixed SOME of the issues that plagued it.\n\nGraphics are bright and colourful and really appealing to look at. Enemies are even bright and colourful and fit in with this world. Like I said in the previous review of this that I put up, I do know that these are assets but these assets fit in well together, look at all these ssets and see wht they have in common:\n\nEvil mushroom: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/24559\nGoblin: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/58800\nWasp (in game it's called wasp but the asset says it's a bee): https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/25833\nFire demon: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/43668\nWolf: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26097\nDark Treant: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/34256\nLich Pack: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/30711\nOrc Slinger: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/36670\nWererat: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/33310\n\nThe similarity between all of these is that they're all by the same author.\n\nI still appreciate that this game tried to bring something new to the table, blending all sorts of different game genres into one and working relatively well (except for the MMO part.)\n\nI really wanted to like this game as it's better than other DH games but after this stuff has been brought forward o me, as well as getting an extra hour of play time, I can't recommend it and I'm also going to remove my curator recommendation. I'm sorry DH, you came really close to making something half decent, which is why I've gone a bit easier on them this time\n\nPros\n+ Colourful graphics\n+ Assets fit well\n+ Blends different genres together\n\nCons\n- Bugs\n- Controls sometimes unrepsonsive\n- Little to no lasting appeal\n- Can't decide if it wants to be multiplayer or single player\n\nFinal verdict: 4/10\n\nSteam Curator page: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 5","false","6.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

My experience with the frame rate has been consistantly near 40-60 fps.\n\nWhen you first start, there is unfortunately no tutorial yet, so you are kind of confused on what to do. This makes it hard to progres through the game as you have to ask around, look up information, or play by trial and error style. There are two control lists though: One is in the Esc menu when you bring it up, the other is in the Command List button that appears after booting up the game and the servers appear. Unfortunately, these control lists still lack some information on how to progress (Example: eating is right clicking a food item, which starts regenerating your health).\n\n\nCrafting:\nCrafting seems simple and basic at first due to you only having access to tier 1 items which give small amounts of health, defense, and intellect. However, once a tower is claimed and you construct a workshop, you gain access to higher tier items to craft (the same goes for two of the other rooms that you can build for your tower). The crafting system actually works like it is supposed to, every item you craft will be placed in your inventory and be fully operational immediately.\nThe gear you craft is essential to survival, as tougher mobs/experienced players in the game will punish you for not going in with the proper armor and weapons. Also, the better armor and health you have, the more health you regenerate. Currently, only two pieces of armor give any cosmetical change when equipped, and the staff you equip will also change its appearance based on what tier it is.\n\nTowers:\nThe towers function as temporary player homes, with large control stones out in front of each one. If there is a stream of light connecting it to the lantern, then you have to attack the stone until it is unclaimed before you can proceed to claim it, unless it is your tower. Currently, there are no tower defenses besides the beefy control stone.\nThe second purpose of the tower, is to acquire better equipment and items. When you own a tower, you can craft four rooms and each provide its own benefits. The bedroom provides a respawn point other than the safe area, the laboratory allows the crafting of health potions, and the workshop allows you to craft more powerful equipment. The kitchen is currently pointless right now, as it provides 1 additional food recipe that isn't that useful besides getting rid of a certain material needed. Towards the bottom of the tower is also a storage chest that comes free of charge, where you can safely put away your items and not worry about losing one of them from dying.\nIf your tower is unclaimed, you lose all of these rooms, so guard your tower carefully while you are on! Your storage chest will most likely be emptied by the player that unclaimed it, then stocked with his or her own items.\n\nPVP:\nPvp is a part of the game, something that was beaten into me the first time I played it. Skirmishes between low to no geared players are common, but many of the new players will typically leave the more heavily armored player alone, or the helpful players. You can group up with other players, but unfortunately friendly fire is still a thing right now, so you must be careful with aiming.\nUnfortunately at the moment (this will change depending on patches) Pvp between more powerful players is unheard of. There is either no more than one higher geared player on, or they don't bother even fighting because Damage and Defense iare still buggy and makes these higher geared players do chip damage to each other (this is likely to change).\n\n\nPVE (and the Dungeon):\nPve is rough at first, with other players that might interfere with your grinding, and being ungeared leads to a swift death at the hands of both players and mobs. However, these mobs on the outside become easier the more or better gear you have. The ungeared players will still most likely target you unless you have tier 2-3 gear, as you can still be vulnerable to a gank. Often times, PvE can be frustrating, as you have to rely on random drops from mobs and your area being empty of hostile players while you harvest. There are two types of mobs in the game: normal and elite. Elite variants of the mobs are larger, and characterized by a glowing red aura, more damage, and more health. Elites have a chance of dropping rare materials.\nThe Dungeon is the large center tower in the middle of the map, and you will frequently see new players die in there from the chat log. The Dungeon is meant to be difficult, as I only went in there AFTER I had a full tier 1 armor set equipped and even then I died a lot. The mobs in there usually have far more health than anything outside, and deal more damage (specifically, one rare mob that spawns)  which makes them tear apart the unprepared in seconds. For those wanting better gear, you have to go through it though. Only in the Dungeon can you find the rare materials you need to craft higher tier gear reliably, though be prepared to fight for it.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI honestly like this game (as you can probably tell by how many hours I've played), even though after its release it is still very buggy. However, the core mechanics still work, and Digital Homicide is very committed to making this game better, as shown by their forum posts/responses, and overall interactions (in game or email). While they may not have a good reputation, and you may not like any of there games, this is the one that you should support and give constructive feedback on. The game may have had an early ending to its Early Access, but that doesn't mean the game isn't being worked on as you can tell by the patches STILL BEING PUT OUT.\n\nMy recommendation: Give the game a shot, and try it for a while. If you get stuck, ask around, or check out the guide/forums for answers. Honestly, this game deserves your consideration, no matter how many people with less than an hour of game time say so in their reviews. I approached this game thinking I wouldn't have a fun time.\n\nI was mistaken, and I do not regret this purchase at all.","April 30","true","27.3"," 11 of 44 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","11","44","0","0"

I mean, it's not like it's expensive or anything.\nThere are some things that needs to be tuned and some things that needs to be implemented. Like a tutorial and a more clear goal.\nFor the time being you just run around killing mobs and try to get the materials needed for crafting. Which gives you a slight bonus in hp and etc. But it's quite unclear how much each item gives you in a bonus and how you find certain materials.\nThe game also needs to fix the pvp part in some way. The only feeling i got from playing was to not interact with unknown players, at all. Since a random guy might kill you which makes you drop a random material/item from your inventory. And that is irritating as ♥♥♥♥ if you are losing a rare material.\nI might try this game later on and if i feel like it improved i will change my review.","May 2","true","1.2"," 2 of 27 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","2","27","0","0"

I've only played half an hour and I enjoyed it. The graphics are nice, there seems to be lots to explore and a lot of enemies, such as the one-eyed wizard or the were-rat. Although some enemies do not have death animations, it is satisfying to see them fall slowly through the floor, like in an old school game where the bosses would explode and fall down slowly. Digital Homicide does not have the greatest reputation, but this game can become something really fun to play if they keep working on it. I just hope that AllShamNoWow doesn't be too hard on the game.\n\nSo in the end, It's aight and I recommend it!","January 29","true","0.5"," 71 of 286 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","71","286","4","9"

If you continue around the entrance's in a circle you will see other long walk ways which lead to safe zones, if you continue down the smaller paths you will end up going down a  deadend path  with a tower at the end of it. These towers are player owned houses which are contested and can be attacked and claimed. The towers also unlock another portion of the game which allow you to build crafting stations to advance into tier 2 items.\n\nThe game itself has a great concept it just needs more of what it already has.\n\nThe graphics are nice it all looks well polished and the dark graphics are easy on the eyes.\n\nThe game is a grindfest but if you're like myself and have 2000+ hours on diablo 3 you fit in perfect.\n\nIt's a easy game to run so lower end systems shouldn't have a problem however FPS randomly drops for a few seconds when phasing into a new zone.\n\nThe user interface is simple and not to confusing I would like to see health numbers and damage numbers added in the future.\n\nThe dept of game is very shallow at the moment but it is also very early in the development I see it having a lot of potential and Digital homicide hit the nail on the head with this release.\n\nAll in all I give the game a 8/10 only because I crafted end tier items with only 6 hours of play time. With all that being said I see the game worth the  $10 people have been complaining about  there is more then $10 in development here.","February 1","true","30.5"," 39 of 216 people (18%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","18","39","216","4","1"
