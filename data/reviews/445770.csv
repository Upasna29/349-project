"http://steamcommunity.com/id/u2numb/recommended/445770/","u2numb","U2NUMB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/u2numb/","1432 products in account","Alright after a couple of hours I feel I can place some of my thoughts here along with some things that need to be added or fixed.\n\nFirst off the game is very similar to the previous Airport Madness games but with the aspect of real 3D geometry. Overall it is a fun game with the same goals and feel of the previous game but it certainly could use some fixes. Below are some missing or questions I have for the game. I am however 100% suggesting you buy this game if interested because it is unique and fun.\n\n1) Would love a distance to airport added above each plane.\n2) Visuals of the ground need a serious upgrade. This game could look amazing with this part updated.\n3) Some bugs / glitches are there like plane icons getting stuck floating. I am sure this will be fixed.\n4) No esc option in game? At least my system would not pause or anything while hitting this key.\n5) Would love a free cam option.\n6) Clicking planes can often be a problem when they are stacked up. Not sure what the solution is but at certain angles you can click the wrong plane and give orders.\n7) Highest overall quality asset is the fake twitter images that pop up.\n8) Speaking of the fake twitter, it is often totally wrong. People complaining about delays when the airport is running as smooth as possible. This part annoys me because it if was accurate it could be a cool addition. As it stands now it seems to just be the same thing over and over no matter what is happening on screen.\n9) The game does take a while to nail down the best view for your playstyle. Not really a knock on the game but an FYI, do not give up if you do not like the controls or view. Adjust in the settings.\n10) Would love an overall passengers moved stat. Planes moved is nice but lets go a step deeper.\n11) Stress meeter? Not sure what this means as I was flying along moving planes like an ace with no stress and it just kept growing.\n12) Obviously more content. Only 4 airports at launch and I know more are promised but it is info that people need to know.\n\nOverall the game is still super unique and fun and I will easily get my value out of it but there is a TON of potential that I hope we see in a future release.","May 25","true","12.5"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","53","59","0","7"

They are probably right. I've poured hundreds of hours into this franchise from the PC browser days, to the mobile apps, to the standalone PC versions, and on to repurchasing and clocking hours on the other 4 titles here on Steam. The developer himself is an air traffic controller, and I've probably dealt with more digital aircraft than he's handled real planes. (Although he has a much better safety record than I do!).. So I openly admit that even as a 33 year old man, I giggled like a strange psychotic Schoolgirl when this game was announced.\n\nSo was I right to have an outburst that would have landed me in a padded cell? Oh yes I was!! Only one PC game could stop me playing Stellaris in my free time this year and Airport Madness looks like it will have done the job perfectly.. I know, I'm a filthy casual.. and a proud one at that!\n\nSo firstly, I would advise that you search for other 2 dimensional Airport Madness games on Steam and then also play this one too. Because Airport Madness 3D is not a simulation. It is a casual, fun, addictive Air Traffic Control game.. It causes my wife to ring the police and send out search parties every time I play it. That's how hooked you can become on these games.\n\nAnyway.. Airport Madness 3D goes to an additional dimension, and unlike other gaming franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and a few others games that have made a transition from 2D to 3D.. this game is actually suceeds the giant leap and becomes all the better for it. The game is more difficult than before and a little slower paced in some respects. But the challenge it brings adds a new appeal to the game.\n\nThe single greatest feature for me though is to finally have the viewpoint of sitting in an ATC tower. The need to keep an eye on the ground and air radar, to search the skies for incoming aircraft to avoid collisions and judge when to push outgoing traffic is something I have been longing for. So if you do wish for an ounce of simulation somewhere in this game, that is where you'll find it. There are also sky, runway and cockpit cams. But these aren't nearly as fun as being lord of all you survey.\n\nGood news is, if you are looking for a friendly developer who adds plenty of free content, bug squishes like he actually knows what he's doing and listens to his fanbase and community, you will find him here. So many developers neglect this basic requirement in aftersales, even if we are all rabid wolves who have tasted developer blood, and often look for more... No bloodthirst required here.\n\nThis review probably isn't helpful.. If it has been then great. I love this game, as I do it's predocessors. No I do not know the dev personally, I just apprieciate the time he finds to do this in real life, then come home and surround himself in his work until he sleeps. Not many people can do that, and it's certainly admirable. Airport Madness is the perfect mix of the real life and arcade style fun. Best of all, you will not fall asleep playing this like real ATC agents who get fired and then battered in the news like some pinata.\n\nSo if you have an interest in these types of games, aviation, or like me never knew something that seems so boring as a job could actually be so much fun, then buy this game already!","May 26","true","9.0"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","30","34","10","3"

Your job as an air traffic controller in this game is NOT to direct ALL aircraft safely to the ground, but to strategitically line aircraft up so that they crash into each other at a desired (and hopefully minimum) pace. That appears to be the only sensible way to handle the insane traffic volume with the limited options you have. Even that is hard to do though, because pilots may disregard your last-minute "go around" command, so occasionally you end up killing more people than needed. But again, safety is not the whole point, all you can do is to accept that crashes are the only natural forces that keep the airport running, and to make difficult decisions about which planes to sacrifice. I hope I'm making it very clear.\n\n10/10 would crash again.","May 27","true","0.7"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","79","23","29","37","0"

Airport Madness 3D could not be missing in the collection so i was fortunate to get the game as a birthday present.\n\nIf you have played previous versions of Airport Madness, the game play won't be that different. You need to click slightly below the airplane to get the menu and in my experiance the sky cam view is the best way to play. Tower view is my second choice.\n\nAlthough the game is not yet bug-free, i can't think of a big negative (yet). The positive is future airport additions  and of course the possible addition of the workshop. Looking forward of spending more time in the game.\n\nMy advise for the developers would be to add aircraft types in the label and to give players more choices in runway combinations (if you have multiple runways).\n\nAirport Madness 3D has so much future posibilities, the sky is almost the limit. ;)\n\n...but then again, i'm biased.","May 29","true","12.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

If you are expecting in-depth commands or realistic traffic, you are out of luck.  However, if you\'re in the mood to push some tin around at nicely rendered airports, with some really charming, relaxing music kicking in the background, and the constant whine of airliners taxiing to and fro, this is a must.\n\nI love ATC sims.  I still put hours into the professional ones with voice commands and SIDS/STARS/RNAVs, MVAs, all that jazz, but this is great for just kicking back and relaxing, while still requiring the same sort of space/time management you get from the pro stuff.\n\nA steal.","June 1","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is not super realistic and you are allowed to brake many ATC rules.  That being said, it is really fun and the best "out of the box" simulator I have played.  I enjoy that you can cruze in from the pilot's perspective and still issue tower commands.  I also like the games intensity.  Want more maps like the non-3D version.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of doing the 'ground control' as no day shift tower control does both.  Also wish the controls were a bit smoother (always clicking top left is annoying).  Instead of "slow down", perhaps warn of "company traffic, crossing or ahead".\n\nWell worth the money, love the game, love pushing tin beyond what is actually allowed.\n\nGet it!","June 1","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I want to say something about it.  First off, the graphics are not AMAZING.  The gameplay is not AMAZING.  The game has problems, but the Developer is here to address and fix the issues if they hinder the problem.  So when you see people yell, "YOU CLICKY ON THINGS AND CLICKY CLICKY DONT WORK!"  Just realize a majority of that has been fixed.\n\nSo my gameplay experience.  I run a youtube channel where we mostly drink beers and play games that look like fun and this game looked like a blast for somebody to play and the rest comment on.  What we found was a fun little game that is not what we expected.\n\nFirst off, we did the continuous challenge which let's a ATC person control planes coming in, taking off, and where they need to go to unload passengers etc.  We had a guy who is a student pilot play the game while I mocked and made fun of him for his poor choices which ended up with multiple planes blowing up.  Obviously planes blowing up is not funny, but the game gives a light hearted feel to when you mess up and the explosion are fun if you have an audience judging your ability.\n\nSo where does the game lack?  I want to say that I enjoy the game, and we had a blast playing it.  I do feel that the $15 price tag may be a bit high, but after showing it to airplane enthusiasts, they said that price was well worth the admission.  So as a gamer, price is high.  If you enjoy simulators that have fun, price is right.  Second is the graphics.  The game isn't realistic, but it also doesn't claim to be.  So if you have a problem with the graphics, let's wait and see if the sequel makes it more awesome.\n\nAll in all, I feel this game is a fun little airport game.  Thing I hate the most?  Is I'm calling friends over asking if they want to try it while i drink beer and criticize them!  lol.  If you enjoy this type of thing, i strongly recommend you buy it.  If you are curious, wait for a sale, and try it out.  I promise you will have fun with it.\n\nRyan","June 1","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you really want this game, go buy it from the app store instead of on steam for the obscene $15 price tag.","May 30","false","0.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","1"

This is so arcade that every serious wanna-be flight controller will hate it.\nThe controls could be better. Graphics simple but do the job.\n\nI will wait and see if the dev pushes an update and revise my review.\n","May 25","false","5.7"," 32 of 72 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","32","72","3","4"

Cool Airplane models!   :)\n\nCons: The environment could use a better 3D engine...\nBut, not that I'm worried too much about that. Maybe for "AirportM-8"\n\nCheers!!!","May 28","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
