Bought it in the Groupees $0.50 bundle. Don't buy it.\n\n2/10 For having a barely working physics engine with atleast a competent amount of blast control.\n\nIf you're so desperate to see it just check out Nerdcubed's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4zE3FuJy1A","May 15","false","0.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

This game is NOT worth your money. Hell, I wouldn't install it if it were free. Most MOBILE games are better than this. The game looks like it was created in 30 minutes. And whoever programmed the controls was probably drunk. Refunded and uninstalled,","May 1","false","0.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"
