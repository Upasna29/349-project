It's a fun and solid system and you may soon try to block "frame perfect" in the vain hope it will mitigate more damage :p or you will die miserably for it was obvious this 5th strike in a row was dumb.\nYou'll have to master the odds in a game of dice for you'll need tons of money to buy keys, health potions, repair your so fragile stuff, cure poison, sharpen a blade, ID artefacts way too high level for you but rejoice! The smith can "standardize" it (remove the level restriction) for a mere 30 gold coins, less than a night at the inn! That's one of the only "gift" in an otherwise harsh and tight economy.\nYou'll have to take lots of risks. The boss is down, should you delve deeper straight away for an XP boost or should you take the chance to go back to town as it's the only moment it's free of charge? On the brink of death, do you tail back in the middle of a floor with XP loss or do you pick up that probably trapped healing basket? Yeah, you should have trekked back...\nYou'll have to die, over an over, for there's no tutorial and the game is mean and nasty. But like in the best rogue-likes where exploration and experimentation are key, it wraps up in the long run and I dare say Verlies really shines, carrying the torch of classics with strength.\nYou'll probably have to specialize. There's not so many level ups and there's a lot of skills, actives and passives. Classics like shield bashing or alchemy for instance, and not so classic ones, like a heal paid by XP or an instant kill spell that eats up your total mana pool.\nFloors layout, monster population, loot and traps are all randomly (procedurally?) generated. Level tone and design change every 3 floors and while there's no lush vistas nor DX12 features, the comic-style graphics are lovely (though I miss the naked blacksmith from the first opus^^)! Sound is good, atmospheric and creepy, or dumb and funny like that cash register trading sound.\n\nSo, this review's a mess... I hope it stills shows of much I enjoy this love letter to the genre!\nI cannot recommend it enough. Two blue thumbs up out of a puddle of blood.\nN'cha!","September 30, 2015","true","41.5"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","52","65","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnvondraugr/recommended/371220/","johnvondraugr","johndraugr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnvondraugr/","249 products in account","Just requested a REFUND. The dev seriously needs to re-think how certain aspects of the game should work.\n\nAs for being a difficult game, I can live with that, ♥♥♥♥♥ I grew up playing Wizardry I on the Apple IIe and then the PC, talk about unforgiving and difficult? I beat that game multiple times and it was very difficult compared to today’s games.\n\nThe problem with Verlies II is NOT it's gameplay difficulty, but the ridiculous and annoying controls, plus highly illogical rules that limit the player. Let me explain.\n\n1. Using the 'F' key to move forward instead of the standard 'W' key as in most games, you know the WASD control.\n\nWhen you are in the dungeon, you face one of four possible directions just like in most other games of this type, yet to move forward you HAVE to focus your cursor over the opening and then press F and not W, that is ridiculous! Now, saying that... IF the opening in front of the hero had something like a shut, or locked door, then placing the cursor over it, and pressing 'F' to unlock (if you have a key), or to turn the knob to open a door would be understandable, but so far in the time I played, all the openings are simple black passages to simulate the darkness leading into the next chamber. Since the openings are unobstructed and as easy as walking from one room in your house to the next via an arch or opening, a simple press of the 'W' key to move forward would suffice. Also, if perhaps a single direction had more than a single exit, or path/door then placing the cursor over the proper door, or opening you wish to exit through makes sense, but in all the time I've played I've only seen a single opening/path in any one direction. Again a simple press of 'W' would suffice.\n\n2. Exiting the Dungeon\n\nWhen you enter the dungeon, you CAN NOT simply turn around and exit, even though when you do turn around, you see the cavern exit and the forest (trees, grass, etc..) on the other side of the exit. Essentially, there is nothing to keep you from simply turning around and walking out, especially if you've wandered around a bit and took a beating and need to get back to town for supplies or to heal. When you try to leave you get some BS excuse that you have too much pride to leave the dungeon. COME ON! If you are really set on such a ridiculous rule (not allowing the hero to exit via the opening they just entered from, use a little imagination and get creative. For example... "You enter the dungeon and look about the first chamber. As you are examining the chamber you hear a deep, rumble... the room begins to shake and then a loud crash... then darkness! You spin around to see the entrance to the dungeon/cave has caved in and there is no amount of digging that would allow you to leave this place from whence you came! Tis up to thee hero to find another means of escaping this dunjon!" Wala, instant logical explanation and more realistic method for keeping a player from leaving the dunjon whenever he, or she wishes to.\n\n3. No control customization!\n\nHow many games have you played where they use a modified WASD control scheme where Q and E actually turn you left, or right? Well, in this game, the 'E' key = drink a health potion. Do you know how many times I've been in the dunjon and tried to turn and my sub-conscious simply hit the 'E' key because two of the other games I play use the 'E' key to turn right? Well, it's safe to say I've wasted countless potions by accidentally hitting E instead of D to turn right. This can be simply remedied by allowing the user to customize their movement and function keys.\n\nThere are a few other issues that irk me... Here is one more...\n\n4. Using a shield to block.\n\nThis game's combat is not turn based, but real time. The monster moves from left to right, and vice versa all the time you must position your cursor over the creature before swinging your weapon or you'll end up missing the target. Combat is really a timing game because you need to see how many strikes you can get in before you must press the other mouse button to raise your shield and defend the monster's attack. This so far is fine and can be quite enjoyable, but there is a problem in that even using the shield properly doesn't negate the damage taken by the monsters attack. It may lessen it, but if you are low on health, have no more health potions, and a simple hit or two is going to kill you, then you might as well restart because there is NOTHING you can do to survive the next encounter, and you aren;t going to move more than a room or two before that next encounter happens. Remember as per issue #2 above, you also can't turn around and head back to town and rest, heal, or stock up on supplies, so once you are in the situation just mentioned, your game is OVER even though you aren't quite dead yet. The next fight and a single hit or two regardless of whether blocked or not, ends up killing you. A better way to have implemented the shield would be one of the following...\n\nA) Have the monsters movement and strike timing alternate between 1 or 2 speeds during a battle, so you can't simply get used to a creatures timing and then strike/block without danger of harm. With this method, you can have a shield block all damage from a strike that is successfully blocked with the shield. The slight randomness to a monster's attack pattern can trip up a player who may miss a block with the shield and thus the monster makes a hit that realistically kills the hero. That would be acceptable.\n\nB) Have the shield only able to block a certain amount of strikes before the hero MUST repair it himself in the dunjon, or purchase a replacement shield to replace the now broken one. For this to work, the dev needs to either a) allow the hero to repair a shield with materials found in the dungeon, or b) Allow the hero the option of exiting the dunjon when he needs to go to town to have the smith repair or sell the hero a new shield.\n\n\nWell, there are a few other things not worth mentioning because they will make this already long review even worse. I have requested a REFUND and will not purchase this game until some changes are made. I only hope the dev listens to this review and similar complaints in the forums and makes the right choices. I know I would have no problem returning to Verlies II, if these issues are remedied. As it is i would NOT recommend this game to anyone.","October 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 164 of 259 people (63%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","63","164","259","14","2"

If you make any mistake, it's almost a certain death! Having a good build is also very important, so keep it in mind when leveling up and choose the right skills.\n\nThis game is very challenging: if you die, it's over, you lose all your gold, XP, skills and items, and you'll have to start over again, in a new randomly generated dungeon. Also, there are some puzzles that you must solve to progress further in the dungeon.\n\nIf you like challenging games, VERLIES II is very recommended!\n\n\n\nReview em Português\n\nVERLIES II é um dungeon crawler hardcore com um estilo artístico bem interessante e um sistema de combate viciante.\n\nVocê deve atacar, defender, usar habilidades e poções no momento certo, já que cada inimigo tem seu próprio tempo de ataque, e dominar isto é muito importante para sobreviver. Se você cometer algum erro, será uma morte quase certa! Ter uma boa "build" também é muito importante, lembre-se disso ao escolher as skills corretas quando você subir de nível.\n\nEste jogo é muito desafiador: se você morrer, já era, você perde todo o seu ouro, XP, habilidades e itens, e você vai ter que começar tudo de novo, em uma nova dungeon gerada aleatoriamente. Além disso, existem alguns quebra-cabeças que você deve resolver para avançar.\n\nSe você gosta de jogos desafiadores, VERLIES II é muito recomendado!","September 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","35","46","2","0"

By grindy I mean you have to grind the dice game in the Inn for money so you can buy better gear and lots of health potions.  There's no skill to that.  If you were to purely rely on what the game gives you by chance you would have none to survive.  There's seems to be very little skill involved in battles as well.  Every so often an enemy attacks at a certain increment of speed and you block it, in between the attacks you swing your sword.  If you decide you have to leave the dungeon for whatever means the game punishes you for leaving by costing you experience.  If you fall behind too far in experience you will be out scaled by the monsters in the dungeon.  After killing bosses on a dungeon floor you have to play an annoying pixel hunting minigame of find the gem or pickaxe or stone in a wall to continue.  This really adds nothing to the game besides nuisance.  The game literally shows you what room a gem is in and you will be moving your cursor around trying to find it even though it should be in plain view.  If you die the game doesn't take you to the main menu.  It literally restarts the game alt tabbing you to windows in the process.  I just can't recommend this to anyone at the moment.","October 3, 2015","false","2.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","1"

This means if your RNG happens to give you 4 monsters in a row, you will basically be forced into using all your hp pots right off the bat, or failing misreably because you can't beat even the first boss on level 1 without at least 2 pots.  Not to mention that traps are very common, and you can even activate 2 traps on the same item, which is bullcrap.   This game is a waste of 8 dollars and it's not even in good english, don't buy this.","October 29, 2015","false","1.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Each attempt was met with the same death, in the same room no matter how many different and "random" things happened in the dungeon. I'm sure there are people who get some enjoyment out of the difficulty of the game and the fact that it's pretty much based on your own personal luck stat.\nI feel like they could make some small changes/improvements and it would be a much better game.","October 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

I can tell you that this game is not for everyone, but for the few out there, it is worth a try. Verlies II reminds me of the old grid based dungeon crawlers of the past, in reminiscence of Dungeon Master and Might & Magic. I find the graphics to be gorgeous, even though they aren't pretty by todays standards.\nOne annoying part of the game, and yes, i have to mention it, is lack of any kind of tutorial. The opening of the dungeon, at least in my game, the first doorway looked like an open hole in the wall, but I couldn't traverse it. Only upon accidently scrolling my mouse over it did i realize i had to press the "F" key of the keyboard. An option for keybindings might help.\nAs I have only played roughly 13 minutes of the game, I didn't delve too heavily into all the options. I will be playing more in the future and will update this review as I go along. I am a huge fan of Indie games as well as mainstream. I had read many reviews on the game before purchasing it, and it d\saddens me to think that people put some much emphasis on how a game looks graphically, that they fail to see any kind of challenge. I love the tought, time and effort someone took to make this game. Thank you Koya Games for this gem, I enjoy it and I hope many others will too!","November 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

I like the art style a lot.\n\nThe translation of the dialogue and texts have funny little mistakes like "Donjon" for "Dungeon" etc. The game comes off as rather crude (developed by 1 guy)  but if you can look past that and enjoy the rogue-like and dungeon crawling genre this may very well be for you.\n\nYou'll primarily be managing your resources (potions etc), skills and items trying to complete the dungeons and beat the bosses.","September 25, 2015","true","0.5"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","11","28","3","0"

I stand by my opinion and think the game is too RNG. Even if you block every attack and maximize your damage, you can still get unlucky and only be able to get so far. This game needs a way to replay previous areas to farm gold, instead we get a dice game which is very slow and frustrating.\n\nI will edit this review if things change.

I rank this worst than Coldfire Keep. For $10 USD I didn't expect much, but I got less than that. Maybe this is one of those games that's meant to be played on mobile device. Here are the pros and cons as I see them:\n\nPROS:\n1) Nice graphics for still scenes\n2) Interface is pretty straight forward and intuitive\n\nCONS:\n1) Saving game.\na) quits the game and not back to main menu.\nb) If you die, and you will, you go to the main menu. If you choose Continue you go to the point where you died and go into an endless loop. Start a new game.\n\n2) If you get poisoned by a snake, unless you have a Cure Poison potion (50gp), you will die. You die because, even if you sell the two mana potions you start with you only get 30gp. If you get poisoned you CANNOT leave the dungeon to get cured back in town. Since you don't have a Cure Poison potion, YOU DIE!\n\n3) No resting or camping. No regeneration of health unless you find food. Good luck on finding potions as the dungeon is randomly generated, so the map changes in each game. If you get poisoned, YOU DIE!\n\n4) There is not enough money or junk to be gathered to afford buying/upgrading gear or a single Cure Poison potion. And, we know what happens if you get poisoned....\n\n5) Oh, but wait....find a chest or two that requires a key. Didn't loot anything that yielded a key? Maybe go back to town to buy one, but you can't because you can't leave the dungeon. Ok, move forward to the next room, and dammit another snake. CRAP, the character got poisoned! Guess what? That's right, YOU DIE!\n\nThis could have been a fun and interesting game, but the developer didn't seem to want to be bothered including a few features to allow the game to be interesting and challenging versus just ridiculous to the point of why should I spend anymore time on a unenjoyable $10 game.\n","October 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","9","25","3","0"
