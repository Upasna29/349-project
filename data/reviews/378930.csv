I made a video on it and told my subscribers, and the dev team everything i didn't like about this game. (which was alot) It had alot of problems that needed fixing. One of the people on the dev team commented on my video with some positive feedback.\n\n2 days later i see an update with all of the bad things i mentioned fixed. It is great to see team listen to their fans/supporters. Thankyou for making the game better!","February 13","true","1.7"," 76 of 91 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","76","91","5","0"

If it is -50% take it without a doubt.","February 13","true","1.5"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","36","46","2","0"

A guarantee that you will be sucked deep in to a game from first minutes of playing.\n\nGraphicly textures and models can compare with any good AA game, for indie game it's just flawless.\n\nGameplay offers decent variety of elements, crafting, puzzles, survival and adventure. Like you actually have to craft thingie to be able to save the game. I wont reveal much of in-game content, but Il say it is very very challenging.\n\nSound have great chilly/horror music that completely fulfill pleasure of enjoying game horrifying ambience.\nHOWEVER I find a big con at voice-acting, it is very amateurish made, like I did it with my 15eur mic, plus  voice cover is only on Portuguese, luckily there are eng subs and there isn't too much voice interaction, so it is going in to second plan and easily forgot when you continue playing game.\n\nOverall:\nWell we dont see many good horror games these days, so this may be the best we got after Layers of Fear, totaly recommended to all horror fans.\nPrice is fair for what this game have to offer, but I appeal developers to make english voice-over in upcoming updates.","February 11","true","5.3"," 45 of 77 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","45","77","7","0"

There is translations for most of them, but for some there are none and the English subtitles do have some errors.\n- Without a guide you can get lost and a bit confused on where or what to do next which can be upsetting because it does take a lot of time to sneak past all the demons to explore new areas.","April 21","true","1.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

This is by no means a cash grab game that is flooding steam recently. A very good game with the excellent unreal engine 4, good atmosphere, well made map, average AI.  The only problem I see is the lack of actual english voice acting as it is only portuguese with sub titles.\n\nWorth every penny. Do not pass on this!!!

Game uses UT4-engine and the graphics are really great, i'm not too deep into the game yet, but i do hope there are more elements to be found though.\n\nGameplay on it's own was pretty simple to pick up, go from place a to place b to pick up quests, complete the objective and return. On this personally i would've hoped some more sidequests and so on, since the areas are quite huge and i hope developer will put those into good use later on to provide more excitement.\n\nOnly two things which i've had some problems with. Firstly, it's kind of weird to start up the game and completing tasks when i have absolutely no idea on the backstory of this character (I hope it'll come up eventually)\n\nAnd secondly voiceacting. It might be that i'm not just customed to hear portuguese, but i can't feel charisma or any emotions on the voiceacting so it brings down the atmosphere a bit.\n\nAll in all, what i've seen so far, it's quite alright. Just have to get time to actually finish the game","February 13","true","2.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It succeeds in a few areas, while comically stumbling in others. For a first time, low budget, indie offering that could use a fair bit of refinement --it's not devoid of thrilling moments. I was surprised how it turned into a stealth based cat and mouse maze through dark crypts and mausoleums. Good lighting and visuals construct a thrilling atmosphere to dodge monsters in the night. It's flaws will be ignored by fans of creative indie horrors, and this one fits that bill.\n\nPROs- Good lighting, texture, and level design ... pretty good use of Unreal 4's visual prowess.\n- Tense cat and mouse gameplay, with some occassional jump scares.\n- Pedro (see review)\n\nCONs- Confusing moments, with little or no direction given.\n- Really bad animations\n- Campy scenes and awkward moments, monsters thwarted by a door.","February 29","true","11.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

But I was let down so very bad by what the game offers out of the gate. "Partial Controller Support"? Nowhere to be found. Push a button on my wired 360 controller, character jumps. Push any other button, nothing happens. So there is clearly no controller support here (false advertising?). I don't see any button mappings for controllers, and no way to edit the key bindings. So either I play with mouse and keyboard, or I make do with one button.\n\nScreen resolution is at a severe loss - game does not take into account that not everyone has a huge screen size. If I want to play at a resolution at anything close to my maximum resolution, I have to settle for black bars on the screen, which utterly kills the immersion one would expect from a game like this. Seems widescreens like mine don't get factored in. My top resolution is 1366x768, yet the only usable one is 1280x720 or 1024x768 - and those black bars. Oh, those black bars. The lack of widescreen support also kills the game for me.\n\nThe fact that I cannot launch the game before experiencing these problems leaves me wondering what else may be wrong with it - but I'm not willing to stick around and find out. I love horror games, even indie horror games, but this was a letdown out of the gate. Let's Play videos made this game look good, but unfortunately my first experiences (which have the biggest impact) were a huge letdown.\n\nI'm sorry, but I just cannot recommend this game. Save your money for better horror games out there.","March 24","false","0.6"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","7","22","0","1"

The biggest problem is that nothing is explained at all. I'm not sure if that's because I didn't play the first one or what. There were a few mediocre scares, but the game runied it by showing cut scenes of the monsters and there were to many of them to be scary. I only played for ~50 minutes but I saw around 10 individual monsters. It played like a knock-off Amnesia: Dark Descent.\nOh and ♥♥♥♥ those poisonous plant things, what a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. You'd be hiding in the bushes from a monster and then randomly die from the bushes.","February 11","false","0.7"," 46 of 145 people (32%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","32","46","145","7","35"
