After a day of work, I stepped back, looked at what we built, and came to some realizations.\n\n1) I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea whats going on in this factory\n2) Half the components that directly interact with each other aren't even near one another, one of the machines producing copper cable for another machine to assemble into circuit boards is halfway across the god damn refinery\n3) 90% of the conveyor belts are underground, and the rest are going so many directions this thing looks like a ball of yarn\n4) There is coal ♥♥♥♥ing EVERYWHERE\n5) I maintain enough sanity to count to 5\n6) Staring at this thing makes my eyes itch\n7) Looking away makes my brain itch\n\nThe scariest part is that it keeps getting bigger, and every time it gets bigger it somehow becomes MORE labrynthine. One of those ♥♥♥♥ing conveyor belts goes all the way around the entire factory to deliver steel plates to a single assembler thats making bloody gears, and its right next to the refinery itself!\n\nSometimes the factory breaks. We don't usually notice because of how much of a mess this thing is, and the breaks we do spot are often half an hour old and are a recurring problem. Rather than fix it, we simply unjam the machine and ignore it until it breaks again. The biggest problem to fixing it comes from our production lines. Normal production lines look like a grid. Ours looks like you threw a bunch of squares into a bowl of spaghetti noodles and gave the bowl to a five year old for a period of one to five minutes. This proccess results in either an empty bowl and a full five year old, a floor covered in noodles, or spaghetti all over the walls and ceiling with the squares nowhere to be found. Knowing the trend in increasing chaos and complexity the factory exhibits, probably all three.\n\nThe factory is an empodiment of madness incomprehensible even to the men who built it, laid every unholy circuit of conveyor belt, a thousand arms madly spinning every second, countless plates of copper and iron in a complex dance the likes of which is unseen in the realm of mere mortals. There are sections that I have no idea how they work, and I BUILT THEM.\n\nThe factory grows more complex with each passing second and more convoluted every milisecond. Perhaps the reason is in part due to each segment being constructed with no plans for future additions, then the future additions were constructed by forcibly adapting the existing segments, usually by shoving more tubes into it rather than actually redesigning it, and these futrue additions are also not planned for expansion. The end result is a cluster-♥♥♥♥ so large in magnitude, the last time a cluster-♥♥♥♥ rivaled it in size, God smote the town and turned its inhabitants into salt. Unfortunately no god can save us from this... thing.\n\nHaving expanded it further its almost as if the factory has a mind of its own, an ever hungry consciousness burning with dark malevolence and the need to grow. It infects all who stand in its presence, compelling them to add to it. A hundred furnaces belch smoke and the black blood of the earth is torn from its cradle to fuel the fires of industry. The ecosystem is demolished and the skin of the planet is rent and shattered for its glittering treasures, tossed into the inferno of a thousand stone and metal prisons to be transformed, used to expand the malignant blight upon the world that we brought. Ten thousand steel cogs turn and steam fills the air as the never ending fires boil the oceans away to power the sprawling spiderweb of mechanised mayhem, ordered chaos at its purest, a hundred thousand plates of steel and copper cycle and swirl in patterns barely knowable by the very people that created them.\n\nEach day, the red and green fluids are pumped into glowing crystalline globes, each sparking and burning, discovering new knowledge and new machines. The factory grows. Each advance in technology only complicates matters. The factory grows. The new advances create a need for new resources. The factory grows. The new resources require new means of transportation. The factory grows. The new transportation feeds new machines that burn the new resources to produce blue fluids to discover new technology. The factory grows. The blue fluids feed the globes to reveal new truths, beginning the vicious cycle anew, a neverending circle of destruction and growth that will only end when every corner of the planet is scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet will never be scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet is infinite in size. The factory grows. The game will never be over.\n\nThe factory grows.\n\n\n\nEpilogue:\n\n//: Date: 6/21/[ERROR_NULL_VALUE]\n\nResources have dried up again. The factory consumes all within its reach, insatiable in its hunger. Though it had experienced full production stoppages in the past, the factory could never be eliminated from the planet by the natives, for the sun itself powered the beams of destruction that maintained its borders. Within the creaking, ancient cogs and permanent haze of foul and polluted smoke, a single humanoid shape slowly rises to its feet. Aged, failing flesh and bone long ago replaced with steel and chrome, once polished and clean, now weathered by uncountable years of exposure to acid rain and blackened by thick, choking smog, form its excuse for a body. It could have left while it was still human, before it was consumed in body by the foundry it created to escape. It never had a chance to leave, mind and soul devoured in the persuit of freedom. With slow, clanking steps and the steady drip of oil from its joints, like a bleeding mechanical nightmare brought to hideous life, it stands and rasps as it moves for the exit. Behind it, a thousand drones rise like a plague of locusts, ready to continue the endless harvest. As the abomination that was once a man steps towards the gates of the factory, a mighty space faring vessel lies decrept in its dry dock deep within the core of the facility. It was supposed to be a way off the planet, the whole reason for the factory's construction. But soon, the building of the factory became the means and the end, no thought other than the constant urge to grow in its mind.\n\nThe only machine resembling the human form in the entire world stepped out into the barren wasteland of the ruined world. A keening, howling wind tears across the surface, forests destroyed by the ruined atmosphere no longer keeping it in check.\n\nIt is the cry of a dead world, echoing forever on a planet overtaken by the machine.","April 13","true","63.8"," 1,839 of 1,863 people (99%) found this review helpful 1,601 people found this review funny","99","839","1","601","74"

These words may now instantly turn you off a game after buggy games like DayZ or lack of content games like Killing Floor 2 but this game is truly different. Never have I played an early access which is so well polished, bug free and complete that it feels like you aren’t buying an early version of the game, instead you are buying a complete game which will get a load of free DLC.\n\nYou start crash landed on a planet with only a few machines and your mind. You start mining some stone to build more miners but it takes too long, luckily you have a mining drill which will automatically mine for you, great! But you need a way to power it so you mine some coal and power it. But where is it going to be stored? You cut down a few trees to build a chest to place it in and then you got your first set up complete! But one machine will take ages and you got to mine more coal, copper and iron (as well as smelt it) too! After some more mining and tree cutting you have a set-up which will mine all the ores you need. But having to run around and place coal in is inefficient and having 6 different chests for each resource is messy. “There’s got to be a better way!” you say like an infomercial, well there is Kevin! Inserters which will pick up items and place them behind the inserters and conveyer belts which move items. After some fiddling around with this you make a set up which mines everything and stores it into one box. But you still have to power everything with coal, is there a way to improve it? Of course, there always is. This is the basics of the game, you are constantly improving on what you have with the goal of making the factory as efficient and automated as possible.\n\nCombat – Although this seems weird in a factory building game, it is actually implement really well. It keeps you on your toes and limits what you can do. If you focus just on production you aren’t going to be able to fight off an attack which can wipe your factory out, forcing you to start again. You can’t skimp out on any factory or risk losing everything and the more you pollute, the more powerful enemies you will have to face, the more turrets you will have to place.\n\nWeapons & defence – Fear not, you are also able to craft weapons and armour which will help you fight off enemies. Pistols, Shotguns, Grenades, Mines, even personal defence robots which automatically fire at enemies. But what about defence? Do I just have simple iron and copper armour? Nope, Power Armour! Armour which you can install modules which can increase speed, generate shields, shoot enemies and more. My personal favourite is the roboport which allows you to summon robots who can build blueprints and repair them, allowing me to set up a fortified base in seconds.\n\nAdvance & interesting Technology – Later in the game you unlock more advance and interesting technology, some which allow you to automate object crafting extremely quickly which can further be improved by modules. Robots which can be ordered to supply machines with crafting components so you never have to refill one again or robots which can build entire bases and repair them when they get damaged. Cars, tanks, trains, ways to transport you and supplies around, allowing you to create separate bases with each having a different focus. You are constantly unlocking more and more technology which will make you rethink your entire factory set-up.\n\nGameplay – I am constantly put into “the flow” where I am completely focused which causes time to go by much faster than it feels like. I am constantly fixing one thing only to find out another is broken, restructuring my factory to be more efficient, and fortifying my bases. There is something quite satisfying about having a compact base which just works.\n\nMultiplayer – This game features a full multiplayer co-op experience which works flawlessly. The only thing more fun than building a factory by yourself is building it with your mates. 50 hours on one multiplayer game, and we haven’t even modded the game yet!\nThis is seriously one of the most interesting games I’ve played on steam, I’ve already got well over my money’s worth and I have no intention of stopping. I can't recommend this game enough to anyone who likes management games.\n\nNote: Killing Floor 2 is not a bad game at all, the way they are handling early acess is the problem.","March 13","true","112.4"," 790 of 822 people (96%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","96","790","822","51","26"

You start out so simple, harvesting some coal and iron, chopping down a tree or two. Then you plonk down a machine that starts mining iron ore for you, and you feed the result into a furnace. You build more machines, then some inserters. More machines, and it becomes easier to link up a few things with conveyor belts.\n\nFour hours later you look down on a factory system so complex you couldn't have designed it; and yet it grew so gradually, so organically, that at no point you felt overwhelmed.\n\nYou look at the time - maybe ten more minutes; you want to quickly redesign this bit around your assemblers to fit in another conveyor belt. It would speed up the production of green electronic circuits.\n\nThree hours later you realize that you should have been in bed for hours, but you can't stop now - you just build a tank and you really want to try it out on that alien base that has been growing way too much.\n\nFactorio is fun. As simple as that.","March 1","true","3.9"," 516 of 525 people (98%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","98","516","525","95","7"

I have looked for a game like this for years. A game that is survival, but you can thrive instead of just surviving by making robots and machines do everything for you. I have already recomended this game to 5 or 6 of my friends. If you have the money, and like using your brain to overcome problems and build things, BUY THIS GAME!\n\nThe good\n-Great for unlimited play. There is always more to do.\n-Multiplayer is super fun, and much less laggy then anticipated.\n-The enemy progression system is near perfect\n-Runs very well, even with over 300 robots all doing different things on the screen.\n-Very customisable world\n-Very smooth controls\n-The combat robots are awesome\n-Modules and suit upgrades out the wazoo\n-The logic systems and rail systems are very polished and well done\n-Most early access games I have played, I have found many bugs. I have not found a single bug in this game.\n-The blueprint system is easy, efficiant, and well done.\n-Robots are very polished and do what they're supposed to very well.\n-Devs are awesome!\n-Best builder/tower defence game I have ever played\n\n\nCould use some work\n-Vehicles are a little sub par, but still fun to use\n-Armor augmentatin system is a little broken. I should not be able to run faster then a train, or take on a max level enemy base with a shotgun\n-Inserter speed is limited for extreme late game. I found myself needing 2 or 3 fast inserters just to load enough copper into one assembler for wire\n-lack of enemy types\n-Water and lake boundries, and some way to clear them or build over them.\n-not many methods of producing power\n\nThe Bad (most being fixed in updates coming soon most likely)\n-A lack of end game. Once the rocket is launched, you have nothing else to progress too, aside from expanding your current base.\n-Weapons. There are 6 weapons in the game, 3 are ♥♥♥♥ and one is god tier, will most likely be balanced soon.\n\nThings I would personally like to see/Pipe dreams\n-A gamemode or checkbox of "Extreme survival" requiring you to eat, drink, and sleep through nights. Enemies may have more advanced AI in this gamemode.\n-Space. Although this is a little far fetched, add the ability to set up a space station, mine astroids or even moons. Or even travel to a different planet all together. Including a sort of out of atmosphere solar panel, which was what I thought the satalite was going to do.\n-More biomes. Some biomes containing different enemy types, or some having extreme tempatures that require a suit module to survive in, but also much richer in resources\n-More power production methods! Nuclear power for examble.\n-A sort of "Deep mining" drill. A drill that extracts ore from deep underground, in a much slower, power consuming fassion. This could also be a good way to get end game ore.\n-End game ore. Uranium, Diamond, Platinum.\n-An enemy "Hive Mind". Sort of like the worms that spawn, only huge. Controlls the underlings, and directs them. Destroy hive mind, end all sort of alien attacks in that biome. Destroying the hive mind would need to be extreamly difficult.\n-Air vehices. I would love to be able to quickly get around the base or area without worrying about hitting a pipe or electrical pole. Also including a "Sky transport", like a end game train that does not need tracks.\n-Differenty types of miners, more suitable and productive for late game.\n-The ability to grow trees and cut them down, and produce charchoal from the wood, leading to a renewable source of coal.\n-Crops, either to eat and regain health, or to use as bio-fuel.\n-More and more exotic types of weapons. We have the alien artifacts, why not use them to make an acid launcher or a plasma beam?\n-More natual fluids aside from water. Have a rarer type of volcanic biome that produces lava, which can be used to power thermal generators.\n-More enemies! More powerfull versions of the origional enemies. A type of behomoth biter multiplied by 5. Flying enemies, subterainian enemies, water based enemies, enemy base levels, producing higher level enemies and giving more artifacts when destroyed.\n-Some drop from basic enemies. Chitin used for armor, Meat used to cook, Spitter acid as an alternate use to make batteries or poison bullets, worm teeth for drill augmentations, the list goes on.\n-Robot companions. Robots that help you with things other then fighting for 120 secconds or building stuff.\n-Neutral mosters. Things like wild space animals that don't want to kill you. Possibly tamable and kept as a pet or something\n-More train types! Trains requiring advanced fuel, or even magnetic trains that travel hundreds of miles an hour.\n-Teleporters(?) requring disgusting amounts of power, but able to transfer anything, including items, over great distances instantly. Cound even include coming from space or an astroid to the home world, requiring some sort of airlock.\n-Pressure chambers! Pressurising air to make types of materials, like alloys or more compressed liquids.\n-Steam workshop support! There are a lot of great mods out there, and the steam workshop just makes them accessed easier.\n-PvP or factions maybe?\n-Proximity voice chat?\n\nSimply put, I love this game. I have never even heard of these devs until now, and they are some of the best devs I have seen. If you like builders, tower defence games, survival games, or anything like those genres, buy this game. I already know you will love it.","March 21","true","91.6"," 472 of 483 people (98%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","98","472","483","26","17"

You can never, ever forget to continue to keep up with defense and weapon tech or you'll slowly become overwhelmed over time.\n\nYou've played many games with systems that sound like this, but honestly nothing compares to this game. It's on another level and still manages to be extremely fun.\n\nYou'll always want to be more efficient with your building and manufacturing not for the sake of being efficient because who really cares honestly, but because you need MORE THINGS FASTER! EVERYTHING, MORE! NOW! When your inefficient hastily thrown together setup is becoming bottlenecked in various places and thus isn't making your flying robots nearly fast enough to satisfy your deep, angry hunger to see what the robots actually look like in action, it'll send you on a quest to improve each step of your manufacturing setup over several hours where you'll forget you were even making robots to begin with. From the outside you may see "tedious", but when you're on the inside, it's "adventure". You discover yourself what you need to do to fix one problem, one at a time without even meaning to. Endless discovery.\n\nHighly recommend playing with a group of friends. After 15 hours or so you really start to get a real sense of what it must be like to run a company or manufacturing plant with so many moving parts. Get enough people together in a server and I'm sure you could simulate the insanity that is managing the LHC.\n\nYou make a server with 3-4 friends.\nOne friend decides to set up Iron Plate production and mining while everyone is off doing other things.\nAfter 10 hours, you realize you've always had a steady supply of Iron Plates, Steel Plates, and Copper Plates coming in to help you build your chemical plants and batteries, but you really have no idea how the Plates are being made or are even getting to you. All you know is your friend would occasionally ask if you needed some, so he would bring you materials in the form of a conveyor belt whose path you would modify to fit into your automation you're working on, and it's working very well! You're well on your way to making robots..... But never mind how all these materials are getting to me from my friend.. How did I learn to make robots in the first place?\n\nYou realize your other friend has been unlocking new technology all this time with a lab setup, so you go to check it out and discover he has spent all this time setting up an automated lab researching process with 3 different products all being automatically manufactured and poured into the labs.. And guess what's being fed down there as well? Your other friends Plates, and your own Batteries and other things (since he needed some and you were like, oh I won't just give you some batteries, I'm going to give you an entire endless line of batteries). All while another friend has been managing a conveyor belt full of coal that circles every piece of equipment that uses coal, thus keeping all the machines operational, and loops back around for excess, where it is periodically stored into containers. And managing electricity grids. And turrets. Defenses. Exploring when you need more materials (stones, jfc). Killin Zerg any way you can... Or constantly trying to run away.\n\nThis is just the best. That's all it is. The best.\n\nAs far as Early Access goes, haven't had it crash once. Haven't run into any weird bugs yet.\n\nCons?\n\nOnly one. In multiplayer, the entire game pauses and waits for the person joining to download the map before resuming. If the person joining has a very low download speed, this usually equates to a having enough time to make a sandwich and some coffee for the group. A smoke break if that's your thing. Not too much of a bad thing really, but it would be great if the game could continue to function while the new player downloaded the map.\n\nWe are.. 20 hours in or so into our map? And I still don't think we're anywhere near being able to build a rocketship. But we do finally have little flying robots repairing our base now!","February 28","true","58.3"," 151 of 152 people (99%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","99","151","152","22","1"

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nIn Factorio you start off with nothing and expand into an empire of automation. The game starts simple and it allows itself to become more and more complex. This is a game that requires patience and the determination to make everything work. Factorio will have a time where it becomes more of a management game than a survival game until the natives decide to attack in a horde and destroy everything you have worked for, making you have to multitask between industrialization and defense from the locals. It has a huge amount of possible replayability.  Factorio has highly addicting gameplay which will leave you wanting to just finish one more supply line from your electric drill, to your furnace, to the assembly machine, into a chest. Oh wait my research finished? Well I guess I should put in my new robots. Oh wait the natives dared attack me? COMBAT ROBOTS ASSEMBLE. Well now the natives destroyed some of my automation so I should probably fix it. Overall Factorio is an impressively fun game, but it also is not something you can just pick up and easily play.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nDon’t judge a book by it’s cover could be used to express this game as the graphics are not top-notch as other games, but the gameplay it comes with is luscious and immersive. There really is no music and the sounds of machinery will slowly take over.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Thought provoking game\n+ Challenging\n+ Allows creativity\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Addictive\n+ Map editor\n+ Mods\n\nCons\n**Note since this is an Early Access title Cons and other parts of the review as well are viable to change as the game continues to develop**\n\n- Multiplayer can be annoying to set-up for some (and could require a third party such as Hamachi)\n- No introduction to certain buildings and items leaving you to search for it or just fiddle until you find out creating a problem when first orienting yourself with the game\n- Lacking ideal graphics for some\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWow I have spent 10 hours in Factorio and I feel I was able to accomplish a lot and at the same time that I haven’t even scratched the surface of the game. Me and my friend now play Factorio together and it is honestly a blast to play. It took us around an hour to figure out how to fire our guns and use our steam engines properly. We have a few automation chains running and are constantly expanding and trying to figure out an ideal production chain to gain the greatest efficiency of all our resources. So far I don’t see any signs of us dropping this game.\n\nTL;DR\nFactorio is not an easy game, you cannot simply pick it up and expect to know everything. Factorio is a game that will have you puzzling yourself on building the best piece of automation possible while also trying to fight off the natives. The gameplay is fun and addictive, but requires dedication to make it all work. There is a great satisfaction in getting a large chain of automation for yourself because of your personal effort and determination.\n\n** Key was provided by developer for review purposes **\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 5","true","27.2"," 212 of 229 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","212","229","10","8"

You explore, you build, you acquire new resources, you develop new technologies, and you protect your shiny belongings from the ever-present horde of bad things that want to destroy it.\n\nNo specific thing in Factorio is really complicated, it's the interacton between structures and the scale that really make it shine. Factorio lets you do a whole lot of creative stuff using simple building blocks and logic tools. The graphics aren't amazing, but they are effective at displaying what they need to in a game that could easily get cluttered with too much information.\n\nIt's also moddable, if you start to get bored with the vanilla game you are still just scratching the surface of what you can do with Factorio.\n\nThe steam integration isn't perfect, but it's still early access and being steadily developed.\n\nIf you like base building and tech games with epic scale, you will probably enjoy Factorio.","February 25","true","3.2"," 152 of 154 people (99%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","99","152","154","6","0"

I first tried out the demo. I liked it. I loved it. In under 15 minutes, I was convinced to buy the full game. So I'm going to make two reviews: One for the people who don't like reading a lot and those who like reading a lot.\n\nReview for those who don't like reading a lot\nHow to play Factorio:\n\n1. Get iron.\n2. Get copper.\n3. Get coal.\n4. Make machines.\n5. Get more iron and copper.\n6. Realize that green circuits are too little. Make more machines.\n7. Make train tracks.\n8. Make a robot logistic network.\n9. Sit back and relax as you watch your magnificent factory.\n10. Realize that you have been, all this time, been in the middle of train tracks.\n11. Train comes.\n12. Train hits you.\n13. You die.\n\n11/10 would get hit by a train again.\n\nReview for those who like reading a lot\nFactorio is a game about surviving in a foreign planet with nothing but a few scrap metal from your destroyed spaceship. With these ingridients, you will make your first—wait for it—pickaxe. You're probably going to be like: "Oh **** another Minecraft/Survival/Crafting game. Not worth my time or my money." Guess again. Factorio is on a different league. It creates it's own niche. Like I've said two times now, Factorio is a game about making factories. "Factories?" you say. "Why the hell would I want to make factories? Is this some brand new **** that's like roller coaster tycoon?"\n\nNo, my friend. This game is about building factories, organizing infrastructure, creating efficient setups and watching your own creation make a replica of itself (eventually). Yes, you craft...for like the first 15 minutes. But then you'll have machines crafting things for you. You'll have to start small. A few miners. A few furnaces. But before you know it, you're staring at a monolithic structure of belts, machines and inserters which you could happily call "Your baby factory." And like your own baby, you have to protect it.\n\nSo far, there are only a few handful of "native" aliens in the land. Your machines that pollute their ecosystem will eventually trigger them to launch an full-on assult. But of course, you will have defenses ready: turrets, lasers, robots, a tank and even your trains (your trains are op. They gotta nerf that ****). You defeat the first wave. But don't go celebrating yet. They'll be back stronger, faster and more tankier.\n\nAs you up your defenses and keep building new infrastructure to your factory, you will eventually have enough firepower to—guess what?—run over their houses and collect their eggs (it will say "Alien Artifact" in the game, but it's obviously alien eggs) which will be useful for crafting end-game items and for finally getting a rocket off the planet.\n\nI've spent around 100 hours each into my saves. I only have 3 saves for now, where in two of them I have already launched the end-game rocket. It's that fun.\n\nAnyways:\n\nPros:1. Content-rich Game (way polished that 90% of the Early Access games here in Steam)\n2. Active developers.\n3. FFs. (It's sort of a newsletter that the devs writer every friday to let everyone know what they've been up to. Basically so we know they're not just slacking around.)\n4. Can be played casually or seriously.\n5. Loads of replay value.\n6. Has a big modding scene (although not in Steam Workshops...yet).\n\nCons:1. End-game content is a bit lacking...but then again this is in Early Access so that is expected.\n2. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH GREEN CIRCUITS HOLY ****\n3. Train Deaths (The amount of train deaths is 10x more than the average Biter-Alien deaths).\n\nNot yet convinced? Try the demo. You'll thank us later.\n","February 25","true","95.8"," 125 of 130 people (96%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","96","125","130","75","0"

The game is fun, well thought out and rather well balanced.\nThere simply isn't a game that is as satisfying and rewarding as this, the difference between your very first factory and your massive well optimised fully automated production line is night and day and getting there will take at the very least 100 hours or so that you'll enjoy immensely.\n\nPros:\nFantastically well optimised\nI usually play with a friend and host, even with pretty giant factories the game ran smooth as butter and my friend reported almost non-existant latency issues.\nPlenty of content\nThere's a lot of value here, plenty of things to do and a the progression is paced quite well.\nChallenging\nOnce you get into it, you're required to be intelligent with your time and resources - The enemies give you ample time before attacking, but not enough for you to be lazy.\nModding\nMods exist, the modding community is pretty great and they're incredibly simple to install.\n\nCons\nArt\nI don't really care for the art style, but that's just my opinion. It's entirely functional and clear as far as I'm concerned, but I'd have liked something a bit different.\nSoundtrack\nThere isn't one of any note or value, not that I particularly care about the soundtrack personally.\nDowntime\nIt can begin to get a little slow in places, it's rare but it can happen at certain points during the natural progression. If you enjoy this game you'll likely never even notice it.\n\nConclusion\nIt's a fantastic game, made by people who genuinely care about their product. The update cycle this far has been a bit on the slow side, but every update has plenty of content and releases are always quite stable (any bugs that do pop up are squashed quite quickly with hotfixes). I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you love building games, especially if you love automation and factories - Just staring at your perfectly constructed assembly line with all your materials whizzing around on conveyor belts leaves you with an immense feeling of accomplishment. Buy it and give it a try, I'd say very confidently that if you're reading this review in the first place, then you'll love this game.","February 25","true","5.3"," 121 of 130 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","121","130","2","5"

Factorio is one of those unique 'early access' games that is feature rich  and can cater for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. I will be breaking this review down into sections to give you an idea of the scope and overall Factorio product.\n\n\n\nThe game\n\nWhilst Factorio is listed as being in early access it is full of content and provides many hours of gameplay to enjoy whilst working toward the current endgame goal. To new players this game provides an interesting and complex set of engineering challenges whereby you have to turn various machines, conveyor belts, robots, trains and power generators into a fully automated factory which ultimately launches a rocket into space. This is all done in a sandbox environment which allows you to explore and try new solutions for your factory.\n\nHowever you are not alone; the native alien 'biters' are a hostile force who are not fond of you and your factory. They will mount attacks on you which you need to defend with the use of turrets and walls; of course you can also mount your own attack on them with a whole range of weaponry from tanks to shotguns or even be a 'combat robot wielding exoskeleton maniac' tearing through their bases. Although combat is not the main focus of Factorio it provides more depth to the gameplay and purpose to what you are trying to achieve.\n\nAlthough the first play through is an exciting and awesome experience, I believe Factorio's success lies in its replay value. Finding new configurations of factory design, setting goals and achievements for yourself in game as well as playing with the various complex systems such as trains and the circuit and logistic networks provide more than enough content to be enjoyed for (literally) hundreds or thousands of hours. Many players can attest to tearing down old factories to build better and more efficient designs but also expanding to the stages of 'megabases'; huge factories with extreme production capabilities.\n\nIf the game seems a little daunting or you want to share the experience with a friend you are able to do this through the multiplayer feature within the game. This opens up a whole new level of fun as you work with others to achieve goals throughout the game.\n\nFactorio takes inspiration from many games, notably; Minecraft modpacks with a heavy focus on production and automation; Transport style games such as Open TTD; and many base building style games.\n\n\n\nThe Community\n\nThe Factorio community is perhaps one of the best gaming communitites that I have been a part of. Most highly knowledgable players are more than willing to share gameplay tips, factory designs, provide assistance and answer questions as well as share interesting and complex combinator contraptions. In particular the Factorio Twitch community is particularly strong with a wide range of dedicated Factorio players with extensive knowledge on the game who are willing to help new players.\n\n\n\nThe Development Team\n\nThis is one of the key things that I look into before purchasing an indie game these days. It isn't possible for me to give enough praise to the team behind Factorio. Regular updates (every single Friday) are given on the situation with regards to development and all things Factorio. The team participates in various levels throughout the Factorio community (such as reddit, Twitch, the forums, etc.) and actively listen to both player suggestions and feedback on development proposals. These factors (as well as all that has been achieved already) give me the confidence in the team’s ability to produce further content and perfect the awesome game they have created.\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\nFactorio has taken the place as my all-time favourite game. When purchasing Factorio you will be receiving a polished product which has enormous amounts to offer to gamers of all ages. The game will challenge and test you; but the feeling of seeing that particular factory design or contraption 'work' is one of the most rewarding of any game I have ever played. The combination of an already awesome game, fantastic community and a passionate and dedicated development team ensures that Factorio will be one of the best indie games ever made. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this brilliant game.","February 25","true","366.1"," 130 of 144 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","130","144","8","1"

Since then I've played games on the ZX Spectrum 48k, the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga 500 and the PC in it's various transitions. During that time I've encountered games which I've thought have been brilliant, like Lemmings, Cannon Fodder, Medal of Honor etc. This game (Factorio) has to be the best. Why, because it had me hooked. I'm never hooked, I play a game and after a day or a week it becomes boring and I look for a cheat or map or just give up. This game really connected with my inner logic to build that rocket and get away from those insidious creatures hell bent on destroying anything remotely pollutant. After 98hrs of game play I've managed to build the rocket and complete the game, all with medium settings. If you're a Programmer, Electrician or are into logistic then you'll love this game. Honestly I'll never play Factorio again because 98hrs is enough dedication.

Keep in mind, I don't make that statement lightly. Factorio is one part real-time strategy game, one part management tycoon-esque game, and another part survival game. You start with some iron in your inventory and after about 10 hours in, you have an absolutely massive automated factory generally too big for you to see all on one screen yet for some reason you never forget what each part of the factory is doing. You'll go from coal powered machinery billowing out clouds of smog to electric furnaces buzzing with logistic robots. By the end you will see thousands of machine arms moving resources/goods to storage containers, furnaces or assembling machines and assuming you've done it right, it will all go off without a hitch. Trains delivering fresh ore to the main factory lines being unloaded in perfect unison onto conveyor belts to be refined into intermediate products which allow for research and more intense production. I don't even know where to start or end when discussing this game because it's just so damn well done and it's so much fun to play. If ever there was a game worth grabbing for 20 bucks and playing with friends, it was definitely Factorio.

Never need to spend time waiting for your economy to grow because all your resources are based on how well you design your production factories.\nHigh depth and complexity but still a great learning curve that naturally progresses you to more advanced technologies.\nMakes great use of the isometric visuals in both gameplay and aesthetics.\nFree demo available with a few of the campaign missions for you to play.\nCONS:Currently lacks sufficient end game content.\nLaying train track is annoying to do.\nOnly 4 campaign missions currently available.\nNo steam integration (need to add mods and join multiplayer games manually).\nIf you are looking at this game and are thinking that it looks too difficult I implore you to think again.  Factorio is a resource management and building game that perfectly balances challenge and accessibility by making the factory systems easy to understand but with enough depth that it will take you weeks to master. Your goal is to survive on an alien planet and to do so you will have to make use of conveyor systems to transport resources around your base. Each time you play you will end up adjusting your building strategies to create better and better factories, but not because you have to but because you want to. Factorio naturally paces itself with your level of play, teaching you everything you need to know through the campaign and allowing you to set the difficulty of the game extensively in sandbox mode. In terms of early access games, this one is up there with Kerbal Space Program as one of the best, and I highly recommend you at least check out the demo if you aren’t sold on buying the full game.

Boring, right? Why not build a machine to mine for you? That makes things easier, although you still need to transport coal over to keep it going. That's pretty tedious, so let's build a conveyor belt and an inserter to transport the coal automatically! Pretty neat, although building all of these conveyor belts is a lot of work. Hey, let's get an assembler to automatically build conveyor belts for me! That works great, except now there's conveyor belts everywhere and it's all a bit confusing. Why not build flying robots that replace the belts.... you get the idea.\n\nThis game basically gives you tasks to do, and as soon as those tasks get boring, it gives you an easier way to do it. It is insanely addicting, in a way that I haven't experienced from a game in a long time. Sure, it is early access, but the game is very stable and already has a lot of content. Plus, the devs give weekly updates on their website, so you always know what's been going on. This is as well done for an early access game as Kerbal Space Program and Prison Architect.\n\nAlso, as of this review, the current count on Steam is 1,778 positive reviews to 6 (SIX!!) negative reviews.","February 29","true","41.8"," 66 of 67 people (99%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","99","66","67","8","0"

No matter how much you play, there's always at least a few unresolved loose ends that you're trying to resolve. Finally resolve one production issue and two more present themselves, not to mention the fact that one of your primary resources starts to dry up, giving you yet another problem to solve. You'll finally get a particular, very satisfying production line set up, only to discover that the throughput on something it depends on is way too low, so then you go to fix that up and get it upgraded and improved, only to realise you're having issues in another area, and perhaps you have everything you need to solve it right away, except you've crowded yourself into a tight space, forcing you to reconsider your approach and rework parts of your layout... but now your iron is running out and that means you're not producing steel, which means your ammo isn't getting produced, which means those turrets aren't keeping the base safe from aliens, so now you need to go and attack the enemy to get to that iron patch they're infesting.... but it's too far away, so you'll need to get a train running to and from it... and so on.

You must begin small - creating a mining station and some basic furnaces. Then begin to build power infrastructure - coal fired steam engines and such. Use this to power electric miners and automate the production of things. Iron becomes gears, iron plates and gears can make conveyor belts. Conveyor belts  allow for you to move things around, and then the logistics challenge begins - creating a fully automated factory to produce science packs that can be used to discover new technologies. Bring in trains, logistical robots, construction robots, solar power, laser turrets and powered armour. Work your way up to a rocket, which is where it currently ends, although it is intended to go further, in the future.\n\nAll the while the native biters are being agitated by the pollution you produce, I hope you can defend what you have made.\n\nI love the devs, I funded this back in the original indiegogo and have seen this develop so much. The devs have always been awesome, they have kept a blog going with a post every Friday for the best part of (if not more than) 2 years.\n\nPlease give it a try, there is a demo available.

It's the seemingly infinite map size that gives you - as chief polluter - a massive canvas to spread your creation over. Have one mega base, dotted outposts or link everything up with trains into a massive megalopolis of dirty industry.\n\nIt's fantastic.\n\nBuy this if you are :-\n\nThe sort of person who loves creating problems.\nThe sort of person who loves solving problems.\n\nVery, very good indeed. So good that you could easily overlook the fact that it's early access. Can only imagine what else the developers have in mind to add next. From what I've read, we have fire mechanics, space platforms and other strategy layers to look forward to.\n\nWould like to mention the enemy progression system. Enemies "level" up, or evolve based on your pollution output. Run a green factory and you might never see an enemy. Run it the other way and the pollution is eaten (??) by the enemies, making them stronger and evolving them into new forms, like Pokemon did (or so I'm told).\n\nGive it a try, and curse the developer for making such a compelling experience that you've sat through 5+ hours in the mistaken belief you've only been playing for an hour or two.","March 6","true","75.0"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","61","71","7","1"

The steady stream of decent updates and developer communication is what puts this game on par with kerbal space program, prison architect, grim dawn or craft the world and it's just one of those early access games done right for a change.\n\nWhat you should understand about Factorio that it's not a minecraftesque game. It's not Starbound, it's not Terraria and it's not a crafting-survival game to begin with. It's closer to Big Pharma, Capitalism or Settlers as you are tasked with building numerous production chains rather than specific items for a specific purpose. It also has elements of tower defence/base building and just a bit of strategy gameplay for when you attack alien nests but that's it - this is mostly an economical micromanagement game which relies heavily on it's fanbase and people like me who actually enjoy micromanaging stuff.\n\nWhile some will inevitably dislike the whole concept - i find having a lot of "stuff" to manage and build more liberating than having to simply dig dirt and build houses... even though i admit that i like crafting games too.\n\nFrom what i've seen over the years this game can only get better as the developers seem to understand how good games suppose to work - there's balance between building, defending, expanding and recently they added an end goal as well. I can only imagine what would modders do to this game after they add workshop and in game mod support since it's quite easy to add new stuff and overhaul the game completely.\n\nEven in it's current state it is definitely worth trying so i can actually recommend it. But if you want to wait - wait for a version 0.13 which is going to add a lot of new stuff or for a workshop support.","February 27","true","15.1"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","60","72","4","4"

It feels like one of those games that I will play all weekends long, never touch it for a few months, play another weekend from start to end, repeat.\n\nOverall, this game should serve as a Golden Standard of how Early Access Games should work (seen only 1 bug from 11 hours of play), and not what some of us have experienced… Looking at you, developers of Spacebase DF-9.","March 6","true","59.5"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","43","48","2","2"

I really needed something new to play, as I got bored with Space Engineers's lack of endgame stuff, and every research I did, factorio ended up showing up.\n\nI saw the reviews on steam. People asking not to buy this game because it's a huge timesink and it ruins lives. I tried not to buy it, I really did. And so I didn't buy it, I downloaded the demo.\n\nHuge mistake. The game is so freaking good that it grabbed my interest just with its demo. I finished the demo and bought it. I told myself "no, I will control myself. I will do the things I need to do during the week and will only play factorio a few hours each night". I did the unbelievable achievement of donwloading the full game and then going to bed without playing it. On the next day I managed to do my important, productive stuff, kind of. Then I told myself "well, I deserve a small break". That's when it started.\n\nThe game, as some youtube reviewer said, is pure cocaine. You can't simply stop playing, there's always something more to do. It's pure yak shaving: "Oh crap i'm running out of coal. Better explore to find another coal deposit". "Oh ♥♥♥♥ I need a car for that. Gotta research the automobilism tech". "Oh ♥♥♥♥ for that I need some fancy science packs that I'm still not producing. Gotta get some more furnaces smelting that iron!" "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the biters are attacking my walls again. I need to make an automatic ammo-producing facility so I can auto refill the turrets" "Now i'm running out of power. Better make some more steam engines" "Ok what was I doing again? Oh yeah the automobilism tech. Ok I just researched it" "...For what did I research it, again? Oh yeah to explore and find some more coal deposits" "Ok now I found some coal deposit. Wait there's a huge nest next to it. I need to destroy it. But I need some more firepower - I need to research tanks" "Ok wait now I need more copper. Gotta make more drills and furnaces." "Well i'm also running out of stone to make the furnaces, gotta improve my stone mine" and this goes on and on... as I said - pure yak shaving but it's NOT a bad thing, because you feel good doing each and every one of those things - by doing them you're improving your factory and making the game more practical - never have I played a game where my progress could be measured and felt so clearly. This is like the feeling of progress you get from playing those idle games like cookie clicker, but this is so much more fun than idle games, because it has idle game elements but you can manufacture tanks and trains and make huge operations - the "idle" part of factorio is that after you start automating things, your factory does everything for you - at the start you're mining coal and iron by hand and placing the manually on furnaces, by mid-late game you have robots that build structures and move items for you, huge facilities that manufacture every kind of item in the game - each with their own destination, most to be manufactured into something else, which will definitely have some kind of use later.\n\nNow, remember when I said I got bored with space engineers because its lack of endgame content? I don't blame the devs, as the game is in early access (just like factorio, by the way), but factorio does something really smart to balance this. The further you move away from your spawn, bigger and more frequent enemy nests will be there. As your factory grows, so does the pollution it emmits: pollution, when it touches a nest, enrages biters and makes them attack your base. More importantly, pollution makes the biters evolve - so the small, early game biter can be killed with the starting pistol, but a behemoth, fully evolved biter, barely loses health to a machine gun turret with piercing ammo. Also, the biters can make new nests - do eventually they will start to overwhelm you, but you will have ways to defend yourself (while also enjoying the game) for a LONG time. Here's how:\n\nIn games where you can automate, farm and manufacture a lot of things like space engineers and minecraft, after you focus enough on creating a basic "item farming infrastructure", they become really easy - in SE you can mass manufacture ammo and missiles and fighter ships and drones after you have a basic mining setup, and in minecraft you can farm arrows and make XP grinders to get powerful enchantments and make lots of armor and traps and shape the environment to your benefit. Factorio is the first game i've ever seen of this type where you can of course mass produce weapons and vehicles and ammunition and other stuff, just like in the other games I mentioned, but the hazards evolve as you get more powerful - the amazing game designers behind factorio used a simple concept that we in the game development industry call the flow theory. The flow curve in factorio is nearly perfect: the challenges scale as you get more powerful. Simple as that. In the games I mentioned, space engineers and minecraft, they start really hard (with creatures attacking and hassling you while you're trying to get your basic base setup), but after a while they get super easy - so that is an unbalanced flow curve.\n\nSo to wrap this up, some pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-The game is VERY optimized - you can have a factory with thousands of items moving in conveyor belts, drones, being processed and changed, without it ever stuterring or dropping FPS\n-The map is infinite (you have an option to make it finite)\n-Has a great tutorial (part of it is available on the demo) and a not very steep learning curve\n-Amazing graphics, reminds me of 90's games like Commandos and the first and second Fallout\n-It has freaking CO-OP. Haven't hosted a server yet but I joined a friend's server - no hassle, I just put the i.p and port and bam! I was in!\n-I cannot stress this enough - the game is surprisingly optimized for an early access game, I have yet to find a SINGLE bug or glitch.\n-Not part of the game but for me it counts - the community, (at least on reddit) is very friendly and welcoming. Reminds me of Dwarf Fortress's or Kerbal Space Program's communities.\n-The wiki is really detailed for an early access game - most early access games I play today have really crappy wikis, some with wrong information and subjective statements.\n-And I think one of the most important things is how polished the game is - not just the visuals and core mechanics - if you read the weekly blog posts, you can see that the devs care about not just big features, but small interface and overall user experience details that really help and make the game practical. I've never seen so much care taken into the actual usability of an early access game. These are really small things, that really make a HUGE difference, trust me!\n\nCONS:\nAs everyone keeps saying, this game will destroy your life. I've had it for about three days and have more than 24 hours registered on steam. On my last map, I started playing during the afternoon after programming some stuff. Time passed and I didn't notice - I accidentaly died and on the deathscreen it logged 9 freaking hours. That's when I realize the demonic potential of this game.\nSeriously. As a game developer, I gotta say Wube Software has found a great way to destroy competition -  they can put a stop in the productive life of everyone who plays their game.\n\nIf you have productive things to do, DO NOT BUY IT!

If you are into real-time strategy games that reward knowledge of the system and creative builds, you will have a field day with this game.\n\nIts hard to describe what Factorio is all about. It starts off simple enough with your little guy manually mining coal and iron (ok, we've all done this before). Soon enough, you are slightly automating coal mining through using drills and conveyor belts (ok, I've used redstone for some semi-complicated things before). And then somewhere after this, the mind-splosion occurs and the craziness starts. Intermediate assembly buildings are actually crafting complicated recipes for you, and next you are building cars and turrets and now loading the turrets with ammo using automated bots. It goes on and on and on.\n\nOh, and did I mention this has multiplayer? You and a friend can build a base and defend it tower-defense style. Its freakin' crazy.\n\nPros:\n+I have never played anything like this before. So fresh.\n+Artwork is awesome IMO. I love the retro look.\n+Music is good.\n+Keyboard shortcuts are super tight. Controls overall are great - too bad no controller support, but I understand why.\n+Endless hours to be had learning how to better work everything.\n+Tutorial is great, and there is even a campaign mode. Not to mention the sandbox.\n+Multiplayer!\n\nCons/Games this is not:\n-While this is not a puzzle game like Infinifactory or something, there is definately value placed on logic. You will need to think. Keep this in mind if you are not into this kind of thing.\n-As far as I have played, its not an action shooter. You don't even have to aim (I like this, but feel it needs to be mentioned), and best-case-scenario you have automated turrets to do the dirty work.\n-Full screen does not work for many people.\n\nPrice tag seems high, but really its not. There is so much game to be had here. And its all so fun!","March 4","true","12.2"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","36","39","4","0"

When you start you only have a few basic supplies and little applicable technology. You might get a few basic things happening but soon aliens will ruin your day. You'll be tempted to give up on it entirely.\n\nBut the problem isn't the game, you just aren't thinking big enough. Why build one lab when you can set up 4 for 4 times the price? Why only walls 1 square thick? You've built one steam engine, why not 30?\n\nThe scale is infinite, and as you build the abmition to grander and grander designs the materials that allow you to expand grow. Soon technology comes quickly, aliens become a manageable nuisance, you start planning some train lines to go for a long distance iron deposit to top up your stockpiles and oh god its 4am I'm supposed to wake up for work in 3 hours what am I doing with my life.\n\nIts only real drawback is that with only a few core resources some people may think theres not enough complexity. But its meant to be a finely tightly tuned experience and what its doing it does well. The visuals aren't exactly next gen but they mesh well together and when you're potentially talking millions of assets at screen on once you don't want the engine grinding to a halt. The sound design is top notch and as you move about your factory you will feel like you are passing by the machinery.\n\nIf you like designing your own machines, solving spatial problems, or even the sim city experience of watching something you plan expand and grow, you will find enjoyment in this game. At the very least, I recommend running through the demo and getting a taste.","April 16","true","98.8"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","29","29","4","0"

You find yourself seeking more. More possibilities, more paths, more pleasure. But then you are wrenched away from it by the overbearing presence that is reality.  Your time away from it seems endless. Hours feel like days, days feel like weeks. Every fiber of your being craves the moment you can return to it.

I'm pushed for time, I need to pay some more Factorio, so here's the general gist:\n\nPros:\n- Endless gaming if you want to sandbox\n- Loads of things to build, research, upgrade, it'll keep you going for days\n- The soundtrack is great, hums along nicely in the background without offending you, but is also pleasant to listen to\n- It's been around for a while, so there are tons of mods, YouTube help videos etc\n\nCons:\n- I haven't eaten in about 3 days and my bum is asleep\n- The aliens are a bit stupid and don't really attack much (however, this could be a pro?)\n- The scenario is WAY TOO SHORT.  It's about 4 levels long.  If you're a person who likes playing scenarios (like me) then you'll be pretty annoyed, especially when you pass level FOUR and it says "you're all done, if you want some more you can pay or belong to an elite club or somehow just know how to mod games etc"...

A total timewaster but you won't feel like it's wasted time as you sit back and admire your perfectly engineered manufacturing base!   But it needs more scenarios built into the actual game you buy, not as some secondary mod or something.","May 8","true","176.9"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","28","31","6","2"

This game is pure joy. I have over 500 hours in it, and I can only reccomend it. While it is still in early acces, the game is slowly nearing feature completeness, which is part of the reason why the developers are coming to Steam. The devs are the most  active[www.factorio.com], determined, competent and hard-working indie game developers out there.\n\nSo what exactly is Factorio?\nIt is a 2D top-down factory builder. It's genre is not clear, but you can say it have something in common with popular games like Transport Tycoon, Sim City, Dwarf Fortress and others. In the game you can (and need to)  mine resources, research technologies, build infrastructure, automate production and fight enemies. The ultimate goal is to send rocket into the space (and after that to build a space platform - which is not yet implemented, but they work on it). The game supports great variety of mods, which can greatly influence the gameplay experience.\n\n\nPros\n- Amazing variety\n- Multiplayer\n- Open world\n- A true sandbox\n- Art and graphic style\n- Awesome modding community\n- Frequent updates\n-  TRAINS!!!\n\nCons\n- none I can think of\n\nYou exploit the planet resources, pollute it, and kill its native population.

Thats a 200 hour goal i would say.  But even tho my creations have not been as grand in scale yet, it was a lot of fun getting to where i got and find myself almost school girl giddle about restarting from scratch to do things better.\n\nIve never been good at describing features for reviews, but one thing i can say is that with the way each and every part is useful in its own way, the the attention to detail of the way the game plays, the Devs must really love this type of game.\n\nGives me hope for the Early Access system, even if just a little, after Starforge and DF-9.","March 2","true","96.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

But as I've enjoyed Factorio for years and thousands and thousands of game hours I could not expect any less. On steam it still runs great and the team is going full steam ahead like they always have.\n\nSo Factorio, should you buy it?Yes, of course!\n\nYes the graphics look at first glance pretty low, but didn't we all think that when minecraft came out? Remember the point in any sandbox building game where you just get sick of collecting the same resources with your generic mining tool? In Factorio you just go: "I'm sick of it, lets automate!"\n\nFactorio can be played very simply by using the default transporter belts and some robot arms, or you can dive in deep and not only automate everything but basically build your own (computer) network of controls and letting an army of drones loose on your planetwide factory doing everything for you.\n\nIf you like building, if you like using your brain to optimize everything you see and build. Then go buy Factorio NOW!\n\nPro's:- Transporter belts.\n- Wood, Coal, Iron, Copper, Stone, Oil is all you need to create a world.\n- Pickaxes are things for museums.\n- Unlimited mapsize (well depending on your PC of course).\n- Trains\n- Cars\n- Tanks\n- Drones\n- Blueprints\n- Perfect inventory control.\n- Easy to create crafting recepies (no external wiki's needed for crafting).\n- Huge tech tree.\n- Aliens who are enviromently friendly.\n- Mod support.\n- Multiplayer.\n- Savegames support online and offline play. no seperate savegames needed but possible of course.\n- Friendly community.\n- Dedicated devs with weekly news updates.\n- Almost no loading times (talking seconds here).\n- FUN FUN FUN!\n- MORE FUN WITH FRIENDS!\n\nCons:- Use of caps when talking positive about this game (see pro's).\n- You create polution (bad you! build some solar panels!).\n- Well I guess graphics if you're someone who hates anything but a full 3D experience.\n- Unable to rotate map.\n- Early access (always expect bugs, it's still in development).\n- So much ingame content that you forget more pro's.\n\nI simply can't say a bad word about this game, for me personally it has everything I always wanted in a building game.","March 5","true","33.2"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","1"

My 9 year old daughter and 7 year old son watched me play for 30 minutes over my shoulder and started jumping up and down asking me to buy them copies so that we could all play together in multiplayer.  Now it's almost like a ritual for us to turn on the game and go hunting for biters when we get home from school and work.\n\nThe game can be so incredibly complex yet is so intuitive.  I read another review that likened the game to writing code and I would have to say I agree, except so much more fun!  This is a great game to play with friends or your kids in co-op mode.  The factory layout possibilities are endless and you can optimize until your heart is content.\n\nIt will take you a few hours to figure out what all of the hotkeys are and what all of the machines do, but you will stumble across most of the game on your own and in a enjoyable and natural progression.

I've been playing this game since the multiplayer release in 2014.  It's not something I've played super consistently, but over that time (prior to the Steam release) I've sunk about 300-400 hours into it.  For me, the game fits somewhere between Dwarf Fortress, Prison Architect, and modded Minecraft, and I've found it to be incredibly enjoyable so far.  At the point in the game where you start setting up trains to haul resources from your mining outposts to your factories, things start getting really fun.  Trains take a while to figure out, but there are plenty of friendly people in the community on the official forum, Reddit, and YouTube who are always willing to help you out with your designs (the community of the game is another thing I love about the game).\n\nI strongly suggest trying out the demo on the developer's site if you're unsure about buying the game.  After the Steam release, the devs will focus on version 0.13 which will be bringing long-awaited features to trains and (hopefully) upgrades to the logistic bot behavior.","February 25","true","29.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Sleep is not an option.\n\nFactorioEngineers rejoice. Learn Technology, Automation and Efficiency in one easy to learn package. No? Seriously. this is a hard game to put down.\n\nLet's take a typical late game scenario.\n\nAssembler #28, manufacturing Advanced Electronics (let's call it a PCB) has a bottleneck and it's dragging down the entire electronic circuit assembly line.\n\nI took a look at the insertor (a small robotic feeder arm) sitting idle as copper coils were swallowed up by the identical assemblers before it reached #28. Obviously I need to increase copper coil production.\n\nSoo... I took a look at the copper coil assemblers, already sporting a Tech III speed beacon and Tech III efficiency modules and noticed that the copper plate was in short supply.\n\nSooo... I took a look at the copper ore smelting furnaces, also sporting (hard earned) Tech III modules and noticed the selectors feeding those were too slow and were skipping every second ore.\n\nSooo... I upgraded the selectors to fast selectors and solved the problem.\n\nOr did I?\n\n10 minutes later, Assembler #28 is doing it again. I repeat the above mitigation steps and notice the increase in insertor efficiency at the furnaces is depleting the ore feeder line. I have to increase ore production at the mining drills. Obvious right?\n\nSooo... my first thought is to add Tech modules to increase speed but... because the PCB production line is effectively in stasis I can't make more modules just yet so I have to do it the more obvious way. Add a new mining drill. Right?\n\nSooo... I went to get some iron plate BUT... there is none free because it's also being used on the PCB production line. I ran down the conveyor belt, scooping up iron plate, made my mining drill, ran down to the ore fields, installed a power line, placed the drill and.... lost power.\n\nSooo.... While I started to manufacture more panels and accumulators to add more power... the aliens came and with no power on my defenses, it took a superhuman effort to eradicate them using my flamethrower and Power Armor (Mk II of course). My personal construction bots all the while repairing what I damaged with my aggressive flame attack.\n\nMeanwhile.... Because I had stolen the iron plate off the PCB production line the copper coil problem was sorted... at least... temporarily.\n\nThen my sulfuric acid production stopped, which makes my batteries which is used to make my logistic bots that supply the whole higher end production chain... including my research.... because I ran out of..... iron plates.\n\nI'll have to redesign the whole damn thing. Tomorrow.\n\nOr maybe I can just do this little bit now...\n\n..oo00oo..\n\nTo sum it up, the slowish start and slightly difficult-to-get-used-to UI initially only lasts a few minutes. There is plenty of online information to get started but half the fun is working it out for yourself. Within a few hours your plan and the objectives become clear and obvious,\n\nThe best methodology required to achieve those objectives?

Review is based on alpha version of the game.\n\nFactorio is building game where you as a player will: build factories (duh!)\ndesign simple and complex processing and production lines, from raw materials to rocket silos and more!\nexplore for resources and try to survive on planet where you are an alien\nmanage and ship resources from ore deposits to smelting areas and so on\nresearch new technologies that help you out with points above\nget your brain melt while optimizing and making your factory amazing!\nThe good: well polished and interesting gameplay mechanics\ndecent amount of content supported by various mods\noptimized game engine for single and multiplayer (you can run massive factories with thousands of buildings, robots, trains, logistic networks, miles of conveyor belts, train tracks and so on without performance degrade or MP lag)\nimo usable art style, even if that is 2D game it feels really good while playing\ngreat for multiplayer and coop!\ngame has demo version available\nOn edge (or what I would like to see improved): experts and genre veterans may want to get mods (like BoB's mods) to increase challenge and end game content (keep in mind that game is still in development and not everything is there yet)\nreverse difficulty: you start with almost nothing and very vulnerable, but with time you become stronger and almost untouchable to enemies which don't progress that much\nsome unpolished areas: MP browser, server administration tools and so on\nThe bad: (not affects everyone) Game is only available on Steam and main game website, which makes pricing unattractive to some parts of the world. Publisher should make it available on more region markets and for more currencies\nTo sum it up:Factorio is a real gem, that already offers great amount of value, fun and challenging experience for a player. It's well worth its money and can get only better.

The progression of difficulty is almost perfect. Most of the time, your production can always be done the slow and manual, or the complicated automatic way, so that you will never feel overwhelmed by new items and their production lines, since you could also just produce the items by hand without much thought. Tus, it almost always feels like it was your choice to develop new factory systems and you will not quit playing the game because the next step is to hard to achieve.\n\nSome say, the enemies are just annoying and should be turned off, but I think they add a lot to the game, since you always need to consider, if a new production is really necessary to build, or if the resulting pollution could lure in too many enemies.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is the late game shortly before you finish it. Your goal is to build a giant rocket with a satellite aboard and to send it to space. As soon as you managed to develop every production line for this, the last 5-10 hours of the game are just an annoying repetition of firstly fending of the same enemies over and over again with no chance of destroying their spawn ultimately and secondly of finding new sources of ore as soon as the old mines are depleted. The rest of the time is waiting for the damn production to finish, as speding up your production would only lure in more enemies.\n\nSome features of the game seemed relatively useless though: The train system looks nice, but you will not really need many trains to finish the game and thus a complex rail signal network seems pointless. The same is true for the signal network, which I did not use at all (also because the game does not explain anything about how it works). And as cool as the logistic robots seem to be, most of the time they just seem to be useful, when you are too lazy to set up organized transport belts, as the robots are just too expensive, slow and lacking inventory space. In general, most of the technology you can research in the game is a bit disappointing when you finally come to use it. Why build a sophisticated armor with energy fields, when your trusty old tank is still the best bet in the end? Why should you surround yourself with extremely expensive short-lived combat drones that require huge amounts of research, if you never face an enemy without walls or a tank between you?\n\nBut apart from the rather boring last hours and many pointless, though interesting features, it is still a great game that pushes your strategic thinking to the limit so that you can stare at your own factory in awe.","May 8","true","76.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I picked the game up after hearing from a bunch of friends that it was great and also due to the fact that it had a 99% overwhelmingly positive rating on Steam.  The videos and screenshots didn't have me entirely sold on it but I decided to give it a go and within an hour I was hooked on it.  So hooked, in fact, that it became the only game that I played for nearly a week.\n\nThe premise of Factorio is that your ship crashlanded on an alien planet that is rich in raw materials and packed full of hostile creatures.  At first you'll be harvesting resources by hand and trying to set up a small outpost but within a short period of time you'll have set up the basics of your ever-growing industrial assembly network that will process all kinds of resources and goods into increasingly more complex goods.  As your technology level rises the variety and potency of your production will continue to increase.\n\nGameplay clips and screenshots won't give you even a glimpse of the true game experience, which is unfortunate, and because of that I almost passed entirely on this great game.  If you're on the fence at all about it I highly recommend that you pick it up.  You won't be disappointed.  There are few games out there that can give you the feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction that Factorio does all while having a lot of fun putting it together.","March 22","true","28.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

IT even launched on Steam with day 1 Steam controller profile, which works fantastically.\n\nThat said, the *only* bad thing about Factorio is that now that it's on Steam everyone can see how much time I spend on it.\n\nIf you like base building or laying out supply chains or any of that kind of stuff, this game is for you, for sure.

From simple beginnings, you have to build a factory to build a rocket and shoot a satellite into orbit of an alien planet on which you crashlanded. But there are natives too... and they don't like you polluting their planet!\n\nA very addictive game where you will spend hundreds of hours building and optimising your factory until it essentially builds itself. If you like complex puzzle/management games, you won't regret buying this. And if you think that you finally mastered this game and its mechnanics, there's a ton of mods already that crank up complexity through the roof (sadly, there is no Workshop-integration yet, hope they patch that in some time). There's literally thousands of hours to be spent here.\n\nWhile graphically rather utilitarian, this game is otherwise mostly stable (haven't found a serious bug so far, and I've been playing since 2014, I think), there were some MP-problems, but I think they're largely fixed by now. The Devs are very communicative and have added a ton to the game over the development time of this game. Expect great things here!\n\nThis is a 10/10 recommendation.

Starting from a simple game where you just want to automate basic tasks, up to gigantic factories with several train station.\n\nIt's simple : i discovered i loved automating things. A new fetish i guess. Creating blueprints, making robots assemble, disassemble, repair portions of base, building perfect outposts in a click, ... well, it's really endless, and time consuming, and OH MY GOD SO SATISFYING WHEN YOU CLICK AND SEE HUNDREDS OF DRONES FLYING TO CONSTRUCT A PERFECT OUTPOST WHILE LISTENING TO F****G WAGNER.\n\nSo yeah, one thing is sure, having a base running smoothly is the most satis'factory' thing ever. (get it ?)\n\nYou loved games like City Skylines, you loved creating huge cities from scratch and spending countless hours just to make that little path the most efficient possible ? Well, Factorio is really THE game you want.\nIt's been a long time since i haven't opened a graphic app with a grid, just to draw the most space efficient way to place things and to distribute items and upgrades. And i'm not alone. People have been calculating the perfect ratio between solar panels and accumulators guys. And it's scary.\n\nDont stop on the graphics just yet, i know it wont be of everyone's taste. But Minecraft wasn't either, and can become an outstanding game (have you tried advanced factory and automation in Minecraft ? Worth a try.). Really, give it a try. Developpers created a huge game, with a lot of stuff to do, an interesting and stable multiplayer part, and a lot of cool ways to achieve your objectives. You will always start messy, creating a "spaghetti" factory, and start over and over again to create that perfect alignment you always secretly wanted.\n\nI guess i'm only a bit deceived by the scenario part, would have loved to go beyond the initial goal of creating and launching a satellite, but hey that's what the mods are for, and they made that part a breeze for developers. Already been seeing Bob's mod, and also a fun scenario where you build your base inside an always moving train.\n\nSee you later. In a couple days. When Factorio have ruined your life.","February 25","true","63.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","10","10","3","0"

At first I was a bit sceptical, because of the rather high price, but I got it anyway and don't regret it in the slightest. I already sunk countless hours into this lovely game without even realising it.\n\n0.12.33 Review:\n\nPros:\n+ Unlimited Map size is an option\n+ Looks simple, but gets complex very quickly\n+ You can pretty much automize every single Production line\n+ Turrets, Walls and later Armor Piercing Rounds are your best friend\n+ There are already some interesting Mods out there\n+ Great way to kill Time\n+ Addicting & fun\n+ Even better with friends\n+ 2D Graphics are simple, yet beautiful\n+ Runs smoothly and stable\n+ Doesn't need much HD Space\n+ Tanks\n\nCons:\n- You start of rather slowly\n- You also move slowly, until much later in the game\n- Enemies are quiet deadly in big numbers and apply the "Zerg-Rush" tactics\n- Enemies spawn insanely fast, when you attack their "Villages", the only reliable way to get rid of them is with the Tank\n- Early production lines can create Pollution-Clouds, making enemies more likely to attack\n- Tank can get easily overrun by larger Enemies. The Tank also takes a lot of damage from larger Worms\n- No alternative "green" route in the early game. Good ol'Coal stays with you until much later\n- Maps with unlimited size can get very big in file size\n- Story & Music need some improvements\n\nNeutral:\nSpace-Managment is a necessity, along with playing defensively and planing ahead\nYou need EVERY Ressource in the game all the time, 'cept wood\nSince automatic Train Routes are a bit complicated, reading/watching Guides will help you\nBeating the Game requires you to have enemies on the Map, since their buildings have a unique drop after being destroyed, which is necessary for researching technology and crafting\nOn of the few games with a fixed buying price of 20€ instead of the usual 19,99€\nTL;DR:\nFun & Addicting game, where you create huge Production lines to make your life easier. It is in Early Access and obviously not perfect, but it runs smoothly and stable, so far, I didn't crashed once. While the Start and Player Movement is slow, after ca. 2 hours, it will run much faster. You don't have to make everything yourself, just make Machines that craft everything for you. There is a bit of balance issue between larger Enemies and you. From a defensive view, enough Turrets can fend of all enemies, but from an offensive viewpoint, the only safe way to kill enemies and destroy their spawners is with a Tank, but when the Enemies evolve into larger Beasts, the Tank struggles a bit. The Music imo is also not very noticeable. Story lacks a bit, I feel it's a basic story, that works.\n\nIt's a good game overall, I do recommend it, if you like Sandbox games, or complex games.","May 21","true","61.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaldoreign/recommended/427520/","kaldoreign","Kaldo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaldoreign/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFactorio is definitely one of the best base builders I've ever played. My estimate is that I have over 100 hours of playing Factorio before it arrived on Steam and it's still very fun and challenging. With procedurally generated maps, good mod support, adapting difficulty and constant dev updates, there's always something new to try and do in Factorio. If you're the kind of person who loves logistics management, designing functional bases or figuring out optimal designs, this is definitely a game for you.\n\nI believe it also has a free demo so why not give it a try if you're intrigued?\n\nThe good stuff:\nSo, what makes it so special? The answer is simple - it has a perfect balance between micromanagement and macromanagement. In most sandbox basebuilders the early game is the best part - you're constantly challenged by hunger, resource scarcity and enemy strength. In a few hours though, when you improve yourself, enemies become a joke and gathering resources is only a boring chore, with no end in sight.\n\nFactorio turns this dynamic upside down by enabling you to automate almost everything. Even though you're expected to micromanage your resources and defenses in the beginning, very soon you can devise systems that do this for you while you focus on macromanagement - expanding your base, improving your supply lines, bolstering defenses. You don't have to manually dig coal or iron - you have automatic drills for that, you only need to make sure you have enough electricity so they keep working! You don't have to automatically transfer dug iron to your furnaces, you have conveyor belts and inserters that do that for you!\n\nBasically, very soon you become the boss, the architect - your only job is to expand production, advance your tech tree and keep up with the constantly evolving enemy. The bigger your base becomes, the more pollution it creates. While this doesn't bother you, it definitely bothers the local wildlife - depending on multiple variables (like global pollution, time passed, number of destroyed nests), they become more and more aggressive and evolved. They start to migrate, their nests increase in size and new kinds of enemies start to appear that will force you to shift tactics, maybe even go on the offensive and clear out some of the dangerously close nests.\n\nThe tech tree is very extensive and there are many moments when a new techonology completely revolutionizes your factory. For example, unlocking trains completely changes the game if you decide to use them. I've spent countless hours on building complex railroad networks with automated trains that deliver raw resources to my main base. You can make it as simple as one railroad with a 2-way train that delives a resource or you can have multiple delivery points, dozens of trains, roundabouts with signals to prevent crashes, automatic unloading mechanisms, train refueling stations, redundancies to prevent deadlocks... Your imagination is the limit.\n\nAnd this is just one of the examples - when you add flying robotic drones, vehicles, power armor, automated construction, the game becomes even more interesting. In the late game you will feel like a god, building outposts with only a few clicks of your mouse, and it's always satisfying to just sit back and watch your factory work, no matter if it looks like a clockwork mechanism or like spaghetti.\n\nThe bad stuff:\nThere is one major thing that might turn some people away from the game - it is really a pure sandbox. Even though there's a victory condition (building a rocket), it's very arbitrary and ultimately pointless. The game is really fun when you set your own goals and work towards accomplishing them but if you're used to games guiding you by hand, telling you what are you supposed to be doing next... you're gonna be confused and bored in Factorio. There's a campaign that serves as a tutorial, and we're eventually getting custom scenarios / challenges made by devs.. but for the most part, you're left to your own ideas in the endless sandbox mode.\n\nI also want to criticize combat. While it works well for defensive gameplay, attacking and destroying nests can be frustrating at times. In the late game your character can be killed extremely quickly so the best strategy is to just spam drones and explosives while running away from them, and loading the game if you get cornered and killed... or just build turrets close to nests and lure the horde into firing range. I believe the devs said they are going to rework combat eventually so this might not be true for long!\n\nConclusion:\nFactorio is a sandbox basebuilder where your base is an actual defensible, functional entity rather than something you build just for aesthetics, or out of boredom. Rather than forcing you to do all the manul chores, you're in charge of building automated systems that do all the work for you. It has good graphics (stylish 2D sprites), performs good, has stable multiplayer, excellent mod support and receives constant updates by the devs. Even though it's labeled as Early Access, it might as well be released as a finished game and I wouldn't complain - it's working great and has plenty of content, especially considering its price.","February 26","true","38.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

The more you know, the more you want to know. The more you play, well... you get the idea.\nThis game is for people who want to settle in for the long haul - no such thing as a quick game, but make no mistake, every day, hour, minute and second will be filled with something to do. And then redo, when you figure out a better way of doing it.\n\nSo what is Factorio? Essentially, you just need to launch a rocket with a satellite after landing on an alien planet. But you don't have a rocket, and you don't know how to build one. So you have to build research labs, and provide materials for research, but you have to gather those materials. To gather those materials you need mining, smelting, and other equipment. To make those? Well, you start with a pick-axe and work your way up.\n\nSimple, right? Well, no. This isn't your planet. In fact *you* are the alien, and all those factories you're setting up are causing pollution, which the native inhabitants don't very much appreciate. So much so that they will seek you out, hunt you down, and put and end to your day and your factories. So you need to defend, to attack, to improve your military capabilities. You need to decide what's most important to research, and where to expand into, what to build, when to upgrade, and how to move the resources around. And there's limitless ways of doing it.\n\nNeed a hand? Bring a friend! Factorio has multiplayer. While it's still being improved, it's very playable (providing you have a good solid connection). Work together (or against each other) to build the best factories, learn new techniques, and show everyone what you're made of.\n\nFactorio has elements of Minecraft/IndustrialCraft, and for players of RimWorld, and Prison Architect, it's a must have.\n\nThe devs are keenly responsive and deeply care about the community, the forums are active, the game sees weekly progress reports, and frequent updates to fix bugs. There's a plethora of mods, and modding support is fantastic (even the base game is a mod). DyTech and Bobsmods alone will extend the playing life of the game by a huge factor.\n\nSince the game is in early access, and at this time hasn't been released, it's unfair of me to post criticism.\nIf you buy the game, know that you are getting a very solid game right now which is completely playable and will give you many more hours than AAA titles. You will also be supporting an already solid development team, and more and more improved updates will come more and more frequently (as has been demonstrated by the hiring they've done).\n","February 25","true","646.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

That same nostalgy and sense of boundless enthousiasm only kids and teenagers experience, thats what Factorio does to me.\n\nIt has a lot of depth, the amount of building and research is great with some intricate and surprisingly fresh takes like the Roboport and Blueprints and what that means for base development.\nIt is superstable, running at 60fps constantly, even in multiplayer, with no gamebreaking bugs detected (only a very few smalltime things that are easily fixed).\n\nIt is an early access which means it isnt finished.

It's also a game that already has a lot of good content, good game mechanics, a big, interesting research tree and a rather unique method of researching technologies.\n\nThere aren't many games I can honestly say are both currently very good currently, and have a lot of promise to become even better. This is a definite recommendation for anyone interested in large-scale building and design, efficiency and transportation.\n\nThat being said, let's get a list of everything Factorio DOESN'T do right now.\n\nFactorio is not an RTS in the traditional sense. It does not have AI units for you to command, you cannot issue direct orders to units to attack enemy bases (although orders can be given to construct things, albiet through a semi-complicated and late-game researched method)\n\nFactorio is also not combat-centered. Yes, there are enemy alien bases that will send waves of attacking creatures after you, and yes you can build turrets to defend them, and cars, tanks, rocket launchers etc to go out and destroy those bases. But combat is bland, with higher tier enemies simply multiplying the stats of the previous enemies rather than adding new mechanics or new AI strategies. Somewhat counter-intuitively, left click is not used to fire, but rather spacebar. Similarly, the crosshair will stick to the nearest thing to the current mouse position and holding down spacebar causes the player character to fire at maximum speed. This, coupled with the extreme high speed the enemy aliens move at, makes combat somewhat linear and uninteresting as early game strategy devolves into holding down spacebar until either the aliens or the player is dead, and lategame it's more about spamming follower combat robots as damage multiplication.\n\nAdvanced technologies, particularly things like nuclear power, a proper satellite system, electric trains, flyable vehicles, and pollution control mechanics, are not in the game.\n\nThat being said, I still recommend the game. Here's why.\n\nFactorio is fun. This is a super simple one, but it's also one of the most important. What Factorio does do it does very well. Factory building is fun, intuitive and has a learning curve fit to the person playing it. A factory can be as simple or as complex as the player wants, and offers players a lot of freedom in how they want to set everything up.\n\nFactory building is well balanced. A perfect foil to the imperfect combat mechanics, the balanced and interesting factory building is engaging and allows for an almost infinte amount of expandability to any design.\n\nThe game is deep, and takes a lot of time, but is not slow. When I say slow, I mean in terms of waiting. There have been very few times when playing factorio that I've found myself waiting for a lot of time for something to happen. Things in Factorio definitely take a lot of time to shape up, but the reason the game doesn't feel slow is a large supply of things to do. There's always expansions to make, walls and turrets to build to protect from attacks, and enemy bases to go out and stomp.\n\nAll in all, Factorio is a game that is currently good, and can be even better, given enough content updates. The devs have been very active and show no signs of slowing down, so I'm optimistic.\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game a solid 8.5/10.\nPros\nGood design, robost factory mechanics.\nScalability, many ways to play, large number of things to do.\nGame is fun. Very important.Cons\nAnnoying combat mechanics.\nBoring and simple enemy progression.\nMissing a few mechanics and technologies that would make the game wider.","February 29","true","149.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

NOTE: English isn't my mothertongue, so please excuse any language errors I make in this review.\n\nThe GameI'm playing this game now for about 2 years and so far I haven't encountered any gamebreaking bugs (at least not in the experimental/unstable channel). This game is about creating your own Factory using Mines, Furnaces, Transport Belts, Inserters (little cranes that put items from the ground/containers/belts to other ground/containers/belts), Assemblers, later Trains and even later in the game: Drones (like inserters, but not bound to the location).\n\nYou're having very slow start with a coal drill (drills ores using coal) some iron plates and a furnace: Barely enough to get started. You gather resources to create more furnaces and drills, so you don't need to gather all the resources by hand. Now you have to walk between your 2 - 3 mining sites to get your stone, iron and copper and to put new coal into the drills and furnaces. You start building a centralized storage and refueling system for your drills furnaces and resources. You still need to craft everything by hand.\n\nTime for some research!\nYou build your first Steam Dynamos to get electricity and replace your coal drills with electrical drills. Now you build a research facility and research Automation I! You get assemblers! Assemblers craft items for you. e.g. 2 iron plates to 1 iron gear and with another assembler 1 iron gear + 1 copper plate => 1 research pack. Now you have automated your basic research! Yippie!\n\nUp to this time you may still have encountered the first enemies which you had fight of with a simple pistol! Let's research turrets, automate ammunition production, research walls and create a defense line. Now you're pretty save from those biters ... at least for a while. But as time goes by your resources are all used in your factory; You need to find new ore deposits, then transport the resources to your base and hope no biters attack your new outposts.\n\nLater on you get the trains (which can be automated ... what a surprise) with these you have access to even more ore deposits. you know have resources, 90% of your crafting automated and no more space. you'll need to clear of those Biter Bases. Once done you can finallly research the technologies to build a space rocket ... Now you *just* need to build a rocket ... Tada you've finished the game ... if you're fast in about 5to 9 hours. if not in about 100 hours.\n\nIn my singleplayer world I have a small factory and about 30% automized of what i wanted to automized ... after about 50 hours of playtime (on this world)\n\nPros+ Fitting graphics\n+ Very good optimized (doesn't need much RAM/CPU/Graphics/Disk Space)\n+ Nearly bugfree\n+ Nice community\n+ LOADS OF CONTENT\n+ BIG Modding community\n+ Devs who care\n+ Stable Multiplayer\n+ Good Balancing of difficulty (hard, but not too hard)\n+ Still getting more content\n\nCons- if you're not smart enough for this game you'll fail with no mercy!\n- Too cheap\n\n\nGreetings\nPingger","February 25","true","63.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

Or it doesn't do that entirely. That's it.[the bug doesn't happen after a while] Now i cannot really explain what you can do in this game, because im in the early stages myself but the main goal is to make a rocket silo and launch a satellite into orbit. On the way, you will make many remarkable contraptions that you will be proud of.\nI really can't find a way to describe this game so go check out some other reviews. I just felt like i had to share this game's beauty with the people in my steam friends list. This game has 99% positive reviews, too. I guess that should explain what other people think of this game.\nNow if you will excuse me, i will go back to making the Great Wall of Musa.

When the autosave happens it happens pretty quickly and it even notifies me of it.\nThe kind of freeze im talking about is my character is unable to move and im also unable to open the steam overlay. A few seconds later the game kind of "fast forwards" to the point the time was supposed to be.

I had a little look and thought it's just a 2D spaghetti dirt sim and thought, I am never going to get this peice of ♥♥♥♥ game, had another look a few days later and saw 99% positive... 110,000 copies sold... So I thought I'll give it a go right as any normal person would. 5 minutes later I purchased another two copies gifted them to friends.\n\n\nAbout an hour later I thought I was a "top quality expert" at this game, you know setting up automated coal mining, researching etc. But then I had a quick look at the subreddit: www.reddit.com/r/factorio/ and saw this thread here: http://imgur.com/a/xcYxk And I wanted to give up with this game. But a few of my other friends brought the game, so I was a little happy I'd have more friends to play with (They didn't play with me :/).\n\n\nBut occasionaly I'd log onto thier server, talk ♥♥♥♥ about how bad they were, when actually they'd done alot more than me and tbh were alot better than me. Anyway, I'd proceed to steal there ideas, make them slightly different and take screenshots to show off right, as any normal person would do. So I find myself stuck in an endless loop of talking ♥♥♥♥, being jealous, stealing ideas and showing off.\n\n\nSo I've come to the conclusion that this is the point in playing the game, one Dev thought to himself "Why don't we ruin some friendships" and the rest of the team just thought "Maybe we should just give this one to Jimmy, his wife just left him for his best friend, his cat sprinkles just died from gastrointestinal lymphoma and on top of that he knows we hired him out of sympathy". So they did, and let me tell you, they did a marvelous job. 10/10 would talkshit, steal ideas, ruin lives, destroy friendships and go to friendship counciling 3 times a week for $100/hr again. Would buy more copies but wallet is empty from counciling. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wont even pay half *sigh*.\n\n\nTLDR: If you want to have fun, lose friends and feel good about your self after completing the simplest of tasks you'll love this 10/10 game","March 21","true","38.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","100","7","7","9","3"

If you're the kind of person who gets satisfaction out of automating resource collection and production (and who isn't?), this is the game for you.  The first time I got a train network set up with multiple stops I felt like a god.  I've probably only seen 2/3 of the technologies so far, and it's already more game than I could ask for.  Even the parts of the game not related to production are fun - the combat is slightly simplified but it allows just enough control to be satisfying, and I love driving around in the little car to visit my various outposts.

The main goal is to expand your factory infinitely to launch a rocket into space (or just build 'till your computer explodes) in an infinitely generated world while fighting monsters and creatures (peaceful mode exists). If you were to ask me, the biggest monster to fight is tending to your ever growing factory. Why? Well creature combat is as easy as pressing the Space bar (Literally xD) and factory management will test your exponential planning skills since leaving things unattended will cause things to clog and be unefficient at producing materials. That is where this game shines, it integrated its building mechanic into its strategy mechanic, with little to no confusion on how to use anything or how to use the tech tree. When I first started this game, I had no idea what to do, but with a few hours in, everything just fell into place like icing on the cake. This game is a game that puts you in the hotseat, makes you do a job, in which you enjoy doing, and you actually learn something from it to use on the next part of what you'll create. Learning on the job is fun in its own right but even I can say that I've had inefficient builds, clogged up conveyor belts, and have monsters ravage me and my base. Did that stop me from playing even if it takes time and dedication to get yourself drowning in materials? Nope. this game is too highly addicting and mezmerizing in its own right, it made me want to improve and learn more, like a good strategy game, failure comes with its own reward, knowledge and experience.\n\nOverall, this game will forever remain on my favorite games list in my library, even with the ever growing gaming industry I find myself coming back to the good 'ol 2d factory builder (It shows only around 2 hours of gameplay as I write this review since I play offline most of the time). This means a lot, not just to me, but to what games are today, Not about the fancy graphics, but the gameplay itself. I even bought the Soundtrack DLC as well, not just to show my gratitude, but because the music added the right atmosphere to the game, the feeling of being alone, no companions or pets but just you and your trusty brain to build to the 2d horizon.\n\nEarly Access? For 4 Years? Talk about dedication for a game that'll make my history books.

There's some jankiness to some animations, and the world is rather bland visually.  There's not too many different types of terrain, not that terrain makes that much of a difference.  The graphics are just there so you can tell different things apart, pretty much, and for that it accomplishes it's purpose.  Even though the graphics aren't that impressive in themselves, seeing the way your factory moves and works together is always a treat.  The zoom level being alterable on the fly is amazing, and it's actually useable zoom compared to what you'll find in a lot of variable zoom games.\n\nSound and music are more suiting ambience for a factory theme.  There are touch pieces of music that will mostly stay in the background and not irritate you.  That's pretty much what you want from this type of game anyway.  Most of the buildings have appropriate sound effects which is a nice touch.  Accumulator's buzz while charging, assembly machines have pleasing 'Ka-thunk's to them, and so on.\n\nObviously the meat of the game is in it's gameplay, and how wonderful it is.  It's a game of constantly expanding scale.  As you go on you get faster and more efficient at doing more and greater things, but you need to keep two steps ahead if you want those greater things not to crumble before your eyes.  Your resources don't last forever, you need to expand, expanding takes resources.  You need to be reaching out before it's too late.  There are always easy ways to transport goods huge distances, but the more expansions you make the less attention you can give to each.  You need to plan them to fend for themselves, because you'll have other things to deal with.  Five million other things, and if you solve one, three more things will appear.\n\nYou have a vast, infinite and expansive world to build your factory, but somehow you'll always be faced with difficulties trying to find space.  You need to connect resource A to Factory B, but Factory C's connection to Resource Y is in the way, and there's pipes from Resource K where you want your line to go.  If you don't want your factory looking like a spaghetti nightmare, you need to keep organized and manage your space well.  New resources and available goods will always add new difficulties in trying to hook everything up.\n\nThe enemies live on the frontier, making you think twice about expansion.  The game tempts you to sit on that iron until it's gone, but this is folly.  You'll learn where and when to expand, how to do it, and how to deal with the enemies you face.  The more you pollute, the stronger and more numerous your enemy, and the sooner they will be upon your doorstep.  The existence of hostiles makes tension from an infinite land, you try to remain tight as possible to reduce your footprint creeping up to the enemy bases, a delicate balance of clunking machines.  It's actually kind of brilliant.\n\nThe enclosed campaign mode is quite short, but it eases you in most of the game.  I hope that this section will be expanded before early access is over.  The last campaign mission ends with you having only maybe half of the tech-tree unlocked.  The later stuff definitely could use scenarios too, because the later stuff is game changing and can be a headache in itself.  This is where things can fall apart, as the game does not always give you all the information that you need to advance.  While it's in early access, expect to look to wikis, forums, videos and the like to get the basics down.  Once you UNDERSTAND everything that's available to you (which is quite a feat in itself), you'll start making better decisions, better factories.\n\nIf you like building games, If you like sandbox games, if you like sim games, don't hesitate.  Get this.  You'll love it.\n\nIf you like games that make you use your brain, definitely, there's enough teasing and conveyor belt puzzles in here for days.\n\nIt's an amazing enough game to convince me to write my first Steam Review, and I know there may be thousands of others saying good things, but I felt it important enough.  We need games like this, we need MORE games like this.  There are things that could be more fleshed out, but this is an absolute 100% recommend from me.\n\n\n\n","March 4","true","102.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Even back then it was a fresh and unique idea to build your own factory. The first few moments I've played I knew I will love this game. It's probably best described as kind of a puzzle adventure action strategy simulation.\nThere is so much content, I'm sure it will take a many days of your precious life until you discover and build everything Factorio has to offer. The game is about managing your transport belts, so you can get everything where you want to have it. The game is about creating a network of materials and advanced products, e. g. the third generation of science packs is incredibly complicated if you don't have any clue about everything works as the game is also about the joy of figuring out how to accomplish certain things. I remember being very happy when I've finally figured out how to let drones place your solar panels automatically with a blueprint.\nAlthough admittedly the game can be a little scary at first considering the amount of content included, Factorio is ten (or even a hundred times) more satisfying and rewarding. There are no obvious bugs to be found since the devs put so much effort in bugfixing it's almost unbelievable. As far as I remember every major version has been being checked for even the tiniest and nastiest bug for weeks - or rather months. All machines, trains, resources, transport belts, trees - everything - look just beautiful. If you can't see the love put into this game here then you are probably a lost cause. lol\nSeriously, if you have a soft spot for either puzzlers, adventure, action, strategy or simulation games I can highly recommend this gem. You will get so much content for its money, Factorio certainly doesn't need to hide behind the one or other AAA game.\nOh, did I mention it even has multiplayer?\n\nAlso, make sure to read about the whole development process in the Factorio blog[www.factorio.com].","February 25","true","10.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The amount of depth, functionality of the game in its ALPHA state, and the fact that it is damn well near 100% operable, deems this game a true gem. To add onto that, it has DRM free builds after you purchase just register with factorio.com to get your DRM builds. It works and runs independant in .zip formats, or install instances. This game truly is worth it. I'll write a more indepth review after the 13.0 update, as theirs far to much worth mentioning. If your reading this and wondering though, i STRONGLY urge you to play the demo before investing in it, you'll definitely love it, and will immediately want to buy it, trust me, if your a fan of building, survival, and goal oriented games, get this game.","May 29","true","236.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Though not important to the review itself, I am attempting to express how sure I am that I love this game, and to express to the developers how much I appreciate the tireless efforts they have made and will make to ensure that their product continues to grow and improve. Over more than a year, I put many hours into Factorio before it was released to Steam. Here are my thoughts.\n\nThe game is complexly simple. Start with nothing and, with as few boundaries as possible, build something. The style is up to you, but the game mechanics is factory-based automation. For those of you familiar with MineCraft’s factory-style mods, the concept will be familiar, but the execution vastly distinct.\n\nAs you build up and produce more pollution, the critters start trickling in. It is possible to lose to their attacks, but that will probably only happen if you aren’t watching and they find a fatal flaw in your design (or power grid). So, don’t worry about this being a combat-based game if you aren’t into that. 99.9% of the attacks are thwarted by automated defenses, anyway, with only the first couple or so requiring the use of your personal weapon.\n\nAs I said, complexly simple. The goal is simple at this point, but how you get there is up to you. Build a compact base or a sprawling megafactory. Build railways far and wide or just to a few key points. You will have to expand some and you will always have to keep new expansions in mind, maintaining power and defenses. When you get to where you can end it, it’s your choice. Keep playing all you want, or move on to starting over.\n\nI easily sunk over 70 hours into each map I played, though I admit my play style is slow and steady.\n\nAs for the cons of purchasing, there are none for me. I consider it one of my best random finds. If you want the flashiest graphics, you will be a bit disappointed. If you want a deep story, that’s not here. But, if you want to sink some serious hours into building something that has your unique stamp on it, and you like maximizing production line efficiency (including your own layout) while throwing in a dash of base defense and exploration, you may enjoy this game, as I have.\n\nThe small development team is still adding content and improvements to this title. Some things may change, but it’s already got enough that it’s worth the money if you think this may be for you.","March 8","true","0.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Repeatedly. Throughout a single session.\n\nIt does a great job at eating your time and rewarding you with a great feel of accomplishment as you grow your base, producing more and more goods of increasing complexity, making you redesign every part over and over as you unlock new technology and learn new tricks.\n\nAnd all that with a very astonishing amount of polish even in this stage of development. In more than 600h of playing I encountered one (1) crash to desktop. One. In a session with 20+ mods. And just because I went ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and went so large I ran out of RAM. Upgraded RAM, problem solved. Until I ran out of RAM again, ~60h later ...\n\nConclusion: First game to make me upgrade my RAM, twice.

The end goal is (currently) to launch a rocket into space, however to get there you must automate the production of headache inducing assemblies to get science packs for researching, while fending off the local wildlife and all the while maintain enough energy to run your base and try to maintain an idea what the conveyor belt spaghetti you just made is doing exactly. Of course with careful planing and generous space allocations one can avoid the problem of having to cram another two assemblers into an already tight space, having a mess of belts or fluids mixing in the pipelines and instead you have straight forward assembly lines that are extendable and dependable with straight belts and a minimal use of logistics bots.\nThere is a ton of mods available for all kinds of purposes and it is decently simple to write them yourself or modify existing ones to suit your needs. The only drawback is that there is currently no automated updating feature for mods, such as steam workshop and that some game updates may change the way mods need to be implemented, invalidating a whole bunch of them.","March 9","true","15.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've probably put around 200 hours into the game outside of steam.\n\nAs a child I loved video games, I loved all kinds of games, from platformers to RTS games, and I remember as a child, I would always be sad when I looked at the time.  Where had it all gone?  It felt like I had only been playing for an hour.  But now its 10:00 and my mother would tell me time to go to sleep.  How had six hours gone by? Is the clock broken?\n\nAt some point while growing up, this feeling stopped happening to me, I would look at the clock, and not be surprised by how much time has passed. I knew how long I had been playing games for.  Though I never really thought about this feeling again, that is, until I played Factorio.\n\nI remember, the first time I played Factorio, I told my friend I was playing it, and he didn't know what it was, however it was at that point he said to me "Hey don't you have work tomorrow, shouldn't you go to sleep?"  At first I thought he was insane, after all it was only five in the afternoon, and I hadn't even eaten dinner yet, well that is until I looked at the clock.  It was currently 1:30 AM.  I had played the game and truly lost myself in it, forgot that time, obligations, and even food existed.\n\nThis would go on to happen multiple nights afterwards.\n\nThis game is so addicting and fun, every moment you play you feel like there's something more you can do, something greater, faster, with better efficiency, or even jam things in trying to make them fit.  Constantly the game makes the player feel smart as hell when they figure out a new mechanic, or figure out how to do something better.  So many times I've looked at something in the game and thought to myself, "There's no way I can do that! Unless..." and four hours later I have accomplished what I was trying to do, not because things are tedious or take too long, but because I'm desperately trying to figure out how to move my current setup to jam one more thing inside.\n\nThis game is pure fun, and addicting, there are very few games that truly absorb all my attention, causing me to lose track of time.  This game is one of them, and I would recommend this game to anyone.","February 25","true","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ulius4/recommended/427520/","ulius4","melting_wax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ulius4/","512 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFactorio is a great, unique game, which offers engaging, creative gameplay despite its clear weaknesses. At it's core it's a game about logistic problem solving, that let's you finally create inspiring, huge scale factories, where everything just clicks and works.\n\nIt bears the fascination of inventing and creating your own working tools and also offers room for experimentation with its systems and design. The core gameplay is so entertaining and satisfying, you'll gladly keep on playing although you've already reached the end goal. Expanding and optimizing your factory, inventing better designs or just revisiting an older factory and looking what you've come up with is nice. Trying different ways to do things is nice. And doing everything very large scale is mostly fun, because the game's mechanics are carefully chosen to make the gameplay fun, demanding and motivating at the same time, for example:\nFactorio offers tools to alleviate micro management. You don't need to place every thing yourself, later on you create blueprints of larger parts of your factory and can duplicate them easily. But to do this you need to create bots and you need to design your factorio in a way that copy-pastable and flexible. Designing blue prints is a nice little game in itself and allows very quick expansion. You get a nice transition from early to late game, while naturally being offered new challenges.\n\nOther high points:\nFactorio's mod support is great. You can add a lot of stuff and it isn't that hard to do.\nIt's highly optimized. Your factories will get VERY huge, before you notice any fps slowdown.\nI'd like to discuss some of weak points of factorio:\nrepetitivness: While trying different builds is fun, an optimal solution is found after a while and there's no advantage in getting creative after that. It's fun, but the game doesn't reward you. If you're not the kind of player, who can reward himself or likes to put challenges on himself you might get bored after 2-4 factories or feel the need to try mods.\nunderused Systems: the train system and the logistic system are both interesting and fun to play around with. The problem is that they're not needed in the core game atm. Trains are more expensive to set up and require more effort to organize and expand. They're still great fun to play around with. It's more obvious with the logistic system. You can coun't items, make some parts of your factory work depending on some inputs etc., which is nice to toy with but ... unnecessary. You don't get any real benefit from using those systems. The game is fine without them, so it's not a big deal, but it feels slightly wrong having those great, but somewhat useless tools.\nCombat is weak! It's a nice early game pressure, forces you to spend resources to defend your base and makes exploration a little risky (not much). In the mid-game it's mostly tedious and is certainly the most unfun part of the game, especially clearing biter nests becomes boring the second time you do it.\nIf you enjoy the trailer buy Factorio! It shows exactly what it offers and if the thought of creating a large scale automated factory sounds fun to you, you'll definitely find that in Factorio, it's executed very well!","February 26","true","19.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"What the hell is this crap?" I thought. A while later I saw there was a demo, includes the first 3 scenario levels that give you an idea of what the game is about. I was sold instantly after finishing that.\n\nTry the demo, in itself a rarity amongst Early Access games. Even better? The demo is actually representative of the actual game.\n\nIf I had one complaint it would be that after the tutorial scenarios are over, you get thrown in to the main freeplay mode of the game that opens up tons of items and machines you have never seen, nor much, if any explanation of what they do. Thankfully some very helpful people have created very useful guides for Factorio.\n\nWhile I lose many many hours of my life to this game, I'm reminded of Towns. Not Towns as the burning, radioactive train wreck it is now, but Towns a few years back, where the Devs still gave a damn, had the basics of an amazing game with almost unlimited potential. Factorio tickles the same part of my brain that Towns did except instead you use conveyor belts and automated drones instead of civillians and you place buildings down to create production complexes rather than bricks to make a building.","March 30","true","146.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It can be hectic if you want it to be, but there are enough options when you start the game to set it up to be as slow or fast paced as you like.\nYou can turn off the enemy initiated attacks and make the playfield huge to give you time to learn. And there is lots of learnin to be had :-)\nThe complexity of your factories builds up over time so that helps too.\nIt always starts off with a lot of manual work, but its not long until you eventually automate it more and more. Don't be put off by the first stages where you have to dig and mine and stoke the furnaces yourself. It is not long before you get all that automated and you can start focusing on how to grow your megafactory and work out how to get the resources to where you need them.\nYou definately need to use the wikis and tutorial vids to get your head around some of the concepts. There are some very clever and efficient ways of arranging things that I just didnt even concieve until I watched some of the excellent getting started vids.\nDont be fooled by the early access either.

This game is wicked.\n\nI saw the trailer and immediately went, "Shut up and take my money." So far, it hasn't dissappointed.\n\nYou can build automated production lines or factories to build things you want in game, whilst possibly fending off attacks by the native aliens. You can start off by building a couple of coal fired mining drills to getting very complex machines that can produce near enough anything you want. The amount of items you can build from six basic materials is incredible.\n\nThe game is built that heavily on you automating things, you naturally go back to your old stuff to try and improve it.\n\nIn my case, I have started off with a very big, peaceful map to get the hang of things. I started off with a very large and very messy factory for producing research which didn't produce alot. At one point I ended up running a few production lines through the middle of a factory trying to get one thing made. Very exhausting but worth the effort and very satisfying.\n\nThen the following day, I came back and built a brand new factory to do the exact same thing. Only instead the factory took far less space, was much more efficent, and produced far more research and other products. And unlike the previous one, can be expanded. So so satisfying to improve things.\n\nI have never felt a game which felt so satisfying to work with rather than just play.\n\n10/10, looking forward to see what else I do with it.","March 17","true","38.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You do something by hand at first, then automate it, then automate the automation. You get a lot of headscratchers when you try to get more complex stuff to flow, you rebuild your factory, you redesign everything.\nThen something goes wrong, you realize you don't produce enough red circuits, you examine the problem and realize you don't produce enough plastics, because you don't have enough coal because your smeltery eats up all of it.\nOr your electricity goes out and you spend half an hour getting it back up by feeding boilers by hand.\nProblems are complex, because there are layers and layers of systems built on each other, and you only notice that something is wrong when the problem reaches the top layer, and you have to peel them back one by one.\n\nIf you are a completionist, you can get a ton of fun just tinkering your factory, make it more efficient, find the perfect ratios, realizing golden rules (like producing copper cable only on demand).\nBut vanilla doesn't make you use trains and the enemies are very easy to fend off. If you want to use the awesomeness that are huge train systems, you really need to use some mods, like RSO. Then you will get another couple hours figuring out how to place signals and chain signals to not get deadlocks. Transport Tycoon players have an advantage here.\nOther mods, especially the big overhaul ones make the game fresh for even seasoned people. You have to figure out new ways to make your factory work.\n\nThen add multiplayer to the picture, and the social aspect makes the game fun and cool again. Sharing roles means you can concentrate on the stuff that makes you tick, leaving the rest to the teammates, the more twitchy guys can go clear enemies, collecting the alien stuff, while the more planner types never even touch a weapon.\n\nAll in all, if you want fast action, this is not your game. On the other hand, if you like to tinker and think about designs.","February 27","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is now on Steam early access and more polished than most titles on release.\n\nThe core gameplay is mining resources, constructing factories and eventually working towards automating the process. The experience is comparable to playing an incremental game, but a lot faster and with very enjoyable controls. It is deep and content rich and one of the few games where the mods are of a quality and depth that they add a lot to the game without breaking the core gameplay.\n\nI've played around 200 hours of Factorio before it came to steam, alone, with a friends and in a group and the multiplayer fulfills the promise minecraft never delivered on for me that you can really build something amazing together with your friends.","February 27","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the process of doing so you'll see multiple inefficiencies and plan a new, better factory.\n\nWhen you start the next map, your friend will see what you started with and stare agape into the abyss to which you have plunged.

I've put hundreds of hours since May 2014 into it, and I don't regret any minute of it. There's not much to say that hasn't been said in other reviews, so just this: Watch the two trailers. If you can't imagine yourself playing something like that, walk away. If you're intrigued though, buy it and never regret your decision. It absolutely delivers on what it promises, and it has a lot more to it than that.\n\nApart from that: one of the most helpful and friendly communities I ever encountered, a great developer team which listens to its community (and is absolutely anal about bugs; I am pretty sure you hardly encountered a game that ran as smooth as Factorio did in early alphas), full modding support, which means: if it's not there, somebody might have already done it. And the modding community for this game, while small at the moment, already did some really cool stuff!

The thing that gets me is that it is extremely accessible but yet still retains such a massive amount of functions and gameplay quirks. Everything functions and it's simple enough to where it's not overwhelming with only a handful of natural resources but the amount of creativity you can put into this is insane. The game is about efficiency and hence the game's mechanics are just that as well. Starting from old fashioned drills burning hydrocarbons manually and digging up ores by hand to eventually creating vapor power cycle monstrosities that belch out smoke and exhaust in synchronization to the belts feeding coal down the line to where robotic arms grab and place into the boilers which then funnels water to the steam turbines to generate electricity to then feed your new electric mines in an ongoing effort to automate everything, and I mean everything. Planning it all out and seeing it all work is a real joy, having to look around and fix mistakes and to really think about how to optimize the entire setup. But there are also bugs to deal with. It's an ugly planet, it's a bug planet. I am really happy that the development team is very on top of this game and constantly adding new features and mechanics as I think this could be something very very special. It's everything I always wanted out of a late 90's RTS ala Command and Conquer Tiberian Sun mixed with the open world building of Minecraft, but it does the latter extremely well.\n\nOverall, a fantastic time sink with a huge array of researchables and building potential.","March 24","true","14.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Sharing roles means you can concentrate on the stuff that makes you tick, leaving the rest to the teammates, the more twitchy guys can go clear enemies, collecting the alien stuff, while the more planner types never even touch a weapon.\n\nAll in all, if you want fast action, this is not your game. On the other hand, if you like to tinker and think about designs.","February 27","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I like to think that I'm doing everything in a game, especially a resource-based game, to maximize my efficiency. That means I spent a lot of time looking at guides and people who really know how to play the game, instead of actually playing it. This week I decided I would break out of my old comfort zone and simply try to have some fun with the damn thing.\n\nSURPRISE! It's a good game, it's a great game, even. But it does have a few flaws. A few more tooltips in the tech tree would be helpful, as would a simple addition of a graphical guide to explain transport belt mechanics in greater detail (both can be found in the wiki, but in-game would smooth some of the learning curve.\n\nIn short, abandon your need to min-max everything, and just have fun with the game.

The thing that gets me is that it is extremely accessible but yet still retains such a massive amount of functions and gameplay quirks. Everything functions and it's simple enough to where it's not overwhelming with only a handful of natural resources but the amount of creativity you can put into this is insane. The game is about efficiency and hence the game's mechanics are just that as well. Starting from old fashioned drills burning hydrocarbons manually and digging up ores by hand to eventually creating vapor power cycle monstrosities that belch out smoke and exhaust in synchronization to the belts feeding coal down the line to where robotic arms grab and place into the boilers which then funnels water to the steam turbines to generate electricity to then feed your new electric mines in an ongoing effort to automate everything, and I mean everything. Planning it all out and seeing it all work is a real joy, having to look around and fix mistakes and to really think about how to optimize the entire setup. But there are also bugs to deal with. It's an ugly planet, it's a bug planet. I am really happy that the development team is very on top of this game and constantly adding new features and mechanics as I think this could be something very very special. It's everything I always wanted out of a late 90's RTS ala Command and Conquer Tiberian Sun mixed with the open world building of Minecraft, but it does the latter extremely well.\n\nOverall, a fantastic time sink with a huge array of researchables and building potential.","March 24","true","14.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

The true joy of this game is the sense of accomplishment one gets from setting up machines to build an otherwise complicated item in bulk, often in hundreds and thousands of units. Each step up is practically logarithmic, requiring many resources that get refined and folded back into themselves. It's strange to say, but the closest feeling to pulling this off is when you finally kill a difficult boss in Dark Souls- you are faced with a challenge that seems insurmountable until you chip away at it and figure out the quirks by trial and error, even if it isn't obvious at first.\n\nYou will go through 3 phases of thinking with each new challenge: What do I have to do, How do I do it, and How do I do it more better? Factorio will draw you in for hours as you make strides in automation and fix any shortages that crop up from your increased production.\n\nThe best TL;DR comes from a Reddit comment: "I have to expand my base to meet the needs of expanding my base".","March 5","true","42.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

A couple of years back I followed a rumor on a forum and go to see the trailer, and then for about 18 hours I literally could not stop thinking about this game.\n\nI just HAD to try it. I couldn't really afford it at the time, but I HAD to.\nSo I bought it anyway.\n\nI then emerged from my apartment about a week later, having run out of food and thus being forced to stop playing.\nThis game takes all the best parts from survival games and sim games alike (most heavily transport tycoon) and turns them into pure crack cocaine.\nEvery time you build something your mind starts working on future plans on where to go next, and even before you've halfway managed to construct that you realize there's a better way to do it, and THEN after you've finally put all those elaborate plans into action and built your factory the way you wanted it and give it a look-over...\n\n...you realize it's some sort of mechanical spaghetti monster from space, having landed on the planest nose first and splattered conveyor belts in a hadhazard pattern that literally makes no sense at all.\nExcept it does. Or rather, it DID while you were bulding it. You know exactly what each part of this overly complicated machine does and how it works, but with that last tech you just researched you realize you'll have to somehow pull this whole thing apart to fit the new stuff in, and you realize that it might actually be easier to just do it all over again.\n\nSo, you start over from the beginning, thinking that THIS time you'll anticipate all the pitfalls and make the machine perfect.\n\nEven after restarting for the 12:th time you'll STILL come back for more, mind brimming with ideas on how to improve your next design.\nAnd as you've finally put your best end-all, new and improved, iterated and perfected factory design into practice, you just quietly sit there and soak in the poetic sights of your latest creation. A new spaghetti of conveyers transporting goods in weird loops and excessive workarounds that only it's creator could love.\n\nAnd what a thing of beauty, it is.","March 25","true","32.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Which if you can already tell, usually is a trademark of a good game.\n\nFactorio is a game about automation, a subject very few if any games tend to build their core theme around. The general idea is you start out on a hostile planet with nothing but a few iron plates in your pockets, and from that you create a sprawling megafactory belching pollution into the atmosphere like it's the industrial revolution. This factory produces everything from small gear wheels to monstrous death tanks and beyond. This fuel for megalomania is achieved by creating machines to do the crafting and hard working for you; miners to do your digging, inserters to do your lifting, conveyors to do your moving, smetlers to do your smelting and assemblers to do your crafting. All the while enraging the natives.\n\nThe replay-ability, at least for me comes from the process of streamlining your factory. The first time you play, your base will most likely be a total spaghetti mess with conveyors overlapping conveyors overlapping everything else in a glorious logistical disaster. But as you play new files you'll gradually make the process more efficent and more clean which then snowballs into expansion, in short, this game is perfect if you love hoarding resources as efficently and cost effectivley as possible.\n\nFor an early access title, it's one of the most amazingly well done games I've had the pleasure of playing for a long time and is well worth the money, though a word of warning; If you have a life or upcoming deadlines, don't buy this game because it'll suck the play time right out of you.\n\n\nTL;DR checklist\n\nThe Good:\n- Fantastic gameplay\n- Little to no bugs or errors\n- Lovely graphical style\n- Wonderful soundtrack\n- TRAINS\n- Did I mention TRAINS?!\n\nThe Meh\n- The end-game as of now may turn some people off, but if the idea does, hold out until later, they're bringing in space to the equation!\n\nThe Bad\n- Trains can kill you when you try to high five them as they go past\n- You can't pollute the world fast enough to roleplay a greedy capitalist","March 28","true","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you can't imagine yourself playing something like that, walk away. If you're intrigued though, buy it and never regret your decision. It absolutely delivers on what it promises, and it has a lot more to it than that.\n\nApart from that: one of the most helpful and friendly communities I ever encountered, a great developer team which listens to its community (and is absolutely anal about bugs; I am pretty sure you hardly encountered a game that ran as smooth as Factorio did in early alphas), full modding support, which means: if it's not there, somebody might have already done it.

A couple of years back I followed a rumor on a forum and go to see the trailer, and then for about 18 hours I literally could not stop thinking about this game.\n\nI just HAD to try it. I couldn't really afford it at the time, but I HAD to.\nSo I bought it anyway.\n\nI then emerged from my apartment about a week later, having run out of food and thus being forced to stop playing.\nThis game takes all the best parts from survival games and sim games alike (most heavily transport tycoon) and turns them into pure crack cocaine.\nEvery time you build something your mind starts working on future plans on where to go next, and even before you've halfway managed to construct that you realize there's a better way to do it, and THEN after you've finally put all those elaborate plans into action and built your factory the way you wanted it and give it a look-over...\n\n...you realize it's some sort of mechanical spaghetti monster from space, having landed on the planest nose first and splattered conveyor belts in a hadhazard pattern that literally makes no sense at all.\nExcept it does. Or rather, it DID while you were bulding it. You know exactly what each part of this overly complicated machine does and how it works, but with that last tech you just researched you realize you'll have to somehow pull this whole thing apart to fit the new stuff in, and you realize that it might actually be easier to just do it all over again.\n\nSo, you start over from the beginning, thinking that THIS time you'll anticipate all the pitfalls and make the machine perfect.\n\nEven after restarting for the 12:th time you'll STILL come back for more, mind brimming with ideas on how to improve your next design.\nAnd as you've finally put your best end-all, new and improved, iterated and perfected factory design into practice, you just quietly sit there and soak in the poetic sights of your latest creation. A new spaghetti of conveyers transporting goods in weird loops and excessive workarounds that only it's creator could love.\n\nAnd what a thing of beauty, it is.","March 25","true","32.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

To do so you need to research technologies and build factories that do the work for you. Everything in this game can be automated.\n\nYou start small by mining resources by hand but gradually unlock new technologies and buildings. You can build huge train networks, a logistics system with robots that fly around delivering items to other chests and yourself and a lot of different kinds of weapons, like a flamethrower, missiles, tanks, 3 kinds of combat robots and laser turrets which you will need, as the natives (called biters and spitters) on this planet will try to destroy your base if it creates too much pollution.\n\nWhat I like most about this game is that you can rebuild it anytime without the need to invest resources again, as removing a building just places it in your inventory and it can be placed someplace else instantly.\nAs soon as you have construction robots, you can duplicate parts of your factory or your whole factory by blueprinting with a selection box and place it somewhere else, which makes it easy to expand your factory without manually having to place things down.\n\nThe map is procedurally generated and infinite in every direction, also giving you the option to change ore/oil/enemy size, frequency and richness as well as starting area (how far away the nearest biters spawn) among other settings.\nThere is also peaceful mode, when activated the aliens will not attack you unless you attack them first.\n\nThere is an active modding community that has made a lot of useful mods like trains that automatically lay rail tracks, remote train control, mods that show you the remaining ore in your ore fields and complete overview over the logistics network. There are also several big mods that add faster and improved machines, new intermediate products so you need to rethink your factory and new technologies.\n\nThe devs are very transparent with the development of their game, they are posting some insight about the game and upcoming features every friday on their blog (Factorio Friday Facts) for over 2 years now.\nThey also listen to the players. When they announced a new entity (the Circuit Network Connector) required to connect a building to that network a few weeks ago, most of the players were against that change so the devs revised that idea.\n\nIf you're even a little bit interested, the devs have a demo on their website: http://www.factorio.com/demo/stable\nwhich is a rarity for most games these days.","February 26","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The one criticism I have is that in the main campaign the 3rd level (the one with virtually no resources where you must destroy all the colonies with what weapons you have) seems really high in difficulty even on 'normal' mode. Maybe I'm just not a hardcore gamer, but truth be told I couldn't beat that one without cheating (and believe you me, I tried).\n\nI have a suggestion, actually. It struck me that with the story setting -- that you're a marrooned space traveler building his/her way back into space -- something very basic was missing. Shelter. Productivity's all well and good but even if you've got an infinite supply of freeze-dried space rations you're still going to want somewhere to spend the night or sit down after a while (speaking in-character, of course). I'd suggest a three-tier "housing" solution:\n\n-A low-tech wood and stone 'shack' that can be entered like a vehicle. While inside, the player's health regenerates more quickly (useful for recovering after enemy encounters).\n\n-A medium-tech 'bunker' that has a radar as one of it's ingredients. Better health regeneration than the shack, plus a large "sensor zone" around it that will pre-emptively alert the player when enemies are detected (serving as an early warning system for attacks). Needs to be hooked up to the power grid to function.\n\n-A high-tech 'command center' that is basically the bunker on steroids. Very high armor and a built-in weapon system. Independently powered (batteries and other power tech items would be ingredients) with high player health regen bonus, command centers are ideal for staking out new resource claims in dangerous territories. Could also have storage capacity to further enhance its usefulness.\n\nHope you like the idea!","March 5","true","86.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The graphics are old school but nice and smooth and it’s a great game all around but you may just have to play this one yourself to find out how much of a gem this game truly is. From the very beginning you start producing iron and coals to conveyor belting them to their stations advancing in technology and then building rails and locomotives to move goods from one place to another.\n\nThis is a pure sandbox game with no true motive, however it may seem that you can fight many aliens for territory, I have never tried that as I was always in peaceful mode. As you advance in technology you must run more and more machines, provide power to them with power lines and just go to town with building and exploring new techniques and logic systems to get the job done.\n\nThis is indeed a fantastic game with much life, little to no bugs, and to top it all off it is highly modifiable and multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggrock/recommended/427520/","eggrock","trending idiocy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggrock/","240 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFactorio has been available as an early access game from the developer's website for.. I don't know how long. I bought it in 2014 and even then the game was stable and didn't suffer from any performance issues (aside from a short stutter of half a second while the game autosaved.) That issue is long gone becasue the developers have focused a majority of their efforts on preparing as bug free an experience as possible for the Steam release. It's worth noting that the devs have been responsive, extremely consciencous and dilligient about squashing bugs, and have generally been awesome. Performance improvements have been added over time that allow MASSIVE factories to be created without appreciable lag.\n\nThe heart of the game involves building an automated production system step by step. For a very short period you will need to manually mine resources from the earth and wave your magic space wand to create tools that will mine them for you. Those tools require fuel which comes primarily from coal as an early resource, which powers machines that mine resources, smelt ores and generate electricity. Electric tools run faster and cleaner (more on pollution in a bit) which allows you to more quickly build parts and machines, all the while researching new technologies that lead to more new machines and even more advanced technologies. Basically, you're climbing up the tech. tree so you can do more stuff.\n\nAs you progress your research, materials gathering and production capacity, you will soon find that your pollution output has annoyed the natives, and they will periodically gather and attack the structures you created, or attack you on sight if you wanter too close to them. Of course you're able to equip personal weapons and build automated defense systems, and automated resupply is possible for your automated turrets (which require bullets) and later, your own inventory.\n\nEventually you'll extract and process oil, build trains and flying robots that carry goods to you or your factory storage facilities, as well as build or repair structures. The latter type of bot can work from blueprints you create, allowing you to quickly replicate part of your factory with a click of the button.\n\nAs with most games like this the devil is in the details and you have a physical factory layout to consider, from mining resources, to smelting them into useable materials, to refining and combining them in various ways to create the multitude of things you will need to advance to the end game. The game becomes quite complex and you will find yourself reaching technological plateaus that may require you to refactor parts of your production floor in order to get the most efficient layout possible. In later playthroughs you will know what to expect and can plan more efficiently, but there are always new challenges and bigger goals to reach.\n\nIt is possible to create logic gates in game and do fun stuff with them, including starting or stopping parts of your factory for whatever criteria you want. Running out of rock? Stop making stone walls. Need more circuits? Turn that on until you refill your supply. Robots and trains can move materials around and keep things flowing efficiently, but the materials cost of robots can be high and your train system can become complex. OpenTTD users will be comfortable with trains in Factorio--newbies, you're going to face a learning curve.\n\nGame mods include a set of tutorial missions, three types of custom scenarios and a regular game with no specific goals. There is also a map editor which allows you to create custom maps and scenarios. Scenario logic is accomplished via Lua scripts that are fairly straightforward. This gives you a variety of game play, including peaceful worlds with no (or passive) natives, or hell worlds that start you off surrounded by massive amounts of enemies and limited resources and space to work with. The choice is yours.\n\nOh yeah, there's multiplayer.\n\nThis game is awesome people.","February 25","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It took me 1 month to complete, as a very casual player, for a total of 64 hours. And I feel like I didn't get enough, yet! Those hours flew away like crazy :D\n\nExploring is a little bit boring due to the barren/repetitive world and doesn't make much sense after a while if not for the resources. But that's fine, it's not an exploration-centric game.\nFighting is fun when using a tactical approach. Trying to have an action approach is near impossible, the aliens attack so quick you'll be lucky if you get even one shot at them! Turrets (like tower defense), kiting and things like that are the best choices and they're very fun.\nResearching is also fun, but it would definitely benefit from a proper tech tree and some more descriptive text, with interlocking requirements and somesuch.\nRefitting/deporting industrial sectors is also fun, there's incredible room for improvement, always!\n\nWhat I'm working on sometimes is optimising the infrastructure, like using less space, less buildings, less buffers, and wasting less resources and time. I enjoy this a lot, it gives room to creativity.\n\nThe time factor is the real measure of success, it is possible to do everything if you have infinite time. But doing something quickly (not placing buildings faster, but ramping up production and efficiency) is a very different thing. Sometimes it requires a lot of work to get timing right without wasting speed modules on the wrong/useless places.\n\nA better story mode would be great, the tutorial missions are somewhat scarce on the duration side, they're quickly dispatched. Luckily, sandbox mode has a lot of settings to keep interest up. But some more things would be nice.\n","February 25","true","29.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're so lazy that you decide that creating a furnace will save your life. Well it didn't, but hey lets slap some iron in there because we're bored. Woah, iron plates, cool I'll just put that in my incredibly large pocket. Oh ok, a big a$$ bug is here, wonder wh- K my hand is gone, lets make guns and turrets and cranes and drills and conveyer belts and explode because you decided putting hot coal on oil would be a good idea.\n\n\nIn Factorio, you are an engineer who crashes on a planet with very little resources to begin with. Your ultimate goal is to fly the heck out of there before you're bug food, but you need to go through multiple technologic advancements in order to build a Rocket Ship. The tech tree, art, sounds, and gameplay all work so greatly together to deliver an old timey ps2 2000s feel, you just can't help but feel happy when playing.\n\n\n\nAlso, if something works....Please for the love of engineering, don't touch it.","March 16","true","50.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feithless/recommended/427520/","Feithless","Fluffy Faith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feithless/","382 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBeen playing this game since long before Steam release and it's amazing.\n\nIf you don't start off on the campaign (something I haven't beaten yet,) you start on an alien planet with a gun, a few bullets, a few scraps of iron, a mineral extractor, and a furnace.  Your objective is to make a colony to welcome the future of mankind while, essentially, destroying the native residents.\n\nYou will pollute the world with your lovely little machines, how much is mostly dependant on how you play the game.  Building around a forest will help mitigate some of your pollution (for a time, if I remember correctly, trees will break apart from suffering too much pollution,) but also make base production a hassle and may require a lot of time spent manually cutting trees down to get to resources.  A desert/plains allows for the easiest in terms of base production, but also the worst in terms of pollution mitigation, as well as several other potential issues (namely, not being able to find enough wood.)  You can minimize your pollution via other methods as well, maybe manually mining everything you need (you're pretty hardcore if you do this,) and only using extractors for oil, and minimizing use of electricity to only times when you really need it.\n\nWhy so much on pollution?  The aliens will not only attack more frequently as the pollution spreads on to them, but they'll also absorb a little bit of it and become stronger for it.  Are they kicking your butt and preventing you from moving forward?  Try starting a new world in a different biome, or try turning on an option so they only attack when you attack them (or get to close!)\n\nHave you finally beaten off the natives and gotten your colony to land?  Why not start again, with a different world generation??  Try for a different starting biome, or even try for a different setup!  Maybe this time you focus more on trying to get things going through trains, or using robots more, or trying to expunge the use of coal except when neccessary?  How about playing without a care to local wildlife?\n\nSTILL not challenging or indepth enough for you?  The game is still early access, and there are updates still being done to it.  I started playing the game around the 10.0 version about a year or so ago, and it's had quite a few updates since then.  And if that's not enough for you, there are tons of mods available that will not only add more depth and complexity to the game (something it probably doesn't need much of, but there's still a joy in doing it!) but also mods that make it harder, or change the playstyle entirely!  Some that I've been interested in trying out are the no-manual mining (except for trees, but I don't often manually mine things anyway) and no-manual crafting (they give you a factory that runs on coal in the start of the game.)\n\nMost the downsides I've encountered are sometimes a very sketchy multiplayer setup, where it's sometimes hard if not impossible to get into a game with more than one person (haven't tested on more recent versions, so take with a grain of salt here,) and the fact that I normally have to go into the save file and erase the replay data to keep the file from being 40+mb to download to the peers (I think they may have fixed this, though? Last times I've played with a friend, the replay data hasn't been too bad.)  I also tend to turn off the sound for the game since I'm often listening to music or talking on Skype with a friend while playing, so I can't comment on those aspects.\n\nGoing along with the multiplayer, it's set up in a way that may cause frustration for those who just openly allow others to join their server, maybe even among friends.  Chests are openable by anyone, resources are often sent along the world via easily lootable belts, taking buildings down is done at the same speed regardless of who put it up, or how high tier the building is, a single broken belt/track may cripple an entire system, turrets only respond to alien threats, and all players are visible on the map, etc.  So someone with a trolly personality can easily screw you over and cause many hours of work to be lost.  It's also designed more for co-op play in this respect than PvP.  Not sure if the devs have any plans to change this, though, as I haven't done much research in that regards, since I don't like PvP anyway.\n\nAll said and done, the game is really fun and interesting, and leaves things for people to do, especially if you go in with more just yourself.  Someone can sit back and work on the base, while the other can go out and try tackling alien bases if needed, or just explore the surrounding area.  If a resource management, factory building, outpost/town/city defense game doesn't appeal to you, I'd recommend checking out the demo before buying, or just skipping the game over entirely.","February 27","true","343.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's gameplay is highly customizable with in game settings and mods if you so desire. It can be the most difficult or easiest game you've ever played depending upon your desire. This is a game that makes Civiliazation games look short, if you are trying to rush to the end, you are still looking at hours and hours of gameplay, but for the average player such as my self whom is not necessariliy interested in rushing, games last for a minimum of 40+ hours.

If I had to summarize my experience with Factorio with three words, it would be Efficiency, Arithmetic, and Optimization. This game can be played in a multitude of ways. You can go all-in and calculate every production line and get all of the ratios to line up. Or, you can just let yourself be free and build whatever's needed.

It masterfully does what is very difficult to do in games these days: eventually the game will be working for you, and not he other way around.  The example of this is the late game construction and logistics robots, with these your factories will run themselves.  It does take some hard work to get there, as well as smart planning, patience, and you will have to purge some natives, but when you are reaping the benefits of a complelety automated astonishingly complicated factory, and sit there and watch it all move fluidly, its worth it.","March 1","true","86.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is like a really cohesive version of those technical mod packs for Minecraft that focuses on what someone interested in this really wants, pure automation.

I absolutely hate it since games never seem to leave it, are often left unfinished and we have wasted our money. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, its tutorial and basic campaign. With a map editor and random map generator, this gamehas infinite replay value.\n\nFactorio is polished, well thought out and can get a bit crazy. Conveyor belts going in every which direction, producing stuff just so you can fight off an enemy that is fairly easy to defend against, but nearly impossible to finish off. Basically a production line from hell. Automated mining facilities give you a steady supply of resources which in turn are smelted, tweaked and tweaked again so you can build that badly needed laser turret.\n\nI had no crashes to speak of and zero lag. I just can't seem to think of a down side here, unless the old school graphics is a turn off for you. Quality product.\n\nEDIT: So after just a few hours of play (I jest.) I am still hooked. I now have a tank with quite a bit of ammo, a ton of logistics robots (late game robots that replace my conveyor belts making the game a bit easier, there are other factors to keep me interested) and an outer defense wall that seems to barely hold them off at every turn....\n\nSo what's missing? This game is so addictive that sleep is missing.\n\nWhat would make it more addictive? ACHIEVEMENTS *rolls eyes*\n\nI absolutely love this game.\n\nNext up, trying out different mods.","March 3","true","75.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Therefore I don't know what to compare it too and will only say that it does what it does very well.\n\nSo what's the game about? It is a survival sandbox. You harvest a variety of ressources (wood, stone, copper ore, iron ore) to manufacture items, machines and buildings. Eventually, with these you are able to automate harvest of the ressources you previously had to manually gather. Everything in the game is automate-able, but, you'll have to carefully plan supply chains and layout of your "manufacturing plant". So, how extensive can automation get in Factorio? Very extensive! You can buid automated trains that will follow a set-schedule to distant plants you'll have previously built to move around supply and feed your supply chains. For example, you import iron ore from a distant mining plant you've built and export machine gun ammunition to it so loaders/unloaders will automatically feed it to the defenses you've set-up over there. Why would you need defenses!? Well, you also must survive relentless assaults from the local fauna while trying to expand control of the land.\n\nVisually, the game isn't for everyone; The textures are quite pixelated but charming none the less and make for an enjoyable atmosphere if you aren't thrown-off by the 8-bit look.\n\nI found myself spending 12 straight hours to complete one of the earlier scenario the game has to offer. I am very excited to see what the more advanced scenario will have to offer.","February 27","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I just could't find any game that gave me fun enough. With factorio I have reinvigorated my passion for gaming, It has been at least 10 years since I didn't enjoy a game like this.\n\nFactorio is an ADICTIVE game because it puts you with a gigantic goal that seems impossible, yet the progression to that point is so well achieved that you just don't notice it. Every time you start a new game you have learnt from you past mistakes and you feel that you do a lot better and a lot faster, again, and again, and again, I have played this game for almost one year and I still feel my skills at this game gets better and better. It's a game very difficult to master yet simple to start with. It's FUN, because of that and the feeling of achievement you get when you   figure out a better or more efficient way of doing thing, which is no easy task, it requieres a lot of planning and thinking, hours of work, but the reward is great: lots of fun!.\n\nBuy it now!","March 5","true","70.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seemed like a really interesting and deep game that focused heavily on logistics and planning, and I fell for it right away. In a way this game can be compared to Minecraft. It's an open world game where the gameplay itself is the real attraction and a purpose unto itself, rather than being driven by the actual stated goal of the game (The End in Minecraft, as of writing the rocket silo in this game, though that will probably be expanded upon in future updates). The actual play mechanics of it is beautiful, and if you were the person wanting to build complicated redstone machinery, this game is definitively for you.\n\nI believe this isn't a game that will appeal to everyone, but for the people who like the base building and resource management games this here is an absolute pearl, and you certainly won't regret getting it.

The brief campain mode is more than recomended to learn the basics. I have starter 4 freeplay sandbox games since finishing the campaing and each time I start a new one is because I have better ideas to make the factory I am building simplier and better oriented. There are a lot of things to research in the games as well as a lot to built which shows to me that I have only passed through the surface and no more.\n\nAs an early access game it does what is supposed to do, with having an incomplete brief campaign and not many modes but the sandbox is almost complete meaning that the lack of further levels does not have a huge impact in gameplay. I have to note down, a tiny downside, not all the buildables are explained by them self, as there is no description and it should be added in an upcoming update.\n\nNevertheless, I suggest this game to anyone who likes sandbox games with a sense of strategy and also some action during alien attacks, well worth the 20euros for the content and replayability.","March 6","true","53.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In one sentence, if you like creating stuff while figuring out problems at every step of your production cycle, then this game is for you 100%.\nAnother thing to like it's that it's not an easy game but it's not a hard game either. It's not putting anything in front of you, but as long as you're applying brain power to your issues, you will figure out pretty quickly what you need to do in order to make it work. Having co-op is a godsend as you can spend hours with a friend or two trying to make it work better, more efficient, faster.\n\nThe game does have a game mode for playing normally with your character (which btw, if he dies, the game is over), which means you need to move your character everywhere you want to build/inspect/see. The other alternative is sandbox where you have no character, you can move and build freely, but it still requires you to build stuff manually before you can automate it. Personally I prefer the freeplay mode, with the character - somehow if doesn't feel detached at all and you're there, overviewing your entire process.\n\nRecommend ? YES! You will lose hours trying to create your automatic processes while only scratching the surface of what you can do while at the same time trying to fend off the "inhabitants" of the planet (thankfully, they're not too bad).\n\nBuy it, try it, get a friend and start having fun while creating!","March 6","true","78.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's it. However you go about getting home, is up to you.\n\nJust like in technic you start off fully reliant on coal. And there's tons of it to mine up. Build the machines, that burn the coal, to mine coal. Build the machines that burn the coal to mine copper, iron, and stone, and set up convator belts that lead eventually to an ureliable grabber arm that carries stuff from the belts to a chest, or furnace. They work as they should and there is literally no guess-work.\n\nYou can set it up so that the miners mine up all the materials needed to create say, copper plates. And you can automate the entire process so arms load the furnace, and arms remove the product into a chest (save for refueling the miners and arms). But here's the thing, each arm will only load 5 of each material whereas you can go in and drop entire stacks in there (one stack is 50 of whatever ore). Is it a bug or is that how its supposed to be done? If that's how its supposed to be done, make it so it isn't, That's a dumb limiter.\n\nIf you have all the stuff needed to make, say, a steam engine, your dude will run through all the preliminary steps for you, making those recipes worthless on the crafting grid. An electric drill takes a handful of circuit boards, but you got all you need for an electric drill, so why are the seprate materials needed at all, if only to point out what will get consumed.\n\nThere are aliens but they're basically the zerg, and of course they don't like you.\n\nI won't give it any breaks for being early access and I hope this menu mania of a game gets cleaned up because its such a delightful experince seeing things actually work for you vs techinc where I'm forced wondering what I did wrong.\n\nAdd more to it please, and please please please don't be a one trick pony.

And part America Simulator 2015/2016\n\nYou put obtain wood, stone, coal, iron ore and copper ore. You setup your first furnace setup to automate copper and iron production.\nYou start to explore into electricity. You build steam engines, boilers, pipes and pumps. You start connecting coal suply lines to your boilers.\nYou discover research and start researching automation and logistics. You increase your mining production and build more smelters which are then used to produce resources for research.\nExpanding more and more, your need for more resources increase. As does your production.\nAnd then it hits you, there are sirens blaring, caution signs popping up in the map, you run over as fast as you can and are swarmed by bugs. The bugs kill you and half your base while your trying to produce weapons and ammo to fight back but it isnt enought, the bugs have already eaten your electricity production.\nYour iron, coal and copper production soon follow in flames. You say ♥♥♥♥ it and turn the game off. That night while your trying to sleep, your mind is racing with what you did wrong, new smelting setups, more efficient power setups, new factory lines and automation designs.\nThe next day you spend as much time as you can trying to make your production as efficient as possible. You are attacked by bugs again, but this time, you dont quit. You start a new world, as soon as you have researched the bare essentials you research turrets.\nYou line your base with turrets and stock them with ammo. But then, a new type of bug emerges, one that can fire from range, they break into your base once again, but you have enough perimeter turrets to kill any scavengers. You then make a double layer of turrets around your base aided by layers of stone walls. You start mass producing ammo, and mass producing turrets. You then proceed to give the bugs the ♥♥♥♥ kicking they deserve.\n\nThis is a game that will test your limits, but make you keep coming back for more, make you recommend it to your mates. You will discover new things about this game every time you play, you will experiment with new technologies you have found, ♥♥♥♥ around with cars, tanks, flamethrowers, shotguns, rocket launchers.\n\nYou then discover how oil works, you discover a new fuel source, and go give them buggers freedom in exchange for their oil. You become the America of this alien world.\n\n15/10 would become a yank again.\n\n\n\nFactorio developer/s, congrats for your arrival on steam, you guys deserve it.","March 3","true","59.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In this game the start is quite simular, gather resources, wood, stone, coal, copper and iron. But after just a couple minutes you can already start automating the process.\n\nCraft transport belts so the resources mined will travel to a furnace, then craft a inserter to move the resources in the furnace. Then once the smelted resource comes out make it go on another transport belt to go inside of an assembler that will craft things for you, expand your factory and create new things, and so on.\n\nI have not played for too long but in the time I have there is still so much more that I can do. Plus you can play with friends in co-op or multiplayer.\n\nIf I had to rate this game it be a solid 9.0/10.0, it's definitely worth the €20.

But it works so you just leave it and say that looks cool, but confusing. Confusingly cool. Buy Factorio, worth the price.

Now, this may seem familiar and, fairly so, quite boring, but Factorio puts a nice spin on it:\nIn order to progress, you need to automate pretty much everything. The goal of your entire factory will be to create (4 different kinds of) science packs in order to progress in the tech tree, get new technologies which make your factory significantly more efficient and, eventually, reach the point at which you'll be able to launch rockets into space, in an effort to get back to your home planet.\nMaking science packs requires sophisticated chains of production, the ability to think ahead and a LOT of trial and error. On your journey to be able to unlock all tech, you'll also stumble upon some unfriendly fellas which will, if angered, start attacking your base. The more you anger them, the more pollution of yours reaches their base, the stronger they will get, so it's not a bad idea to prepare for this BEFORE they get too strong, you do this by either destroying their bases, building good enough defenses or simply not producing any pollution and going on greener ways.\nAll in all, Factorio has been in development for over 3 years now, being regularly updated by the developers. Before releasing the Steam version they have been hard at work at polishing and optimizing the game, so you can be pretty sure this won't be like your run-of-the-mill laggy, unfinished and bugged out Early Access game. Regular updates also contribute to the game staying bug-free while still adding content.\n\nAll in all, this is an inherently great game and I would recommend it to anyone remotely interested into the idea, as long as they're willing to commit a lot of time and effort into learning the game and how to make a working base.","March 4","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Factorio is easy to learn and hard to master. Its addictive, rewarding, fun and has huge amounts of depth and freedom. After 45+ hours I'm still discovering new things.\n\nThis is only technically an early access game. Its stable, runs great, has plenty of content. As another (better) reviewer put it, think of it as a finished title with plenty of free dlc coming.\n\nA top down, open world sci-fi survival and crafting game, its fairly unique and hard to summarise. It mixes many elements together. You will see bits of top down GTA games, Prison Architect, Minecraft's Tekkit mod, Command and Conquer, SimCity, The Martian and even Starship Troopers.\n\nYou are an astronaut crash landed on an alien planet. Your objective is to survive and extract enough natural resources to build a rocket to escape. At the start you dig up some materials by hand, until you have enough to create an automated mine. Then you gradually build up your production to meet your ever growing needs with more mines to extract ore, furnaces to smelt metals, conveyor belts to carry materials around and much, much more. As you raise your tech level you can build fancier machines, but to do this you need more advanced materials and so on.\n\nThere are native aliens that are hostile and attack your factory like the swarms of bugs from Starship troopers. You will need walls and turrets to defend from attacks. You will need to research and build armour, weapons and vehicles to go out and destroy hives that have grown to large. But to do this you will need to make sure your factory is processing enough raw materials to make the ammo and components you need.\n\nThe upgrade research path is sublimely balanced in the early-mid game. You are not punished for naive research choices while learning the ropes. As you get more adept at the game, it gives you a sense that your choices are having a real strategic impact but steers clear of following a linear formula. It does become a bit less important later on as you just try to get as much researched as possible.\n\nOlder systems and materials become obsolete as you move up the tech tree. For instance coal powered furnaces become obsolete as you research electric ones. But your conveyor system is designed to deliver coal to your furnaces. So you have to tweak your system bring it up to date and keep your processed iron flowing to the factories that need it.\n\nFor me there are three big reasons to give this a go:\n\n1. There is always something to do. Theres always an assembly line to tweak to give better output, base improvements to make or exploring & combat to carry out. It never gets overwhelming but does give you that "Just one more turn" addictiveness that you get with Civ.\n\n2. Freedom. The terrain and resources are procedurally generated so no two factories/bases are the same and multiple styles and approaches work. One big base with mining and assembly all together? sure. Outpost bases each working on one specific resource and delivering its output by train? why not?\n\n3. Its so satisfying. As I said at the start, its easy to pick up, you wont be overwhelmed, you can pick anything up after laying it down so you are free to experiment with layouts and find out how each system or building works. But its hard to master. There are some really complex and smart logistics things you can do in the late game.\n\nYou are missing out on a gem if you don't give this a go. 10/10","March 30","true","140.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Therefore I don't know what to compare it too and will only say that it does what it does very well.\n\nSo what's the game about? It is a survival sandbox. You harvest a variety of ressources (wood, stone, copper ore, iron ore) to manufacture items, machines and buildings. Eventually, with these you are able to automate harvest of the ressources you previously had to manually gather. Everything in the game is automate-able, but, you'll have to carefully plan supply chains and layout of your "manufacturing plant". So, how extensive can automation get in Factorio? Very extensive! You can buid automated trains that will follow a set-schedule to distant plants you'll have previously built to move around supply and feed your supply chains. For example, you import iron ore from a distant mining plant you've built and export machine gun ammunition to it so loaders/unloaders will automatically feed it to the defenses you've set-up over there. Why would you need defenses!? Well, you also must survive relentless assaults from the local fauna while trying to expand control of the land.\n\nVisually, the game isn't for everyone; The textures are quite pixelated but charming none the less and make for an enjoyable atmosphere if you aren't thrown-off by the 8-bit look.\n\nI found myself spending 12 straight hours to complete one of the earlier scenario the game has to offer. I am very excited to see what the more advanced scenario will have to offer.","February 27","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

In this game the start is quite simular, gather resources, wood, stone, coal, copper and iron. But after just a couple minutes you can already start automating the process.\n\nCraft transport belts so the resources mined will travel to a furnace, then craft a inserter to move the resources in the furnace. Then once the smelted resource comes out make it go on another transport belt to go inside of an assembler that will craft things for you, expand your factory and create new things, and so on.\n\nI have not played for too long but in the time I have there is still so much more that I can do. Plus you can play with friends in co-op or multiplayer.\n\nIf I had to rate this game it be a solid 9.0/10.0, it's definitely worth the €20.

This game looks so bad based on just the screenshots and basic gameplay videos but I tried it anyway because it had great reviews and I was pretty bored of my current games.\n\nI also had the misconception that this was another tedious "crafting" game. This game is NOT that. Its all about automation so that you DON'T have to do any of the crafting at all. If you've ever programmed at all, even just a tiny bit, this game is basically a fun, easy-to-learn version of programming. I know that sounds like a boring concept for a game, but this thing hooks you in like crack.\n\nIts a very straight forward learning curve and is not as intimidating as it seems. $20 seems like a lot for a game that could have been released in the late 90's but it is totally worth it. Really goes to show that visuals aren't what make games good.\n\nI would call this a puzzle game if I had to categorize it but its a fairly untraditional game.

The more you play it, the more you learn how to set up your base, and your production lines, most bases are constantly being made over as you increase your tech, you will use coal for fuel less for material production, and more just for power supply or making plastics.

That's one session. When I'm done writing this, I'm probably going to pass out while listening to the sweet melody of the Inserters doing their Inserting and the Conveyers doing their Conveying.\n\nThis game is seriously addictive with an insane amount of stuff you can do to keep yourself occupied with. I haven't even touched the Campaign yet!\n\nA great part of the game is that there is no singular way to tackle problems. If you run low on Copper, you can get some more to your base from a far-off location either by building a neat little train system, or build an insanely long Conveyer to get the raw materials to your Factory. You can even have a small army of robot helicopters fly it to you!\n\nThe factory itself...well...unless you spend hours/days planning it out, it's gonna get confusing. It's part of the beauty, though. When you look at what you've made and you think to yourself "The f♥ck is going on?!".\nEven with it looking so derped up, it still produces exactly what you need.\n\nThe combat is pretty cool. Personally, I just love fencing off a big-♥♥♥ area with a wall of Turrets while 2 factories produce ammo for them. When you get the tank, combat will be pretty easy unless you attack a large colony of enemies.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is amazing.\nIf you like resource management games, this one is, in my opinion, at the top of the leaderboards.

After 11 hours I know I didn't.\n\nThat which can be a good thing to some, might be a bad thing to others though. The game IS very complex and managing everything will require quite the skill at both micro and macro management.\n\nFighting is pretty cheap though. You use turrets to defend and tanks to attack. That's it really. But the core of the game is building and maintaining supply routes. That's where the fun comes from! Especially in freemode.\n\nCampaign is there, but, well... It's boring. Tutorials are a necessity and campaign probably helps with the steep learning curve.\n\nAnyways - it sure is worth the attention.

You start out hacking everything together manually in a very tedious manner, and every small automation early on feels like a big improvement. After you've been working there for a few years, you have your automated systems going like clockwork. Even still, you'll hem and haw over whether to automate this or that process. 'Do I use this enough to be worth it?', you'll think to yourself.  Over time, you'll learn new techniques that make your old attempts to do things look crude and sub-par. On the best days, you'll have those beautiful moments where you make a cup of tea and watch the universe unfold like it should without you lifting a finger. Then some variable changes akin to running out of ore or having giant bugs destroy your conveyor belts, and it's back to work.\n\nIf you like this game, you'll love working in tech, unless maybe you're not yet past that stage in your career when you tell people to turn their computer off and on again all day.

I really enjoy the mechanics of the game, the logistical problem that needs to be solved and enemies that needs to be killed. As the developers say it is still an Early-Access but a very, in my opinion, stable game! It's a really well made sand-box game with no end-content (yet). After launching the satelite there are more optimisation to be done. More circuts to be made, steel to be smelted and solarlayouts to improve the electricity of the factorio. Reducing the smoke and polution.\n\nAt the time I'm writing this there is not yet a clear end-game content (as they are working on it) and is to be added to the game and I'm looking forward to it!\n\nRecently i've played alot with mods and the modding community is greate!

Well worth the money, espcially if there's some OCD in you. The game does feel complete for the most part. It's definitely stable and runs really well for me. There's just a few minor complaints I have with the game in it's current state.\n\nMy biggest complaint is just the late stages in the game where it requires way too much resources and time in order to get that rocket to launch. By way too much I mean it would have required me to spend 10+ more hours with my current factory (even longer if I tried to automate it better), just to reach 100% and then hit the launch button which is just a basic flight animation that doesn't benefit anything or really do anything. In the end, what's the point of all that effort in launching the rocket if there's no reason to?\n\nI wish I could have better control over the inserters... being able to control which side of the belt they place items onto, and also be able to control their pickup and drop-off angle (like, instead of only 180 degree, allow it to do 90 degree pickup and drop-off). Maybe even be able to pick up or drop off from multiple directions. What's the point of smart inserters if they're not really smart?\nEDIT: mods fix this issue.\n\nI did find the alien bugs to be way too over-powered in the early and mid stages of the game (mainly the stationary worm spitting defenses), but as soon as I got the tank, they became no match for me. I just plowed through their massive bases like it was no big deal, and retreated to the gun turrets to repair the tank a bit, then went back to plow through some more, rinse and repeat until they're all dead. My only concerns were simply to not get stuck. The AI in this game is very basic though, they travel in a straight line and in the exact same spot each and every single time, so you really don't need to defend your entire base, just the areas each enemy bases send their bugs to. They also attack on a predictable schedule.\n\nThere are obstacles in the game which blend in way too much, especially when zoomed out, to the point where running your vehicles into stuff at least once is to be expected. Once you run into them, and you happen to not destroy your vehicle in the process, it'll make a health bar on that obstacle, so at least you'll be able to see it next time. Or you can magically destroy it with your weapons because... reasons.\n\nYou're able to zoom in way too much to the point where the textures are extremely muddy and gross, I'd actually prefer if they limited that a bit cuz I really don't want to see muddy textures like that.\n\nI also wish the minimap was a bit smaller as it takes up a lot of my 4:3 screen. It'd be really nice if I could play the game on the primary monitor and have the entire map displayed on my secondary monitor.\n\nIt would also be nice to be able to build bridges and stuff onto the lakes... especially hydro lines and pipes.\n\nNone of my complaints are major, but they are worth mentioning. Aside from that, the game is perfect.","May 19","true","56.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't shy away from Early access, this is a hugely fleshed-out title and is extremely stable and well-performing.\n\nFactorio is deceptively simple at first, and soon escalates into something you have never seen or dreamed of before. That escalation escalates as you automate your automations. The gameplay quickly becomes deviously addictive, and you truly can work at your own pace.\n\nIdle away and watch your machinations churn, or furiously work, build, collect, expand, and fight the alien natives. There are no penalties to play your way, and either a jumbled mess of pseudo-organised conveyors and machines or a perfectly planned and optimized meta-factory can both be successful.\n\nAs others have noted, if you are of the obsessive type, be warned: Factorio wants your waking hours, and some of what should be your sleeping hours as well.","May 15","true","182.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabeux/recommended/427520/","gabeux","Gabeux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabeux/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFactorio is one of my favorite games. It's also one of the most polished and fun alphas I've ever seen. And it even have mods that make it crazier already!\nI played it a lot outside of Steam, so don't be fooled. :)\n\nFactorio is a Sandbox-Survival game where you play someone who crash-landed on an alien planet inhabited by a hostile race of primitive aliens that seem to, instead of going to the gym, simply breathe Carbon-Dioxide to get pumped up and angry before trying to steamroll your base.\nWhat? Read on.\n\nInitially, you'll have to gather resources manually in order to craft the tools you need for basic automation and basic research. You'll then start automating resource extraction, smelting, refining, production and research as you try to steer clear of the angry aliens. Eventually, you'll have automated trains loading up cargo on automated stations that's being automatically filled by automated extractors and smelteries. And as it reaches your main base, that train will be unloaded by automated cargo drones that will help you sort out your huge storage system and bring you whatever you need directly to your inventory.\nAnd let's not forget about the construction bots that will automatically build blueprints you design. It's a simple, great feature that will make you do the "Feel Good Man" face every time you build a new Solar Array.\n\nOf course, you're free to play, build and progress as you wish. Make your designs as compact as you can or as large as you want. Design storage and sorting systems, optimized smelting/refining/research/transport designs, or just load up your tank and troll the wildlife.\n(Personally when I first started playing with trains I completely forgot about the rest of the game and simply tried to weaponize them for a few hours.)\n\nThe game features a World Generator that really lets you fine-tune your experience. You can go for a game with passive and weak enemies filled with resources, or a scarce planet filled with angry mobs. You can even make the map really narrow, only generating terrain horizontally (Linear Factorio), which is a different gamemode by itself.\nThe default settings are balanced and challenging enough for most people, so you can quickly jump in on a new game. And even though the game has a learning curve and can be rather complex at times, the tutorial will get you covered, for the most part.\n\nThere's also a mechanic in the game called Pollution. As I mentioned before, Pollution will make aliens (more) agressive, and they will get stronger and evolve faster as you pollute more and more. This can make you adapt, plan and upgrade your factories for lower footprint or higher production in order to progress faster before the aliens spread everywhere.\nThis is a really interesting feature that keeps you on your toes, and makes it so having radar stations and keeping an eye at enemies is actually useful, and sometimes necessary.\n\nThe game is already really fun as is, and features multiplayer.\nHopefully it will get further expanded and polished. If you enjoy crafting, survival, automation (especially Minecraft Tech mods), you'll definitely have a blast with Factorio!","February 26","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearnaise/recommended/427520/","bearnaise","Béarnaise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearnaise/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFactorio might just be the greatest game I have ever played, and that's pretty incredible considering it's still in early access. The game just launched on Steam yesterday, but I've been playing it for over a year as a member on their website and I've probably logged upwards of 300 hours already. The game challenges you to build a fully automated factory, starting with nothing but a furnace and a single mining drill. Your main goal is to progress through the tech tree, unlocking both features that will let you expand your factory and increase its efficiency, and features that will let you better defend against--and ultimately bring the fight to--the encroaching enemies who don't care for your pollutive presence on their land.\n\nAs a game, it's extremely well-paced. The progression is very smooth and concrete, both in your factory techs and your military techs. When you start building your first logistics and construction robots, or your first tier III assemblers, or when you don your first set of power armor and equip a shield modification, it feels like a big accomplishment. You will know you've come so far, yet there's still so much to improve upon.\n\nBut the tech tree isn't the only thing that keeps the pacing solid. The game forces you to balance action in fighting the enemies with the organization and construction of your base. So not all of your time is spent carefully planning out the next expansion you're going to install in your factory. The combat, like everything else, follows a progression. The biters (enemies) get increasingly harder as the game goes on, but their difficulty ramps up faster the more of them you kill. On the default settings, they're never overwhelming, but they're never really a breeze either until you hit the end of military techs, when you're running around on foot at 30mph with a shotgun that does 100 damage and fires 4 times per second.\n\nHonestly there are only two complaints I have about this game in its current state. One is that the default resource generation is just not up to par. The devs have talked about changes they're going to make in the next major release to fix this, but in the game's current state it's just too easy. The resources are too frequent and the game generally gives you enough in your immediate starting area to at least make it to midgame without ever having to migrate your mining operations. This generally make the trains in the game, which are honestly a really cool feature, pretty useless. Endgame won't get you much futher than that either. I've had games where I was still on my second copper site (and you use a ton of copper in this game) by the time I launched my rocket. You can change the spawning settings when you start a new game, but the settings are quite arcane and rely on an understanding of Perlin noise to be effective. Like I said, though, the devs are going to be making improvements to this in the next major release (which sounds like it will be coming soon now that the Steam release has concluded), so I have something I'm looking forward to.\n\nMy second complaint is pretty niggling, and it's just that the car and tank controls are kinda weird to get your head around at first. Holding forward will drive you forward, but since your overview orientation is static, forward isn't forward from your perpsective, it's forward from the car's perspective. So if your car is facing the left edge of the screen, holding w will send you left. You definitely get used to them in time, but I still feel like turning with the car is too sensitive, and I'm constantly running into things.\n\nOverall though, Factorio is the most feature-packed, brain intensive, epically-scoped action RTS sandbox city-building crafting game featuring automation that I've ever played, and hands-down the best game purchase I've ever made. It will give you tons of hours of fun, and I think it's well-worth trying it if you're even the least bit interested. So do I recommend this game?\n\nHell. Yes.","February 26","true","122.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Utterly worth the asking price.\n\nBuy this game if you enjoy:\n-- resource management (aka settlers)\n-- city build sims (aka cities skylines)\n-- mico and macro organisation (aka no game that I'm aware of?)\n\nDon't be fooled by the somewhat retro/simplistic graphics, underneath there is a game that will make your brain angrily happy.","March 6","true","223.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I probably have 2000+ hours total. It falls into the same category of games as Dwarf Fortress-- a game I'll pick up now and again, burn days of time in, then put it down until I think about it again. That being said, please don't let my gaming habits reflect on how good this game is. Because it is -good.-\n\nThere are very few games that will keep me hooked for a long time. World of Warcraft, Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, and a few others here and there are the only ones I've ever been able to consistently put 3-4 hours minimum a day into and never get bored. Factorio trumps nearly all of them with its near-infinite replayability and 0-infinity difficulty scaling.\n\nThere's always a belt to optimize, a production line to buff, or a biter nest that needs culling. Playing it Multiplayer makes it even more fun, if you can convince a friend to dump their life into a game. If you've got any kind of interest in factory-type games, or enjoy large networks of interacting dependent production lines, this is it. It is Anno on crack. It is Technic for grown-ups. Factorio distills all the unnecessary cruft from other similar games and keeps it straightforward-- but definitely not easy.

I didn't really find these that interesting though.\n\nI thought this game was pretty fun, and it reminded me of Prison Architect, which is a great game.\n\nI started getting bored with this game at about the 20 hour point. I felt like it was getting a little repetitive, and I became pretty unmotivated to continue, as there weren't any really clear goals. As of right now, I've played for about 25 hours, and I probably won't play too much more of the game.

Start with nothing, build a few machines to mine things and manually process materials, slowly building up material flows and processing and automation until you can finally have a factory that essentially runs itself. It's as simple or as complex as you want it to be and there's lots of options for neat setups much like you'll see people doing in minecraft. The trailer for this game is actually one of the better ones I've seen, as it boils down what the game is about into a one minute video.\n\nThe developers are first-time devs using an engine they're building themselves and they've done really well so far. They're keenly listening to customers and they also post weekly about their development and things they're learning/doing and their transitioning from a couple of guys working in a garage to a small game studio. Their blog provides a neat insight into game development and also clearly shows that they're making the kind of game they want to make, and doing it well.\n\nIf you enjoy stuff like Settlers 2 or SpaceChem or other games where the gameplay boils down to optimization and flows, going from simple setups and gradually making them more complex and intricate and efficient, then you'll enjoy this game.","February 25","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Just look at the amount of time played by some of the reviewers, or of friends on your friend list who own it.  In terms of value - I could only dream of living in a world where developers put this amount of time, effort, community collaboration, and content into their work.  In this day and age where quality early access games are few and far between, and microtransactions filled free to play games domintate the market in terms of sheer numbers, drowing out smaller and newer developers, it is such an amazing refreshing feeling to see a game like Factorio.\n\nFactorio is a sandbox openworld building game where your goal is to automate everything.  It shares a similar concept with many games, in such that each resource requires a combination of resources that come before it to create.  You start small, but believe you me, you get big!  Towards the end of the tech trees when your factory gets really big, it is truly astounding that it actually functions and that YOU actually made it!  It reminds me a lot of lego's in a sense, and also the human body, in that each little part does its function and as a whole they create this amazingly complex machine.  You actually learn a lot while playing it too, in an engineer'ish type way. Sometimes changing just one thing creates this huge butterfly effect, and rather than reverting it back, figuring out why and making it work is so much more fun.  With multiplayer (which I will talk about a little more down below) you can see in real time how people look at the same problem and solve it in different ways, which I find fascinating.\n\nThere are a million ways to play this game, but personally I (and I know so many others do too, as this is one of the core concepts that draws people like us to this genre) love figuring out how to make each little contraption work at the most efficient rate I can.  I also loved making my first factory as symmetrical as I could, because it just looked so cool.  Copper on the left, iron on the right in the exact pattern.  Oil up the middle with some green chips on each side just because it looked cool!\n\nIf you have even the slightest bit of OCD this game will turn it on overdrive, but in a bizzarly fun way...I can't really explain it, just trust me xD\n\nThe developer is constantly adding to the game, and listens to the community feedback, which is in my opinion neccesary in 2016.  There is so much more I could say about this game, but I will just add this one final and AWESOME end note....It already has *PERFECTLY* working multiplayer, which makes it just THAT much better.  These are my absolute favorite types of games, and I have always wanted a good open sandbox game to play with my friend(s), and now I have one.\n\nIf you are even considering buying this game for whatever reason, do yourself a favor buy it.    These are exactly the types of dev's we need in the gaming world today, our support means everything!\n\n*An easier way to use muliplayer is being added in one of the next updates, but as of now just use the program "evolve" which allows your to share an IP address with whoever you party with, and just join a party with whoever you want to play with.","March 8","true","60.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The goal in the game is to build an automated factory. You start of small using the resources in your immediate vicinity, however after some time expansion is necessary to get more distant resources, while fighting enemies.\n\nThe fun in this game is trying to create the necessary items, with your always increasing factory, for your research and other items. Most of the time is spent working on how to get all the resources and items to the correct place in your factory. At the start you can only transport your goods on your avatar or with belts, but in the middle late game you also get the option of trains and robots. For me the most fun was designing a train network for transporting resources from distant outposts to my main base.\n\nMy only negative point about the game is the RTS element. The fighting was fun when I first started playing the game, it’s however quite easy late game and repetitive.\nAlso the game does have quite a steep learning curve, which can be a deal breaker for some people. It can take quite some time designing and redesigning before you are able to make an proper factory, however I personally loved that.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 9/10 and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a to build a large and awesome base ;). Also playing coop is awesome.\n","February 25","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Immediately, the game peaked my interest but I was sad to see that the game was only in alpha at the time. I was surprised at how polished the game felt (even a few years ago!) and spent probably 20+ hours with it my first time through.\n\nIt's obvious that the developers love their game and, although I feel development has been on the slow, the game has gotten progressively better. I've revisted the game several times in the past few years mostly after learning about the awesome modding community. It is comprised of die-hard fans of the game and you can find anything from game-changing mods to subtle changes for personal preference.\n\nAs it stands, the game is basically sandbox and freeplay only. I kind of hoped that a campaign would present itself sooner but so far it is not much. It's not such a big deal because freeplay is really fun and has a lot of replayability with the mods.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game are the "aliens". I like the idea of building a mining operation that must be defended but the combat, simply put, is not good. Gun play is really weak and invading enemies really don't have a huge impact if you know how to deal with hives before pollution spreads. Typically, I just play on "peaceful" mode where enemies only attack if you attack them because I prefer to focus on automation and problem-solving and not have to invest time or effort into the combat. I truly hope that they'll make combat more exciting or introduce different modes instead of "peaceful" or "hostile" such as a mode where combat is the main focus or objectives must be taken to win, etc.\n\nOther than that, the only other thing I feel they could work on is the UI. It can be a bit finicky and really doesn't look very good.\n\n4/5 Stars!\nIf you are into automation or base-building, this is the game for you!\n\nPS. The music is really good","February 25","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an awesome game if you want a non-combat challenge that pushes you to think.\n\nLong version: Factorio is definitely not for every one. Things not to expect from Factorio: rewarding/challenging combat, in game help on what the best layouts are (there's a reason for this), easy diffuculty curve, and fun if you're not into building/maintaining networks that can be grossly complex (seriously, you won't have fun if you don't enjoy building logistic networks because that is the focus of the game).\n\nLook at the trailer, now realize that the layout you see there is not an exageration of what's needed as you progress through the tech. Lets break it down from the begining on what the crafting tree is like and it might shed a bit of light on that thought:\n\nCoal + Iron ore + (inserted into) Smelter = Iron plate. Same thing with copper. Then: Iron plate -> Crafted into -> Iron gear, Copper Plate -> Crafted into -> Copper cable. Copper Cable + Iron plate -> Crafted into -> Electronic circuit. Iron gear + Electronic circuit + Iron plate -> Crafted into -> Inserter.\n\nEach time you see (crafted into) you can craft this at a machine called an assembler that will make it for you so long as it is powered and has access to all of the correct compenents, and with the inserter created, you can now move items from a chest, smelter, or assembler to another container or onto a conveyor belt.\n\nThe goal of all of the above? Trying to automate as much of it as possible, even though your character can create all of the above items mentioned, he can only create one thing at a time, and when you need at least three inserters for a single smelter (one for coal, one for ore, and one for the output) you'll soon realize making it all by hand slows the game down significantly.\n\nKeep in mind that the resources you need will NOT be conviently placed and you will HAVE to figure out how to get resources from point A to B... and then C, and then A1, B2, and C5 (because a basic resource can be used in multiple recipes, it will need to split into different allocation lines). Then, when the resources in a particular spot has run out, it's time to pack up all that equipment in that area and move it somewhere else and then reconnect it back to the network.\n\nNow the combat is very basic (because that's not the focus of the game). If you have a gun and ammo, you mouse in the general direction of the nasty critter you want dead and hold down space bar. Otherwise, you make gun/laser turrets to protect your network (you will need to as depending on resource locations, networks can get mas+sive) while you're not there. Then when you're ready to assualt a particular nasty nest of the beasties, create a tank and blast them to hell.\n\nBut that's it, there is no RPG elements like gaining experience, nor is there a reward for killing all of them on the map. The game does become a bit too easy if you don't have the creatures attacking you as then there's no reason to waste resources (and more importanly assembly line space) on creating defences.\n\nThe point of all this is to make it painfully obvious that if you don't like the sound of making optimal configurations for logistic networks, then pass on this game. Otherwise, take a look at the demo if it's still available.\n\nI haven't even tried multiplayer yet, but have had this game for quite some time before the steam keys were released. It's an awesome game and would highly recommend it to any one who's interested.","February 27","true","66.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So the main premis is you build machines, and make them cool and big. The "progression" is the research of tech so the first few should be to help the production of research packs. This is almost painfully slow at times and points might find you "stalled" in your first couple plays due to not knowing what to build and waiting for the next thing to complete. HINT - BUILD MORE THEN ONE RESEARCH STATION.\n\nOver all this game is very cool and realy worth it if automation and designing it are your slice of cake. I found this game threw DireWolf20 on youtube who does letsplays of this and a moded minecraft that makes this game look like you automate the picking of your nose.

Its depth and breadth unrivaled by any competitor.\n\n\nThat being said, if you're not the into problem solving for the joy of problem solving, Factorio can also be a rather bland (and grindy) puzzle game with an anticlimactic endgoal.\n\n\nWhile not a game to be recommended to everyone, it's one of the rare, highly polished exemplars of what an indie/early-access team can create with a clear vision and unwavering dedication.\n\n\n\n(Note: I owned the game pre-steam, so my playtime will likely be dozens of hours lower than reality.)","February 27","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you already have Factorio, it is likely you are not even reading this, or forgotten that most early backers probably have a Steam Key Available.\n\nThe basic principle of the game is simple, you just have to build a bunch of assembly lines to get back into space. There's just one small detail, and by small I mean relentless creatures that do not take too kindly to your existence. You will find yourself mining ore, stone, wood, and drilling for oil to supply an ever increasing complex production chain of goods. All while researching new methods in which to build, new materials to create, and defend yourself from the "locals".\n\nNow, if this sounds like your average builder game, you are wrong. Not only do the creatures try to kill you, but the bigger your base gets, the more pollution you create, and the more pollution you make, the bigger and badder the creatures get. So, consider the hostility of the planet to be simbiotic to your success in growing your base, which keeps the game nicely scaled to your progress. Normally, you get to a certain point where you are doing so well that nothing can stop you, except in Factorio that just throws down the gauntlet to the creatures that will wreck your day if you let them. Make a car, they get tougher. Make a tank, and well you get the idea.\n\nAdd in multiplayer, infinite map, random map generation that has LOTS of options (including a peaceful mode), and you have a very replayable game.\n\nPros\nNo two games feel alike unless you reuse a map seed.\nEverything has a use, so the huge tech tree is not just filler techs.\nMost items never become outdated, and there is plenty of variety to play differently and still be a viable strategy.\nThere is only inefficient ways to do things, but never a "wrong" way. Half the fun is figuring out the best way to make your factory better, and since every game is unique the concepts are the same, but the implementation might change.\nThe community is pretty nice too, from guides to asking for help, you'll find plenty of people willing t]\nCons\nNot really a con, but the graphics can turn some people off.\nThe game's depth and complexity is daunting to newer players. Again, not really a con for me, but for some it could be.\nThere can be some sections that feel a bit mundane, but that's the best time to make your factory more efficient.\nIn short, I honestly think it is easily one of my top 20 games I would recommend to someone.

There really is no limit about how big you can build your factory. How far your trains can go and how much you can pollute the planet (Somehow more pollution leads into more bullet consumption).\n\nI don't think there are any other games out there right now that match up with this scale.

Yet.\n\nFactorio is a game for which I have been waiting a long time. It can be a bit confusing to get started but if you can get past the somewhat bumpy start (the tutorial helps with this but I still had to do some outside research on some mechanics) there is a very addicting game waiting for you.\nThe premise is that you are crashlanded on an alien planet and you have to build a rocket to get off. The start certainly sounds simple. "I'll get some coal and some drills and some smelters and smelt iron ore into iron plates!" Things are going great. And then the game expands on that concept and expands on it again and what you end up with is somewhat of a logistic puzzle game involving transport of materials, designing assembly lines, and trying to balance all of your resources between everything you are using them for. Then the iron vein you were mining will run dry and you'll have to find a new patch and figure out either how to hook it in to your existing factory or tear down what you have and rethink how you were doing some things.\nAnd all of this is made much more interesting by the research tree which, while a little too fast if you automate it correctly, consistently unlocks new technologies that make some things easier but also adds new problems to consider. So far I am most impressed by the train system in this game which made getting distant resources a lot easier, but also made me have to redesign how my resources were being transported because I, of course, didn't plan for having a train run into my factory.\nAnd all of that without mentioning the multiplayer; so far I'm having a lot of fun with it. The multiplayer is just like the single player but everyone is building on the same factory. Currently there is no support for pvp or anything like that; well, you can certainly shoot at each other, but there aren't rival factories or anything (which I personally am ok with but some might be disappointed). No, most of the time, you are simply fighting your design, wondering WHY you put that conveyor belt THERE or the natives of the planet. See, as you burn coal and give off pollution, the lifeforms on the planet will become enraged and try to get rid of whatever is causing the pollution, so you also have means to defend yourself such as turrets and guns that you can craft.\nFinally, I just want to touch on the graphics. They remind me of an updated version of the graphics I grew up with in Starcraft, Deadlock, and other PC games in the late 90s and that's one of the things I love about this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but I also recognize that it may not be for everyone. If you are on the fence, be sure and try the demo!","March 13","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They get the appeal of the game across better than I could.\n\nDone that? No you haven't. But if you had, you'd already know that Factorio is like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lovechild of SpaceChem and Minecraft, raised in a ménage à trois with Transport Tycoon. You start out and it's just like any other survival game - click for resources, use resources to build things. Except that the first thing you'll build is a mining drill, which gathers resources for you but needs to be fed with coal. Then you'll probably design a system that handles the coal-feeding automatically. Then you'll build an electrical network, so that (almost) the only thing that needs coal any more is the boilers. Eventually, you'll even build robots to build things for you! Over the course of the game, you'll create a gigantic factory dedicated to the production of a single rocket to get you off the planet.\n\nOr, you know, stay down there and build up a factory that launches not just one rocket, but one rocket per second. Or acts as a Turing machine. (Seriously, check Youtube.)\n\nOf course, while you're doing this you'll be fending off attacks from the biters - insectile natives who get quite, well, bitey when they run across your pollution. They gradually get stronger over the course of the game, so they stay a threat until the endgame. The endgame then consists of using your superior technology to gleefully exterminate them, take their stuff, and use it to research your rocket prior to building it. They can be made peaceful in the game start options if you'd rather just build, but where's the fun in that?\n\nYes, this is an early access game. But it's been under development and in open paid alpha for going on five years now, and it is absolutely worth your $20/€20 in its current state. It's essentially bug-free (except for the biters), it has hundreds of hours of gameplay, and the devs are consistently adding new features. There are rough edges, but they're the sort of thing that's easy to fix given enough time. The biggest issue is probably the user interface, which isn't particularly discoverable - you'll probably need to check online to see how to use some of the things you can build. The graphics are also quite lo-fi and "muddy", which AFAIK the devs are planning to address with an HD texture pack at some point. (They don't want to make it part of the main game to avoid raising the minimum system specs too high...)\n\nOh, and mods. So many mods. Did you feel it was unrealistic that you could make a circuit by combining iron plates with copper cables? Try Bob's Mods! Then you can use wood and resin from trees (or synthetic wood and resin from heavy oil) to create a phenolic board, and etch the tracks with iron, copper and ferric chloride. To get the ferric chloride, of course, you'll need iron ore, hydrogen and chlorine - the latter two of which you get by electrolysing salt water, which also produces sodium hydroxide (used in aluminum processing). Of course, that's just the circuit board - you'll also need resistors, transistors, and solder to make the circuit itself!\n\nOr maybe you want to go full megabase? Play with RSO! Your resources will be concentrated into much larger, rarer patches - which has the side effect of forcing you to to build a massive train network to keep your base supplied. And of course if you just want to sit in your original base and never have to deal with resources running out, there's a mod for that too. (Cheater.)\n\nOr maybe you just want the base game to be longer? I mean, sure, your first save is going to take 40+ hours, but someone who *really* knows the game can get that down quite a lot - the world record speedrun finishes in two and a half. Try the Marathon mod! It scales up pretty much everything while keeping the biter evolution constant, to the point at which you're forced to optimise pretty hard if you want to beat the game. And yes, *of course* someone has adapted it to work with Bob's Mods.\n\nI could keep going, but by this point you're probably already either sold or fleeing in horror. If you're neither, then just watch the damn trailer, OK? :-)\n\n(Disclaimer: the reason I don't have much playtime logged is because I bought into the open alpha so I've been playing off-Steam. I have no affiliation with the devs.)","February 25","true","42.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

They get the appeal of the game across better than I could.\n\nDone that? No you haven't. But if you had, you'd already know that Factorio is like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lovechild of SpaceChem and Minecraft, raised in a ménage à trois with Transport Tycoon. You start out and it's just like any other survival game - click for resources, use resources to build things. Except that the first thing you'll build is a mining drill, which gathers resources for you but needs to be fed with coal. Then you'll probably design a system that handles the coal-feeding automatically. Then you'll build an electrical network, so that (almost) the only thing that needs coal any more is the boilers. Eventually, you'll even build robots to build things for you! Over the course of the game, you'll create a gigantic factory dedicated to the production of a single rocket to get you off the planet.\n\nOr, you know, stay down there and build up a factory that launches not just one rocket, but one rocket per second. Or acts as a Turing machine. (Seriously, check Youtube.)\n\nOf course, while you're doing this you'll be fending off attacks from the biters - insectile natives who get quite, well, bitey when they run across your pollution. They gradually get stronger over the course of the game, so they stay a threat until the endgame. The endgame then consists of using your superior technology to gleefully exterminate them, take their stuff, and use it to research your rocket prior to building it. They can be made peaceful in the game start options if you'd rather just build, but where's the fun in that?\n\nYes, this is an early access game. But it's been under development and in open paid alpha for going on five years now, and it is absolutely worth your $20/€20 in its current state. It's essentially bug-free (except for the biters), it has hundreds of hours of gameplay, and the devs are consistently adding new features. There are rough edges, but they're the sort of thing that's easy to fix given enough time. The biggest issue is probably the user interface, which isn't particularly discoverable - you'll probably need to check online to see how to use some of the things you can build. The graphics are also quite lo-fi and "muddy", which AFAIK the devs are planning to address with an HD texture pack at some point. (They don't want to make it part of the main game to avoid raising the minimum system specs too high...)\n\nOh, and mods. So many mods. Did you feel it was unrealistic that you could make a circuit by combining iron plates with copper cables? Try Bob's Mods! Then you can use wood and resin from trees (or synthetic wood and resin from heavy oil) to create a phenolic board, and etch the tracks with iron, copper and ferric chloride. To get the ferric chloride, of course, you'll need iron ore, hydrogen and chlorine - the latter two of which you get by electrolysing salt water, which also produces sodium hydroxide (used in aluminum processing). Of course, that's just the circuit board - you'll also need resistors, transistors, and solder to make the circuit itself!\n\nOr maybe you want to go full megabase? Play with RSO! Your resources will be concentrated into much larger, rarer patches - which has the side effect of forcing you to to build a massive train network to keep your base supplied. And of course if you just want to sit in your original base and never have to deal with resources running out, there's a mod for that too. (Cheater.)\n\nOr maybe you just want the base game to be longer? I mean, sure, your first save is going to take 40+ hours, but someone who *really* knows the game can get that down quite a lot - the world record speedrun finishes in two and a half. Try the Marathon mod! It scales up pretty much everything while keeping the biter evolution constant, to the point at which you're forced to optimise pretty hard if you want to beat the game. And yes, *of course* someone has adapted it to work with Bob's Mods.\n\nI could keep going, but by this point you're probably already either sold or fleeing in horror. If you're neither, then just watch the damn trailer, OK? :-)\n\n(Disclaimer: the reason I don't have much playtime logged is because I bought into the open alpha so I've been playing off-Steam. I have no affiliation with the devs.)","February 25","true","42.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I needed 10 walls, I could have just mined it myself but I ended up building this big factory for it. I took my 10 walls and let it do couple thousand more because that's what you do in this game. You just build and optimize since you have good time doing that.\n\nYou can automate the base very nicely. Like mine some iron, melt it and make ammo from it. Then transport it by belts near the turret and add arm that reloards the turret. So you end up with bases that just run by itself. See enemies attack, turrets shoot them, arm reloads the turret, factories produce more ammo... it all looks very nice to me.\n\nFor early access this game is the better ones. There is already a lot of things to build. For me there is some minor issues, like building the railroads. It feels clunky, I found from their blog that they are looking into making it better. The examples I saw looks very promising. It really feels like the developement team is active on this game.

And at a awesome game.\nRight now im at 0,38 € per hour.\n\nAnd with that said, i hope the game is gonna get more content and ♥♥♥♥ to do. And when that is all over we also have the mods to consider.\n\nGreat game, great buy,\n\nNO REGRATS!","April 2","true","54.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
