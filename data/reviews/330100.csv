It's an Alpha game, and I am amazed how well this game is being developed. It is packed with features, ideas, and it even has an in-build survey in the main menu so you can give your two cents on what should be changed, and when. Let's get into it!\n\nThe Pros:Truly a Sandbox - You don't need to follow a storyline, there are a dozen of game modes available, you can make and edit as many ships as you like, and the ship creation is very configurable! Except modules you have to research to unlock, everything in the game is available to you from minute 1!\n\nUI OPTIONS!! - Wherever you go and can edit stuff, there is an accompanying right hand side menu with a lot of little buttons, toggles, and sliders. Everything is very detailed and really gives you the impression that you are in ultimate control.\n\nInteresting Gamemodes - From the expected Randomly Generate Galaxy you must explore, we can go to other (fully scenario customisable) modes such as Huge Space Battle or AI Simulation and even Evolution!. Yup, you can sit and watch as the game simulates natural selection on your starting ship and calculates a numerous series of descendants! Take my word for it, there are many things to do when bored!\n\nUpdate schedule - The game has very consistent and regularly released updates, all based on the survey you can complete in the main menu.\nThe Cons:Hard Controls - The ship operation is very difficult, in my opinion. Ship handling is hard, and lining up correctly to shoot an enemy is even more so. I wouldn't mind it that much, but it sort of distracts me from the other gameplay elements more that I'd like.\n\nGraphics - I know this is an alpha indie game, so I won't be too harsh, the graphics are okay, but need a serious overhaul before I would accept them as "final" version worthy. The UI could use a redesign as well. These are on the list of the dev, so we'll see how it turns out!\nConclusionThis is the most customizable space game I ever played before, and the constant updates really build up my confidence in the final release. For you, the player, as with all early access titles, I tell you this: Buy only if you wish to support development! The current game lacks many features that are about to be added, could be buggy at times and so on. However, I can vouch for the quality of the updates, and I would put my money on the official release! If you like space games, building games, and simulation games all at once, this is a good choice for you!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 19, 2015","true","8.1"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","37","47","3","4"

Spaceship building with parts salvaged from other ships is a perfect mechanic in this game, and the objectives and combat feel fantastic. Controls are fully rebindable, and there are multiple different controlling modes (mouse, arrow keys, etc.). Developer is extremely responsive to community and is always talking advice, even going as far as having in game surveys on controversial additions and decisions. The main gamemode is to explore a randomly generated galaxy, but there are other gamemodes such as a deathmatch, endless mode, and hopefully an upcoming campaign.

Physics of space play a large role but after tinkering around for a while it's easy to grasp the basic concepts. Only left up to your imagination what you come up with.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHRFjb4INt4\nEarly access doesn't contain the singleplayer story, but there are randomized galaxies and expedition modes which are a bunch of fun alone. Basically you fly around the galaxies clearing out each sector, picking up new items from enemies destroyed, black holes and space anomalies in general. Completing a sector will give you the ability to use the collected pieces to repair/upgrade/enhance your spaceships.\n\nShould provide many hours of fun for fans of exploration/construction games.\nCan't wait to see how the full storymode plays out. :)","January 12, 2015","true","1.1"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

I figured OK, statistically speaking the reviews can't all be from friends and family. The game was on sale at the time so I took a chance. Am I ever glad I did! I've been playing the game for over a week. Steam says I've logged almost 30 hours in that time... how is that possible?! I work 2 jobs! But then I do the math and yeah... I think I've been playing the game too much.\n\nSo why is the game so much fun?\nWeapons feel great!  They have weight. I love the way my lasers rip into the hulls of enemy vessels. Missiles, torpedoes, they all FEEL good.\nCustomizability. My battleship has like, 10 different action keys. One to fire lasers, one to fire long range weapons, one to launch my interceptors, one to open/close the main torpedo ports, one to fire the torpedoes, one for emergency hyperspace, etc etc. I sometimes get the keys mixed up and I accidentally hyperspace into an enemy ship when I was trying to turn on the emergency generator. I should really move that keybind to somewhere else.\nBattles are intense. No matter how awesome your ship gets, you still need to keep your eyes on the smaller enemy ships because they can still hurt you.\nConstant updates! The developer updated the game at least twice in the week I've had the game.\nStill, the game isn't perfect:\nIt's Early Access. The game is a work-in-progress, but I've had no crashes except on the first day (but that was because the dev was working on the game). But there is a TON of content.\nShips look... not quite like starships. Because it's kinda like lego. If you stick weapon modules onto a drive module and add some ore container boxes... well it's not gonna look pretty. Still, you can build some pretty respectable looking starships. But alot of times your ship is going to look like you just crazy-glued a bunch of ship parts together. Beware my garbage scow!\nAI isn't perfect. The AI is good enough to put up a decent fight most of the time. But then for no reason it'll hyperspace into an asteroid.\nSo the game is definitely worth the price, full or on sale.","July 17, 2015","true","303.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

If this seems like the sort of game you might be interested in I would highly suggest you pick it up.\n\nStill in Early Access but CONSTANTLY updated, every time I log into Steam there seems to be a small patch tweaking/fixing things and then every Sunday for a while now there is the content patch from the Sunday twitch coding session the developer does.\n\nOne of the problems with early access is you are not sure if the game is going to ever be finished or updated at all.  The amount of features in this game constantly grows with the dedicated developer and is well worth it!\n\nCan't recommend enough, but I can try!","June 5, 2015","true","28.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

(2 flash games, and 6 other games share similar characteristics, as far as I know.) That niche being the ability to create a ship of your design, lego-style, using a (currently) small cache of parts.\n\nFrom the start, there is a level of polish which is sufficient to make this game simply look better than anything people might tout as "crap, weak, waste of money" which I can assure you it's not. Currently, you are able to design and build a ship or fleet of ships with which to shower your rain of destruction.\n\nThere is a story mode which has, in recent patches, reflected the difficulty settings much better, where the harder modes not only include more larger enemies, but makes them a bit smarter too. It takes anywhere from 1-4 hours to complete an exploration, and now there is a save feature in case you can't do it in one sitting!\n\nA unique aspect to this game is the evolution pool. This is where you can sit back and watch the computer fight itself, learn from itself, and make its ships better. There could be some improvement here, as with any random generation environment, it takes time to see real results.\n\nEventually, I'd like to see mirko add something of a large open ecosystem you can journey through rather than small world points you have to jump to, thus combining two aspects of the game. However, the game is still early access, and as such has plenty of time to improve! :D\n\nTL,DR:\nDesign your own spaceship, fly it around, kill things, take their parts, and attach them to yourself. Also watch the computer kill itself. Also missions. And a storyline. More stuff pls!","November 10, 2014","true","3.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Lots of fun and potential in it for any dignified space shooting ship assembling geekster fan (like me self). For an Early Access game I have to say it's very well executed. Every thing runs smoothly and properly and apart from some labels and feedbak info still missing here and there it is apparent that a lot of care was put into it. It's a lot of fun assembling the amorphous ships and testing them in the 'field' and the set of parts available is quite enjoyable. It should be a very decent and wide scoped game once it leaves alpha/beta stage and comes out into a full fledged game. As of now, even while in Early Access, it is already very playable and worth every cent (and surely hours of fun).","January 31, 2015","true","18.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kormyou/recommended/330100/","kormyou","Bushi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kormyou/","279 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOut of all the games I've gotten on Steam so far, this is the first one I've felt like writing a review for, mainly because I see a lot of potential in this one and hope for it to succeed. So keep in mind this is my first review and it is for an Early Access game.\n\nStarting Off\nThis game is a sandbox through and through, focusing obviously on the construction of a customized ship and then allowing you to test it out within various game modes from a full campaign of sorts where you establish yourself with different factions that each have their focus on research types, a survival mode, random missions and more to come I am sure. Sure, there is no story, save a generic themed enemy that apparently is a threat for some reason, but let's admit that isn't what people play sandbox games for.\n\nThere is already plenty of modules for making the ship function the way you like to play. Want a gunship? Make it happen. Want a ship that has more versatility in tools and tech? Do it. However, at the current point in the game, it feels like there is very limited uses for many of the different techs already available, and in time I hope to see more reasons and uses for it all.\n\nGraphically speaking, it's nothing impressive, but there's plenty of particle effects to keep things flashy enough to keep my attention. I still get the inner satisfaction when I destroy enemy ships to say the least, and the effects of the weapons and other modules feels appropriate for what they are/do. The music does its job at setting the feel for the missions and stuff, but tends to get a little repetitive after awhile and I have begun muting the music to play my own during my long sit down sessions with this game (three in total so far).\n\nPositives    Exceptional Ship Customization\nBasic, But Helpful Tutorial (With exception of the negative below)\nFully Rebindable Controls & Controller Support\nA Developer Who Appears Interested In Feedback\nNumerous Modes of Play With Challenge For All\nNegatives    Rebindable Controls Do Not Fix Difficult Maneuvering\nModerate Learning Curve (Knowing which faction to help in the procedurally generated galaxy, and how it applies to your research is something I am still figuring out... could be helpful to explain that in the tutorial.)\nNeutral Factors (Things I believe will probably get better as development continues)\nLimited Mission Variety (Currently they could get repetitive for those who prefer variations)\nFew Reasons to Use Specific Module Types (This might be a personal preference thing)\nOccasional Bugs (To be expected with Early Access)\nMore Control Options than Buttons on Controllers (I am sure the expected interface with the game is via keyboard and mouse, but the use of a controller is a very nice option when wanting to play casually, and it feels limited when you have to choose what abilities you want to have access to if using the controller.)\nAssessment\nOverall this is a very entertaining experience for me, as I keep spending time trying to tweak my ships to be more streamlined, or trying to upgrade my modules. For an Early Access title, this one is one of few I have felt is worth the asking price, though I happened to find it on sale and became my replacement for another game since I can't play (and have chosen not to) Galactic Civilizations 3. With the level of customization, replayability due to a variety of game types, and the fact that the developer seems to be actively engaged with the playing community and offering frequent updates, I suggest you take a look at this game if it happens to be your cup of tea. Being still in development, it has plenty of potential to become a gem in my library.\n\nPersonal Verdict  8.5 / 10","January 29","true","19.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I didn't play long, but long enough to realize most of my playtime was frustrating because I was fighting the user interface and control scheme. I also couldn't figure out how to purchase new weapons/solar panels for my ship. I couldn't tell which things persist between missions and which don't. When you load, it's where you left off before starting the mission, but apparently when you edit your ship, that's saved outside of missions...I don't know. Very confusing. The ship building UI is a jumbled mess of buttons, and I can't figure anything out.\n\nThis game needs to be simplified. It feels needlessly complex, almost like it's a stream of development/design conciousness. The survey pops up in your face asking what kinds of things should be improved before you've even played the tutorial. Also, the control scheme feels really clunky, at least for keyboard/mouse (my preferred controllers).\n\nNeat idea, but I can't recommend this game in its current state.","January 27","false","1.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Its complicated and boring and very 2D. From what I could see most maps have an enemy to destroy and some asteroids to blow up and some space mines. That's it. You just do the same things over and over. You can put your engines here or there and it affects the whole spinning out of control issue. If you'd like you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out things that should be pretty simple or at least explained.\n\nThe physics are wrong. No space ship should handle this bad.\nExploring areas. From time to time you need to explore an area. That means you have to move your ship near some rectangles. They'll disappear. Done! Does that sound like fun? It isn't.\n\nCan I build an interesting ship? you might ask. No. Seems like you should be able to build an interesting ship like lets say something similar to one of the big capital ships in Sins of Solar Empire that has many functions. That would be interesting but as far as I can see you can't build anything like that. There are some extraordinary people on the internet. I've seen them at work on Besiege and they can create almost anything of enormous complexity. Maybe they can do something incredible with Boss Constructor but not me. I didn't see much possibility and isn't that what I'm paying for? The game is supposed to make me feel like I can, with my normal abilities create something marvelous using their easy to understand tools. They have totally failed because I cannot create marvelous things and their tools are not easy to understand.\n\nLet me compare it to a game that is fun - Lunar Flight. In Lunar Flight you have some sophisticated navigational devices to get you to a floating sphere that needs to be "researched". Once you get there you have to use your piloting skills to float within the sphere while the sphere is being researched. This requires skill, which you can learn with some diligence. The result is a satisfying 3D experience because the maps in Lunar flight look fantastic compared to any game whereas the maps in Boss Constructor look like crap and the physics feel so right.\n\nHave you ever worked on a monitor that is reflecting things from the background into your eyes? Well, that's what every map in Boss Constructor looks like. The planets in the background look like an annoying reflection on your monitor. On a positive note I think I did read that you can turn off backgrounds.\n\nI could say more but...\nTo summarize - Boss Constructor as it is now, sucks","January 29","false","3.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This game is NOT an open-space game. You have to play missions and skirmishes to unlock parts, which allow you to build bigger and better ships that use those parts so you can acquire even more parts in said missions.\n\n2. There are really only two levels of difficulty. REALLY bloody bleeding edge hard, and super stupid easy where you have to actually try to lose in order to lose. For example, the types of enemies you face will either be teeny ships that pose zero threat to you, or really big ships that can blast you with all kinds of firepower. And inside those, there are only two types of AI. The first type is simple 'shoot at player and try to kill them" AI, and the second is the impossibly hard to fight "RAM PLAYER WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT AND DON'T STOP RAMMING UNTIL ONE OF US IS DEAD". When you find a big ship utilizing ramming behavior, you pretty much always lose.\n\n3. The ship building on this game is really really fun. However, the point of a mission is to take your ship, and blast through it, complete all the goals, and not die while leaving the warp gate. If parts of your ship get blasted off, you can recover all of them. But if they do get blasted off, you cannot re-attach them until you've completed the mission. The problem is, this makes some kinds of ship builds not very interesting. I'd love to make a 'ramming' ship, but you can't because you'll be lucky to kill two other ships before you no longer have a battering ram to ram with. Meanwhile, ramming is super effective VS you.\n\nOkay, that was a mixture of the good and bad. This game is really unintuitive and not very fun at first, but if you can get past the clunky controls you'll have to mess around with, the awkward camera (It's being worked on as of this review), the hit and miss AI (Also being worked on), and other quirks of the game, you'll find a really solid gem of a game. I do not believe the game is currently worth $15, but if you can get it on sale for $5, it's very worth it!\n\n\nI hope to see the developer continue to update and make this game great!","October 18, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/recommended/330100/","atxferret","ATX Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I was a kid, my friends and I used to play what we called Lego Ships. We basically built spaceships out of Legos, using very loosely defined rules as to what piece did what (Lego-guy-legs with the tops pointed forward were cannons, lights were phasers/lasers, and anything proturding off the back was a thruster), and we'd imagine characters and stories to go with our creations. Our method of fighting was to take our finger and jam it into the other guy's ship, knocking what pieces off that we could. In hindsight, that's not the worst way that one could simulate fighting in space, I guess.\n\nDespite your initial primary weapon being space-fireballs (what?), Boss Constructor feels a bit like Lego Ships made into a video game. You cobble together a ship with what you can find, and then you poke the crap out of enemies until stuff falls off. And then you take said stuff and put it on your ship to make it better.\n\nAs it stands right now, the game is entertaining, if shallow. It absolutely does nothing to justify the RPG tag, so certainly don't buy it expecting a story, because if it's going to have one, it's not there yet. It's neat that the developer is asking people to vote on things like modules and asking for ideas for missions, though I do wonder if that doesn't mean the developer's running out of ideas. The game has been on Steam as an Early Access for over a year, after all, though I certainly have not been involved long enough to know what state the game was in when it was first made available.\n\nWhatever you do, don't buy this game expecting a release-quality experience. It's definitely not that. It's stable enough to play (three CTDs in 15 hours isn't bad for early access), and looks to be a great platform on which to build a really good game, but it's far from finished.\n\nMusic is limited, sound effects are at least decent, and your ship handles like a big, complicated version of the ship you use in Asteroids. If you want maneuverability, or the ability to reverse, or any kind of speed, you have to place thrusters, pointed in the right direction, and enough to counter the weight of your ship. Your ship will continue indefinitely until you fire thrusters pointing the other direction to stop you. It's not nearly so complicated or hard to control as it could be, though, and the controls strike a very, very good balance between realism and playability.\n\nI've already got access to nearly every possible module, and everything from here on out seems to be just more punishing versions of what I've already done. I'm disappointed that there are so few modules that are rarer and higher tech, meaning smaller, lighter versions of what you need. I kind of thought that sort of progression was a given in a spaceship building type of game. That's not to say that the concept is absent -- just lacking.\n\nI also think the ship construction (which is definitely the core of the game) would benefit from having two or three layers so that you're not so limited in your design by the game being strictly two-dimensional. For instance, the only way to change the direction of a weapon is to put it on an auto-aim joint. As of now, there is no way to put a weapon between but below or above your thrusters, or armor, or anything else, forcing you to either extend the weapon further out than every other part of the ship, or risk (guarantee, really) shooting yourself if an enemy ends up beside you since your weapon will automatically turn to point at it, regardless of what part of your ship is in the way.\n\nEverything shield related is pretty goofy as well. You either have this orbiting projectile-blocking thing that will get between you and enemies (meaning you'll always hit it when you shoot) or some peacock-feather-looking extensions that also block your own fire. Maybe the developer just really likes the idea of parts flying off of the ships and, honestly, so do I, but I'm not sure how I'm supposed to go about fighting anything remotely hard when I can't shield my weapons.\n\nHowever, if you enjoy the idea of slapping parts off of other spaceships using space-arc-welders and space-fireball-launchers, then stealing those parts because apparently they're really durable but not connected very well, then I don't know of a better game for you. And, hopefully, there's a lot more to come.","February 3","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perfect if you just want to jump in and use a straight-forward ship creater to build a ship of mass destruction. As easy is it is to put a ship together, there is still a ton of strategy involved, and the game never just 'hands' you all of the ideal modules you'll need.\n\nThe developer is incredibly responsive, and will quickly fix any issues that arise. This is a rare instance of an Early Access game that I am glad I purchased.","February 8","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really something you see often and I dig that even if it completely freezes my computer like I dunno, 9 times out of 10?\n\nExploration mode is the heart of the game and while it can be a really rough start if you pick a bad starter ship (with no real guidance say, that it's going to be super-hard mode since, oh hey, you just configured a ship with no weapons of any kind) overall, if you make it past the first round or two, it gets really fun. You constantly get to exercise your creativity as new modules and module varients become available to you. I'd say AI is only a challenge if you're outnumbered and surrounded, but that definitely happens and when it does, you may very well have a truly challenging fight on your hands. Most of the time, with any kind of decent tactics to control engagements and a good ship design, fights are pretty easy though. But that also makes it easier to become complacent and get totally surprised when a tactical situation changes suddenly and your gun arcs can't hit something that's picking away at your engines. Engines matter a lot in this game and once a couple are gone, you are all but hosed. I really like having a more tactical shoot-em-up, and I found most of the game design decisions here to result in pretty cool gameplay.\n\nMy biggest criticism of the game, if I had any would be that the non-combat missions can get a little tedious after you get the same one too many times in a row.\n","May 5","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Newtonian physics and 100% customizability mean you get exactly what you want, with whatever parts you have on hand.

This also means that you must point your ship at an enemy in order to fire your weapons, which takes a lot of skill. The enemy AI is so good it feels like you are fighting a player, since they will navigate around obstacles and take care to aim, rather than just spam.\n\nThis game mechanic gives skilled pilots a huge advantage with smaller ships, as they can deal out damage before a larger ship has even brought its weapons to bear.\n\nBy far this is the only game I have seen where skill is the ulitmate decidin factor in a fight.\n\nBuilding [h1/]\n\nBy defeating enemies and destroying stuff, modules are dropped. You can use these to aid in construction, and some have stats that can be positive or negative, depenidng on its quality.\n\nThe more modules a ship has, the larger its mass, and therefore it is less manueverable and requires more power.\n\nExploration [h1/]\n\nTo start exploring, generate a galaxy, and you will be able to progress through randomly generated levels with objectives, such as destroying stations and/or ships in the area, or collecting stranded escape pods.\n\nGraphics [h1/]\n\nThe game is very well-optimized, and you could run it wihout problems on a potato.\n\nThe backgrounds are breathtaking space art, which fit well with the FTL - like artstyle for everything else, but higher-res.\n\nMisc. [h1/]\n\nNo DLC.\n\nFull Steam Workshop support for sharing ships.\n\nAchievements.\n\nVery active developers (look at the update log!)\n\nNice sound effects and space-y music.\n\nMust buy if you love anything similar to FTL.","April 23","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
