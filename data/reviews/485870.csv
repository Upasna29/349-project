Not many bugs, and for $0.99, Its worth it.","June 6","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The rhythm element with the included music is often off (really badly in the last level), and the desserts (green dot(s)) only add to the score and not the "ammo".  Custom music can be used, but you have to manually enter in the file path and beats per minute.  Yeah, it's a little rough, but it's hard to have this much fun for so little money!","June 6","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While the gameplay of Soup was very simple, easy, and you take it at your own pace, this game is much faster, and actually much for difficult (I actually couldn't finish it). Most of the game involves you eating food by hitting the corresponding key quickly enough, which honestly wasn't that fun of a mechanic because there's such a huge margin for error. This kind of control would actually work really well on a mobile version of this game though, and I would hope that this and Soup get ported to mobile eventually. After "creating" the poop, then you fling it at a group of partygoers. Pretty simple, and there's actually less to do in this than Soup (Soup had a list of goals, this one is to just get a high score). This and Soup are easily just joke games and YouTuber bait, but at the base level it's a fun game to kill 20 minutes with...maybe even get a laugh or two as you smack some poor fellow in the face with a turd.\n\nIt should be noted that most people won't realize that you can add your own music to this game. So instead of listening to the royalty free tracks (I actually noticed a song with a "PremiumBeat.com" in the background, even made a joke about it, saying that I thought it said "PremiumMeat.com"), you can shove in your own tracks. Obviously you won't seen that on YouTube, as you'll get copyright problems.\n\nIs this obviously a cash-in on the success of Soup? Totally. Does that necessarily make this game bad? No. Would I recommend for you to buy it? Sure, it's only $1. Heck, if it was on sale I'd say "what do you have to lose? $.50?" Would I recommend that you buy Soup over this game? Yeah. What about both? Sure. Rudder Game has proven that they just like making stupid humor games and they don't make crappy games. Or wait...they kind of do, don't they?\n\nIf you'd like to see some gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9vFj7FqXOA","June 6","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
