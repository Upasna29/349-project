Hell, single episode there may last for few hours if you have no idea what to do, or you may just get stuck if you never had experience playing adventure games before.\nAs for the episode that is given to us, I can say that it has quite interesting concept/idea in this one, being related around Politics theme, first objective being punching president out of hypnotism, with more to come after that (with some nice music... tihi). It has enough content in it for me to say that you should try and beat this episode. Who knows, maybe you will like it enough to get the whole season pack?","October 21, 2013","true","8.8"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","1"

Those words might mean something different for you but for me it means that the Sam and Max games (S&M) are fun games made after a classic series. There is one waf to tell for certain if you like the games, you could play this one. For the now cheap price of completley free you can play through Sam and Max: Able Lincoln Must Die to see if you like it. If you dont there is no harm done, if you do like it however there will be much harm done, atleast to your free time because you will be playing the Sam and Max series (maybe). So play this, afterall there is no harm in trying it.","March 7, 2014","true","6.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

It's satyrical dialogue is wonderful and seperates it from the rest of the point-and-click style games that are out there. The only problem I have with the game is that the objectives seem fairly unrelated. This is my first Sam and Max game so maybe it's the style of the series that I'm missing, but the constant back-and-forth jumping between areas and activation of obscure points seem vaguely and loosely strung together. I fail to see the relationship between a decent amount of the objectives here. Not all of them- but more than a couple. Without a walkthrough I'd be lost in this. Other games in the genre at least have a box for obtaining more clues, I have yet to find this detail in the game but it'd definitely help. Like I said, maybe it's just me (the majority of reviews here are very positive) but this game doesn't feel as smooth as other Telltale games (i.e. Walking Dead, Back To The Future). I'm a fan of Telltale and everything else going on in the game, but I wouldn't recommend this one to a first-time player in this genre.","September 1, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

And in my case, it worked.\n\nBasically, Sam (a talking dog) & Max (a talking bunny thing) are Freelance Police who use any means neccessary to solve ever-more ridiculous cases. LucasArts worked with Steve Purcell (the guy who drew the original comics) to create an adventure game back in the 90's named Sam & Max Hit the Road, which was excellent. Plans for a sequel were canned, but Telltale Games took up the mantle around 2007 and worked with him to create more games. Which, if you were wondering, are also pretty good.\n\nThey've created 3 'seasons' so far, and I've played through the first two. The writing is generally good (not to mention funny!), the puzzles IMO are great, and the interface is a bit sparse in the first series but improved in the second. If you're wondering what sort of adventures the Freelance Police get up to, in this particular 'episode' Max becomes the President of the US and has to fight an animated statue of Abraham Lincoln, hence the title. I'd rather not spoil any more; if you wish to see what happens (and how) I would like to remind you once more that this particular episode is free.","February 5, 2011","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And in my case, it worked.\n\nBasically, Sam (a talking dog) & Max (a talking bunny thing) are Freelance Police who use any means neccessary to solve ever-more ridiculous cases. LucasArts worked with Steve Purcell (the guy who drew the original comics) to create an adventure game back in the 90's named Sam & Max Hit the Road, which was excellent. Plans for a sequel were canned, but Telltale Games took up the mantle around 2007 and worked with him to create more games. Which, if you were wondering, are also pretty good.\n\nThey've created 3 'seasons' so far, and I've played through the first two. The writing is generally good (not to mention funny!), the puzzles IMO are great, and the interface is a bit sparse in the first series but improved in the second. If you're wondering what sort of adventures the Freelance Police get up to, in this particular 'episode' Max becomes the President of the US and has to fight an animated statue of Abraham Lincoln, hence the title. I'd rather not spoil any more; if you wish to see what happens (and how) I would like to remind you once more that this particular episode is free.","February 5, 2011","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
