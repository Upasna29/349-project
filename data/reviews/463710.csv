I like how there are different ships to steal your jewels - its something I have not seen before. The difficulty does bump up slowly, making the game quite challenging over time as the space stations get bigger and the enemies come in greater numbers. Quite the well made casual game.","April 29","true","0.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

So simple. Definitely not Bejewled. And it's got pretty space backgrounds and soothing music.","April 30","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As soon as the game introduces the mobile enemies a few levels in, you have basically seen the whole game. Additional difficulty only comes from a larger playing field, more different symbols, and faster enemies. There are long stretches of game where the difficulty doesn't change at all. The content stretching goes so far as requiring the player to play a level twice to complete it, but then again, does it really matter if I have to play 2 identical levels, or one level twice?\n\nThe only reason why I didn't refund the game is that it costs below 1â‚¬, so why bother.","June 5","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To move gems around, you click on two pods "connecting" them, and then click on a gem in either pod you'd like to move and that gem will instantly swap with a gem in the connected pod.  When 4 in that pod are the same, it's complete and gets locked.   Get all the pods locked and the level is complete.\n\nThe challenge starts with the alien ships which transport gems from pods that aren't locked.  The challenge increases when the space stations get larger (from 5 pods to 15 pods) and with additional gem types, and then with additional alien ships (ones that move faster to ones that carry multiple gems).\n\nOverall, it's certainly a neat idea and I did enjoy the game, and I liked the graphics.  But once you get the space station expanded to the larger size, it's very repetitive and the challenge doesn't really ramp up any more; it just gets more annoying (from waiting for aliens to drop a gem you're waiting on).\n\nThe PROs:+ Nice idea\n+ Nice graphics  (Though I'd like wide-screen graphics, and more variety in backgrounds.  But what's there is nice)\n+ Music was pretty good\n\nThe OK:~ Duplicate levels?  I believe there are 68 levels, but how many are identical?  Appears to be a lot.\n\n~ Backgrounds.  The backgrounds are not-widescreen; nor is there many variety of them.\n\n~ No windowed mode?  Considering the resolution is not all that high in the game, and also that ALT-TAB'ing takes a good 30-40 seconds for the game screen to come back up when trying to return to it, this is one of the few games that I really wish had a Windowed display mode.\n\nThe BAD:- No variety in space station layouts.   You have the 5 pod space station, and the 15 pod station station.  (I made it to about Level 45 and only saw those 2 layouts anyway...)\n\n- Timer?  I'm not entirely sure why there's a timer.  For score and bonus purposes sure, but to end your game if it reaches 0?  Not a fan.   Not when I lost on level 40-something because the final jewel of the final pod was being carried around for ~20 seconds when the timer finally ran out.\n\nOverall:  It's a neat game for a little pass-time, but at the same time, you're not missing much.  6 out of 10.","June 5","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
