It can't be difficult to design a different shape salvo for different weapons. As it stands most battles look like a few ships with a rainbow crying in the middle of them.\n\nThere's a crap load of salvage missions, mostly escorting some frigate to a wreck through a series of waypoints that are entirely irrelevant because everything on the map moves to attack you from the very start, and when they're all dead the mission is complete, making them waypointless. However, you don't actually hear about anything that's been salvaged. You get no equipment or new tech or anything from it.\n\nThere's a variety of different hardpoints on ships with different weapons on them. Good. However, there's no upgrades or chance of anything new or different. What's on them is what's on them until the end. Providing variety for this is an obvious way to increase the tactical challenge (and fun) of the game.\n\nBig capital ships have the same range as a half decent staple gun (basically the same as everything else).\n\nThe ships are not what I would call well designed. There's nothing distinctive about them. Stick a couple of engines on a rhombus and you'd have a better looking ship than half the fleet.\n\nThe story is too fragmented for most people to follow. I mean, you have to *really try* to immerse yourself in it; it doesn't entrap you in the world. Homeworld pulled you in within three missions; you watched your home be destroyed, and from that point you were onboard for wherever it'd take you. In this, a guy, who it's been made clear doesn't like you that much, dies, and you get to salvage his ship (well, sort of, see above). Oh and your father is someone high ranking. Not exactly mind blowing.","June 6, 2015","false","4.4"," 131 of 180 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","131","180","13","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988077759/recommended/337680/","76561197988077759","danny_maland","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988077759/","158 products in account","This review is a tough one, because I wanted to like this game - a lot.\n\nThe concept is a really nifty thing: Deliver tactical-pause mechanics to the same genre occupied by, say, "Homeworld." In a trailer it looks VERY cool. Guide the trajectories of fighters, use 3D space to your advantage, set up some killer pincer movements, and just generally have some real control.\n\nThat's the promise. The reality is slow, clunky, and - strategically - just like everything else. Mass your firepower, and just hammer the problem until it goes away.\n\nThe 3D nature of the game IS important. You should organize your fleet such that your ships are unlikely to bump into each other. Past that, though, maneuvering for the optimal shot is a giant pain, and a waste of time. WIth any decently mobile enemy, chasing them down and specifying them as a designated target is an exercise in near futility. You'll end up just going around in circles or "S" curves, all the while being chewed up by whatever is not the designated target. The "turn-rhythm" of the game is such that it tends to produce stalemate, with designated enemies in and out of firing arcs long before your ships decide to actually shoot at anything.\n\nYou're far better off just allowing your fleet to fire at anything they think they can hit, while keeping your ships able to support each other. This means that all the fancy maneuver mechanics can be reduced to a few variations: Everybody turns in a clockwise circle, everybody turns in a counterclockwise circle, or some ships turn one way and the other ships go the opposite way. (The "movement limits" represenation was actually done really well, by the way, even if it could be hard to click on the ship you actually wanted if a big crowd had formed.)\n\nA major contributor to the "clunk" factor is that all non-movement commands go through the HUD interface, with basically zero provision for "context." For instance, designating an enemy to chase down and fire upon should be a matter of right-clicking the enemy and selecting something from a short menu. Instead, it's a chore involving finding the enemy you want, finding the designated fire button, clicking on it, and not really getting much helpful feedback as to what's going on. Shortcut keys do help a bit, but the whole thing realy ought to have been more direct. Missile fire is even worse, with a target designation system which zooms into an enemy (completely breaking your contextual sene of the battle). While you can click directly on a foe to designate them, the "enemy to shoot at picker" is designed around two buttons: Previous and Next. That's fine when there are a few enemies on the map...and horrific when there are tens of them.\n\nAnd, of course, the auto zoom from the target picker often means that finding the target you want becomes a ponderous, multi-step process instead of a snappy one.\n\nAnother thing that drove me pretty crazy was that every mission required the manual rebalancing of energy systems for each ship. Since shields don't regenerate by default, avoiding the loss of a fleet member pretty much demands that you rebalance your power use towards shields. Doing that for each ship, over and over again, was a bit of tedium that could have been done without.\n\nThe metagame also has problems. "Star Hammer" doesn't allow saves during a mission, which creates an all-or-nothing type of scenario that punishes mistakes, bad luck, and the sometimes vague win-conditions far too harshly. It also makes glitches very, very frustrating, especially when a long mission has been going on. More than once, I ran into a situation where the game never fully exited the realtime portion of a turn, and my only option was to restart. What finally soured me completely on the experience was almost finishing a long, difficult engagement...only to have my fleet suddenly refuse to fire at anything.\n\n"Star Hammer" actually does a decent job with its setting, with your bridge being inhabited by real, identifiable characters who converse through text boxes. The humanization of the game is good in that sense, but the wider context tends to get lost. The "world" is actually a spiderweb of various organizations and people - and that's a cool idea - but the way it all comes across is as a confusing mash of names that don't end up meaning much.\n\nI feel like "Star Hammer" might contain the seed of something that's really first-rate. It didn't clear the bar of recommendation for me, but doing so doesn't seem like it would be out of reach for the developers. The way the experience works as a whole needs quite a bit of polishing-up, though, before I would want to try it again.","March 26","false","9.2"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","49","55","2","0"

Only thing it seems to be missing is Multiplayer. If it had that it would be an absolute must buy game. As it is I still recommend it as a great implementation of strategic space ship combat.","June 4, 2015","true","5.8"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","63","82","2","1"

Was looking for this for a long time.\n- Decent AI, with some tough scenarios (played on hard).\n- Shield management is actually fun.\n\nThe bad:\n- The ship variety is limited.\n- Fourteen hours in and I never had the chance to customize my fleet. Every mission I have to use exactly what they give me. I never got any points to buy new ships.\n- War Scale mechanics is opaque and seems pointless.\n- Ammunition is unpredictable from mission to mission. Will I have 12 or 2 missiles this mission?

Because you can "respec" crew trees at any time, there is no sense of important decisions being made.\n- Human ships are interesting, but I found the aliens to be boring (for whatever reason). Just not my thing, and they make up a majority of the battles.\n- Screen gets really messy when the spitters start covering everything in their trails.\n- No sense of drama during rescue/escort missions.

The more I've played it the more its grown on me. At this point I'd give it an 8/10. I doesn't come across as anything revolutionary but its a pretty solid game. It mixes neat elements like ships only being able to fire in a limited number of directions with turn based gameplay. So its kind of like naval combat in some of the Total War games (and probably other games) I guess in that sense. Combat also reminds me of the combat in Space Rangers 2 mixed in with the graphics and feel of Star Wolves 3.\n\nI've only played the first five missions but so far story wise they seemed alright. Just alright though. I'm hoping at this point it evolves into something a bit more substancial because its coming across as being pretty generic.\n\nUltimately, its a turn based game. So if you aren't into that kind of thing you probably shouldn't buy it.\n\nMost of the negatives I have about the game are more nitpicking on my part on ways it could be improved. I'd still overall recommend the game.\n\n\nPositives:\n\n- Combat is reasonably smooth and the game is pretty enjoyable as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- I experienced no major bugs\n\n- The background art between missions looks really nice. Obviously the game graphics themselves are not 2015 level graphics, but they are reasonable I think given the price.\n\n- Seems like the game has a lot of potential.\n\n\nNegatives/suggestions\n\n- It would be nice if there was a waypoint option. Something like Space Rangers 2 where if you've selected a location on the map to travel to (that is outside of your ability to travel to in one turn) you don't have to manually say to go to the next turn in cases where you aren't being fired at.\n\n- The commander/captain of any vessel probably could be shown in a larger text size.\n\n- The first mission dumps a lot of info on you before you probably really need it. Info about the UI could probably be spread out more.\n\n- Some kind of indicator that projects an enemies movement limitations. Particularly if I'm supposed to be (according to the story) familiar with a ship design.\n\n- It would be good if you had an option to turn off automatic dialogue. Sometimes the pacing of the dialogue is a bit off and it takes forever for your wingman to say what they were going to say.\n\n- Very limited ship customization options from what I've seen so far.\n\n- To me it doesn't make much sense that given the 3D nature of space that a ship would only exclusively be able to fire forward or behind it (or exclusively to the sides). Outside of smaller craft like fighters ships should have some ability to shoot targets on their weaker sides, even if that ability is considerably weaker than their ability to shoot on their stronger sides. The only exception to that might be a ship that is exclusively designed to fire a big gun in one direction (like an Ion Frigate in the Homeworld series).\n\n- More significance for the Z axis. If this has some significance then that isn't made clear. It doesn't seem like it has any combat significance.\n\n- The movement of ships can be pretty finicky. You'll click on a ship's shadow and it won't register that you clicked on it. This could be improved I think.","June 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","34","45","3","0"

Pike & Shot has scratched my historical wargaming itch, but it doesn't feel particularly polished. But like every other Slitherine game I've purchased, Star Hammer drew me in with it's concept. While their games are sometimes a bit rough (Sovereignty, I'm looking at you), Slitherine tackles concepts and mechanics very few other companies will - so I took the plunge.\n\nIt was worth it.\n\nI'm only a few hours into the game so far, but I'm enjoying it. The controls are intuitive, The game is gorgeous, with ships moving in appropriately ship-like ways, shootng beams and railguns and missiles (oh, such satisfying missiles!) and dying in interesting ways - full on explosions, drifting hulks rocked by secondaries, the works. The campaign has been fun too - if you've read any Honor Harrington or Jack Geary you're not going to be _too_ surprised by anything you run into in the plot, but it's presented serviceably and the characters are likeable. There's a neat mechanic where you build bridge crews to give your ships passive buffs and the relationships between officers matter - pair folks up who hate each other and that buff suddenly doesn't look so great. Notably, the game presents pretty much all of the story in text and (wonder of wonders) that text is virtually typo free and decently written - and even a bit clever in places.\n\nThe missions so far haven't had a ton of variety - mostly they've boiled down to "kill all the baddies" sometimes with "and make sure this one thing doesn't die, either". Refreshingly, failing the second objective (protecting salvage crews, etc) doesn't always cause mission failures - though I presume there will be reprecussions later in the campaign. Combat feels right for the genre - closing with an enemy fleet is a fencing match of outgoing missiles and countermeasures before broadsides and spinal mounts start blazing.\n\nSo it's totally worth a buy if you want to reenact some David Weber novels or if you're having a hankering for some turn-based strategy goodness - but what are the downsides?\n\n>The music is pretty generic. I turned it off within the first few minutes and put on something else. It's not bad, just bland.\n>The character portraits are a bit "old school" in their design - they remind me of Wing Commander in a good way. However, when they're displayed in-mission they're blurred or low resolution or something, which doesn't look the best.\n>Mopping up the last elements of an enemy fleet - particularly it's smaller/faster ships - can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥. It boils down to a lot of circle strafing and predicting where that last enemy corvette is steering.\n>The game is relatively unforgiving. Crews gain XP from missions, but if they die, they're gone forever. The game rewards patience and planning - be careless in moving your ships and they'll collide, inflicting massive damage to one another and stunning them. While you can save freely between missions, I didn't notice an option to save in-mission, which may lead to frustration.\n\nI've noticed no glitches, freezes, or other hiccups. If none of the above turns you off, the game is absolutely worth a shot - you'll probably have a lot of fun.","June 4, 2015","true","2.1"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

If you like space strategy, you'll most likely like this even if you side more typically towards RTS instead of TBS but it certainly isn't, as obvious from the media posted, a bulletfest action game.  It's still TBS space battles, with a good amount of complexity that you can delve into as deep as you want, that play out in RTS as you finish a turn.  The game has a fun story overriding the campaign as you go from mission to mission which are tactical tbs space battles.  You build and control the resources of your fleet as you progress including assigning crew members and deciding between their special traits which can interract with other crew members based on their relationships.  Another fun element is that you can affect the overall war by cooling off or heating it up by how aggressive you are in the battles which will affect the story.  The graphics are good quality as well and the pew pew spaceship factor is definitely fun.\n\nIt's a no-brainer at 20 bucks if you have an interest in TBS, tactical or strategic, space genre.","June 6, 2015","true","17.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

But the thing that really tips this from a recommend to a not is the warscale system it is broken.\n\nIf you wanted a mass effect style paragon system make it about choices you make in the mission selection screen and or in dialoge options not about the way you fight with absolutly no direction on what determines aggressive or defensive. Did the devs not realise leaving people trying to guess would be frustrating because thats seems obvious.\n\nOh and to top it all off for some reason now after i restarted the game i now cannot gain ship points 8 missions in and im still stuck on 110 the game starts you with meaning i cannot buy new ships. I dont know if this is because i keep getting aggresive warscale (because as i stated 0 direction) or if its a bug that didnt show up on my first play through.\n\nSuch a shame a few of the mechanics have let this game down.","October 25, 2015","false","20.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I do have a few complaints.\n\n1. The RPG mechanics should be deeper.\n\nThe game makes a triffling effort at having RPG esk progression buts its very shallow and doesnt really appeal to me as a long time veteran of RPGs. Perhaps something more like a skilll point system where you can allocate and spec, your captain and crew to your OCD wracked, heart's desire?\n\n2. No customization on a ship by ship level.\nThis game has a great system for customizing what ships are in a fleet, what position those ships start in, ect. But they still dont feel like MY ships. They are cardboard cutouts of what they should be. Ever play Nexus: The Jupiter Incident? The customization of that game, while linear and limited, still managed to make me feel like I was resposible for those few ships. They were very much MINE and loosing one was unacceptable.\n\n3. The story, is somewhat lackluster.\nIve only played the first few missions of the game so far. But the rocky start is really not saying good things about the rest of them. Whats my problem? Well to put it bluntly, the MC is an over agressive idiot, The Military is fine with you not following orders to go do whatever, the antagonists are yawn inducing (not in their battle mechanics but their concept.)\nThis game could really shine if the writing was kicked up a couple of notches. Give us a real space opera, thats what the system feels like it was built for.\n\n4.The art\nOk, the ships are wonderful, (if a bit on the low end for this day and age) but your 2D art? (which I dont have a problem with you using) Is just kind of lazy looking, its muddy and the characters look more like impressionist art than people. This was one issue I really agonised over wheter to put down or not. Im sorry for insulting someone's art like that but, it really should be top notch if your going to use it in a game.\n\nSo there you gave it all of my compaints.\nIf you think it doesnt paint a very nice picture of this game... well your right. This game feels like it was created by a very small group with highly limited resources. I STILL RECOMEND picking this up however. Lets get these guys some money so they can either patch up this game with the five star content it needs, or deliver to us a great title in the same vein in a few years.","June 6, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
