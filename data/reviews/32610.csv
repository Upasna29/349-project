Plenty of custom maps and some still very hardcore dedicated players online at all times.\n\nCompared to other games released in 2009, this is just extremely outdated. But compared to the expectations of fans of the series, it's good enough. I would stay away from it if you haven't played any Delta Force games ever, but if you are a fan of the series it's worth picking up for $5-10 (Amazon has it for sale as Steam doesnt seem to anymore)","December 1, 2013","true","4.4"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

I like the delta force series games just because of the endless maps. Its not always about graphics, it's about game play and how much fun you have playing.  I love games that have no boundries and you can hunt someone for miles before you finally get them. Plus all the close quarters maps where you seem to die every 2 seconds but get in a few kills before you die. My kind of game. I love the delta force series!","June 27, 2013","true","6.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I loved the Delta Force series, my favourite being Black Hawk Down, but this really is one of the worst in the series, despite it being one of the most recent. The enemy AI is robotic and (most of the time) plain stupid, vehicles are ridiculously overpowered and there's no-one ever on multiplayer so I did every co-op map on a public server alone. There are so few weapon choices and the mechanics are so poor, with a rubbish cover system. This is the worst £15 I've ever spent on a game and I regret buying it. 2/10","February 13, 2014","false","9.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.","February 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

If anything, Delta force Xtreme 2 is a soulless money grab. It offers so much less than it's predecessors that it's almost a shame to call it a Delta Force game in the first place.\n\nThe game is not without some strongpoints though. The gameplay is solid and the custom content offers endless replayability, but activating an account near impossible and once you're online you wont find much to do. The AI is abysmal and their's little to no difference in weaponry. this game will not challenge you, and fans of the series will be dissapointed with Delta force: Xtreme.\n\nTake the money you'd use to buy this game and instead go out and buy a copy of Black Hawk Down... a much better experience.","January 6, 2014","false","1.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The game is a lackluster, minimal graphics, shooter thats trying to combine battlefield and COD together. Even then it doesnt do a good job.  Lets start with the game. There is no story at all just that you are a Spec ops person. The singleplayer is just a multiplayer based mission with AI. The weapons are terribly done for balance and even the look. The multiplayer. I made an account with this group thinking it was going to be cool. ITS HORRIBLE. I played ONE GAME and it sucked. The guns were completely imbalanced, there was no large battles with tanks or helicopters, the graphics were muddy and I was confused of how to play a SHOOTER GAME. A SHOOTER GAME SHOULD BE SIMPLE TO PLAY. The game is confusing with the controls like there is no crouch only prone and standing?
