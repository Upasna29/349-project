During the first month online you have complete access to all features at no charge. After the first month, you can still play free, but you are limited to an early war plane set, which varies from arena to arena. To access the full set of all aircraft in all arenas, Steam players can purchase day, week or month passes, which range from $2.99 to $15.95. If you just want to play in a specific event on a specific day, the Day Pass is best for you. If you want to play with the best planes, against the best players, whenever you want, the Month Pass is your best choice."\n\nRecommend you do not buy. Aces high is essentially a more populated version of the same thing with a sub, but no up front fee. I'll admit that the flight model, damage model and graphics are better here. Not ok at all that they charge for the base game if they're going for subscriptions. Feels greedy.\n\nEDIT 1 2015/12/19: Apparently with steam you're supposed to get a month of sub with the purchase so the 15 you spend is supposed to cover the first month of online play. The UI advises to create an account after every training, instant action, mouseclick, but if you make a new account it won't link with steam correctly. Still recommend aces high over this one, free to download and play offline or on private servers, subscription for online arena play, higher server populations.","December 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","1"

Where this sim compromises on graphics it makes up for it in its large open area online combat in arenas spaning 100s of square miles full of targets, such as airbases, towns, docks, supply depots and carrier battle groups. The aim is in closing the enemies bases/towns etc. to allow friendy troop transports to paratroop and capture them for your side, with victory being achieved when you control all of the map (though don't expect it in a single day cause as mentioned they are LARGE maps).\n\nFlying is not to difficult as long you don't stall ('Realistic' flight mode), I recommend using a joystick not a gamepad, and flying the training and offline combat in easy flight mode first in order to get a feel of the 100+ aircraft (all of which are available to fly, none of this unlocking and paying for special types), though I do stress that all online flight is with the 'realistic' flight mode so get the hang of flying with it on before venturing into the online arenas.\n\nThe aircraft models are are mixture of realism and the need to allow ease of playability, and I will say straight away to head off the 'they don't fly realisticly' crowd, of course they won't this is a COMPUTER SIMULATION (this is why I put qoutes unquotes Realistic above), as with all sims compromises had to be made in order to have a large number of combat flyable types within a 4gig package ALL READY TO FLY FROM THE GET GO!!\nThat being said each aircraft has its own quirks, and you need to know whether the type you are flying is a 'Turn and Burner' Like say the Spitfire and A6M Zero or a 'Boom and Zoomer' like the Bf109 and F4U Corsair, because this will dictate how you use them in combat. Also bombers, you need to know whether you will need a full fuel load or not cause this will dictate whether you would be able to take off or not with that heavy bomb load of yours.\n\nThe online community is for the majority freindly and approachabl with great comradeship within the arenas and the different sqauds available to join once you have been flying online a while. Though the number of online players will Vary from day to day and within in the different timezones due to us all spread out over different countries.\nI also recommend getting the free downloadable TeamSpeak com system since this is where all squad voice coms are controlled.\n\nAs a note basic online membership is around $13 a month or there abouts (don't qoute me on that) and that gets you unlimited access to the main arena.\n\nI am sure to have forgotten to mention a large number of things but these are what I could remember off the top of my head for the time being.\n\nThis is Vulcan member of the 'Doolittle Raiders' signing off and I hope to meet you in the air sometime.","September 20, 2015","true","2.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

It has been updated and now out on steam.\nThe game is air combat flight simulator with a very realistic feel and control. After playing the steam version it still feels the same as the old school versions, very hard to learn and I suggest you def' want to get a joystick to help fly.. trust me the keyboard and mouse does not cut it.\n\nPros:\n~ A good mix of content\n~ Realistic controls\n~ Flight sim buffs im sure will be happy\n~ Dogfights with computers or other people in multiplayer\n\nCons:\n~ Graphics and sound are a little outdated\n~ I wish it was easier to learn , this is not for the average gamer\n~ I had trouble with this and Windows 8.1 and 10{Windows 7 worked perfect}\n\nOverall: 6.5/10","May 22","true","0.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Been playing it since 2009, finally glad it is on steam. Very realistically structured, in terms of flight models of aircraft and weaponry and load outs. This isnt your typical shoot em up and fly home simulation. A lot of variables to keep you busy, and coming back. Very addictive once you get hang of it.

I've played this game for 3 days, first two was ok but third day got 5 disconnections, ridiculous! First you have to climb for 5-10 min to get fight or to reach field you want to attack, then you are disconnected! No way people dont pay for this, you will loose time and money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/navyator/recommended/365620/","navyator","Navyator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/navyator/","6 products in account","As some others may have mentioned - Warbirds is, at it's heart, an on-line, massive multiplayer, very realistic WWII flight simulation. It has  extensive offline options that can be enjoyed for itself - well worth the price - these are used by members of the on-line community to hone their skills and as a learning center for new players to develope their flying skills. They can be enjoyed for themselves but the real action is head-to-head play online.\n\nIt certainly does NOT require continual in-game purchases to upgrade and/or grinding to get into an aircraft that is competitive. From day one - in off-line and on-line play (depending on historical arena timeframes & subscription) all aircraft and loadouts are available. The selection is entirely up to you.\n\nThe flight models are as realistic as the WB development team can make them and they are based on actual performance data. Some aircraft are more forgiving than others - just as they were in real life. There is a learning curve as in all flight sims. A joystick will be the preferred controller - you don't need a super pricey model.\n\nAnd the community is very welcoming and helpful, esp. for new players.  Well worth the investment!","September 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If you want realistic flight models, an opportunity to fly in historical events run by the community and supported by the publisher, and a mature community, then this is for you.\n\nMost of the negative reviews will be for the graphics and to an extent the difficulty of the flight models.  It takes a little time to learn how to fly effectively, but the payoff is that you are getting as close as it gets to what it might feel like to have flown one of these planes into action in WWII.  Great community of people, good trainers, and most of the all, the weekly S3 series is immersive and REAL.  Want to experience what it was like to escort B17's deep into Germany against the Luftwaffe, where you are constantly looking over your shoulder wonder if those dots on your high 6 are 190's?  This is it!  The rush of making a clean kill in these series is as good as it gets!\n\nI think the game needs a graphics update, and some work on gameplay, but if realism, immersion, and a great mature community are important, then this has it in spades.\n\nGreat game!\n","April 15","true","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
