It's a puzzle game, and really long one too, much like the classic snake game, with extra stuff to increase the difficulty. It has a difficulty system that can change it up if you find it too easy (or too hard, you know...). There are twenty-four different floors in just the first level, out of three. The down side of it is that you have to collect a certain amount of hearts to go to the next floor or to the next level. This can make it a bit redundant, but, if you like puzzle games, you won't mind. The graphics are good and has it's own charm. I was impressed with everything this game has to offer and, again, I've only played it for about an hour.\nNow, the price is a little rough, unless you use hundred dollar bills to blow your nose, but not any worse than most Indie games(because, you know, they need to eat). I ,personally, had a coupon from making a badge for it and scrounged up the last buck twenty-five, but, if it's on sale, I'd recommend buying it.","May 11","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a zombie centipede 'snake' puzzle game of traversing labyrinths the optimal way, basically the clone of 'Millie' game by the same devs. It's intended for gamepad play but you can use keyboard as well. The problem resides in those controls department - I had a really hard time trying to push buttons in time to turn precisely where I wanted to, so the goal of the game and the thinking part start to kinda vanish behind this struggle - the damn zombillie wouldn't give you one spare moment before she bumps herself in the ♥♥♥♥ for gameover, and the buttons are either too unresponsive, or that's me who couldn't seem to concentrate enough (excuse me, I inconsiderately wanted to have some fun here).\n\nНесмотря на милый вид и неплохо проработанную проверенную временем идею, я не стану рекомендовать, так как вы можете расстроить свои нервы на почве данной игры без особых на то причин. Это головоломка "змейка" про сороконожку-зомби, которую следует провести оптимальными путями по лабиринтам, в общем клон игры "Милли" от тех же разрабов. Задумана для джойстика, но можно управлять с клавиатуры. Проблема лежит как раз в области управления - у меня возникли серьезные проблемы с тем, чтобы вовремя нажимать на кнопки и сворачивать туда, куда хочется, так что цель игры и мыслительная часть как бы уходят на задний план - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ая зомбиножка не даст вам лишнего мгновения перед тем как врезаться себе в ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ и проиграть, а кнопки такие неотзывчивые... то ли это я не сконцентрировался должным образом (ну простите, я всего лишь хотел развлечься).","May 8","false","2.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You can play in different difficulties that grow your length at different speeds as you eat, and it just blocks the higher star rating & "shoes" collected that unlock new levels.  The game runs fine, controls are decent, and had no problems.  But in the end, I just didn't have much fun with it, so thumbs down.  (3/5 stars + trading cards)\n\nMillie is its predecessor, and is largely the same, but Zombillie has improved visuals (in my opinion).","May 28","false","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
