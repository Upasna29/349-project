And it's hard to find ones that doen't seem rushed or use basic recycled ideas. This game is different. This game gives a new meaning to top-down arcade shooters. "The brain slurping aliens are only vulnerable to bullets. Using your flashlight, environment and special powers you have a better chance to take care of the unwanted pink guests." You are faced against waves upon waves of aliens and trust me this experience is more than fun with your friends. As your progress you get new guns you can upgrade, upgrades themselves, and more. Even though you can play by yourself, the ability to play with friends is a HUGE pro. Mess around with friends, or use real strategies to survive through the waves... There are many options on how you can tackle every scenario given the increase in difficulty. Let's not forget to mention how hilariously fun this can get. But the game lacks a content. The developers are really listening in on the players and the communication is there, but there needs to be more variety. Lastly, the price is beyond fair for the replay value alone.\n\nIn my final note, the dev team is awesome with how they respond to the community. They so-far have delivered on their promises.\n\nI'd rate this an 8.5/10\n\n(All this game needs is a little something to improve. I think the developers are trying to create that "something" the game is missing, and I'm looking forward to see what that is)","April 8, 2015","true","0.7"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","50","63","2","19"

The best way to live is to grab random upgrade boxes that will give you money, health, survival abilities, or special attack options.

Meet Jerry, a straightforward guy ready to save the day and possibly the world with nothing more then his flashlights and wits.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mds1Oy2tvd0\nIt came from space is a no nonsense twin-stick shooter, with beautiful subtle colours and electro soundtrack the games aesthetics really do stand out. You have the ability the select from 6 different zones and play in singleplayer or co-op modes supporting up to 4 players. KB+mouse and gamepad controls were both responsive, though I preferred mouse as you could direct the crosshair more accurately which seemed to increase weapon damage or critical shots.\n\nSticking to the tried and tested formula of 'survival waves', rounds will quickly speed up the numbers of enemies and types of species spawned while giving you a short rest between each. Killing enemies and getting higher combos results in larger drops of money which are used for upgrading the 1 of 6 weapons, pistol, shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, laser gun and the old faithful rocket launcher. While you can sit in a corner and gather enemies up, running around the levels uncovers random drops of temporary weapon upgrades, health packs and cash so it's worth staying on the move.\n\nDifficulty options were easy, medium, hard or insane and while I did not have a chance to try multiplayer yet, I'm sure it would increase spawns per person connected adding to the challenge. Both local and online high score boards were also available for each level. Would like to see new zones added in future but whats there is enough to enjoy and recommend. Quite similar to some of puppygames products like Ultratron, if they were set in a 3d world. (good thing!).

Caches with gold (spent on guns and upgrades), health and temporary power-ups drop at various places on the map, which adds another layer of risk and strategy.\n\nMost of the maps are fairly dark, apart from a few lamps, the only light sources are your torch and the aliens' glowing faces, so getting to know the maps is an important step in mastering the game. I like this art-style, however the lack of a brightness setting can be disappointing for some players with old or worn out monitors.\n\nAll in short, quite enjoyable and would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for an action packed, yet tactical game with lots of enemies to shoot.","April 18, 2015","true","15.2"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","0"

They look pink, and at least for me, they all look quite the same (I know you could see differences, but I can't while busy playing it, most of the time).

This was not in exchange for any consideration such as a positive review. Which is good, since I would have trashed it anyway had it deserved it. ;)\n\nAnyway, now with that out of the way, this is a top-down wave survival shooter. Bunches of enemies spawn in, you shoot or blow them up, more spawn in until you die or survive all the waves. In this case the enemies are pink aliens that want to eat your brain. No deceptive game title here. You get a flashlight and a selection of 6 weapons you'll get and upgrade by making kills. Fairly standard shooter fare, but well done. You can play solo or in coop with up to 4 players. Again the gameplay is nothing that hasn't been done at some point or another elsewhere, but this is solidly executed and the fun factor is there.\n\nThe visuals are in a blocky retroish 3D style, with a nice color contrast between the pink aliens and the environments. I like the look myself. The sound is solid but unremarkable. There are cards, achievements, and leaderboards. The achievements will require skill to 100% without being ridiculous, so those are a plus.\n\nIn summary, this treads absolutely no new ground, but it does what it does well. If you like top down survive the waves shooters you should like this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBun/recommended/342620/","MaxBun","MaximumBunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBun/","1148 products in account","I'm conflicted over this game. On the one hand, it has a very charming presentation. On the other, there are so many design choices (flaws) that I cannot agree with for this type of game.\n\nYou play as a survivor of an alien attack that's instantly thrown into waves of attacks in a dark, minimalistic backdrop. The enemies are wonderfully designed (kind of like grues) while the character model and animations for him are noticeably subpar. In the screenshots you can see that multiplayer doesn't even give you different colored costumes. There is some clipping in the game for your hands/guns and the hitbox for guns/solid objects is buggy. You can shoot any car/wall/house and your bullets stop, but if you have a shotgun they may as well not be there. Same damage radius blocked or unblocked which reduces an element of skill for it. It's not the biggest thing but it's there and feels like something they should have fixed by full release.\n\nThe game's scoring system is entirely based around how many aliens you can chain kill. To do this you have to wait for them all to converge on your location from all over the map per wave and kite them as one big group. The money you get is always the same per kill, but you get multiplier bonuses for the alien kill scoreboard. This system is very unrewarding though and there's really only one way to do it - slow, systematic chore working. There is no variance and each time you play a level it's exactly the same as the previous time.\n\nOn the difficulty levels, you have easy all the way up to insane. Easy slows enemies down and gives them less HP, while insane adds more aliens with higher HP and speeds them up. But this turns out to be more artificial than anything. The way they scale them is that the most versatile/mobile enemies will have more HP to take down while the should-be-tankier fodder actually has less. So you spend more time trying to kill the hard to hit ones even though their evasion scales enough on its own. This type of balancing system makes no sense. The biggest and baddest enemies are also the slowest, which means you'll never get hit by them.\n\nThe weapons aren't very balanced either. Anything fully upgraded is efficient to use. This means that the ones that cost more are useless since they take too long to get when you actually need them. You only have 1 weapon slot anyway and you'll always take a one weapon upgrade path.\n\nI would have seen this game as great potential for a co-op horde horror arcade game. Especially if it had procedurally generated levels and they fixed the balance issues. Something like using the lights and darkness to make them slower/faster would have been an amazing dynamic. As it is now though, I'm surprised it's still not in early access. The design choices make no sense for this type of game.\n\nIt's very cute, but has completely unrewarding gameplay. This surprises me because this genre isn't complicated at all. Even games like Titan Attacks are just clones with added charm and that would have been enough here. I don't recommend this game. It seems like it should be in early access still and could use a thoughtful overhaul.\n\nI'm making this a review rather than a discussion because I really don't think one random person saying "redo everything" is something they'd take into serious consideration and I'm supposed to be curating this for them. :P I'll still add it to that list as agreed upon but I can't fake a positive for it.

Waves of aliens will spawn and you will try to survive. Eliminating enemies will award you with money that you can use to buy new weapons and upgrades for them.\n\nThe game offers four difficulties which makes it suitable for casual gamers as well as the ones looking to really challenge themselves. There's leaderboards so that you can prove that you're better than the next guy, but the real charm of the game is playing it together with your friends in Co-op.\n\nI got into the game when it was in beta and this was not that long ago.

Replayability. Some decent variety of content, guns, gamemodes maybe. I'll talk about all the aspects of the game though. Let me start with one of the best things.\n\nGraphics, stylization. The way this game is made on the visual side of things is great. The colors are well balanced, there's perfect contrast, weapons have diverse designs and the projectiles vibrant awesome different colours. If anything, this game is a pretty thing to look at! It's like looking at slot machines, you just can't turn your head off of it.\n\nHand in hand with graphics comes sound design. The sound effects are really good as well, everything sounds awesome (nope, not a LEGO reference) and even the gnarling horde of aliens is believable. Both your eyes and ears will get stimuled by these things and by the end of the playthrough you will surelly have problems realizing if what you see and what you hear is the real world. I had pink goo coming out of my ears.\n\nFun factor is definitely high and we had a lot of laughs playing this in two, and I can bet it would be even more fun playing in four people. The increasing difficulty of the game with changing levels is keeping everyone awake and a bunch of funny achievements only make it better.\n\nWhere the game falls short right now is content-wise. The weapon store and upgrade system is very bland, predictable and it's missing that “MOM I NEED THAT” factor. Same goes for replayability, it just doesn't get anywhere else after a while and I'd much welcome an addition of different gamemodes, or even the possibility of new strategies. There's been a mention of turrets on the forums, oh hell yeah! Give me turrets and a base I have to defend against these pink f*ckers and I'll fire this game any time! That applies to level design which is bland after a while, it just need that spark, maybe a little interactivity, but definitely a change.\n\nDont let that fool you, this game is great and has great potential. It just need that little kick in the back to make it awesome. And given the nature of the developer we can surely expect this kick. Promised weekly updates, feature-wishlist on the forums, etc. seems like he cares and to me that's one of the things that matter the most in a game. If a developer releases a game and shortly after abandons it, then why should I care as well?\n\nOn the technical side of things, it was very easy to set up a multiplayer game so I have to give a thumbs up for that, as it's still (even in the 21st century) not easy in every game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilborghi/recommended/342620/","ilborghi","ilborghi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilborghi/","346 products in account","Unremarkable.\n\nThe game is a basic arena twin stick shooter where you fight hordes of aliens with a "limited" variety of weapons.\nThe game is not strictly "bad", as it doesn't have any blatantly broken features. Everything feels mediocre, unremarkable. It's just hard to stay interested after a couple arenas.\n\nGraphically the game is hit and miss; I mostly enjoy the setting and the alien style; the character model is pretty badly designed and animated, and the weapons range from interesting (rocket launcher blasts, lasers) to very bland (the projectile weapons). Some people complained about the darkness being overdone, but I'm mostly okay with it.\nSo, cute enjoyable purple neon aliens: charming, until you find out after fifteen minutes the enemy variety is very, very limited (as in, 5-6 enemies which in the end look quite similar).\n\nMechanically, the game again is not bad but is unremarkable. You are dropped in an arena and you fight waves of aliens until the end of the level. There are 6 weapons available but there is no reason to switch between them, since there is no ammo management and the most viable strategy is maxing out your favorite weapon and sticking with it: every maxed weapon is strong enough to clear basic enemies and the "big guys" are easily kited. You'll probably end up sticking with lasers or plasma for the whole game with little reason to spend on anything else.\n\nLevel design is good, and probably the best aspect of the game. They got the "city in ruins" style reasonably well and let you use corners and obstacles to control the aliens' movements. Some levels have a "height" element in the form of stairs, but they basically are obstacles you can walk over since you can shoot up or down.\nSWAT helicopters will drop powerups around the arena, encouraging movement and exploration, which combined with the overwhelming darkness makes the levels a bit more interesting. The powerup themselves are serviceable.\n\nI wasn't able to play multiplayer because no matches were on for the entire time I've played and nobody joined my games when I was hosting.\n\nOverall, the game does nothing remarkably poorly, but also nothing remarkably well. Not enough enemy variety to keep it fresh, not enough "wow" factor to hook you in, not enough creativity to set it apart from the mass.","October 8, 2015","false","8.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","1"

I die instantly. try another two times and die instantly. quit playing. When i decide to go back on maybe a hour later i manage to get somewhere. I complete the first and second maps and fully upgrade some guns. The upgrades look cool and there is a balance between all the guns stats. The powerups (cubes of colour that get dropped from the swat hovering vheicle) come in 3 types. money (for upgrading guns), health (maximum health is four), and upgrade (upgrades your gun to a random gun out of the 6 to a similar level of the gun you had - i think it is better). The aliens come in waves leaving you time to run around a little. Only once i finished my first victory did i notice that you could sprint by using the shift button. I still havent got through the majority of the game but it is a fun shooting alien game. It can be difficult at first but it gets easier once you think of some good tactics to use.\n\nThere is only one downside. That is that it can lag sometimes - Actually, im not sure why this is a downside.

The only complaint I have is that on Countryside, things get way too crammed and it kinda ruins that run and gun experience, but every other map is pretty damn solid.\n\nSound: The sound design is pretty good. The creepy, glitchy, alien music sets the intense yet stylish mood right from the get-go. The aliens make these weird sounds all unique to each type, which makes it all the more awesome yet terrifying when you hear certain ones coming your way.\n\nWeapons: The weapons are awesome. Hands down great. They each have their own unique style of gameplay and make for a unique experience each time. The pistol seems to be the only weapon which just isn't worth investing your hard earned cash in, but oh well. Each weapon can be upgraded 3 times, and they all have different prices based on I suppose the develepors view of their awesomeness and worth (which means the rocket launcher is obviously gonna be the most expensive, even though I prefer the plasma gun myself). I wish they would add some more weapons, and maybe change their designs which are pretty bland at the moment, but otherwise they are top notch.\n\nMaps: Before I did complain about one map, Countryside which just really seems to be too squished compared to the other maps I've played so far, but that's about all of the negatives for the maps. They are relatively well spaced out, and while they are challenging enough to manuever around, they are also fair and give you chances to escape the alien horde at almost every turn, albeit only just alive that is.\n\nOther: With developers that constantly change and add things to the game, this game will always feel new and fresh every time you come back to play it. I haven't really played much multiplayer at the moment, so I can't really give my view on that, but one thing I feel the developers absolutely NEED to add is some customization. The guy you control is really really bland, and it almost ruins the quirky side of the atmosphere. I'd just love to see some customization of my character and give him some of my own little traits. Other than that, that is all I can really think of.\n\nSummary:\nPositives:\n-Great pace\n-Intense gameplay\n-Quirky style while also maintaining atmosphere\n-Creepy yet silly sound design\n-Nice array of weapons\n-Constant updates\n\nNegatives:\n-Lack of character customisation (lol not even a negative tbh)\n-Some map designs are a bit off (*cough* countryside)\n\nOverall, I give it a 9.5/10. Basically just a quick game to play every now and then and have a blast while doing so. :)","May 11, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Easy wasn’t much better.  The game is more fun if you play with others.  Jumping onto multiplayer you should be able to find open games, and this is a lot of fun.\n\nThe game also has a good split screen local co-op mode.  This is also a lot of fun.\n\nBasically you need multiple people to play so that you can die.  As long as your mate survives for 20 seconds you can respawn.\n\nPros\nGood aesthetic design.  It’s the blocky “voxel” style but it looks good and clean.\nGood combat and weapon variety.  The weapon upgrades are fun and keep me interested.\nGood co-op gameplay\nCons\nLevels are repetitive.  This is partly because the levels are all a dark “night” setting.\nGameplay isn’t that varied, but it’s still fun.\nThere is a bit of lag in online rounds when everyone is shooting upgraded weapons at a huge horde.  This is problematic since some aliens will jump at you.  I don’t know if this is because the other player’s internet connection was bad, or maybe the geographical distance was just too great.\nThoughts\nOverall the game is fun and well made, yet simple.  For me, I probably will keep it installed for local co-op gaming with the Mrs’.  It seems like a game that would be fun to play with some background TV on.  A good party game.\n","November 8, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","2"

Check it out Here\n\nAfter playing this game for a short while I have gathered what I believe to be enough information on this game to give it an honest review. Obviously games are selective in taste, so don't only read this review or watch my video, check out a few others before making a final decision to spend your money.\n\nPostives\nGraphics - Personally the simplicity of the graphics in this game are wonderful. I love the lighting effects and and how this game just looks alround.\nSound - The sound in this game is what you would expect it to be. You have the great atmospheric soundtrack whilst playing, the sound of each gun is different and noticeable, plus the abient sounds are also spot on.\nGameplay As I'm sure you have read or noticed already, this game is a roundbased survival game, and that is exactly what it is. You play as a man with guns shooting aliens that spawn. You are given 12 levels to pass, each one having to hit a certain milestone before being able to move on. You can upgrade your weapons whilst ingame. Very simplistic and very true to the nature of roundbased survival games. Also this game runs great, I'm sure you will not having any problem on any system.\nPick up and play - This game is great for those people looking for a game that they can load up and just play, you can have hours of fun just shooting things without having to worry about anything. Believe me, it is literally a pick up and play!\n\nNegatives\nWhilst I did struggle to find any true negatives for this game, I did look and found a few things to nickpick on, or better yet just one main thing\nMultiplayer - I feel bad for mentioning this as the devs themselves cannot really do anything about this. Just with lack of players right now you will be VERY lucky to find anyone playing. In my time of playing I have only ever managed to come across one lobby. But as time goes on hopefully this game increases in popularity and multiplayer grows.","November 15, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

But under its covers lies a very cheap gameplay design.\nThere is no real progress in playing the campaign. Every level is just a different map with no variates but visual ones. Upgrading weapons doesn't feel rewarding, and there is no strategy involved (except for kiting enemies). The "campaign" is just a bunch of unlockable survival maps.\n\nI can imagine it being a great game with a *real campaign*. The levels could have different "Left For Dead-style" objectives: Reach a specific destination (like a draw bridge), prepare defenses (mines, turrets, ...), then set off the horde and survive until you can finally escape.\nFor more strategy and deeper gameplay experience, especially in coop, weapons would need to be more different. Right now, all weapons are more or less bullet sprayers (except the rocket launcher). E.g. pistols could make players more agile while a sniper rifle could be used by a player to stay on a higher position and take of the big guys from far away. Having limited ammunition could engage players to use different weapons.\n\nBut I doubt that any of these changes will ever make it into the game (since what I'm suggesting is almost a complete redesign). And since I had very little and short fun playing it with my friend, I cannot recommend this.","August 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

My earliest memories of arcades aren’t filled with Donkey Kong or Pacman. Instead, my weekly allowance was pumped into an arena-shooter called Smash TV. It’s a genre that started me on my path to video gaming glory long before my first Game Boy, and while my tastes now desire something more complex, there is a lot to be said for sitting back and shooting a mob of aliens in the face. ICFSAAOB offers a few new ideas, and the active nature of the dev team bodes extremely well for the future of the game. Weapons are a pleasure to use, and you always thirst for the next upgrade. The constant shadows do make the levels feel a bit too similar, but the dependence on your flashlight to spot the aliens is extremely engaging. Does it win out in the end? Let’s shed some light on It Came From Space And Ate Our Brains.\n\nWhether you play with a friend or all alone, you are sure to encounter more aliens than you can handle. The difficulty of the game will determine the HP and speed of the alien horde. Combos are built by killing large strings of aliens in a row, if you want to maximize your weapon as fast as possible you need to let the aliens converge into a giant horde before splattering them to bits. It seems like a great plan on paper, but in execution this methodical method of maximizing wealth becomes quickly monotonous. The art style is extremely nice, and is determined to shine through the inky shadows that coat every stage. The terror of a mob of pink mouths marching through the dark is visceral. I’ve been telling people for years that pink is terrifying, now they will truly see.\n\nThe replayability of ICFSAAOB is largely thanks to the variety of weapons and upgrades. Lower cost weapons can be maxed out quicker, but will have less power in the long term. The weapon you end up picking should always compliment your style of play. Do you prefer to thin the horde with a rocket launcher? Or pick off the strays with a laser rifle? The choice is yours, and any pick you make will be the right one. There is a great sound to every weapon that can be noticed from the first “pop” of the default pistol. The music is a decent drum and bass track, but I feel like it is a bit too slow to really capture the frantic action that is happening on the screen especially when playing on Insane.\n\nOverall, It Came From Space And Ate Our Brains is an extremely likeable game with an amazing aesthetic and decent gameplay. Skills are being added to the game slowly, and there is a wishlist thread over on the forums which informs me that Triangle Studios really are dedicated to making the best game possible. The game is extremely affordable at only $10.

Sometimes it looks like it's designed for multiplayer, but also playing singleplayer is a great and pretty addictive experience. Not the CIV kind of addictive where you play for hours, but the kind of addictive that keeps getting you back into the game regularly.\n\nAlso, as you can probably see from the news history and the games' forums, the developers are actively supporting the game and adding new stuff. There have been pretty significant changes to streamline the gameplay to be more fast-paced, and around the steam summer sale a bunch of new features were added.\n\ndisclaimer: I know someone on the dev team, so I might be a bit biased.","June 21, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But why?\n\n\nI came across the booth I started watching the game.\nIt got clear and mostly colorful graphics with a dark level.\nYou where able to play 4 players split screen on a controller.\nIt looked like a little chaotic top down twin stick shooter.\n\nIn the time I was waiting to play it myself. I talked to the developers.\nThey try to improve the game and game balance based on the community feedback.\nAlso, they wanted to support the game for a while to build a community around it.\n\nI started to play the game after a lot of talking about other games with the developers.\n\nThe game\n\nYou play the game with max 4 players, they got different fresh colors.\nIn a small map you get 6 waves of aliens. They are different from type.\nYou can upgrade your weapon with money, money drops from killed aliens.\nalso, you can buy items. This can be a sentry gun or a 15 sec power up.\nthese items will also drop randomly.\n\n-The character movement felt smooth. I did not get stuck on walls or other objects.\nThe shooting/aiming was done with the other thumb stick. The response was quickly.\n\n-After killing aliens you get money. With the money you can buy weapon upgrades or items.\nThis is done in the buy menu, it is a simple buy menu.\nBut with the amount of aliens around you still don't have much time to buy.\nThere is a shortcut button to buy the same as your last upgrade.\nI was playing on a controller and I am not used to them, in the beginning I was struggling to navigate to it. But i will learn quickly.\n\n-the level itself is a little dark. Sometimes you can not see clearly where a wall is. A few times I bumped into the invisible wall, and got cornered.\n\n- the aliens did not feel overpower, there are differed types of aliens. They made to feel the game better. For example you got a big alien who need more hits to die. Or aliens that can jump.\n\n-you got 6 waves of aliens. With the first being the most easy and the 6 wave the hardest. I don't know yet if the game got enough re playability, the best think you can do is to play it with friends. In this way you can enjoy this much longer. The split screen coop multiplier will add this.\n\nOn the end I recommend picking up this game. In my opinion you will be able to play it multiple times.\nIt is fun to play a match if you don't have a lot of time to play.","October 11, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To give you an idea, the gametime I've accrued has been done in two settings. The fact that I could open it up, play it for a bit, then put it down, is really saying something.\n\nWhy is this unique? Because, though I enjoy this particular genre of game, most of the time I play them once or twice and then never touch them again. Two plays is pretty good - and it won't be limited to that. "It came from space and ate our brains." - a sentence for a title.\n\nHighly stylized visuals, which I personally enjoy. A lot of time went into building the levels, but I would like to see more color in them in the future. The domo-kun lookin' alien chompy things make sounds like when you stir a bowl of wet spaghetti, their pixelated light-bright brains splatter after you shoot them. Love it!\n\nIt's simple, but sets itself apart from the other "stay alive" games in a number of ways, and it seems reasonably possible to 100% of the game without investing an entire week and a half of your life into it.\n\nMy only complaint? Though the soundtrack is awesome, I would love to hear some more variety in it. The sounds themselves are fantastic, and the wiggly-armed monsters are adorably KILLABLE!!!\n\nAs of this writing, this is the only game that the developer has on Steam - I would love to see them reuse the graphical ideas from this in other games, similar to what a few other companies that I'm addicted to have done. How about making a breakout clone? There's just NOT ENOUGH OF THOSE - plenty of space invaders, plenty of games like this, but not nearly enough breakout clones.\n\nWhat more can I say? It's still installed after a day, and Yet Another Zombie Defense isn't. I WANT to 100% this.\n\n10 bucks? Heck yes, I would pay 10 bucks.\n\n9/10 - Lets see more!!","March 25, 2015","true","4.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

It's a minimalistic 3d twin-stick shooter in the world of Lego Aliens (kinda). It feels uncomfortable to play both with mouse and 360 pad, you can call me lame for that and I am, but I not gonna train skills like crazy to open more of its dull greyscale levels for highscoring. I know they resemble ruined dark world, but.. I'm somehow not convinced by the look of it, more like an excuse for cheap bulky design. Effects aren't impressive too.

Я понял, что они призваны изображать темный разрушенный мир... но почему-то меня не убеждает их вид, а больше похоже на оправдание дешевого кондового дизайна. Эффекты также не впечатляют. Но хуже всего - прицеливание, болезненно тяжелое для правого большого пальца, а на 2ом уровне когда появляются орды смещающихся в стороны врагов, меня просто одолел этот однообразный процесс бегания в сумерках и игры в корриду с этими садистскими алгоритмами.","February 14","false","4.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","1"

You start with the gun and with the money earned you can buy or upgrade the gun you want. You have the choice between the gun(starting weapon), shotgun, plasma, laser, machinegun and rocketlauncher. In addition you can also purchase items like turrents, shield, health. So depending how things are going or how you want to play you hav a decent amount of choice.\n\nIn addition to an obvious single player mode, you also have a multiplayer mode. You can play with friends or join a game with other people. I personnaly consider that the multiplayer mode is much more fun than the single play mode. Firstly because you can resurrect if there are still other players and also you have more strategies at your disposal.\n\nThere is a certain wariety in the type of aliens you encounter. I have seen around 8 different types i think. Depending on the type some guns are more effective than others. For example there is an alien that dodges your shots by teleporting sideways. This alien is difficult to kill with the normal pistol. Its however very easy to kill with a shotgun. Its interesting to see that different guns are effective against different ennemies and you can switch between guns depending on the situation.\n\nNow lets continue with the negative/bad points. About the gameplay itself theoretically you have a varied choice of weapons to chose from (6 in total). However i consider that some are nearly always better choices than others. The rocket launcher for example is especially bad. You absolutely need a wall to explode the missiles. No wall no explosions or at least not where you want them. So depending on the map you can forget that weapon. I am always afraid to get upgrades lying on the floor because i am afraid to get a rocketlauncher which often ♥♥♥♥s me up.\n\nAnother problem is the environnement which sometime really ♥♥♥♥s you up. You can get stuck on small debris that has the same color as the ground so its hard to see. This happens a lot to me killing me very often. This is enhanced by the fact that the whole game is very dark. The only light you have is you torchlight. So debris that are hard to see become even harder to see. in addition to that environnement can influence the trajectory of your bullets. Ramps are one of the most annoying things. if you are on a ramp you can only shoot monsters on the ramp because youre shots go in the same direction as the ramp. If you are off the ramp the ramps absorb/block your shots. So when you are fighting you always have to watch out for the ramps otherwise you will be unable to hit certain ennemies.\n\nThe last problem is that there are not a lot of players in multiplayer mode. So you really need a friend that owns the game if you want to play in multiplayer mode.","December 11, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The soundtrack matches the game's atmosphere.\n2. Awesome graphics, I love those 'cubic-like' graphics.\n3. I enjoy the weapon upgrade system!\n4. Infinite ammo!\n\nCons:\n1. It feels like it lacks content. I want more guns, equipment, and more types of aliens!\n\n2.\nBug: the shield powerup sometimes isn't centered.\n\n3. Pressing Esc won't close the menu.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1. Add sounds when you buy guns & equipments.\n2. Add different kinda of upgrades to the turret.\n3. Add caber wire(if that's how it's called), and options to make it with glue that will slow aliens, and another upgrade that can make it poisoned.\n4. Add more alien types!\n5. Add more soundtracks, weapons.\n6. Add mute button and sound in the menu(while in-game)\n\nThe game is fun, but it sure needs more stuff into it!\nThey will release an update soon, so I hope for more content and fixes.\nWith enough content and bug fixes, the game can be very good!\n\nStill, it's a must try!\n\n***Will expand this review after I'll get a significant amount of playtime***","December 21, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a certain atmosphere and definetely cool blocky graphics. It has vibrant colours and really cool theme as well as soundtrack. Really great fun with four players and it does have a lot of replay value.\n\nThe fact that the developer is contiously updating and improving/adding more to the game increases its overall value. I do recommed purchasing this game. 9/10","June 18, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It becomes very repetitive very quickly, but that's okay. The controller support for local coop wasn't working for me. I think the game would have been a little better if I could have played with some friends. The weapons are pretty satisfying not going to lie.","November 21, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has Co-op for you and 3 other friends to kill aliens and see who gets the highest score or combo. This game is pretty simpler there are 12 stages that you can play on. There isnt a whole lot to this game, but its fun to play with friends and kill aliens. I would give it an 8/10 because it doesnt have a lot of gameplay to it, but it has enough to be fun.","December 28, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mineselves/recommended/342620/","Mineselves","Myself","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mineselves/","438 products in account","What I like\nMultiplayer. This game is so much more fun to play with a friend/friends then just playing it by yourself.\nNice graphics and sounds.\nVery simple. Pick your gun/guns, collect upgrade boxes, blast aliens, and survive until the end.\nDifferent difficulties.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like\nRepetitive. VERY VERY repetitive.\nNo need for more then just one gun. When you get to the harder difficulties it's better to stick with one gun and upgrade it all the way instead of getting more then one gun.\nIt gets kind of annoying just holding the shoot button down.\nEasy is very boring.\n\nOverall\nThis is a very fun game to play with a friend but not as much fun by yourself. Recommended if you have a friend to play with.","January 19","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
