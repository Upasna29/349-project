The production quality, art, and way the novel is presented is actually okay, which makes me even madder that the plot had to be something as bad as what it was.

That was Aoi’s point of view until Sora came into his life. Aozora Meikyuu is a visual novel that tells the story of Aoi and Sora’s meeting and path to romance. This unlikely pair have to figure out how to co-exist as Sora tries to bring out the kinder side of Aoi. A tale of human emotions, sexual desires and personal growth, Aozora Meikyuu will take readers on an interesting journey with lovely artwork to bring everything to life.\n\nAoi is a normal high school student until his love confession to a classmate goes wrong and he drops out after the rejection. Years later he is now a, hikikomori, shut-in who spends most of his time watching anime and playing video games, especially visual novels. One day on his way home from the store a beautiful young woman with cotton candy-hued hair literally falls from the sky on top of him, naked. The lovely Sora then proceeds to force herself onto Aoi’s life, moving into his home and becoming his housemate. Despite Aoi not wanting to deal with her he can’t help but grow closer and closer to the mysterious girl, the game following their relationship until the shocking end.\n\nI can’t really go much more into detail about the story without spoiling anything, however it did take a bit of an unexpected turn. During most of the game Sora doesn’t talk about herself at all nor does she give much reason for being so attracted to Aoi. He treats her pretty badly for the first half of the game, you can even kick her out of the house and not let her stay but that will end the game prematurely. There is also another girl after his affection, Misaki, however she seems very shoehorned in and it’s also odd that she wants anything to do with the protagonist. Aoi is a shut-in who would rather look at anime girls than real ones, he’s rude and rather depressing. He only becomes more likeable after falling in love with Sora. The second half of the game is mainly about their relationship, sex life and him coming to terms with where his life is at the moment. Misaki, despite being another romantic option, only shows up twice and only has two ending; a good and a bad one. She also has no CG pictures which is a shame.\n\nAll of the CG is of Sora, and it’s well done. She is drawn to be very busty and sexy and the artwork ranges from cute to downright sexual. There is no nudity in the game, save for one picture so everything is pretty tame. There are sex scenes in the game but they mainly consist of kissing and then fade to black moments. I don’t mind this but for the amount of times sex does happen it makes the lack of CG for the scenes very apparently. The music is nice, there isn’t a huge amount of variety however. There were a few times where the music seemed to be a bit creepy but nothing of the sort was actually happening which created unnecessary suspense.\n\nAozora Meikyuu is a simple game, it won’t take that long to finish one play-through and the other endings are easy to get after that. The story itself has a few dull moments, unfortunately having to do with a lot of the day-to-day interactions between Sora and Aoi. When the plot takes twists and turns, they’re very interesting and well written but overall the game hoovers in neutral territory with not much happening. However, it’s a good read with lots of choices to make and the choices are a timed which is a nice feature for this genre of game. There is plenty of humor in the game, especially at the irony of it being a visual novel about a shut-in who plays visual novels. The price is very reasonable for the game’s length and there are also trading cards to collect, if you don’t mind a bit of naughty humor I would recommend this game wholeheartedly.\n\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favorite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 5","true","13.0"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","58","69","4","0"

This game can be beaten in under an hour, if not thirty minutes. I only have more playtime on it because I wanted the card drops.\n\n---\n\nI can honestly see no reason to want to play this game when there are much better visual novels on Steam and on the internet in general. This game is shoddily written, which is only made worse by the fact that it's painfully short.\n\nThere are actually choices and multiple endings in this game, to which I can give it some credit. However, since everything is so bunched up together due to the game's length, there's no time to feel any impact to your decisions besides "oh hey, I got a good ending," or "oh hey, I screwed up."\n\nThe characters are generic stereotypes, although that honestly is possibly too kind of a term for them. They might actually be too single-note for that. Any of the "romantic" scenes are downright cringe-worthy, and it really doesn't even make sense for the protagonist to care about the lead girl by the end of the game.\n\nThe art and music are both passable, but forgettable. Nothing to particularly note here, I can't really complain, but I also can't really compliment anything.\n\nOn the subject of the art, you can see all the CGs in the game the first time you boot it up, without even playing the game. Maybe that's why there's an achievement for actually bothering to hit "new game."","June 1","false","1.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Playing through to several different endings took under an hour.\n\nIt has a fairly standard plot (for VNs), a girl falls out of the sky and tries to seduce you. Obviously she isn't a normal girl. The story is so short I can't say more without spoiling it.\n\nIf the story was fleshed out more, so it took a few hours for a play through I would most likely recommend it. It also could use achievements and ending tracking. In its current state it is simply too short.\n\nI really liked the "inaction" mechanic. A timer started when you were presented a choice, and letting the time run out had its own result. In fact sometimes silence was the correct answer.\n\nTo the devs, please expand on it!

Actual playtime is around an hour with a little more to take alternate paths.\n\nI enjoyed this short visual novel. A naked girl falling from the sky was a bid odd, but the ending cleared that up. The rest of the beginning seemed a bit typical, and I started to get annoyed at Aoi and wanted to punch him for being such a weirdo. As the story progressed, I was really intrigued with what was going on. I wanted to know why they both acted the way they did. The ending was a complete surprise. I was both happy and sad for the guy.\n\nI'm not sure if I would've paid $4.99 for it, but I got it as part of the $6 level "Anime Angels" bundle on IndieGala.

The story is so anime that it makes me cringe every minute or so. I personally enjoyed it my first readthrough, but that's because everything about this VN is so ridiculous that I couldn't take it seriously. The only reedeming part about this VN would be the way it handled choices with a timer mechanic, which is something I would like to see other (better) VNs do or be inspired by.

I didn't buy my game, it was more or less like my friend bought it and shared his acc's library with me, so I had one or two of his visual novels which, I'd say are rather enjoyable for romance stories, but this one had a bit too much erotic scenes which I mostly flew through.\n\nSo, mainly I'd recommend it, the reasons will be the following ones :\n\n1. The CG's are nice, I really enjoyed the art although the eyes could be drawn better / more lively when they're open, they look fat :P\n\n2. The story's pretty nice, but if you go into a wrong route/selection, you get a bad end, there's like 3 death ends and 1 true end, which you eventually stay immortal with Sora forever in the labyrith that leads to the heavens where only gods can live (you'd get reincarnated).\n\n3. Sora was cute (though I didn't like her being dirty), I enjoyed how she had a ponytail later on, liked those instead of twin tails, if you like a lively, active and a girl that's being honest with you in everyway, yeah go for this game\n\nIf you have some extra bucks you can spend and you want a visual novel that's somewhat dirty without hentai scenes, this is your thing.","March 5","true","1.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Boring, repetitve, not original, schematic. Game looks like it was created by cherry lonely otakus. RenPy have so many options about fading and other things, but i saw only 1 effect in entire game. Art is only good, this and cards were only reasons i played this game. Thank God this game doesn't have adverts. :D","June 6","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
