The setting, while not entirely unique, does offer the player a wide variety of strategic options.  The music in particular is very well done in this title and along with the stage transitions keeps the gameplay moving forward smoothly.  The Steam Overlay and widescreen options are supported, so if you are a fan of Bejeweled or Tetris, you will find a lot to like in Planet Busters.","March 17, 2012","true","0.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

'나름 괜찮은 게임이었는데 특정 스테이지 지나치게 높은 난이도 수정했다고 하더니, 이전 세이브파일이 완전 날라간 이상한 버그가 있어서 접었다.' 지금은 괜찮을지는 모르겠음.","December 13, 2011","false","0.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"
