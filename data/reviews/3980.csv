It's easy to understand but operates slightly differently from how most others do (where road access between buildings is necessary for benefits), instead opting for a direct "distance" approach in order for benefits to convey. Because of this, some strategies may seem non-intuitive at first to folks who are experienced in the genre.\n\nIt's competent, and fun - not the best example of the genre, but a good way to spend some time if you're into this type of game.","February 13, 2014","true","18.3"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","47","52","2","0"

You can research technologies to unlock new buildings, but it stays in one era (of course), and it has wonders you may build. That's about all for the similarties between Civ and CivCity.\n\nThe campaign does a good job of easing you into building a city, introducing you to new buildings little by little. I kept expecting it to end, but it ended up being a fairly deep game, the ending having quite a lot of buildings and rescources to manage. I had a lot of fun, especially at the end when I had to make my city pretty with gardens and statues in order to win the game.","September 23, 2015","true","52.9"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","0"

Build your settlement from just a few huts into a detailed and thriving center of trade, conquest and research. The game reminds me alot of the ANNO series where you have settlers that come into your city, you have to fill certain needs, and they level up. A player can choose from a free-build city, to doing the campaign, and even beyond to playing your own custom maps that YOU as a player can create.\n\nA few things I have noticed that are not accurate, is that aquaduct technology allowed for one main trunk to branch into smaller segments, in this game that does not occur so you do not get the representation of the True aquaduct system. However the gameplay was not affected by this.\n\nOne thing that I do NOT like about it is that I found the maps to be small. I mean really small. I constantly had a high unemployment. Apparently settlers just come in even if there is no spare work slots. And the workers dont leave if you bulldoze work places if you move them. Documented sources via gametap.com/formus have stated that "when happiness is positibe, immigrants arrive reguardless of housing and cause unemployment and housing chrises" With this said its kinda broken in a sence if you have 100% happiness you will always have a high unemployment.\n\nAnother thing is that widescreen support is not automatically built into the game on download. (As also documented in steam forums) HOWEVER there are fixes and solutions for this that can be found on google.\n\nNow then for the positives. It is a simple game. The menus are easy to navigate, and the gameplay is easy and quick to comprehend. For example Wheat farm -> Wheat -> Mill -> Flour -> Bakery -> Bread.  Another thing is that it IS addictive. looking at my clock I played 3-4 hours on one map straight through. Please remember to set yourself a timer when you play this game I will not be responsible if you spend 3 whole days on the game and forget to eat or sleep. Yes it is that addicting.\n\nOther thoughts : I wish widescreen resolution was included with the game. I wish there was alot more realism, for example you cant build on mountains.. Yet the alps are in the north, and the apennine run through the center. I am quite sure the Romans found a way around that.\n\nOverall : Would recommend. Due to price. Recommend x 1.5 .. H/N Kinsha review rates this AS.... 4.25 cookes OUT of 5 cookies.\n\nI am Natalia Kinsha and I approve this message ^.^","November 30, 2013","true","4.5"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","34","37","3","0"

I wasn't disappointed, I enjoyed building my cities which could grow quite quickly once you have managed to start making good money. I found some difficulty when I first realised that when the houses evolved they needed to be rehomed and I had to do a lot of remapping of my city to fit in my estates. My own fault for not checking the tutorial before each campaign mission.\nIt's all about balance. Big cities can be hard to manage if you haven't got the means to meet everyones needs. Also vagrants don't stop coming, by trying to house all your workers more vagrants come to the citie even if you don't have the jobs for them. This doesn't stop you from being able to play the game, it is only a slight annoyance in that you can't really create a perfect city.\nIt also has a military side to it for those who would like it, adding another level in the game. Trying to keep yourself well defended whilst also keeping your city happy and growing adds the next difficulty to the game.","June 11, 2015","true","20.5"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

To start with, the game is very simplistic in design and approach, but don't let that fool you into think this game is easy.  To put it simply, it is relaxing but challenging, but the challenge can be set harder if you want to try at a much more diffcult level.

CivCity Rome is pretty good, but it has some bug that need to be addressed.  I've played 31 hours over the last two weeks, and I have found some minor bugs in the game. Sometimes, but workers sleep in when its work time.  My docks unload very slowly or not at all. Why wont my houses improve when they are surrounded by plenty of services.  I would like to see overlays to see which building are negatively affecting my houses, is that the problem? Citizens seem to get stuck in ruts and ingore the bath or food they need to improve housing, even though there is plenty in the city and near by.\nI like the game, but I'm barely in the 4/5 part of the campaign and I've spend many hours just trying to past basic hurtles.

I hope the latter, because while it looks cute and seems to play decently at first, everything begins to unravel as soon as the scenarios get a tiny bit more challenging.  By the time I was playing Britannia, I realised that there was only superficial control of basic economic functions and none of the things that I wanted and needed to do were possible.\n\nI could tell a warehouse to send  one commodity to another warehouse, but I couldn't tell workers to stop gathering the raw resource (the only way to control a glut of supply was to demolish the worker's station).  I couldn't prioritse manufacturing at any particular workshop (Settlers could do that 20 years ago, so...really?)  I couldn't manage workforce supply and demand by assigning additional carriers either.\n\nEven basic functionality was missing.  For example, there is no prompt, visual or verbal, to tell you that one of your residences is either devolving due to lack of desired resources or needing intervention in order to evolve.   The first one in the tutorial is brought to your attention, but that's it.\n\nThere are only verbal prompts (hard luck if you are a hard of hearing games player who uses captions) and no other sign of something wrong when granaries and warehouses get full, or when food is close to running out.\n\nYou cannot even zoom out to see the whole map at a glance and half of every single map is unusable due to bumpy terrain, with no option to do anything about this.\n\nSo I rate this game as frustrating and annoying once the initial charm wears off. I did however laugh quite heartily at Spartacus and his East London accent.  I kept waiting for him to break out into full Cockney or steal a diamond or a rare pair of flintlock muskets.  Sadly, I was disappointed in that as well.","January 29","false","30.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The first one being the fact that things get quite boring once you've mastered the correct technique to expand your city and improve your hovels.\n\nAnother issue, (although this may be a "one off") is the occasional failure of avatars to carry out their work. For example, the Well worker, the firemen and the tunic weaver tend to either sleep or wait about instead of work. This is a significant problem because it means I am unable to progress through the campaign, and it also halts any chance of progression.\n\nAside from these pointers, it's a lovely game (if you're lucky to not have these issues).","February 2, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play the clever city builder in the employ of the Roman goverment to seek out new areas and found new cities from the ground up.  Each scenario becomes increasingly difficult, but not to the point that it becomes overly taxing to build and maintain your city.  There are fewer overlays in this game, making it slightly harder to micro manage your city as perfectly as you might have in previous city builders of the same genre.  Still, you command all the power on your map, and if a Roman's house has to go for the city bath, you just say the word.  There are also economic and military scenarios available as you progress into the game, as you might have assumed.\n\nThere are only a few negative aspects of the game that might make the avid city builder a little frustrated.  In CivCity: Rome, you find yourself balancing happiness constantly.  The scale goes from +100 to -100 and it affects your population directly.  If you leave your happiness at +100 (which is relatively easy to do in most scenarios) your population will explode leading to "vagrants" that sit outside your town center, create housing shortages, and generate... unhappiness.  On its own, you can counter this effect, but you'll eventually find yourself trying to balance your population by keeping your happiness in the -10 to +10 range, which equals 0 growth and 0 loss.  If you then want to create a new industry, you'll need to bump your happiness to get more people, then bring it back down again.  Occassionally you'll receive empire bonuses or, negatively, barbarian threats that will mess with your happiness for a short time.  I found this yo-yo effect to be a little annoying at times.\n\nPostively, Sid has added some researchable technologies that you can use to customize your city to the style you want for the particular map your on, which is really refreshing.  This game is really a solid add to your collection if you like these types of city builders.","June 15, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can edit a config file to set the resolution manually, but there's still so little visible game space that placing some of the larger buildings, like a circus means you can't even see the whole footprint to place it.\n\nBottom line - I really wish I had done a little research, even for spending $2.50.

You play the clever city builder in the employ of the Roman goverment to seek out new areas and found new cities from the ground up.  Each scenario becomes increasingly difficult, but not to the point that it becomes overly taxing to build and maintain your city.  There are fewer overlays in this game, making it slightly harder to micro manage your city as perfectly as you might have in previous city builders of the same genre.  Still, you command all the power on your map, and if a Roman's house has to go for the city bath, you just say the word.  There are also economic and military scenarios available as you progress into the game, as you might have assumed.\n\nThere are only a few negative aspects of the game that might make the avid city builder a little frustrated.  In CivCity: Rome, you find yourself balancing happiness constantly.  The scale goes from +100 to -100 and it affects your population directly.  If you leave your happiness at +100 (which is relatively easy to do in most scenarios) your population will explode leading to "vagrants" that sit outside your town center, create housing shortages, and generate... unhappiness.  On its own, you can counter this effect, but you'll eventually find yourself trying to balance your population by keeping your happiness in the -10 to +10 range, which equals 0 growth and 0 loss.  If you then want to create a new industry, you'll need to bump your happiness to get more people, then bring it back down again.  Occassionally you'll receive empire bonuses or, negatively, barbarian threats that will mess with your happiness for a short time.  I found this yo-yo effect to be a little annoying at times.\n\nPostively, Sid has added some researchable technologies that you can use to customize your city to the style you want for the particular map your on, which is really refreshing.  This game is really a solid add to your collection if you like these types of city builders.","June 15, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a mix of both developers such as researching technologies from Firaxis and the city building from Firefly.
