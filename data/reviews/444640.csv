Till it came out for mobile, than nobody played the Flash version.\n\nI REALLY like you can play this with the players on Steam and on an iPad/Android, so you'll not have to wait about 20 seconds to fight someone (unless you have really bad connection, if so, you shouldn't play this game).\nAnd connecting to the Steam Cloud and the Ninja Kiwi Cloud, I found that really useful if you had a record before.\n\nBut of course, there are some problems.\n\nI'm a bit dissapointed that if you want to have the best of BTD Battles, You'll need to pay for it, and the Club Rooms is a perfect example. I don't really wanna pay 5 USD (I'm Australian, so I'd have to pay more) just for new maps and different gamemodes.\n\nAnd also slowly having to play for hours on end to unlock the best towers, it's gets quite frustrating that you want to unlock a 4th tier Bloonchipper, but if you're into the grinding genre of games, I guess it's alright...\n\nAlso, I would want to be able to customise hotkeys, but if that is not going to happen, it's ok, I guess. BUT there is no hotkeys to send out Bloons, and I'm REALLY used to do that. It's really weird.\n\nOverall, I'm glad this went onto Steam, and I'll be playing it on Steam, the game itself is great, challenging and competitive. (I mostly wrote about the Steam and Mobile version and differences, sorry.) But I shouldn't be able to pay 6.40 AUD to have access to the more interesting features of the game.\nAlso, Hotkeys. Give me dem hotkeys man.\n\nEDIT: Oh god I went over this after 1 day, and this review is so so bad,","April 20","true","6.9"," 113 of 144 people (78%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","78","113","144","23","10"

This version is basically identical to the mobile version aside from some additions yet to be implemented.\nPros:\n-Clean Graphics\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Great TD Tower Scheme\n-Assault/Defence Modes (One for competitive and casual)\n-Win/Loss Ratio & Win %\n-Free to play\n-P2W Mechanics But Not A P2W Game (Money spending is not needed it just helps. Gives no real dramatic advantage)\nNeutral:\n-No chat (No communication with opponent but prevents toxic chat messages)\n-Somewhat grind intensive\nCons:\n-Lag (Lag spikes can become really annoying)\n-Random Crashes (Only have had 1 crash so far)\n-Hackers (This is the only con that really ruins the game)\nI have been a fan of this series for a while, so my bias is in favor of this game. While I feel they addressed this game very well I will address some topics that may want to be heard about.\nGrinding:\nWhile, yes, this game requires a decent amount of grinding to get all the towers (Paying for them just unlocks them quicker) the time grinding gives the player a sense of enjoyment of progressing through the ranks of all of the towers and also allows the player to learn at a controlled pace without overdoseing on all the tower upgrades.\nLag/Crashes:\nNot much to say here. Some random lag spikes that really don't affect the game that much are just annoying more than a hinderence. Crahses are rare, but do need to be fixed.\nHackers:\nOh boy here we go. Now this is something BTD Battles has always had a problem with. Hackers will cause themselves to become invincible to your attacks which will then cause you to instantly lose unless they lag out. To try to combat this there is a "report player" button. However Ninja Kiwi should really try to put a stop to hacking if there is any possible way.\nOverall a well structured game.

If you run out of medals it's not that hard to get them back if you know how to rush properly especially. Nobody is forcing people to play battle arenas, anyway. I also saw a few reviews claiming to get towers it was a massive grind, however even as a noob to the game I managed to grind out all the towers (minus the t4 I don't use ever) in about 6 or 7 hours. To me this isn't very bad, but then again I also enjoy mmo grinds.

Although there are 2 changes I would like to see in the game such as:\n\n-A higher price on the baloons that are sent in to the opposite players course due to the game turning into 'first person to send in the blimp wins' (which is extremely frustrating)\n\n-Money for each baloon you pop (or atleast getting money for popping baloons sent by the other player)\n\nAll round this is a great game and I have a lot of fun playing.

Apart from the expected decent gameplay the Bloons series offers, there's nothing good about this.\n\nEnergy system, massive grinds, everything is instantly unlockable by paying and it's rubbed into your face every step of the way. The constant bickering to pay to unluck full tiers and whatnot quickly becomes annoying, and due to the nature of the game you can expect many one sided matches. As it's not all about skill as some others have stated. It's also very much about what you've unlocked, and as said, you can unlock everything by just paying, giving you an automatic advantage compared to same level players who did not pay.\n\nEssentially the game isn't pay to win, but where is the line drawn? Personally I find games like this makes the difference between P2W and not P2W more and more vague, and I don't see that as a good thing.\n\nWould have been able to recommend this if it wasn't so commercialized to the max, as the "Bloons Wars" idea always appealed to me.\n\nKeep in mind, just to unlock all content in-game you'll be paying more than any dev has ever charged you for an AAA title. I think such practises are becoming way too common, but the fault lies at the customer, who has become more and more accepting of such practises.\nStop co-operating with these disgusting business practises. No, a single card, character or unlock should not be worth $5, but you sheep just keep dishing it out anyway.

But... this game isn't all about skill, the progression system is pretty definitely supporting the more experienced. (I got a lot of hate for the next statement, so I have augmented it just for you keyboard warriors.) It takes a bit of time to unlock all the towers, but the addition of arenas and rankings made getting medals easier than before. Every week you get a guaranteed 1k medals if you played at least one game, if you played actively it can scale up to 2k or more. The arenas also help getting medals if you're good, you basically stake the selected value and the winner takes all.\n\nNow of course most towers will have most of the potential unlocked by the time 3 line of upgrades are unlocked and that is relatively cheap compared to fully maxing out (all 4 lines). Here's a good example, the regular monkey is the best started tower in the game, but only if you have the 3rd line of upgrades unlocked, of course it is also the cheapest tower, since in the late game even upgraded to 4th line upgrade it is very bad. It costs around 30 medals to unlock the 3rd line and you get 5 or 7 medals every game that you win (depending on how many lives you had at the time of winning).\n\nThe games are relatively fast (5-10min), but sometimes can take up much longer, so they could be compared to the lenght of hearthstone matches. The game is very simple to get into, but has a lot of strategical depth, since when you are in game, nothing is relying on luck, all of it is skill. Oh and (just like a deck builder) you can only pick 3 towers that you take into the battlefield, with an optional 4th one (in regular mode you can roll it for 1 energy (you have 20 max and it restores at a rate of 1 energy per 5 min, you can't buy more energy) and in arena mode you get a free roll and a free re-roll).\n\nThe game is a lot of fun when you unlock some towers, I have played it very long on the phone and it was very easy to sync my progress with the pc. I truly recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy without RNG.\n\nP.S.

At the very beginning you will have to choose how to use your medallions (the ingame currency). Once that's done you'll be forced to choose game mode, and after that turrets. You'll have the option to do map-skips or add a forth turret at a cost. Is it worth it? once the game begins. what turret do you place? Should you upgrade it? or build another? Should you send balloons or better your defenses? Should you upgrade to camodetection early? can you destroy lead balloons?\nHonestly the turrets and ballon types give this game a lot of variation and depth. I do recommend playing their singelplayer game BTD5 do fully grasp the concept as it can be overwhelming at first. The concept is well executed with the different gamemodes and leveling system.\nMany people in the review claim that the game is P2W but i disagree. Most of those people are often new and haven’s really got any medallions from the weakly competition. Most of the medallions will come from these competition and they cover the expenses more than well. I have unlocked every character with every upgrade at this point (except the C.O.B.R.A.) without paying a dime.\n","May 18","true","45.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(you have 1 entry per day but you can buy unlimited\naccess from the store for 4.99$. it's woth it.)\nyou think that the 250/75 (assoult=250 defened=75) income\nis too low and you want to get some money? well no problem!\nthere are a couple of ways to get more money (keep in mind i'm\ntalking about normal battles (except for what i said about bananza\nand speed battle):\n1. send bloons atyour enemy: bloons that you send cost money\nbut they give you more income per 6 seconds(4.5 if it's a speed\nbattle).\n2. FARMS: this is the way that brings you the most money (early\nto midgame, for late game eco is better). farm is a tower that you\nplace and it pops out bananas. for each bananayou will get 60$.\nyou get 2 bananas per round but you can get morebananas when\nyou upgrade them to the left side of upgrades.\nyou can boost the amount of money from each banana by getting the\nx/2 upgrade but that upgrade is worth it only if you got the forth tier on\nthe left side of the banana farm. there is another side that changes the farm\nbut it's not worth it in this game. the left side of farm (after the 0/2) is called\n"monkey bank". on this game, it's NOT worth it, eco is better then the banks.\nfarms do cost a good amount of money but it gives a lot so it's worth it :P\n3. other kinds of upgrades: "wired funds"- cobra, 80$ for the end of each round,\n1/0 upgrade. "supply drop"- sniper, it's ability (0/4 upgrade) it gives you a random\namount of cash between 500 to 1500 every time you activate the ability.\n"support chinhook"-heli pilot, 0/4 ability number 2 (it's the only tower with 2 abilitys),\nthis one is kinda like the sniper ability but it gives you lives every second time you use\nit. "bloon trap"-engineer 4/x upgrade. it sucks in bloons and every time it is full you\ncan press it to bring it money. there is one more tower but it doesn't GIVE you money,\nit makes the towers cheaper, this tower is called the "monkey village". it also has\nthe 3/0 upgrade that will bring you 50% more income from bloons sent and the 4/0\nthat will make abilitys come back faster, good combo with the heli's ability for money.\n4. there is a gamemode that is called "bananza", it will give you double money from\neverything AND double eco+starting cash (there are other gamemodes that give more\nmoney but that just relate to other stuff i said, like play with fire, it's eco.\ni should have said it earlier:\nyou can only choose 3 towers and get 1 random tower every game. you start with 5\nbasic towers that can be upgraded only up to 2/2: bomb shooter, ninja, sniper, tack shooter\nand dart monkey and you can buy more towers as you progress. you buy towers with\nmedalions, you can get medals (i am just calling them medals instead of medalions) by:\nbuying medals for money, winning medals in games and betting for medals in battle\narenas.\nsome ways to play the game:\nright when you start: ninja canon sniper. when you unlock the wizard use it for now instead\nof the sniper. it can help you until you got some more stuff. when you got 3rd tier dart monkey,\nswitch the ninja with it. when you got farms use it instead of the canon. don't forget to rush\nyour enemy. round 13 regrow zebra rush is the most affective rush for that time. betting for\nmedals is a very good thing. ik you don't think it's good because you can lose your medals but\nwith some skill you can win a lot and win a lot of medals. when you get more stuff you will start\nrealizing how the game works and you will know what to do\n(wow this thing is way longer then i wanted it to be and i still forgot to say a lot of stuff i wanted XD)\ni hope i helped someone to become a better player :)","April 20","true","285.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deliciousberry/recommended/444640/","deliciousberry","Praise The Meme!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deliciousberry/","6 products in account","Product received for free\n\nNow, I love BTD Battles to death, don't get me wrong. I've played Flash and Mobile/Win 10/Steam (they play just the same) quite a bit. But there are a few things that really need to be fixed in this version that the devs know about (unless they live under a rock or something) but won't fix. Let's get to pros and cons, shall we?\n\nPros:\n-Replayability, for obvious reasons\n-Good for all ages and skill levels with its family-friendliness and its battle arena system\n-Many fun gamemodes\n-A very nice tower selection\n-Solid graphics, most other TD games tend to be too realistic or absolutely terrible looking, this game finds the sweet spot between them\n-Decent matchmaking\n\nCons:\n-Game balance\n-"Downloading Vital Data" bug\n-Need to pay to enjoy the game to its fullest (I'll overlook this myself due to my love for BTD, but for others this can be a huge annoyance)\n\nThe pros speak for themselves, so I'll talk about my cons.\n\nFist of all, the "Downloading Vital Data" bug. This bug causes you to be completely unable to play the game due to the loading screen getting stuck at "Downloading Vital Data" forever, and happens seemingly at random (and not to everybody), sometimes staying for days and other times requiring a simple close-and-reopen to fix. This has been around for a long, long time, and makes this game very difficult to play on PC for some people. I haven't heard of it happening on Mobile.\n\nSecondly, game balance. Many will disagree with me here, but I just feel like some towers are absolutely ****ing useless and others are winning the "best tower" race by a few thousand miles. Here's some examples:\n\nDart Monkey - cheap, extremely good early and mid-game, requires zero support until round 22\nSpike Factory - slow, not that good at any point in the game compared to other towers, requires a lot of support\nBanana Farm - gives a massive head start on economy, can be sold to defend a rush, counterrush, or rush, usable on all but one map to its fullest extent\nBloonchipper - combos well with many other towers, can destroy entire Ceramic bloon layers with just 2 upgrades and entire ZOMG layers with 4, and can almost infinitely stall any amount of bloons with a large enough amount of x-4 Bloonchippers (just fix this already ****it, it's not hard)\n\nThese are just 4 examples. There are many, many more.\n\nThere are only really 4 mid-tier towers, which are the Ninja Monkey, Monkey Apprentice, Sniper Monkey and Ice Tower. They perform well, but need support from other towers, just not too much. They're examples of very well balanced towers. Other towers are either quite a bit better or quite a bit worse, and it makes it so that higher levels of play boil down to one or two different strategies, with the rest being unable to keep up with the best of the best.\n\nPaying for faster-regenerating battle energy (battle energy being a huge part of the game) and more battle energy is already showing a little bit of pay-to-win. You can still beat energy-buyers, don't get me wrong, it isn't like buying a $1 in-game money tower that has infinite ZOMG and bloon popping power. It's still a bit of an unfair advantage. There's also the fact that you can only enter 1 club room every 24 hours without the $6 pass, and the fact that you can fully upgrade a tower for $6, making it somewhat unfair to new players who get matched up with you because of your 5/2 win-loss record. I'm not saying this game is pay-to-win, but when you need to pay to get the full experience, it's not good.\n\nOverall, I have to give this game a negative. If they put a little more thought into game balance and micro-transactions, I would definitely change my mind. Heck, even just nerfing the Dart Monkey and Supa-Vac would make an absolutely massive difference. But as it stands, this game's downsides, despite there being few, make this game quite a chore at points.","May 3","false","22.7"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","12","22","3","15"

Although it is unlikely for them to read one.\n\nNote that I've probably wasted a few hundreds of hours into this game on its mobile version.\n\nMy favorite game on mobile,is now on steam. I like its p2w-ness.\nFor those who's already getting salty,this game is a Play-to-Win game. It's an extraordinary tower defense game.

I can still win 50 matches in a row without paying a single buck.\n\nBTD Battles pits you against a real human opponent,with 2 main game modes to play\n\n1.Assault mode\n\nThis game mode is the main and the most popular game mode in the whole game. The goal is to send units known as "bloons" against your opponent's defense,while maintaining your own defense to sustain their attacks as well. But you might think,you have to wait just to get units that are strong enough to crush your opponent and do nothing while nothing to unlock the said unit,right? Wrong. This game has an "income" mechanic,which delivers you money every few (6) seconds,this amount is increased by sending units against your opponents. And the income increase is also larger when you send more expensive units.\n\n"Woah,so we just keep sending strongest units against them while building up cash for our defense?"\nStill wrong! Some of the higher units give less income per cost,no income increase at all,or even decrease your income! So you'll have to plan for everything. So no more spamming strongest units endlessly while waiting to win.\n\n"But income's only way to gain cash?"\nNo. There are many other ways,like a farm that produce money which is in fact more popular than income itself. Or even a tower that is capable of creating traps to trap lower units and make money off them.\n\n"what's the best thing to send against your opponent?"\nCamgrow reds. Search up "BTD Battles Camgrow reds" on YouTube for more detail about these beasts.\n\n"enough about this assault thing,move on!"\nOk.\n\n2.Defensive Mode.\n\nThe goal of this game mode is to outlast your opponent. You can't send bloons,you begin with very small amount of income. So it's your job to spend your money in a correct way. I myself find this game mode quite boring because :\n-Long Games\n-Fixed type of bloons each waves\n-Pretty much fixed kind of gameplay\n-You can't really do anything to your opponent.\n\n"No bloon sends,bad income,how do we get money faster?"\nGood news,there's income boost which cost money,and they are much more most efficient compared to income increases in assault mode.\n\n"You got anything else to say about this game mode?"\nNo sorry,let's move on.\n\nOther Stuff :\nUsually,this game is not laggy at all. Even with 2GB of RAM. But there's a few situation where the game can create massive lag though. Graphics are cartoony,but is very neat. Also free to play and newbie friendly even you don't know how to play a tower defense game.\n\nTL;DRNah.\n\nThis tower defense game is free-for-all,easy to play and understand. It has 2 game modes,outlast your opponent,or defeat them by your units/"bloons". It is very enjoyable can contains endless hours of fun.\n\nBut beware,this game can make you a lot of salt in a very short time. So hope you are ready.\n\n\nAt the end,I'll rate this game 9.9/10. There are still design flaws to a certain tower which can be ridicilously powerful despite its not so expensive cost. But I don't mind it much.","April 24","true","98.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since this is the case you are constantly having to use Dart Monkeys for camo baloons, Boomerang Monkeys for lead baloons, and using all of your energy to re-roll in vein that you either get a Bloonchipper, Cobra (which is easily the most broken thing about the game), or Monkey Sub. Either you can take days if not weeks to unlock them, while still needing medals to unlock all of their abilities, or you can buy each building for $4.99 each which is absurd. Once you run out of the initial 20 energy (which it takes 3 to roll each time) than you have to wait for it to regenerate. One energy takes 5 real-time minutes to come back so you often find yourself playing two matches, running out of energy, and turning the game off because you don't want to have to pay money for more.\n\nYou have to get medals in order to unlock new buildings but you don't get any if you lose the match, which I've noticed that most players have a 60% winning streak or lower, so if you're like me and your winning streak is 50%, that means that half of the matches you've played were useless and just a waste of time because you got nothing for them.\nThere is no ranked matching in the game so you will often come across players who have the most advance stuff unlocked at max tier with you only having the basics - so you'll suffer a loss just for getting unlucky which isn't fair. You can also buy the medals with money too.\n\nPros:\n• Fun Gameplay\n\nCons:\n• No Balancing\n• Noob-Unfriendly\n• Full of Microtransactions, which are pretty pricey\n• Only fun in short bursts\n• Too long and hard to unlock tower tiers without paying for them\n\nVerdict:\nWhile the game is fun and addicting it is very limiting unless you either wait for your energy to refill or spend money in a game that should have been $4.99 - $9.99 to begin with. If the pay-to-win aspect of the game wasn't such a problem than I would highly recommend this game but in it's current form I don't think it's worth your time. 5.6/10\n\nStick to Bloons TD5 until they come out with a full version of this game.","April 23","false","6.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","0"

It's a small and free download. However, the grind to earn currency (called medals) takes way too long. You need to spend medals to unlock better upgrades for your towers. This seems to promote a some what pay-to-win ecosystem.\n\nI lost to someone who only bothered to use three toweres for the entire 25 round match. Even stopping two BFGs I sent their way. Two of these towers I did not have acceses to nor the upgrades that were used to beat me.\n\nEach tower costs about 20 medals to unlock. Then, towers have two more availible upgrades for 30-50 more medals per upgrade. You can see how it starts to add up quick. You get about 5 (maybe 10?) medals when you win and nothing when you lose, making it really hard to get any upgrades or new towers.\n\nBut if that takes to long for you, which it does, you can spend $5 and get 5,000 holy crap medals! That might be a special promotion but either way the game is very imbalanced.\n\n\nIt's fun for awhile but then you start to lose to people who spent money on the game.","April 25","false","3.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

But it gets even better with this Steam version! I highly recommend it! If you like Tower Defence games, this is what you are looking for! By now i have tried lots of TD games, but Bloons TD Battles  Bloons TD 5 are the only ones which I like. One good thing of this game is that it is free, and it has lots and lots of things. There are plenty of towers to unlock, and 8 upgrades for each tower which you can combine as you want! There are also special towers, very different from the common ones, and you can farm and all that stuff. In fact, thi game has everything you would like to see in a TD game. Another good point of this game is that it is not a PayToWin! So don´t worry if you can´t afford the in-game purchases. Are you ready for balloons + monkeys? Sounds well, uh?\nBtw, this is the first ever feedback on this game on Steam :D","April 20","true","4.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You cant use the same strategy everyime you allways have to adapt to what the other player is doing otherwise you will most likely lose. There is many diffrent towers which have diffrent special abiltys that are all helpfull in their own way. There are also alot of fun diffrent maps which have their own layouts that force you to put ur towers in diffrent uses and lanes which might sound pretty obvious but this is my first "legit" review so forgive me. But anyway if you really like tower defence games you will really like this game. And if you havent played tower defence games you really should try this one out!

Well this isnt slow paced but i dont need my face infront of my screen looking for a pixel to move and kill before it shoots a rocket at me.\nI suffer from insomnia, almost any of my friends will verify that so this is a nice game to play at 2 am. And if you loose its not cause someone has a better gun or something, no if you loose its usually your fault. It rewards the stratigist.\n\nThings that I would look into:\n\nPlease figure out how to add 2V2. That would be soooo cooolll!\n\nPlease implement a chat like you have on web.\n\nSo if you lagg 3 times your out. I was in a wager match for 2,000 Medalions And i lagged 3 times reconected each time in a matter of a second. BUT 3 strikes your out its alright though i was able to make them all up in a matter of 10 minutes. It's not that hard to make medalions on here\n\nThe trac shooter can be upgraded to the ring of fire, however alone cant target camo bloons but if there are camo bloons rushing by normal ones and they pass through the fire they dont pop. Idk i just feel like if they hit the fire they should be popped.","May 16","true","42.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","6"

Interface is okay, and I didn't encounter any serious bugs so far. Soundtrack is pretty bad, you're better off listening to your own music. Unlock system is kinda fair, much better than in other F2P games (looking at you, OMD:U!)\n\nHowever, the matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥. I was matched with people with a 100% win ratio that didn't have anything unlocked, so probably had just won their first game. Then I was matched with someone with a 22% win ratio, and he wasted me. He built excusively towers I had never seen before, upgrading them to tier 3/4, all the while spamming premium bonuses.\n\nAll in all: good parts to work with, absolutely destroyed by the ♥♥♥♥ "matchmaking" and the MASSIVE P2W.\n\nTerrible as is, would be 8/10 if it was just a normal Bloons game for 5-10 bucks.","June 2","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first hour of play seems fine, you get some easy wins against players who have no idea how to play the game.  Then the balance changes, and you ONLY face people who have paid to unlock all towers.  The worst part about this aspect is that when you pay to unlock these towers you COMPLETELY BYPASS THE LEVEL SYSTEM.  So two players can both be '100 darts', and one player can have simply paid for every lvl 3 and 4 tower.  So basically, at a certain point, its impossible to win WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TOWERS.  So a first time player has to look forward to getting pulled into the experience, and then losing EVERY SINGLE MATCH BAR NONE, for 30 matches in a row.  This game is a shallow pay to win failure.  I have 100% completed BloonsTD 4 and 5, and I CANNOT STAND this game.  This game only exists for micro-transactions.  The game itself is a hollow shell to make you pretend you're actually accomplishing something against other players, when in reality, this is a cesspool of kids with their parents credit cards, effortlessly winning against free players.  Pay to win, or stop playing, that is the best summary of 'Bloons battles' I can give.","May 11","false","8.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

It has made it way to Steam now and I have to say it is just as good here. There are a few game modes including attack game modes where you have to send waves of balloons and defend against your enemies, or the more classic defend game mode that plays like a traditional tower defense where you see who survives the longest, you or the enemy. I have not played much yet but I recommend you try it if you are looking for a free tower defense game.

Just be careful because it takes a bit of time to learn. And to the people saying it is pay to win: If you want to avoid people who spend money just do the r3's. They select 3 random towers with all upgrades unlocked. You will still get medallions and dart trophies that allow you to upgrade towers. The r3's are pretty fair, unless you get matched with an amazing player. This is a very fun game and i would recommend it. Just remember this is a mobile port there WILL be problems.

Ninja Kiwi has definetly grown since their early flash days. Now some may say, "OMG, mobile games are not real games! GET THIS CRAP OUTTA STEAM!" While others may say, "Humph, it was better as a flash game." While both may be right they are both wrong. This game was first a PC game, technically a flash game, but it went on to the mobile world. The Bloon TD games are so great, that they work as Mobile, Flash, and PC games.\n\nNow as to the gameplay itself, it is just as I remember it. First off, it looks beautiful, it can run on a potato. Secondly, it has classic TD gameplay, but this time you can use your strats to destroy your opponent. You buy balloons with the same money that you buy towers in-game. As far as I can see there really is no pay-wall. Sure you can use money to unlock more tiers, but you can also unlock those same tiers by just playing a whole bunch. Also, I feel that the way the tiers work is very fair. Because they have to upgrade the tiers in-battle using monkey money. (I use the words money a lot in this. But there is two types of money, real cash and monkey money* *game cash)\n\n\nNow I do suggest playing with friends as it is always fun to do a 3 outta 5 match with them. See who is the Monkey King!

Ninja Kiwi has definetly grown since their early flash days. Now some may say, "OMG, mobile games are not real games! GET THIS CRAP OUTTA STEAM!" While others may say, "Humph, it was better as a flash game." While both may be right they are both wrong. This game was first a PC game, technically a flash game, but it went on to the mobile world. The Bloon TD games are so great, that they work as Mobile, Flash, and PC games.\n\nNow as to the gameplay itself, it is just as I remember it. First off, it looks beautiful, it can run on a potato. Secondly, it has classic TD gameplay, but this time you can use your strats to destroy your opponent. You buy balloons with the same money that you buy towers in-game. As far as I can see there really is no pay-wall. Sure you can use money to unlock more tiers, but you can also unlock those same tiers by just playing a whole bunch. Also, I feel that the way the tiers work is very fair. Because they have to upgrade the tiers in-battle using monkey money. (I use the words money a lot in this. But there is two types of money, real cash and monkey money* *game cash)\n\n\nNow I do suggest playing with friends as it is always fun to do a 3 outta 5 match with them. See who is the Monkey King!

It's mechanics are fantastic. Anything your opponent sends out at you, you can defend. There is nothing you can't defend. It just requires skill. Now then, it is SOMEWHAT p2w- HOLD IT, hold it. I see you rolling down my review because I mentioned p2w. It is sorta p2w, but not by the fact that you pay, and win matches. Only by the fact that you unlock things earlier. Because no matter what you do, no matter what you buy, your chances of winning will not go up by how much money you have, but by how much skill. Unfortunately, my 60-6 win/loss ratio sucks, so I can't say that for myself.Now then, To give you an idea: it takes 75 matches for everything to be available, win or losses. That may seem like a lot, but for a good tower(like the dart monkey), it takes about 7 matches to unlock, so it is NOT a grinding game. It also seems like a lot of people say that the game "pushes you to buy a transaction", though I have never even been close to tempted into buying anything except the club mempership, which costs 5 bucks and is inCREDIBLY worth it.\n\nAnyways, if you think that the game is hard, watch some tutorials.

Anyway back to BTD.\n\n- BTD battles steam is literally a carbon copy of the mobile version with the addition of SOME hotkeys which level the playing field between mobile and PC. Although being a steam game, it has very limited settings which may annoy some more techy people such as myself, but it is bearable.\n- Secondly, the 'pay-2-win' element of the game which countless negative reviews are complaining about is a very minor part of the game, as not only is the matchmaking fairly accurate but the grind to obtain these tower upgrades is very small, only taking about 10-20hrs to get EVERYTHING, comparing that to warframe where you need to put in a minimum of about 300+hrs in.\n- Next, is the skill based area, this is the part which frustrates me the most, DO NOT EXPECT TO WIN IF YOU HAVE JUST STARTED, it is just like a MOBA, you are gonna lose a lot in the beginning until you learn the strategies and the physics behind the game, I was the same. Although balancing is a major issue in the game, it is not a problem as 90% of the time you will be matched with someone of equal skill level, and an equal amount of stuff unlocked.\n- Fourth, is a simple one, there is no exit button. All you need to do is go to settings and change it to windowed mode, this allows you to fullscreen it with a border that has an exit button\n- Fifth, this is another thing that really annoys me. Many people complain about losing to rushes, it is part of the game, you are playing on 'ASSAULT' mode for a reason, if you prefer late game, play defense, and yes defense is hard to learn but once you learn it, you can go late game every game. The concept is not that hard\n- lastly, many people say that people put a lot of money in, you can transfer your data from the mobile version meaning people who have played 10,000 games can move to steam so, most likely they did not pay, and yes there are some people out there who do pay, but you most likely only be paired up with them if there is no one else available.\n\nNow the comparison of the steam/mobile version to the flash version. The flash version has been forgotten by 90% of BTD players and for the more competitive game, it is the superior version. BTD battles flash, although worse graphics, less community, and no arenas, is a wonderful game, that boasts its amazing balance and physics which make the game a much more serious version compared to the mobile version. This is not suggesting which one is better because the mobile/steam version is targeted to the more general casual audience who just enjoys playing, thus the reason i am giving it 8/10 and not 6/10 because it is not targeted at the more competitive players.","April 24","true","52.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am still happy that I tried it and the game is ineed fun, but the game has some huge flaws.\n\n-Hackers galore\n-Lots of opponents just disconnect\n-Pay to win\n-♥♥♥♥ matchmaking\n\nOkay so how is this game pay to win when you can just unlock the stuff through playing the game.  Well having unlocks is superior to not having them and in quick match mode (the mode I primarily tried) there is an energy system.  Energy gives you boosts for your battle like a brief period of increased tower attack speed or increased balloon strength sent to your opponent.  If you have full energy (which you can pay money to get) you will win all other factors being equal.\n\nSo I jumped into a game where you put medallions on the line (the in game currency) and I having 3 hours of gameplay and not a lot unlocked was matched against a 97% win rate player with 1000s of medallions to spend.  I had 20 medallions.\n\nHonestly the game is fun, but I really can't support a game with these insanely expensive micro transactions that do give an advantage to the person who has either put in more time or spent money.","April 28","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get matched up with people who have more towers unlocked then you while you're stuck with a strictly worse, basic, starting pack of towers. So in other words. someone who was playing longer or paid now has the upper hand. Not to mention the grind to get a single tower is insane, let alone purchasing an upgrade for it.

I am still happy that I tried it and the game is ineed fun, but the game has some huge flaws.\n\n-Hackers galore\n-Lots of opponents just disconnect\n-Pay to win\n-♥♥♥♥ matchmaking\n\nOkay so how is this game pay to win when you can just unlock the stuff through playing the game.  Well having unlocks is superior to not having them and in quick match mode (the mode I primarily tried) there is an energy system.  Energy gives you boosts for your battle like a brief period of increased tower attack speed or increased balloon strength sent to your opponent.  If you have full energy (which you can pay money to get) you will win all other factors being equal.\n\nSo I jumped into a game where you put medallions on the line (the in game currency) and I having 3 hours of gameplay and not a lot unlocked was matched against a 97% win rate player with 1000s of medallions to spend.  I had 20 medallions.\n\nHonestly the game is fun, but I really can't support a game with these insanely expensive micro transactions that do give an advantage to the person who has either put in more time or spent money.","April 28","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get matched up with people who have more towers unlocked then you while you're stuck with a strictly worse, basic, starting pack of towers. So in other words. someone who was playing longer or paid now has the upper hand. Not to mention the grind to get a single tower is insane, let alone purchasing an upgrade for it. In short, game is basically like all the other bloons games but new players are restricted from using most of the towers.","April 28","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ninja Kiwi has definetly grown since their early flash days. Now some may say, "OMG, mobile games are not real games! GET THIS CRAP OUTTA STEAM!" While others may say, "Humph, it was better as a flash game." While both may be right they are both wrong. This game was first a PC game, technically a flash game, but it went on to the mobile world. The Bloon TD games are so great, that they work as Mobile, Flash, and PC games.\n\nNow as to the gameplay itself, it is just as I remember it. First off, it looks beautiful, it can run on a potato. Secondly, it has classic TD gameplay, but this time you can use your strats to destroy your opponent. You buy balloons with the same money that you buy towers in-game. As far as I can see there really is no pay-wall. Sure you can use money to unlock more tiers, but you can also unlock those same tiers by just playing a whole bunch. Also, I feel that the way the tiers work is very fair. Because they have to upgrade the tiers in-battle using monkey money. (I use the words money a lot in this. But there is two types of money, real cash and monkey money* *game cash)\n\n\nNow I do suggest playing with friends as it is always fun to do a 3 outta 5 match with them. See who is the Monkey King!

Whoever wins is nearly 100% dependent on skill in this game. There are "purchasable things" but really they're jokes and give pretty much nothing really unless you're pretty new. After over 4k games in here... there are still players that can pull out little edges to barely beat me. The arenas do a good job of sorting out skills as they more skilled players acculate more medalions. It kind of seperates everyone on skill levels.\nDefenitely amazing for a mobile game. So good it was put on steam as a PC game as well. I also like how the staple monkey of all the ones you can unlock is the basic and originally free dart monkey. "NEARLY EVERYONE" at high tier uses  the dart monkey as it is cheap and allows you to do other things initailly and a lot of them do make a good defense later on; The most importat tower in most strategies (beside the banana farm). You can also bloon eco build which is a great concept and my prefered one.\n\nFav loadout: Dark monkey, Wizard, Spy, Bonus: (I normally try to go for a tower that is good long game for the bonus or ice/boomerang/bomb tower are good to settle for too.)\n\nMy highest rank on the global leaderboard was: 124\nNot bad out of the world. :P\nDon't expect to get into the top 100 just for being good. I could do it.... if I had the time to compete with those guys. ._.\n\n(I've done all my playing on mobile if you're wondering about my time.)","May 25","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably the best tower defence game ever made according to me.\nBTD Battles is what happens when you want to face off against your friends in BTD, instead of wanting to cooperate with them. With an expanded economic factor involved and having faster, more combat-centric gameplay, BTD Battles will exite you for many an hour. At the time of review, I don't have many hours, but I can firmly claim that this is a good game, with a prior PC and mobile releace. (Don't get mad at me for disobeying Gaben's law when I don't have a PC with me) I reccomend you pick up this game asap, as there are many new players, so it will be a breeze to roll through the ranks if you master the mechanics.","April 22","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love it.\nBut, it's broken.\nI've played this game on mobile for eons and I have unlocked every tower upgrade, and I have club access and COBRA access. However, despite that both versions allow linking through Facebook, I could not connect the Steam Version to the Mobile. The instructions are broken.\nIn explanation, the tutorial starts by saying to open the profile on your mobile device. At 1360x768 resolution, the picture included takes up so much of the screen that the NEXT navigation button is not displayed.\nFortunately, I have two monitors, which I can use to make the window for the game obscenely large, thus making room for the NEXT button. A work-around, yes, but not one that everybody will have the luxury for.\nEDIT: Using black magic and shady tactics, I finally linked up my account. I would like to say that I am VERY excited for this moment. I've wanted to record/stream BTDB for a long time now, and nearly no emulator will run Ninja Kiwi games, save for Bluestacks, which is annoying to use.

Throwing doubts over the pay 2 win that other users are claiming.\n\nNow for my review.\n\nThis game is like the old Bloons games that are on Kongregate and other flash based websites. It's a simple Tower Defense game with a twist. You're versuing other players. Like some of the mods from Warcraft 3 (Which were personally my favourite)\n\nThe real issue with the game is you unlock towers way too quick so that you assume it's "grinding" but the reality is, after 5 matches that you win, you can easily purchase the next tier tower (Or you can gamble against other players to unlock more "cash")\n\nOverall I give this game a 7/10. While it hasn't changed much from the basic Bloons game you can find on Kongregate it adds a nice versues mode, which, for nostalgic purposes of multiple Warcraft 3 mods is a nice niche.","April 21","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, despite that both versions allow linking through Facebook, I could not connect the Steam Version to the Mobile. The instructions are broken.\nIn explanation, the tutorial starts by saying to open the profile on your mobile device. At 1360x768 resolution, the picture included takes up so much of the screen that the NEXT navigation button is not displayed.\nFortunately, I have two monitors, which I can use to make the window for the game obscenely large, thus making room for the NEXT button. A work-around, yes, but not one that everybody will have the luxury for.\nEDIT: Using black magic and shady tactics, I finally linked up my account. I would like to say that I am VERY excited for this moment. I've wanted to record/stream BTDB for a long time now, and nearly no emulator will run Ninja Kiwi games, save for Bluestacks, which is annoying to use.

It's mechanics are fantastic. Anything your opponent sends out at you, you can defend. There is nothing you can't defend. It just requires skill. Now then, it is SOMEWHAT p2w- HOLD IT, hold it. I see you rolling down my review because I mentioned p2w. It is sorta p2w, but not by the fact that you pay, and win matches. Only by the fact that you unlock things earlier. Because no matter what you do, no matter what you buy, your chances of winning will not go up by how much money you have, but by how much skill. Unfortunately, my 60-6 win/loss ratio sucks, so I can't say that for myself.Now then, To give you an idea: it takes 75 matches for everything to be available, win or losses. That may seem like a lot, but for a good tower(like the dart monkey), it takes about 7 matches to unlock, so it is NOT a grinding game. It also seems like a lot of people say that the game "pushes you to buy a transaction", though I have never even been close to tempted into buying anything except the club mempership, which costs 5 bucks and is inCREDIBLY worth it.\n\nAnyways, if you think that the game is hard, watch some tutorials. Simple as that. My final ratings would be a 9/10.","April 24","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can tell this immediately by the fact there is no way to turn down the volume after it deafens your ears.  You can either completely mute the volume or leave it on the default game setting.  You can either leave the game in full screen or a predetermined resolution windowed mode.\n\nOutside of these poor options, Bloons is a really good tower defense.  Like all pay to win models, it suffers from having a ton of content that is restricted by a massive time investment or moderate (to massive) cash investment.  At the time of this review, I have 10 towers unlocked by can only use a maximum of 4 at a time.  Which allows me to use the wizard and any other random 3 because the wizard is OP in the early game.\n\nThere are random draft clubs you can play once, then can pay money to join later on.  In game currency can be wagered at predetermined amounts in best of 1 matches.\n\nI recommend the game, but not on PC.  Play something with a little more depth on PC and play this game while your boss isn't looking at work.\n\nIf you want to check out my video review of the game, here you go - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WzjzzeRz64","April 24","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyway back to BTD.\n\n- BTD battles steam is literally a carbon copy of the mobile version with the addition of SOME hotkeys which level the playing field between mobile and PC. Although being a steam game, it has very limited settings which may annoy some more techy people such as myself, but it is bearable.\n- Secondly, the 'pay-2-win' element of the game which countless negative reviews are complaining about is a very minor part of the game, as not only is the matchmaking fairly accurate but the grind to obtain these tower upgrades is very small, only taking about 10-20hrs to get EVERYTHING, comparing that to warframe where you need to put in a minimum of about 300+hrs in.\n- Next, is the skill based area, this is the part which frustrates me the most, DO NOT EXPECT TO WIN IF YOU HAVE JUST STARTED, it is just like a MOBA, you are gonna lose a lot in the beginning until you learn the strategies and the physics behind the game, I was the same. Although balancing is a major issue in the game, it is not a problem as 90% of the time you will be matched with someone of equal skill level, and an equal amount of stuff unlocked.\n- Fourth, is a simple one, there is no exit button. All you need to do is go to settings and change it to windowed mode, this allows you to fullscreen it with a border that has an exit button\n- Fifth, this is another thing that really annoys me. Many people complain about losing to rushes, it is part of the game, you are playing on 'ASSAULT' mode for a reason, if you prefer late game, play defense, and yes defense is hard to learn but once you learn it, you can go late game every game. The concept is not that hard\n- lastly, many people say that people put a lot of money in, you can transfer your data from the mobile version meaning people who have played 10,000 games can move to steam so, most likely they did not pay, and yes there are some people out there who do pay, but you most likely only be paired up with them if there is no one else available.\n\nNow the comparison of the steam/mobile version to the flash version. The flash version has been forgotten by 90% of BTD players and for the more competitive game, it is the superior version. BTD battles flash, although worse graphics, less community, and no arenas, is a wonderful game, that boasts its amazing balance and physics which make the game a much more serious version compared to the mobile version. This is not suggesting which one is better because the mobile/steam version is targeted to the more general casual audience who just enjoys playing, thus the reason i am giving it 8/10 and not 6/10 because it is not targeted at the more competitive players.","April 24","true","52.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyone saying "well you can get slight advantages" is outright lying. At every opportunity there is a way to spend energy (which a free player has a very limited amount of) to gain an advantage. You can see your opponents towers, reroll your special so it works better for the map you're on. After that once you're actually in the game you can use energy to boost your towers, and then even if you do find yourself getting beat, just drop some spikes on the ground to pop the clearly better players balloons they have worked to send your way.\n\nAfter you win remember to leave your steam review saying NOT PAY 2 WIN LOLOLLOLLO... It's a real shame as well because  they have a nice game going on here. Great graphical style, fun to play, and I don't think anyone can argue that in the tower defense genre the Bloons guys are kings.

It doesn't allow you to remove forced ads with medallions.\n4: Sorry that I feel I must complain about this, but on PC/Mac, you get to choose your extra tower, and not have to worry about getting cobras all the time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jameshaswon/recommended/444640/","jameshaswon","James |","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jameshaswon/","66 products in account",""The Most Exciting Game Around"\nBloons TD Battles is one of my favourite games, I'm sure many of you can see why. BTDBattles has a unique gamemode that was created by NinjaKiwi and is in no way similar to its competitors. The fact that I can get home from a day of school or work, open BTDBattles and join a battle with someone within seconds is one of the key features I'd look for in a game heavily revolved around multiplayer. Below I have lsited some of my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nUnqiue gamemode.\nAlmost always someone online to play with.\nCompetetive yet fun at the same time.\nThe ability to play my Steam friends.\nCons:\nClub mode can only be purchase with real-life money.\nThere are often many hackers on this game which can have a negative impact on your win:loss ratio making your win:loss percentage lower, leading other people to think of you as a bad player.","May 1","true","65.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Extremely balanced gameplay and a little bit tactical, not the usual td that everything shoots everything. There's no "best" tower, you have to allways keep in mind that the same strategy doesn't work for MOAB bloons, camo, regen, metal, zebra and ceramic baloons.\nI admire the company that's behind this game, keep up whit the good work.\n"bad" things about the game:\nIt needs a "real" quick game:\nWhen you press this button, you have to select what tipes of games are you looking for, so you don't\nhave to go to each game mode, that maybe no one is playing at the moment.\nChange the music:\nIt's not bad, it's just too repetitive.\nToo much sounds:\nIt's horrible to hear when your enemy is hitting whit darts a metal bloon.\nA "stop following mouse" function:\nFor towers like the dartling gun, the tower is useless on PC, in mobile is much easier.\nProfile pictures:\nJust put 4-5 profile pictures like the bloon skins and I'll be happy.\n"ranked" games:\nI don't have any tier 4 tower, and when I play against a person whit t4 towers is pretty much imposible\nto me to win on "lategame".\n\nI love this game, I hope they read this.","May 11","true","41.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a pretty good game and it will continue to be.\n\nNow, I have read alot of the negative reviews for Bloons TD Battles (BTDB) and most of them say that it is a Pay To win game (p2w). This is absolutely false. Earning medallions to unlock new stuff is easy. In my playtime i managed to rack up over 1500 medallions in total, by just playing and getting in the leaderboard. I have almost all towers on max level. And don't tell me that the cobra is op yadda yadda, because it is not. There is a way to defend cobra-rushes and counter-rushing is way easier.\n\nI read some reviews about the club room thing too. You should really be happy you can try it once a day, most games make it so you have to pay, i guess people get more and more greedy.\n\nBack to the game.\nThis game has a decent artwork, and the mechanics are easy to pickup.\n\nGenerally this is a game for people that likes fastpaced stuff with a slight taste of intensity.\n\nbye\n\nPS.
