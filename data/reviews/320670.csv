"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/recommended/320670/","praxis666","Praxis-[CE]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/","1529 products in account","The third game in the Season Match series offers more of the same match-3 style play from the first two games. This time there is a bit more content, it took me a little longer to beat this one than it did the first two games combined. There's a story mode, where you have to free Month-themed characters from the evil clutches of the Witch Crow by matching gems until certain treasures are unlocked. In between the match-3 rounds, there are little mini-games which require finding objects, sorting out puzzle pieces, or comparing two pictures to spot the differences. I found the mini-games in Season Match 3 to be more consistent, and more in-line with the overall game itself than the ones in Season Match 2.\n\nUnfortunately the issue with some of the small, oddly-shaped boards where gems are prevented from falling depending on the blocks that remain is still an issue, and the crystal shards that lock up more blocks makes the problem quite a bit worse on some maps, preventing any gems from falling to refill at all. Some powerups can get around this, but not all powerups are available on each board so sometimes the only solution was to restart. And restart again.\n\nStill, Season Match 3 - Curse of the Witch Crow is a nice match-3 game that's good for killing some time or relieving some stress. Or just adding some achievements, if that's your thing, since the series has great steam integration with trading cards, achievements, and nice items.","January 11, 2015","true","13.3"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","52","54","0","0"

Have Fun ;D\n\n","January 18, 2015","true","13.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","24","25","2","4"

Warning: if you don't have a widescreen monitor, unless there's something I'm missing in the (minimal) options screen, you're going to have a hard-to-impossible time clearing some of those, items can be "offscreen". The window is 4:3 and the game seems designed for 16:9... but won't display as such no matter what I do.\n\nPlease be aware of that before buying. That's not really a black mark on the game? But it is a problem.","November 15, 2014","true","1.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

The Story mode is half collapse style puzzles and half other puzzles types including hidden object, sorting picture tiles, find the difference, and some arcade style mini games.  The story is mildly amusing.  My only complaint is the the final piece of the story never shows, so you have no idea how the story ends.  This game is recommended for those who love puzzle games.","January 13, 2015","true","29.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I guess it is no different from the other 2 in the series. Decent game; as others indicate, it is a great casual time killer, button masher on the mouse and probably get carpal tunnel after achieving 100%.\n\nOne thing I wish it had was a cloud save, as I lost the save file when I changed operating systems, but overall it's an easy game to 100% achievements if you like collecting those. Grab this game at the next Summer sale.\n\n9/10","April 6, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The one thing I was looking forward to, was the gathering of the months at the end of the game, but it didn't happen. hopefully there will be a match 4 and it will continue from the ending of match 3. When playing this game I loved the artwork and the scenes are spectacular. If you like match games, this one I highly recommend. Enjoy and have fun, it's worth playing. ps, remember to read all the rules and tips it really helps with the game,\nThanks,\nSkinnydugan","January 13","true","129.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
