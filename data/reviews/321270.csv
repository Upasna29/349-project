(You can destroy three trinkets in order to craft a single trinket of a higher rank, similar to the Implant system if you've played Planetside 2)\n+ Developer appears to be listening to feedback and suggestions from playerbase.\n+ Atmosphere is dark and seedy. Plenty of shadow, grime and blood intermingled with macabre art and creepy furnature.\n+ Music is sorrowful and well composed.\n+ Challenges give some minor direction to the gameplay.\n+ Monsters are unnerving, and their movement can result in some nice jump-scares. Enemies have melee and ranged attacks, making combat a bit more varied.\n+ Simple to hop in game or quit, as the game saves your experience (Karma) points.\n+ Players can join your play session easily.\n\n\nNEUTRAL\n? Randomly generated levels make gameplay a little tense, but once you've seen a few rooms, you've pretty much seen them all.\n? Character customization is entirely unlocked based on progression, meaning you start with practically zero character options. (You can be the pencil pusher with the green tie, OR the pencil pusher with the grey tie!). You collect "ink" as you play, which you then spend to gamble for new color combinations. This is surprisingly enjoyable, go figure.\n? Minimap is functional, but pretty basic.\n? Character perks require some effort to unlock.\n? Items purposely take a brief moment to pick up, which borders between annoying and added tension.\n+ You can now equip Theif Gloves to accelerate picking up items by 10% per glove level.\n\n\nNEGATIVES\n- Weapon selection seems very limited as well as random. So far, I've discovered the pistol and the shotgun, and the latter is not always easy to find. You can find it almost immediately in one session, and take a long time to find it on the next.\n- Weapons are limited to just the pistol and shotgun so far.\n- Music selection is also limited and repetitive.\n- Only 4 enemy types at the moment.\n- Clipping and glitches with corpses. Mostly an aesthetic/immersion problem.\n- Multiplayer is unpolished and less rewarding than single player. Player movement appears warpy, and four identical characters with bad character-animations ruins some of the immersion.\n- In Multiplayer, other players can take all the items if they arrive first, and this includes ammo, weapons, upgrades and unlocks. When you die, your teammates can resurrect you, but the death-screen is so uninformative (splattered blood and a quit button) that you have no idea if your mates are anywhere close to your body.\n- Unoptimized. Performance can take a significant hit when plenty of corpses are nearby.\n\nDespite the negatives, I'm certainly enjoying UNLOVED so far. If you're looking for storytelling and structured gameplay, you'll likely be disappointed. But if you're in the mood for instant gratification bloodshed, this is a pretty satisfying choice.\n\n\ntl;dr...  Mindless and bloody, unpolished but enjoyable. Certainly an Early Access game that needs some work, but the gameplay is solid and there's enough incentive to explore as-is. Excited to see how it evolves.\n\nI will update this review as I discover more.","August 23, 2015","true","10.2"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","53","61","3","2"

This game is very unique if I had to describe it I would say take some Doom fps gameplay mix in some Silent Hill inspired monsters, add some Spelunky and you have UNLOVED. First and foremost this game is still in Early Access so many more things are getting added and the dev is very receptive to the community which is always a good sign and he does frequent dev videos.  Another good sign is that this dev loves his game and you can tell by watching his vids and how he is polishing his game.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are gritty and have a very dark and disturbing feeling. If you have ever played Condemned then thats what you can expect. The game is dark but you have a flashlight that never runs out. The monsters look good enough while the animations are nothing ground breaking they get the job done but this games other strengths make you forget about the subpar animations.\n\nSound: OMG this is one of the games biggest strengths. The ambient sounds are top notch and the guns also sound good. Every monster has a distinct sound and you had best learn them to know what is coming and how to deal with it.\n\nGameplay: Ok this is why I love this game so much. This is not just a generic fps. Oh no this game is vastly different from fps that you have played. What makes it unique is that it has interesting mechanics. For example the spawning is determined by how much ammo and items you grab or how many doors you open. There are hidden items in the levels and they are different everytime you play which gives it that Spelunky feel. You can play a daily seed as well. While the layout of the levels is the same the location of the items are not. You have to beat the level to gain karma which you use to buy certain upgrades. I am not sure how to level up yet. I think it has to do with certain items you collect. You can pick up items in the levels to help you such as gun mods and totems. Gun mods give you certain upgrades but only for your current play session while totems give you special abilities like being able to see the monsters on your radar. You do get permanent upgrades called trinkets which you have to earn by beating levels.\n\nDifficulty: Yeah you are going to die in this game even on the easiest difficulty. There is no respawning, no reg health and once you die thats it permadeath ftw unless you play coop then your parter can revive you. The monsters can corner you very easily and the maps are tight so you won't have much room for error.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game if you like challenging fps and rouge lights because its the best of both worlds. Right now there are only 2 maps but he is working on more and there is up to 4 player coop.\n","January 15","true","38.8"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendshipIsMagic/recommended/321270/","FriendshipIsMagic","Moki ‚ù§","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendshipIsMagic/","186 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's about time I wrote my own review on this game, and I want to make it extra clear that my review should be held accurate to its date, as content is actively rolled in. I postponed writing one because I'm not honestly very well-structured or that diligent on writing these things. But for the sake of inspiring people, I'll give it a try.\nUNLOVED is basically what the Doom II mod was in terms of theme and perhaps story as well (Still trying to uncover the details on the Clues!) and if you are not familliar with the mod, then you can google "Unloved doom wad" and get your hands on it immediately. I strongly recommend it if you own a copy of DOOM II.\n\nThe gameplay is basically Doom, I'll say that. Tons of shooting, really fast, key-collecting and finishing levels with a rather repetitive and *simplistic kind of style. Kind of how Left 4 Dead is being compared with Vermintide, with differences to set them aside and make them very disthinguishable. If you've played those, you'll know what I mean with these adjectives.\nHowever, make no mistake - the game is definitely not easy, and it's seemingly adrenaline-producing when you get swarmed by hordes of monsters on the harder settings. So what do I exactly mean with this when I compare it? Well, if you're familliar with Doom - you'll remember the very puristic, robust but timeless kind of FPS-shooter 'feel' to it. To speak for popular consensus; if you love Doom and don't mind how its softly lazy* and fast gameplay is/was with damage-randomization, then you won't mind this one either. In comparison to ol' grand-daddy of FPS: UNLOVED has more of a RPG feel and more darker approach to the atmospheric value. And you can of course aim freely, jump, dodge, that sort of thing. There's also this enormous impact on player and weapon changes, since you can use Trinkets and temporary Weapon Mods to apply strength and behaviors on you and your weapons. It's really fun to have a Level 5 Quick Reload on your Shotgun for example. Helps you TONS.\n\nThe things that UNLOVED offers and are note-worthy are as following..\n\nRandomized layoutsYou can pick between choosing the daily layout for a level (Apartments and Clinic.) or you can pick the option to completely get a random layout for the level, which is nice if you experience trouble finding that first gun for example!\nTrinkets.Now this is where the interesting part comes. There's about 5 difficulty levels, and you are advised to play on the one with the appropriate amount of players and Level. Skill alone won't help you battle the horrible hordes of monsters and creatures, and you need to complete levels to gain Trinkets. The total trinket-rank you have on your loadout is calculated to Level, and helps you detect where you are but also for your friends.\nIn order to upgrade Trinkets, you must use and earn Karma and Fragments. Karma can mainly be acquired through completing missions, and Fragments are converted from either Ink Bottles or destroying Trinkets that you do not need.\nTrinkets come in many kinds, and there's several slots for specific trinkets. For example, you can equip an Evidence slot with a Shotgun Shell Evidence to gain the Super Shotgun as your starting weapon, and additional starting ammo for every level you upgrade it with. Another example is the new gun-specific slots. D'ya want an accurate SMP? Get that Tempered Barrel on. How about the new Magnum trinket that doesn't just make your Pistol into a handcannon, but also changes the visuals and sounds for it? The choices are quite plenty, and I feel that more will definitely come - especially since there's Rank 2 versions of so many original ones.\n\nCollectibles.This area is much under construction, but it is also one of the more interesting things to me. As of right now, you can collect Card Pieces to unlock a Collectible (Also gives you a trinket if you complete the set on a level.) and Collectibles are like.. little diaries, stories, notes. In order to read a Collectible, you must collect Photos scattered around levels randomly, just like the Card Pieces. Each "donation" of Photos will reveal one line out of usually 7-12, and you are rewarded with Karma for it. Lastly, we have Ink Bottles which purpose is to give you more Color Schemes, and to sell for Karma or Fragments.\n\n\nMy personal opinions.With the amount of time I got on it, I feel it's fair to say that anyone who loves Doom or just these kind of games should absolutely consider taking a look at UNLOVED. However, do please check out gameplay videos on it. They may be dated, but they will give you a nice insight on what you'll be expecting and playing. You may wonder if there's any cons to the game in my eyes, and I honestly can't tell you much. Sure, there's some rather stale and dull animations, and some visuals aren't always the prettiest, but they're not bad either in my opinion.However, that's just minor thngs to me and I cannot say with absolute certainity on what will be improved or not. However, be mindful of that you may not always find a buddy to play with online due to the current playerbase, so do bring a friend you know just in case.\n\nI would like to give a highlight to the developer Paul/Blue for being attentive, listening and open to feedback. Please give the forums a visit, there's tons of tips and you can even check his roadmap to see what is being planned and worked upon. UNLOVED has great potence and I believe it is worth its price if you don't mind the robust and simplistic things about it, which is to me - some of its charm that stands out from casual and modern FPS titles nowadays.\n\n*Lazy = No headshots or specific parts to aim at - just center-mass shooting. Not a bad thing in my book!\n*Simplistic = You search for keys, you open rooms, you find the Blood Tanks and fill them before running to the exit. Again, not necessairly a bad thing.\n\nIf I have forgotten something or if you have a question, please post it in the forums or in the comments. I apologize in advance for any errors or inaccurate explaination, as this was never my thing to begin with.","January 13","true","214.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","7"

Unloved gets itself off to the best possible start by recognising that there are few greater joys to be found in gaming than blasting some undead ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tain halfway across the map and makes the gun that is YOURS BY RIGHT easily accessible for all the brain confetti production you need.\nThere's not much I can legitimately complain about here. The spawning system is great but needs a tweak here and there. A couple of times, I've had revenant and tank types drop out of thin air behind me while I'm waiting for the item pickup timer. That needs to go, honestly. The rest of the game is so fast that it feels like stuttered buffering.\nMinor ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing aside, Unloved is an intense, bloody, lightning fast pleasure to play even in these early stages. With far more to come, this could very well end up being one of the best horror shooters on Steam.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWqE6IKU0Xo","August 27, 2015","true","2.0"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","27","36","9","2"

I just had to review this game because ever since I bought this on release the game has improved a LOT! more enemies makes the game a whole lot harder than before and it's a heck of a lot more intense as well. if you like fast paced shooters with a horror theme, this is the one to get for sure.

The 'game' version of Unloved ventures into more roguelike territories, introducing randomly generated levels, customization and character development of sorts. The Binding of Isaac inspiration is evident (and fitting).\n\nIn the game you enter a 'dungeon' of your choice (though only Apartment is available in the current version) and try to survive the horrors that lurk within in hope of finding a way out of the madness. Beware as there's a price for escaping the nightmare. You collect various weapons and upgrades but also more elusive items such as Photos (which unlock pieces of backstories for characters) and Cards pieces (gathering all of them grants an additional Trinket). Upon completing a level you are awarded with Trinkets, character upgrades that will help you survive in more dangerous areas and on higher difficulty levels. You also collect Karma for completing bonus objectives (though currently there's no use for it other than unlocking a Trinket slot).\n\nThe gameplay is a solid basis, focusing on fast and brutal shooter experience. Randomness of each level makes sure you will never know what to expect but it also comes with tradeoffs - it's no longer the carefully crafted progression of the Unloved mapset. Balance is also debatable - while playing on Sliver of Mercy and No Hope is fun / hardfun, Kill'em All pits you against an insane amounts of monsters. Playing alone is very difficult (and slow). You will often find yourself swarmed by relentless hordes of demons and it takes away some of the fun. You're forced to hold your ground for extended periods of time hoping there's enough ammo and health pickups to keep you alive. In addition, the game will happily feed you to the strongest beasts right off the bat. There's definitively a room for improvement here.\n\nKeep in mind though that higher difficulty settings are meant for players of a higher level (determined by Trinkets). In other words: start on Sliver of Mercy.\n\nWhen you return, you can manage your character, select Trinkets you wish to use in the future and try to uncover details of mysterious notes in your possession. You can also spent Ink Bottles found within levels to get new color variations for your avatar, if such customization is your thing.\n\nA word of a warning though. Much like the original mapset, this game hates your guts. It will not try to make you feel nice and cozy. It will rip out your heart, crush it with a sledgehammer and feed it to the wolves (or whatever lurks in the dark apartment halls). Be aware of that before you enter its unforgiving world.\n\nAs a SP-only gamer, I would love to see some kind of a campaign down the road though it looks like currently the game will expand primarily through its roguelike elements.\n\nOverally it is promising. It's a good start and with more content it's bound to get a whole lot better and interesting.","August 23, 2015","true","192.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It's true, there virtually are no peeps playing multiplayer UNLOVED anymore.  No worries though cause there's plenty of fun to be had by yourself.\n\nCurrently there are only 2 maps - Apartments and Clinic - but the look of the monsters and the 'feel' of the rooms therein have a very Silent Hill vibe and even on the easier difficulty setting (from 'Sliver of Mercy' up to 'Beast Mode') the action is intense and you can easily kill upwards of 175 enemies per try.  To go with the small number of maps there are also only 3 firearms available (handgun, shotgun and SMP) + a knife for melee. Thankfully the weapon mods that you can find throughout each map add anything from increased damage to reload speed or spread, etc. making for a unique and varied experience to go along with the randomly generated layout of the maps for each playthrough. There are also locked boxes that contain totem items that will add attributes such as faster reload speed or an armor/health boost, etc.\n\nTo further keep things interesting and add replay value are trinkets that you can acquire by collecting 3 pieces of a card and/or successfully completing a map (I think). These trinkets will last forever and can be changed out from the main menu. There are numerous trinket slots and unlocking these slots and equipping trinkets is how you level your character up. The trinkets themselves act like the totems/weapon mods as they can allow you so start with a certain weapon, have increased movement speed, armor, or even an increase in the amount of ammo you can carry at any one time among many other things.  There are even ink bottles to collect that allow you to acquire new color schemes for your character - no microtransaction BS here, just collectible items that serve a purpose without you having to pay for the outcome.\n\nAll in all, UNLOVED is a unique shooter with bloody, intense and atmospheric gameplay that shouldn't be overlooked.  It will be interesting to see what additional content is added in the future. Now if we could just get more peeps playing the game....\n\nP.S. there are also photos to collect that will allow you to unlock journal entries and such to add to the backstory of the game","February 3","true","13.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","3"

The maps will be slightly different, and you'll be fighting off against various deranged horrors of monsters.  You'll be locked in a near constant struggle for your life, your trinkets, and your own sanity.  You have to search the environment for ammo, health, and armor.  There are quite a few mechanics to this for a game that has roots to shooters from 1993-1995.\n\nMy personal opinions are mixed about this.  Part of me prefers the days of when this game was just a little mod on Doom.  But part of me enjoys the possibility of rogue-like elements, where no matter what, your environment will always be slightly different each playthrough.

It is still in early access so I assume they'll add some variety as the game goes along. SOme minor glitches with the flash light, short load times for picking up weapons and equipment (which I think is intended to increase difficulty but it comes off more as irritating), and the mini map could be a little more clearly designed (a minor issue). Overall it's a fun little horror FPS but is more fun when teaming up with a partner.","March 31","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'll update this review as it gets more content added to it.\n\n---\n\nMore stuff has gotten added to the game since I wrote this review. Here's my mini story with this game:\n\nSo I initially bought this game thinking it would be amazing. Jumping into it, I found it very challenging and almost immediately disliked it because of my quick death. So, I stopped playing for a bit. Then, one day, months later, I decided to head back into the game to give it another shot, and see if anything had gotten better from the last time. I died. However, this time I was a little bit more determined.. there had to be something in the game that makes it special. I posted asking for tips on playing. I explained my scenario, and I received replies. Replies that told me what I was doing wrong while playing and what I should be doing. I thought about it, and decided that what they were telling me was logical to reach the game's objective. So, I tried. And I beat it for my first time.\n\nOh, what's this? I received.. karma, photos, ink bottles, and.. trinkets? Wow! So this game has loot you say? Now I got even more interested. One day, I met a friend. This friend told me even more tips and tricks to use while playing, which helped me progress even further into this game. What I've learned from this is that you've got to give this game a shot. It may seem to lack a lot of things, but you must ask yourself, "Why is this game in Early Access." Instead of saying, "This game has nothing!", you should be asking yourself, "I wonder what is to come?"\n\nIs this game repetitive? Yes. But that's not even a problem. As long as you understand how the game works and you can allow yourself to have fun, you would not even think about this.\n\nIs this game scary? I would say that a more generally applied genre for this game is action. It's not at all scary. Unless, if you find turning around the corner for a monster to jump at your face. Well.. from that, yes. This game is scary. A new monster has been added recently. The Witch. It's freaky. I'm serious. This game just got creepier than before.\n\n"There's no multiplayer games available!" This game is Early Access, so it may make a bit sense that not many people have heard of this game to play it. But yes, it may be hard to find multiplayer game sometimes. That eliminates the horror aspect, though. So in some cases it's better to go alone.\n\nThere's no real beginning to this game. You just hop in and learn yourself. That's what I think has scared owners of the game away from actively playing it. That's why the community has started to create a wiki! unloved.wikia.com\n\nThe community and the developer is very responsive. If you have a suggestion that is commonly shared with other players, the developer is probably already working on it.\n\nI can't wait to see future updates for this game! I think is has a lot of potential and I'm very satisfied with this purchase.\n\n--\n\nThis review was pretty horrible. It had such a random order. If anyone has got any questions or comments for me, make them. I'll answer/reply!","November 17, 2015","true","68.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

The game is currently available on Early Access, and will be updated based on the feedback from the fans.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is developed with the Unreal Engine 4, and it looks and performs really well. The current setting is the Apartment, and it features dark and rusty corridors, creepy basements and rooms with multiple paintings on the walls. The three enemy types also look very good and creepy: you have a nurse-like monster that shoots fireballs and melees you, a vampire-hunter looking fellow that shoots at you, and a big fat monster who rushes in and requires multiple shots to be killed. If you like the Silent Hill games as I do, you will enjoy both the level and monster design.\n\nGAMEPLAYWhen you start a new game, you can choose the amount of players, the map's size and wether or not to play the Daily Level (same for every player) or a Randomly Generated level. Your goal is to survive the monsters and find 7 blood machines to use an elevator and go to another level. There are currently only two guns in the game, a Pistol and a Shotgun. You can also customize your character's colors by buying color schemes, as well as finding trinkets that give you perks in-game.\nWhile this might sound boring or repetitive, I was surprisingly enjoy every second of it. Probably because I liked the original modification, the atmosphere and the fast paced action. While playing solo, you will be spooked multiple times by the increasing and overwhelming amount of enemies. While playing coop, you will have a blast running through the rooms with your friends, shooting demons in the face and finding all the collectibles.\n\nCHALLENGEUnless you play on the easiest difficulty (in which enemies die after a couple of shots), the game will be challenging. Alone you will die after 10-15 minutes due to the amount of enemies that keeps spawning, while with other players you will most likely survive and still feel the tension of being constantly attacked. I recommend playing online, otherwise your solo experience will quickly become borderline frustrating to some players. However, the ever-changing maps and amount of collectibles make you want to keep playing.\n\nSOUNDAs with many horror games, the sound is the most important aspect to make it succeed. And UNLOVED has great monster and ambient noises, as well as a perfectly fitting soundtrack: when there aren't many enemies roaming the rooms, the music is soft and eerie, and when they start rushing in and trying to kill you, the music keeps building up and it gives you both energy and tension to kill the monsters. I love when this happens in horror games, because it enhances the experience quite a lot.\n\nREPLAYABILITYEven though there is only one location, the focus on coop, fast combat, multiple secrets and collectibles, trinkets and randomly generated levels make this a game that feels fresh every time you play it.\n\nOverall, I had a ton of fun playing this game solo and with friends: the atmosphere is great, the combat is fluid and the replayability hooks you up. If you like action games, if you like multiplayer games, if you like action-horror, if you like survival-horror - you will enjoy this game. It's a very good game, very well developed and we must support it.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","August 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 47 of 87 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","47","87","4","0"

It's got a current lack of weapons and enemies, but apart from that the feel is nailed down to a T.\nIf that appeals to you like it does to me, try this game. If not, welll, you won't find much else there.\n\nUnloved features four player co-op, a weapon upgrade system, and Doom 2's weapon-switching oriented combat with a runspeed. The core gameplay is extremely fun, and swapping weapons between combat is a blast.

This is the 2016 version of Doom 2 done right. Forget covers and regeneration: here you strafe, dodge fireballs and put down monsters who look differently, but play just like our old friends like Zombieman, Imp, Mancubus, Archvile. There are several novelties that enhance the gameplay without ruining it, like a system of long-term upgrades, weapon mods and, my favorite, some enemies' ability to dash right into your face in the true horror B-movie style. There's also a game mode that borrows the core mechanic from SuperHOT: everything is in slow motion unless you are moving. The game supports both single player and convenient drop-in/drop-out coop for up to 4 players. Though still in early access, it is already 100% playable and can deliver tens of hours of fun before starting to bore you. It is regulary updated, too, so by that time there would probably be something new to play with.\nOverall, Unloved is a perfect mix of "creepy" and "fun", "old" and "new", good for both nostalgic old doomers and fresh newcomers.","May 25","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The horror aspect of the game is more present in singleplayer and can be increased by selecting a more difficult mode available only in single player that increases enemy strength but reduces the amount of enemies, providing a tense and challenging experience - though even in the other setting with many enemies, the sheer amount of them makes the game very fast paced and filled with scares. The simple objectives give the player a goal each level rather than just survive, and the randomised personal objectives allow for small achievements to attempt along the way, and give players the choice of spending extra time in the area (thus increasing difficulty) to gain the rewards upon completing them. Successful completion of objectives as well as finding certain items within a level allows the player to gain Karma or items to use for additional Karma, which is used to improve ones character - while this progression is slow, it has a lot of potential and feels very rewarding after purchasing a new perk as they all have a large impact in game.\n\nSomething that would massively benefit the game is steam workshop support, as this would allow the creation of new rooms that can be used in its level generating, or even new theming (as of this reviews time, there is only two themes, a clinic and apartments, though both are very well done) and so on, but whether this will be implemented or not is to be seen.\n\nOne of the few games in early access worth buying, moreso if you intend to play with friends, and will only get better as time passes and updates are released.","December 30, 2015","true","29.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

While it can get repetitive after a while, it's fun to play as enemy spawn is always random so you have know how many enemies you'll get and hard it'll be. The multiplayer mode is probably my favorite. It's more fun to play in a group then by yourself, cause otherwise it really will get repetitive.\n\nI'll be honest though, there are some downsides to the game. One downside is that the game is dark, literally. Your flashlight helps to see what's right in front of you, but unless you're in an area of the game that provides other light sources it can be somewhat difficult to see. And turning the brightness up on your monitor only does so much before it makes it worse. The only other downside I personally found was that when you first start playing, unless you have someone there to help whose played before, then you have idea what to do or what your objective is. You just run around killing enemies and collecting things. It wouldn't be so bad if more people played, then others can join your game and you'll figure things out faster.

I am a huge fan of horror and gory games.  By Satan is this game good so far.  It plays similar to a wave shooter but don't let that fool you, this game will make you jump and almost ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• your pants.  "Why?"  You might ask to which I reply with the enemies have to basic speeds of movement: slow and mach 5, when you turn around after picking something up and one of these creepy monsters just rushes towards with out warning, let's just say it's enough to make you say holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.  The enemies are also slightly unpredictable, all enemies have two attacks one ranged and one melee.  The ranged attack animations are none existent (at least from what i've seen i could've easily missed them.)  The demons or monsters are definitely creepy, ranging from creepy clowns to butchers (the rest you can find out for yourself, I don't want to spoil the enemies.)  It gives me a vibe of classic FPS games like Doom and Duke Nukem, just shoot everything in sight and leave none alive.  The atmosphere is creepy the apartments are pretty scary.\nAll and all I believe this game was worth the $12.79 I paid for it, I wish nothing but success for this game and the developer for they both show promise.\n\nUpdate: The dev has added totems, which are power ups that affect the player. (i.e. Make the player run faster.)  Also, the game is still making me jump.  I have been playing horror games for pretty much my entire life, and a game has never made me scream.  This game did it, it broke me.  I was typing a message to my friend (While on multiplayer.)  and I forgot you can't pause on multiplayer and when I look back at the game right after sending the message a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing nurse is all up in my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at light speed and a screamed... at 3:00 am.

What it has evolved into, is something pretty awesome.\n\nIn Unloved, you and a group of up to 3 friends scout out randomly generated locations for 7 blood machines. Once you find these machines, you need to fill them with your blood and escape to keep the demons at bay.\n\nWhile you are doing this, a variety of monsters attempt to eat you skull. While the designs aren't anything to boast about, their behaviour is more or less akin to the doom cast of monsters. Keeping the monster variants to a minimum helps keep the claustrophobic and easily filled hallways easier to naivagate. Unlike Doom, however, almost every monster throws a projectile, with only one monster dedicated to hitscan.\n\n3 weapons exist right now, and those are the Pistol, the Silenced Machine Pistol, and the Super Shotgun. These all function as they are supposed to, however, I feel the SMP is rather under powered. It has the fastest fire rate, but you'll find yourself putting clips upon clips into some of the tougher monsters on the lower difficulties, and literally bleeding your full reserves dry to even dent a higher monsters health on the harder difficulties.\n\nCollectibles are scattered around the maps in the form of ink bottles which let you unlock new color schemes, photos which let you unlock pages of the journal, silver keys, which let you open locked totem boxes which give you random power ups, and finally, weapon mods, which boost your weapons for your current playthrough.\n\nWhile bare bones and in Early Acces, Unloved is easily a frantic and enjoyable co-op horror shooter. There's enough content here right now in my opinion to warrant a 15 dollar price tag. The author is working on the 4th weapon, the Nail-Gun at the time of this review, as well as a new map location. There is a game mode called Twisted, which randomizes every room to be from each of the 3 themes if you really wany infinite replayability.","June 6","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then as you turn to go in the other direction suddenly before you stands mockingly staring at you with its eyes of boundless insanity is a psychotic being tearing at you as if possessed of every serial killers rage which ever existed.\n\nThis is UNLOVED a horror fps set on maps fearfully dark yet with just enough light to let you see what will kill you if you dont escape.  Throughtout the maps you will need to look for weapons, ammo to reload your armaments, health packs to keep you going as inhuman monstrousities seek to mutilate and kill you, armor to protect and absorb damage, special artifact like keys to get passed magically sealed doors and mysterious chests which hold untold ancient power for the player to wield.

New content is added every month abouts.\n\nAnd it has a super shotgun.. so i have to give it a nice review.\n\nA note on the creator, he seems like a good fellow and canvases the forums with his ideas and looking for others, i read a nasty review that seemed to hate on him for NOT listening to people, but he has such a forum presence that I find that review to be, to put it kindly, slandering trash.\n\nThe coop is simple and fun, and derpy because the animations arent done. You simply make a game and people can join, no server hosting software or crap like that (However the servers are often dead so find friends BEFOREHAND to play with).\n\nSUPER SHOTGUN, AWAYYY\n\nPlease note this review is old, i plan on updating it when i get enough tools and skill to play on the difficulties high enough to spawn enemies i have yet to see.","November 1, 2015","true","16.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

With another DOOM game actually coming out soon, they'll have you beat in action, so if I were you, I would direct the game into a more survival-horror zone. Having a gun in your hands is very nice, but making the game much scarier would deffinitely do it well.\n\nThe AI also needs a lot of work. A lot of times the enemies would walk into a room only to immediately leave it for no reason.","August 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But after I kept playing, I became addicted.\n\nThis game has a bunch of very clever systems in place that makes game play fun and challenging. The objectives require you to not only get to 7 blood machines, but you also need to sacrifice 7 health points to EACH. This means you have to be on edge the whole time while trying to get to them.\n\nThe gunplay is great for a one man indie title, and feels gory, punchy, and satisfying.\n\nThe loot system combined with the random rogue-lite elements makes for tense and challenging gameplay. You will always need to be moving from room to room to find the supplies you need to survive and win, and having to hold down the use button for certain amounts of time makes every little noise terrifying because you don't know if picking up that armor shard will be worth it when you lose all your health by getting your back shredded off. Different things take different amounts of times to pick up/open, and I find this to be rather clever. I mean, putting on a full combat vest isn't as fast as opening a door, and opening a door isn't as fast as picking up a pistol magazine and stuffing it down your pants.\n\nYou can also find many different items besides ammo and health/armor. There are photos you find entirely devoted to advance the story in the extras menu, and ink bottles you can spend to get a new random color scheme for your character model. Not to mention the gun mods you can find to make fighting off demons easier, and completing levels awards you with useful trinkets that can either change your play style, or just help with making surviving easier. You can also trade in extra trinkets to upgrade certain ones so the ones that help you the most can be leveled up for further power.\n\nDespite being so early in developement, with only one tile set availabe for random generation, I can't say that I am not having a lot of fun playing it over and over again at different difficulties, with different people, and getting new loot. The tidbits of story it gives you for collecting photos is interesting so far, and I am intrigued to find more. (Along with more ink bottles to try and get the perfect color combination for my character!)\n\nThe multiplayer is rusty, but fun, and works pretty damn well. Having someone cover your back while you unlock a door or generously donate blood to finish the level is awesome, and fits in well with this game I feel. So far it's a shame that more people aren't playing this gem in the rough, because the multiplayer is quite good despite its stiff appearance.\n\nI think that i'm loving the game even though most of the planned monsters, weapons, levels, and polish haven't been added yet. I was kind of scared off by the $15 price tag for an indie early access game as I had been burned on purchases like those before, but this was different. The game is fun, challenging, addicting, has a goal, and has a developer that seems to care about the game he is making. It is rightly in early access, but that's no reason to think that it is falling apart or unfinished as hell. The developer was smart enough in many different ways to design the game to be fun and challenging despite being fairly rough around the edges. And I haven't really run into any bugs other than an occasional ragdoll bugging out.\n\nI applaud the developer for his efforts, and emplore him to keep working on this until it is as awesome as it can be. I find it great as it is, but once more levels, enemies, guns, and etc. are added, this may just be another great indie hit!","August 24, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You need a modern DooM engine like Zandrorum, Gzdoom, or Zdoom itself to run the mod. The Unloved mod for DooM was nothing short but brilliant in atmosphere and level design.\n\nWith all the positive feedback from the DooM community over his work, Paul decided to continue on with a sequel, Unloved 2. Even though the project was unfinished, let me tell you that Unloved 2 was probably the best DooM mod I have ever played. Unloved 2 takes place right after the events of Unloved. You wake up in a mysterious underground cell, where you are held prisoner by an unknown entity. As your cell door creeps open, you black out with a brilliant flash of light, only to be awoken on a operating table with a pile of your own organs on a nearby table....\n\nPaul nailed it again in Unloved 2 with underground demonic fleshy walls, abandoned cities with hanging corpses from post lights, the player's personal demons manifesting in front of him, and a series of extremely bizarre written notes inside of a house that hints to your captivator being an old entity like Jack the Ripper. With soundtracks ripped from other games like Silent Hill for his old work, his personal selection of music with a melancholy, dark atmosphere level design. I highly recommend that you play the Unloved series on a modern DooM engine, and if you like your playthoughs, then pick this up afterwards to support Paul.\n\nI have high hopes for this project reboot. And I have all the confidence in Paul that he will deliver same sinister, gloomy atmosphere from his old projects and will transmit them into his new work.","August 23, 2015","true","8.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The karma point system is abit annoying and confusing and i wish it was explained when you first got into it. I do wish there was a better variety of guns in the game as well. I find at times enemies teleport to you like a fury charge which is not that great either but is good for a scare. The coop needs some work as well and there is currently only one character to play as. The random map generator is pretty basic but gets the job done.\n\nUPDATE: Since originally getting this game and playing it further it is a really fun and innovative horror game. When I can afford it I am looking forward to gifting my friends this game since the servers seem dead for matchmaking. The simple and complex additions make the game for me, a survival horror fan, all the better as it gets creepier, harder and still at the same time if your good enough to survive you will. I think this game will continue to show more promise but I think the community needs to grow indefinately as this game is one of those hidden gems.\n\nAll those who want to know I purchased this game on sale. A fair price for a game with alot of content and  playability.","November 6, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We have seen the rise of competitive gaming utilizing cult classics such as Quake Arena and Counter Strike while remakes keep appearing out of thin air to revitalize classics such as Doom or Wolfenstein. Mods for some of these older games have also been seeing the remake treatment in the form of full releases. Unloved, based on a Doom 2 mod, is making its way through Early Access to hopefully see the light at the end of tunnel and join Team Fortress 2 and Natural Selection 2 as full releases that originated from mods. It has been around since August 2015, but has it managed to improve in quality and quantity during this short time in Early Access?\n\nThe title screen sets up the general theme of the visual aesthetic with a great melding of rusted iron and dripping blood stains. While the player controls a well groomed suit wearer, the environments are everything to do with filth, decay and wholesome horror. It is rather low grade technically, but the dark (lingering on semi-pitch black) lighting provides a much needed clash with the stark red, purple and yellow glows from fireballs utilized by different enemies. Nurses, clowns, and lumbering monstrosities round out a good portion of the ten or so enemy types you are bound to face in three different area styles. It works quite well to promote a sense of dread, especially with the help of the few music tracks that linger creepily behind grunts and screams. If Unloved had to be labeled for one overarching trait, it would definitely be its' atmosphere.\n\nA hand gun, shotgun and sub machine gun make up the three weapons you will be using. Scattered throughout the map are mods used to increase damage, spread, accuracy and stability for each weapon as well as photos, ink bottles and keys used to unlock totems. This is the basis of the gameplay: killing disfigured horrors and building yourself up with upgrades. The actual shooting works well, aside from some hit box issues, and can be rather enjoyable for the first couple of times you play. The problem is with repetition setting in.\n\nThe Achille's Heel of the game has to be in the amount of content currently available. There is a great deal of customization in level size, game modes and difficulty settings, but it only affects the size of the map, the number of enemies and how long it takes to interact with items. The overall premise stays the same and it is not explained well. You will shoot the same enemies in increasing difficulty and numbers while finding mods for your weapons, cards to buff your character and keystones to unlock three types of doors until you locate seven machines that require a sacrifice made in blood. Once this is done, you must return to the elevator and thus completing the game. This is how every mission will be regardless of player level and repetition sets in quickly after.\n\nTechnically the game ran pretty well outside a couple of issues. Upon starting up the program, the software would freeze up a minute later and require a forced restart. Enemies are able to melee hit you through some walls, which I managed to test by standing still while enemies on the other side wailed on me. Enemies will also ignore you when you are standing right in front of them, with shots I make at point blank range not registering. The online community is next to dead, with just a small (and I mean small) group of people still using it. All and all the major issues revolve around the enemy behavior and hit boxes of certain attacks.\n\nIt is hard to gauge a game for what is essentially a reliance on replay-ability. Repetitive motions can be alright for one person, but ultimately ruin an experience for another. Very few games can capture the allure of a game in the sixtieth run that a player felt during their first play through. Unloved presents a lot of modes and plenty of cosmetic appeal, but did not manage to win a recommendation from me. The amount of available content is too slim for the price at this time; hopefully when I come back to it for a re-review that will change.\n\nPros\n\n- Atmosphere is dripping with dread\n- Shooting works and has some enjoyment value\n- Plenty of game modes\n\nCons\n\n- Start-up crashes, enemy bugs\n- Repetition for gameplay sets in quick\n- Content is lacking in both location and objective\n- Online is close to dead","May 29","false","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Blocky, ugly convoluted mess of extra-amateurish production levels, filled with issues and ton of design flaws. Feels more of 'proof-of-a-concept' filled with placeholder everything than actual game, but that's Early Access for you. Enemies and chars (and even furniture) mostly have low quality models with polygons sticking out of everywhere textured like it's UV mapping is broken. Useless UI (especially map, which is extremely important for randomly-generated game), ugly menus, looting that brings you to pixel-hunting era. Environment is mostly pitch-black, just sometimes mixed with badly lit rooms. I'm not really the graphics guy, but those art assets are ugly even for me. The game has it's style, but it doesn't feel like it's potential will be fleshed out.\nThere is ton of balancing issues, atrocious pacing, coop like it's '92 with zero coop mechanics (not even scoring system, nothing - like it's Doom2 or something). Game tend to get boring after single playthrough, doesn't matter if it's SP and MP you were playing. The game doesn't has any killer feature while playing on absolutely the same field as Space Beast Terror Fright which had solid design, artistic vision, split screen and god knows what else.\n\nDespite that the game is pretty fun for first half an hour due to solid shooting and a lot of gore, sounds are good, music suits the game well and creates mood and atmosphere much needed for horror game. Sure it's a small excuse for one-man-dev-team mess of a game we got here, but I thought it's needed to be noted.\n\nAlso it's coffee-break shooter that probably won't work on your work PC though, hello UE4\n\nThe game feels and looks like a FPS made by Doom2 modder: modern rogue-lite and UE4 sit on top of design flaws that FPS games got rid off in a last decade. It's not a homage to long gone era, it's just amateur attempt. Take it or leave it. But I'd rather play Ziggurat. Or wait for Killing Room release and then wait for Strafe.\n\np.s.: I thought I should say. It's not an excuse that it's one-man-dev-team - you can be a legend alone or can be crap boys band and have your year of fame because of PR money - it's all the same for any creative process. This game is 15yo kid's music he makes alone in his garage, he might become a rock-star or part of a great band. But chances are his efforts will be forever unloved.","March 28","false","8.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

If the DEV, Paul Schneider, was as interested as maintaining his game as in maintaining his petulance, this game might easily flourish. But evidence proves his greater interest is in condescenion and one-upmanship over those he should be expressing his gratitude towards, his customers, who have no interest beyond expressing their own independent and heartfelt suggestions. He chooses to see ideas as attacks, no matter how sincere or innocent. That, and the apparently long planned and baffleling concept of calling players ‚ÄúThe Fool‚Äù, risking life and killing for ‚Äútrinkets‚Äù, which shows a blatant disregard for those seemingly with more regard for this game than he, jealously punishing concerned players daring to express a selfless interest in something he clearly doesn't intend to share. The sad fact is, for $15US and early access, sharing IS included. (That's rather the entire point of early access.)\n\nIgnoring reported bugs and issues out of ego is unconscionable (three so far, documented and/or repeatable, and that‚Äôs just from me), so for now, I cannot approve UNLOVED. If it‚Äôs in development long enough for him to gain the maturity necessary to understand the priorities of game development, I will happily change my rating, but this sort of issue has ruined many otherwise encouraging projects. Still, I‚Äôm compelled to consider this still promising game in its own right, for the potential player to consider fairly.\n\nWith well over 60 hours in UNLOVED, and all but one achievement, I have to say that not only is it a very challenging game (though rather tedious as a whole), it is one of the FUNNIEST games I've played. Rarely have I laughed so much in any game.\n\nThere are very good things about UNLOVED, and very bad things. Among the bad, that apparently the only way to learn how or why about UNLOVED gameplay is to read reviews written by reviewers who have played older versions, or watch nearly two dozen long and tedious videos by the DEV. He won't tell you much about how to play, and neither does the game. Don't bother asking, no matter what the into screen says. (I presume this condescending attitude is why the player character is named "The Fool".)\n\nFortunately most gameplay is fairly intuitive, and as long as what you want, instead of strategy, is to shoot demons or slash them with a knife, you'll be fine. In fact, the most recent upgrade was largely adding blood and squishy sounds to deaths. Unfortunately, despite it's association with Doom II, single player mode is largely disregarded, to the point of including chat mode in single player (presumably so  players can talk to themselves. Told you it was a funny game!)\n\nBut where UNLOVED really shines in the demon movement. Running around in circles, staring at walls, levitating.....ignoring you entirely. A group of various demon types side by side, performing exactly the same movements as if in a Busby Berkley musical. So often demons are shot in the back when running...away! (Don't sweat it, they're demons!) And when they're shot, embedding through a wall as to be visible on both sides, or the floor, upside down with only a foot sticking up. Sticking to the ceiling by the sole of a shoe. All the while jiggling madly (though dead!), often scooting across the floor or up a wall! (Take a look on the Community Hub page. I've captured as many of these hilarious screenshots as possible.)\n\nThe humor in UNLOVED is entirely appropriate, considering its source is the classic Doom II, which certainly had its share. This DEV adds to it, with frequent intentional references to the final scene of "The Blair Witch Project" (by asking the player to consider "demon as victim", ads a new, very interesting dimension.) The Salem Servant character's constant catchphrase is "Don't Move", usually while running at high speed, often in the opposite direction. Go ahead and shoot him, there'll be more.....\n\nEnjoy UNLOVED for the humor, because that (and the graphics, usually) may be the best part!","September 13, 2015","false","73.1"," 31 of 68 people (46%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","46","31","68","9","16"

It's frikkin' awesome. A perfect pick-up-and-play horror FPS. Took me minutes to figure out what the hell I had to do and I had a blast on my very first run. It's a fast paced "holy crap, I'm totally screwed" panicky kinda game that will keep you coming for more with every failure (and I played on the easiest difficulty).\n\nThe game launches, runs great and has a some good PC-centric graphics options. The only flaws this game has are the ones you would actually associate with an early access title like limited content, maybe some missing animation and just general polish. Other than that, the game runs fantastic. I would honestly accept this as a full game for the asking price.\n\nUNLOVED doesn't want to hold your hand and nudge you through your objective. Nope. It wants to bite your hand off and slap your own face with it while kicking you in the nuts (if you're a guy of course). If you love old school no mercy for the player FPS shooters and indie horror, then you have to give this one a try.\n\nEDIT: So I made it to the elevator on my second playthrough. As soon as you activate the final blood machine, the game becomes a mad dash to your starting point. The hellish cratures start spawning uncontrollably at this point, shooting my way throught this ordeal was stressful as hell. When I finally get to the elevator, I focus all of my attention on the lever to activate it. I decide to ignore all oncoming damange and hope my remaining health and armor will last long enough for the lever timer to reach zero.\n\nAs I'm watching the race between my health meter and the elevator timer, it's blatantly obvious that it's going to be a close call...\n\n.2 seconds left before escape and...dead. .2 SECONDS!!\n\nWhat a rush. What happens if you successfully escape? I have no idea lol Can't wait to try this co-op.","November 7, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemies start to multiply as you go along ..they seem to be a bit confused about entering a room sometimes but other then that the game works great with the only bug i have seen being the ragdoll flying off into a wall then wiggleing like its trying to escape. Not much to this game yet ..yet being the keyword as the dev seems to be working on it quite nicely and plans on adding more. However the atmosphere and the thought of something behind you as it takes time to pick up things or open doors makes for a creepy feeling or worrying about every bump or growl makes you want to run. Overall the only negative thing i have to say is the creatures haveing trouble with their room decision makes them easy kills. The game is also multiplayer so..bring friends!","September 18, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun, it's bloody, and Killing Floor-esque, if not repetitive, granted this is Early Access. The UE4 engine is nice, but it's got a lot of kinks to work out (granted it's a relatively new engine). Try and help randomize the encounters, and sometime's the audio isn't syncing properly.

The ambiance and horror elements are there, and it relates a lot to Killing Floor in my opinion but different in that it definitely focuses more on the horror vs just action run & gun. I haven't played it with others or friends, so this is all based on solo experience. There is definitely areas that need improvements, which I am sure and hope the devs are already working on them. And the lady things remind me of Nurses from Silent Hill, which I have gone on to call them haha.

Each play through has a randomly generated map, different objectives and involves worshiping RNGesus.
