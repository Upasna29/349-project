I loved the 2D animation and the point and click interface of the first two Broken Sword games. This was so different that the experience was almost ruined for me. I'm glad I saw it through, because this is a great game. We still have the George and Nico that we have loved from the previous games (same voice actors and a great script) and the story is great, stemming back to the first Broken Sword game. The 3D is decent, with some awesome set pieces, and the rest being average. The controls can take a bit to get used to, and may turn off a lot of people. A point and click adventure has turned into an only use your keyboard adventure. That was difficult for me to swallow at first. For the most part, the puzzles are pretty good.....except....for all...the BOXES!! There were way too many move-the-box puzzles. One here or there isn't a sin, but the amount in here makes them feel like filler, as if the game needed to be longer. I don't think the game would have suffered had they removed some of these tedious box puzzles. A minor complaint is that there are moments in the game in which you have just moments to react, and you have to press the right button to avoid death. It kind of kills when the button doesn't appear till after you die. Luckily, the game loads right back to the perilous situation and you now know what button to push. This doesn't happen often though, so it is a minor annoyance.  This game will probably not be considered as good as the first two, but it is definitely still worth playing. There is enough Broken Sword goodness to soften the leap from 2D to 3D adventure.","January 16","true","23.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","2"

The dialogue and voice acting is definitely one of the strongest aspects of the series, and BS 3 has that too. Most of the puzzles range from okay to pretty interesting.\n\nHowever, the controls are an unholy collection of awful and rubbish. They suck, they suck in every way possible. Combine the bad controls with the terrible camera and you got a special kind of awful. The camera uses weird angels and it switches them constantly. CONSTANTLY. It jumps back and forth, sometimes as much as five times in a few "meters" of road. It's enough to make you seasick... and it causes you to run the wrong way since what was one direction a second ago is suddenly the opposite direction or sideways. It also prevents you from seeing the things you wish to see.\n\nMaybe it is easier to play on a controller, but as far as I can tell there is no way to do so.\n\nThe move to 3D really did not help this game in any way. The visuals look dated compared to the other two older games. The controls and camera are, as I said, horrific. To the puzzles it has apparently only added crate/block dragging and hidden climb points. The block puzzles are unfortunately uninspired and the hidden climb points are either obvious or frustrating. It has, however, added a bunch of empty space that you have to transverse, filled with an endless supply of locked doors that you can for some reason try to open, look at and listen to. It is a frustrating test of patience. It adds nothing to the puzzles when five endless corridors still only contain one object and one place to use it. It does not make the world feel larger and more alive, it just creates even more space you have to get through with your bad controls and camera.\n\nThen we have the fact that you can't skip dialogue or cutscenes. Which is going to be a problem considering BS3, like all adventure games, encourage interacting with objects numerous times... which means that it sure would be nice to be able to skip past having to hear them say they can't open the door for the thousands time until you find the door you ARE supposed to open. Not being able to skip cutscenes is even worse since they had decided to match almost every cutscene with either quick time events or chases... and if you miss you die... and if you die... YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE WHOLE FREAKING CUTSCENE AGAIN... AND AGAIN... AND AGAIN.\n\nIt's a shame, because underneath it all is a pretty nice adventure game. The problem is that the amount of frustration you have to go through to get to the good parts is just not worth it. The only reason I played to the end is stubborness. There are good moments, but the only way I can recommend this game is if you have a high tolerance for bad controls, bad cameras, watching the same cutscenes over and over again, and just generally feel like the game is wasting your time for no good reason.","January 16, 2014","false","12.2"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","33","46","3","0"

The controls are really wonky, even after adjusting them to the typical WASD setup.\n\nYou waste a lot of time on box puzzles, as others have mentioned. The "stealth" sections are extremely tedious, frustrating, and don't add to the story.\n\nThere were two points in the game that really drove me crazy. At one point, while dungeon-crawling, I missed an item at the very beginning. Yep, you guessed it, no way to backtrack! I had to grab a save file to continue. Secondly, there was a puzzle that required you to check your notes. That was the ONLY time I found myself having to look at the notebook, so it was the furthest thing from my mind!\n\nThe dialogue and videos are NOT skippable, so have fun if you have to repeat sections because you missed your window of opportunity to not be killed. Those windows of opportunity involve paying attention to the action buttons and pressing it when required. Most of the time, I was too involved watching what was happening in the video only to realize I had died, because I didn't see the action pop up. Sigh.\n\nAnd the ending... boss fight, really? Another pointless section!\n\nNot sure what they were thinking with this game compared to 1 & 2 (which I enjoyed), but I was quite pleased when it ended...

Went with "Recommended", but only if you are a fan of the series.\n\nI previously played part 1 and 2 of the series, and this game was, IMHO, the poorest of the 3.\n\nThe game had lesser puzzles! I don't count box pushing as puzzles and there were really too many of them! They also added Quick Time Events (QTEs), some action sequences (usually running away or hiding) and sneaking around. Well, my preference would have that it been more puzzle-oriented.\n\nThe 3D perspective would have been fine, but the camera angles made it terrible. The camera kept switching and the controls are relative to the angle at that point, and so making it difficult to move the character. For example, I might end up running towards the enemy rather than away. And certain sequences had time constraints, which made it frustrating when I can't move the character to the correct position, and had to keep repeating till I get it right. It is also irritating that I couldn't skip cutscenes when repeating these sequences. For these reasons, I prefer the 2D view in the first 2 games. The shift to 3D was refreshing (reminded me of Uncharted a couple of times), but implementation was really poor.\n\nWell, having said all these, I love George and Nico and won't hesistate to buy the next game (was also wondering why The Angel of Death is not on Steam?), though newcomers that start with this game first will probably think otherwise.\n\nWill probably get The Serpent's Curse (glad that it went back to the series' 2D roots) on the Playstation Vita once, or if, it releases in the Asian PS Store (probably the region with the worst store updates).","January 19, 2014","true","12.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

This game takes everything great from the past 2 games and completely ignores it.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- This game came out roughly 10 years after the first game and has aged worse than the previous games. This is what happens when you focus on technical graphics over art style. Gone is the cartoonish look and animations replaced with a more realistic look that doesn't even come close to holding up in modern times. Obviously a decade old game isn't going to look good compared to modern times but when the game is harder to look at than the previous games, you know you have a problem.\n\n-The areas in this game feel so lifeless and soulless. All the charm has been lost. Every area is devoid of anything and now that you have to manually control your character it feels even emptier than before. I remember areas from the first two games that felt vibrant filled with people and unique locations. This game, every area feels the same. The feeling of being on an exotic adventure is gone.\n\n- The game suffers with poor controls and camera angles.\n\n- Designed with controller in mind\n\n- The dialogue is atrociously bad and painful to listen to with some of the worst sounding accents I've heard in a game. To make matters worse you can't skip any dialogue. It's like getting punched in the face repeatedly and there is nothing you can do about it.\n\n\n-The puzzles are not very good and most of them are 'crate puzzles'- moving crates around to access new areas. On some occasions you have to use 'stealth' or risk being killed. These stealth sections are also poorly done given the camera angles and controls.\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ The only bright spot I can think of is if you enjoyed the characters from the first game than you will enjoy seeing the same characters and revisiting familiar locations.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI don't blame the developers for this. Point and Click Adventure games were all but dead in the early 2000's so trying to make them relevant and porting them to consoles only seemed like the logical choice given that is where the money was at. This game sadly did not make the transition so smoothly. As a standalone game I could recommend it, problem is 2 other games came out before it and did a much better job in every area.\n","April 15, 2015","false","9.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

This time in full 3D - a change from the classic 2D style we have all become so accustomed to. You may ask, does this change work for the series? Well... yes and no... I did feel a lot more connected with the characters than the previous games. For being made in 2003 they did a very fine job with the facial animations sparking new life to Georges witticism and Nicole's sarcasm. The jealous banter between the two of them continues just like the old games, but it feels more fleshed out this time. Nicole continues to improve with each game and is much funnier and involved now. You will constantly switch between them giving both equal screen time, and in some instances they will be working together to solve puzzles.\n\nWhere this game fails unfortunately is the gameplay. You will have tedious climbing sequences which will remind you of a bad version of Uncharted, weird sneaking like it's trying to imitate Splinter Cell and endless simple crate puzzles which adds nothing but frustrations. The game tries to be so many different things, but only works great when it's a point-and-click adventure. Still... despite the flaws, simple puzzles and ugly controls which will have you run into so many walls George will end up looking like the town drunkard - It's still a good game. The story is there, we have many interesting characters, the dialogue has its moments and the voice acting is above average.\n\nA lot of classic point-and-click adventures failed the 3D-conversion in the early 20's, but this game has stood the test of time and is yet another fine entry in the Broken Sword franchise.\n","July 25, 2013","true","11.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The Sleep Dragon is a shining example of how the genre has progressed and what it is capable of, it’s a stunning achievement adventure gaming. Inclusive of a solid story, likeable and engaging characters, stunning visuals, and delightful dialogue, this is one adventure you simply won’t be able to tear yourself away from.\n\nGraphically, the game is well done, with bright, cartoonish visuals. Cut-scenes are well voiced and complement the story, animation quality is superb. Incredible voice acting dominates this game, often surpassing the graphics and story by far. From Nico’s French accent to George’s “yankee lawyer” daftness, it’s a pleasure to listen to this game.\n\nMany of the puzzles are somewhat straightforward in design, and while ensuring player is less likely to hit those infuriating brick walls typically found in many of the genre's titles, your input into the events once again tends to feel slightly shallow and less rewarding than before as the majority of ‘box’ puzzles are repetitive, yet otherwise clever.\n\nThe games controls however, feel somewhat broken, as to can make it almost impossible to play expect for the most dedicated of fans. The Sleeping Dragon is the only instalment in the series that is not point-and-click, in fact, it’s impossible to use the mouse for anything; instead all major actions in the game are done by keyboard or even game-pad as I preferred. The games manual brags about its “hybrid” system, but it’s practically unusable. The UI on the other-hand does steer away from the familiarity of the previous titles in the series, but once you look past the crude user interface, you will find an otherwise excellent and compelling game.\n","May 19, 2014","true","13.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Once again this Broken Sword Chapter begins on a rush and with some news as well. This is Another Point & Click that decided the old 2d system was obsolete and had to be renovated and replaced with a new 3d interface. Good thing? Bad thing? Well it's true that the old 2d interface is a classic best suited for adventures, but this is not just a matter of following a trend. New mechanics have been introduced, so even if the third dimension wasn't necessary it suits fine this adventure as the items you can interact with are easily marked and reachable, the character can move fluently, and the camera system has been studied enough to prevent as much as possible those classic shot troubles. The inventory system is quite comfortable and well integrated in the game (unlike Grim Fandango's, just to make an example) and the actions pad seems like a good integration as well: there are 4 slots which hold 4 different kind of interactions. According to the item, the compatible actions will lit and will be usable with the corresponding key.\nThe most important news still is the action side of the game: while in previous chapter you never needed to run now you can. And there are also stealth sections where running is mostly inadvisable as you'll be heard if you do it too close, so you'll need to quietly sneak behind guards and other things like these. And last, we have the infamous boxes... XD\nIn this chapter we have many situations and riddles that will require you to pull or push many boxes (or rocks, or other things) in different positions at the purpose of granting you a passage or maybe blocking some mechanism, or maybe even solving more complicated puzzles.\nSo it is safe to say that this chapter sees more action along with classic riddles and box riddles. As a confirm there are (few) Quick time events, not to mention the very end of the game which is a little action based (no spoilers, beside the gameplay), but there's nothing to worry about if you're not used to action games and prefer a quiet adventure, as every situation of this kind starts from a checkpoint, hence if you fail you can quickly restart from that point until you're able to pass through.\nI've had some minor issues with the game, as I run it on Windows 10: the game kept on playing windowed, and I had a hard time to save my video resolution and settings as well, but these are minor issues to me as anything worse ever happened to prevent me from enjoying the game.\nAfter all I enjoyed this chapter, the story was intricate but I liked it, The 3d interface was a change but has been handled well as it was quite easy to use, and about puzzles, as usual, some of them you have to try out of schemes. Anyways this is a good chapter, to me.\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. The 3d revolution was a news that brought some small action situations as well. Honestly I did enjoyed this because it gave a small excitment to the classic quiet atmosphere of the old adventures. Still I understand that purist might consider this blasphemy but I believe the developers thought about this too and that's why all of the most dangerous situations have an immediate loading checkpoint.\nINTERFACE. Even though I still prefer the classic 2d interface of point & click adventures, I still enjoyed this game as the situations and ambience required an action interface together with an intuitive inventory system and item spotting method which worked quite well here.\nDIALOGUES. An always important part of an adventure, in my opinion, and I appreciated the dialogues, the thoughts, the comments and the dynamics between characters.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY BUGS. I know they have to be expected because of the age of the game and the requirements but honestly I don't care. Fortunately they're very small issues that can be dealt with, but still the game would be obviously better without them.\nWOLF, SHEEP AND CABBAGE. Yes, there's this riddle disguised with Egyptian mythology... I was speechless when I saw it and I silently solved it blindfolded... Now seriously, they could have thought something a little more creative considering the rest of the game. On top of that this riddle is in the final part of the game...","March 4","true","10.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's quite tedious to play at times though. Fixed camera angles coupled with the way controls work will trip you up at times. Say you are moving up with the up arrow key and the camera angle switches 180 degrees. If you had never let go of the up button you will continue moving up but if you let go and press down you will move down instead. Thinking more on it this is actually good system to have in place since if it wasn't there your character would never be able to walk a straight line with all the camera angle changes but it's still not a good enough control system to make the fixed camera angles excusable. Fixed camera angles and 3D games don't go togather well.\n\nAnd the tedious box pushing puzzles that aren't puzzles really they are just there to pad this game. Seriously, if there was no box pushing puzzles involved I would say it would take 2/3 less time to finish the game.\n\nThat said I find the characters and dialog for this game to be much better compared to the first 2. It's the little things that are good. Like the characters having facial mimics while talking, it makes them feel more alive. Makes the delivery of the dialog better.\n\nIt's up to you if you want to play it. If you cannot handle the oldschool awful controls, camera angles and tedious puzzle design I suggest you pass it. If you are slightly nostalgic about all this crap though, you'll sort of enjoy this for some reason.","May 2, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's old, and while I was surprised that there was no mouse control, the controls were fairly intuitive.  It is one of those adventure games which, instead of point and click, attempts to add an element of real-time play.  This mostly works against the game as it can sometimes pose annoyances that force you to replay a scene multiple times until you execute the moves just right.  It also gets obsessed with tedious but not difficult pushing box puzzles similar to Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver.  They mostly don't add any satisfaction to the game.  There are also many stealth scenes that are hampered by camera angles that block your view of surroundings.  Beyond that there are a lot of standard adventure game elements.  I'm fond of the conspiracy themed games, however this series tends to follow a less sophisticated plot similar to an episode of Scooby Doo.  It serves its purpose and I wasn't entirely put off by it.  The character of Nico is well done and complete with sexy French accent and sexy everything else.  George is portrayed as a bit of a typical jock, but also well voice acted.  The age of the game also means a 4:3 aspect ratio, which can be streched to fit modern resolutions if you don't mind the characters looking fat.  In summary, worth playing but probably not going to be very memorable.","April 13, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Puzzles.\nMost of the reviews complain about the controls.  Yes, they could be better.  In particular, the "click to move to a location" scheme from the previous titles is better.  But the controls aren't too bad for this style of game, and you quickly get used to them.\n\nOverall, not a bad addition to the Broken Sword line of games.  Decent voice acting, and the puzzles are (for the most part) well done.  Except for the box puzzles.\n\nEver hear "When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail."?  Well, the devs built a really nice hammer -- the ability to slide boxes around on the floor.  And they use it.  Contantly.  It seems like every third puzzle amounts to "How do I move that box to that spot on the floor?".

Very sad for a company that made one of the best point and click adventure games with Broken Sword 1. Some obvious reasons are the terrible camera angles and controls for the game. That could drive someone bananas just with that. The game also does not allow for the skipping of cutscenes, which must be repeated on dying over and over and over again. The crates are just stupid and the game no longer has the intriguing point and click puzzles of the first two games, all of the puzzles seem way to simple/linear.

I know the game is old but come on... No mouse control, randomly changing camera and therefore the directions. It drove me crazy from beginning to end every time the camera changed and I bumped to wall on a completely straight road. Just guess how it gets on not-so-straight roads. Sprint button is a long needed addition and the only plus side to the gameplay. The fact that I love the sprint button so much says very much about the game.\nGraphics sucks ♥♥♥. Again I know it is old but this is no nostalgic old like the first two in the series. It's just polygon-poor 3d objects all around. Textures are no better. Going 3d was obviously a big mistake for this series.\nStory is following the story of the first one - completely ignoring the second one in the process and I agree completely. Main character George's involvement is - again - totally coincidental but I got used to it. Second lead character Nico has another voice change but for the better this time and has more of a role in the story which is another plus. More interesting npcs are around and references to the past games are nice too. More witty remarks are an added bonus. But generic bad guys, cliche escapes and preventing the end of the world don't match the funny atmosphere. Do you want serious or funny? Make up your mind, game!\nAnd then there are the puzzles or lack thereof. They have a box push implemented and redefined the word overuse by it. It's not even a good system but it's EVERYWHERE. Escaping from death or saving someone in distress? Here push these boxes. They are the solution to - figuratively- EVERYTHING. Rest of the "puzzles" are either too easy or too stupid.\nTo sum up: worst game in the series and the genre up to now. I hope the last one is better.","March 20, 2015","false","8.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not only is the game inherently flawed because it came out in that awkward transitional period when adventure games apparently weren't hip enough and had to be "modernized" by converting them to WASD control input, but almost all of its "challenging" puzzles actually come from dragging boxes for excruciatingly long stretches of time which grinds the story to a halt and becomes more prevalent towards the end. Story also seems like good old familiar fare, with it's returning cast of characters and voice actors, for the first half or so, but then it proceeds to jump every imaginable shark in the book in favor of science fiction and ends up ditching the tone of Broken Sword completely.

Also they tend to get annoying since you have to move with keyboards, risking to avoid something important because you are not facing it the right way.\nAlso there were so many boxes (god, how I hated them) and stealh riddles that it was the exact opposite of you would expect from Broken sword.\nStill, I think it's an ok purchase but for fans only","February 21","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said and forgiven, this is a great game with adequate high-quality story and constantly changing dynamics. Can be a bit annoying from time to time, but all in all positive things overthrow the negatives by a great margine.","February 25","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one was a bit of a shock because was the first 3D version. BS1 and 2 was 2D traditional point and click and BS3 was more like a 3D Third person controller.\n\nThe controllers didn't feel very good but still couldn't make enjoy less. Loved the game and the story.","May 30","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
