Enemies are erratic to the point of annoying and disappear off the screen before you hardly know they are there. The amount of hits they take to actually go down is a bit tedious and there was a cheap "fly right into you" boss ship at the end of level 2! I also seemed to pick up bonuses or "upgrades" that seemed to have little or no effect! Right, I'm off for a game of R-Type!","October 4, 2015","false","6.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Not sure why more shmups dont do this!\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated but have that classic pc/arcade charm.\n\nI would like to see some more variety in the different ships beyond stats.","February 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You need to play through lower difficulties to unlock the higher ones. Higher difficulties are basically a crap load more enemies moving faster. I had fun with it for a bit.

What a steal\n\nA game with a retro style that executes it perfectly in today’s generation!\n\n*-Lovely art style\n*-Wide options and resolutions\n*-Supports 360 and Xbox One controller\n*-OpenGL\n*-Great performance\n*-Simple to play\n*-CO-OP!!!!\n\nI was going to ask for a review copy, but stopped myself and supported the developers. I paid the £3.99, the game is mainly CPU usage and uses a minimal amount on the GPU.

There's only a few different types of enemies, only 3 different kinds of weapons, about 6 levels and the different types of ships hardly add any extra gameplay. The thing I disliked most about the game is that it is quite hard to see enemies against the terrain especially on a certain map, where it is almost mars like the smaller red bullets are also rather dificult to see.","December 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

Your ship is way too big on the screen and the aliens fall in the "we're ALL kamikaze" category. There are bullets to avoid but the biggest threat is the ships themselves. Some areas have bosses... models are fine but they don't give you any satisfaction to take down, no visual on how damaged they are, no phases or transformations. The whole story mode is bland and it feels like all levels are the same except for the background. Sometimes enemies come from the background, ramming you from the depths of your screen as you're trying to figure out if you can even shoot them. I do love the ships firing FROM the background.. it kinda sets the climate for war although you won't know at which point their projectiles can actually hit you.\n\nOther modes of play include "you shall not pass or i lose" where you fire a thin one shot kill laser on enemies that eventually move faster horizontally than you can move vertically.\n\nThen comes the blitz modes where you must kill a fixed amount of enemies to go to the next wave. In this mode you soon find out that the screen is filled with ships that you can't kill with your strongest ship and your big ♥♥♥♥ get rammed by the swarm. Yes your hyper charges a little faster when not firing.... not firing, you're kidding right?\n\nI'm sure some people will like this game but i think it's missing A LOT to even start to be interesting.  There's some talent into this game but i'm expecting more than this in 2015.","August 6, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A shmup verteran will have an easy time with it, did I just write shmup veteran, lol I obviously did, err I am getting old.\n\nDon't misjudge by the graphics, the core gameplay itself is very solid. The levels as well as the angle you play changes quite a lot, basically a very cool thing.\n\nIf you're into shmups and can live with the HUD and the minimalised style this is very much worth your time, especially in co-op.\n\nRegards,\nNicoNico","October 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lots of ships to use, each of which feels different.  The Training difficulty allows even casual players to reach the end of the campaign, while the toughest settings can be quite challenging.  In addition to the short campaign, there are randomly generated levels and other modes.  Good value, good fun.
