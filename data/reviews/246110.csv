When I first read about it I was really interested and excited, but only after a few hours, I came to the conclusion, that there is no life in this game.\n\nLet me explain that a little:\n\nThe combat: An immersive game cant be shallow. If you played the recent X-Com titles you will have noticed that they watered down the combat compared to the old titles. Massive Chalice has a watered down recent X-Com combat system. It lacks any strategy, if you ask me. There is no flanking, no useful cover system. In the end, you will only care about the swiftest way to wipe away your enemies. And when it comes to wiping out, you will mostly care for the highest damage. I don't feel any synergy between the classes.\n\nHome/map screen: While waiting for the fast forward function to pop up any events, the game feels lifeless. Nothing will happen. Your map does not live. You wont see any changes in your nation within a hundred of years. While I do not care for graphic quality, I care for visuals. I do not like to stare at a lifeless map for a huge amount of time. This lifelessness continues:\n\nResearch/castle: You have the possibility to research new stuff. Weapons, armors, items, whatever. The visuals for that are not appealing. They are mostly symbols and text. Some areas actually show a nice background, which helps your kingdom come alive, but mostly you will look at text and symbols. Spacebase DF-9 had a similar system, which is really not appealing.\n\nLevels: The levels are mostly tiny arenas or tunnel-like maps where you have to fight the Cadence. Combined with the shallow combat, this will rapidly feel like heavy repetition. No map is unique, nor interesting. Its always about search and destroy. In some events, you have to defend a castle and protect your breeders. There, you will fight in their castles. Man, those castles feel so dead, I would rather just jump down the castle tower. Everything is grey, lifeless, looks like a maze. Where are those libraries, dining rooms, stables, whatever? May be they are there and I just did not see them, but especially the castle maps do not look appealing. Depressing, to be honest.\n\nDeath: Permadeath is great. That makes every decision important. But with all those deaths, with all this loss, there should be a place to worship your most important resource. At a certain point, I stopped caring about what color the heroes wear, wether they are male or female, which banner they carry. At a certain point, it was all about stats. They are a resource and that made me feel pretty lonely. No bonding to any fictional character. No caring for any hero. No favorite. I know that this not really avoidable, but there should be a way to truly honor and remember my heroes. Make them come alive for the short duration they will be with you.\n\nThe Chalice, the voices: The voice acting is pretty good. I like it, but it wears off just too fast. The two talkers start to repeat themselves early and that is counter-immersive. Also: Since they are no persons, but a massive chalice, I felt pretty alone in the game. I could not bond with them, because they had no visuals I could stick to, no interaction. Nothing.\n\nIn sum, it may sound a little drastic to some, but Massive Chalice was only entertaining for a short duration of time. The rest was depressing. It felt shallow, trivial and lonely so many times in my short duration of game  time. With no avatar, no continuing visible NPCs, no bonding with your brood, no life in the castle on the map, I felt like I entered a world of nothingness. Cold lonely nothingness. With two voices in my head, that kept entertaining each other like a dark circus show, somewhere in a lifeless void, doing the same old trick over and over and over again.\n\nI am sorry, but ~20€ or whatever the price may be now is way too much money for this game.  I can not recommend buying it unless you enjoy mind numbness, not caring for your party/characters, hollow design, 7 different enemies throughout the whole game and ... so ... on.","May 22, 2015","false","6.7"," 582 of 713 people (82%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","82","582","713","14","12"

This feels more like the start of an Early Access game rather than the end of it. Edited for clarification, and typos. It's not that this is a bad game per se, so much as there are better games at the same price point.\n\nI'll keep this short. I typically play on easy for those of you who actually care.\n\nPro: The Generation concept is neat.\n\nNeutral: Apparently, if you make it past Year 150 'Advanced' enemies make the game more fun. This was not my experience, but if you like watching your heroes suffer increasingly horrible odds to placate a giant talking goblet, more power to you.\n\nCon: Due to the gameplay, if you don't get the baby train rolling immediately, you lose. Between age, 'traits' (Infertile), and combat, time is a far greater threat than the Cadence could ever hope to be.\n\nCon: You can breed, and you can fight. That's it. Despite the simplicity, Double Fine somehow managed to make the combat both incredibly boring and frustrating. Try not to get attached to your people.\n\nCon: Startling lack of endgame content. You've seen everything Massive Chalice has to offer by year 150 or so. The enemies have different varitions, there are hybrid classes (which mix/combine class skills and armor appearance).","June 16, 2015","false","28.5"," 553 of 689 people (80%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","80","553","689","91","17"

There's barely any strategy involved and the game is shallow beyond any words.\n\nBreed, fight, build a building, wait, breed, fight, wait, breed, fight, wait, breed, fight, wait and so on and so forth. Where's the fun in that?\n\nThe story is barely covered, the characters do not have any backgrounds or personalities and they die like flies anyway. There is no fun to be had here at all.\n\nI think the game is either unfinished and rushed just like DF9 or at least has a lot of wasted potential and bad design choices.\n\nMaybe they should've focused on building aspect more or maybe they should've focused on characters so each one was unique and interesting. Either way - its boring and no amount of love towards Double Fine and Tim Schafer can fix that.\n\nAlso -50% in the first 3 weeks since the release is a pretty desperate move.

A full campaign took me a little under 22 hours to finish. There's too much I can complain about, so I've reduced this review to major grievances.\n\nGameplay can get boring real quick. Prepare to fight in the same maps over and over again. With 3 classes (plus 6 breedable hybrids that have minor tweaks) there is not a lot of variety. I wish there was more to do in the game. I wish you could be more proactive in fighting the Cadence, in some way taking the fight to them. Staring at a timeline waiting for the Cadence to attack is a very dull experience. The random events in-between attacks do more harm than good. I constantly lost buildings, heroes, and gained negative traits. Each time the timeline stopped for a random event I dreaded it. There's practically no story, no lore. 300 years of defending against an enemy and I knew nothing about them. I was hoping that the ending would explain or at least give some insight into the Cadence, but of course it didn't. The ending is very short, vague, and feels like a cliffhanger.","June 13, 2015","false","21.6"," 228 of 278 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","228","278","3","3"

The defense force consists of heroes, which battle in short, turn-based skirmishes against invading forces. Heroes live for 70 years on average, but the player has to defend the land for 300 years. Therefore the player has to marry off heroes so that they produce children, which get some of their genes and personality traits from their parents. This way, the player attempts to breed heroes of good stock, so that future generations are better able to defend the land against the invaders who get stronger all the time. Sometimes a hero may leave behind his weapon upon death, which then becomes a family relic, that gains better properties over time when it is used in combat.\n\nWhile the game has some original ideas and can be fun to play, it also has some very noticable flaws. What irks me the most is the lack of control that the player has over important parts of the game. Even on "Normal" mode, the game is really hard. Being hard is not a negative by itself, but Massive Chalice is hard because of randomness that is beyond the player's range of influence.\n\nThe most prevalent example of the game's randomness are the events that occur regularly. An event is a story moment in which the player has to make one or more choices, picking from several textual options presented. Some of these choices lead to slightly beneficial results, some of them lead to very bad results. But what result you get is completely random! There is no way to influence the outcome. You pick and hope for the best. A hero gets a positive trait, or a negative one, or your best hero might die, or you might lose a relic, or you might lose part of your land to corruption (and once you go down that road, you are on the losing track).\n\nYou also have relatively little influence over what genes the heroes get. Yes, they are likely to get some genes from their parents, but these might be good or bad, and they might get new genes that their gene pool did not contain before. Since parents only get a few children, it is not uncommon for a family of good stock, which you carefully bred, weeding out all the bad offspring by sending them into battle or to the Sagewright, to get wasted in one generation because the offspring gets inferior random genes or there is no more good partner available. There is almost nothing that the player can do to protect a family against that. Basically, the only thing that may help is calling forth new heroes, which takes about 5 years of research, and produces 5 new heroes with random attributes. Usually all of them are crap -- Infertile, Sickly, Clumsy, Nervous wrecks. Again, complete randomness.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of the combat. The enemies are relatively weak for the first half of the game, but after the halfway point they ramp up in difficulty in big strides. And then the combat rolls are really starting to get on your nerves, as a hero that gets attacked might evade the attack, or might lose one or two hitpoints, or lose all of his hitpoints in one go. There seems to be very little in between.\n\nThe game has been compared to XCOM, and it definitely has a lot of similarities. But XCOM offers the player many more ways to mitigate the random effects of the game, both in strategic decisions and tactical approach.\n\nMaking the player suffer badly from the whims of random events is a serious design flaw for any strategy game. I therefore cannot recommend Massive Chalice. I have had some fun with it, but I am always interested in seeing what Double Fine comes up with, and got the game at a big discount. It may be worth a couple of dollars or euros to you, but do not get it at full price.","September 11, 2015","false","49.8"," 202 of 247 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","202","247","3","0"

This creates some interesting strategy: keep your best warrior fighting, turn her into a regent so that her children get her warrior genes, or retire her to a Standard so that all children get the benefit of her experience?  I've never had a game before where I've had to worry about where my next warriors come from when my current ones die of old age.  A veteran and skilled player of many strategy games, I got my butt handed to me my first game just because it requires such a new way of thinking.  Brilliant.\n\nThen it stops.  After about 100 years, it all becomes repetitive.  Each generation plays the same as the last.  Each choice is decided by exactly the same parameters as the one a generation before.   The enemies are the exact same, just with more health and attack power (you deal more damage and have more health, so it comes out the exact same).  You just do the same thing over and over again, and win. I didn't have to adapt my tactics once in the last 200 years of the game, which is a shame considering how fun the first 100 years were.  And in those last 200 years, there are over 20 battles of the same thing, again and again.\n\nI still enjoyed the last 200 years, but by the time I had beaten the game, I was done with it.  Tragic, really, because the game had so much promise.","August 2, 2015","true","21.3"," 148 of 174 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","148","174","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawly/recommended/246110/","crawly","The All Business Guinea Pig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawly/","70 products in account","Read the other reviews for in depth content of this game, I might not get too in depth about mechanics and such, I'm just gonna blabber for a bit.\n\nI personally enjoyed this game and have played through it multiple times. It starts out as interesting considering it's initial concept involving heroes and trying to create and maintain bloodlines with good genes that can carry on to future generations, while hoping the bad ones don't... While it's true that heroes are bound to die, whether from time or battle, and thus you can't get "too attached" to them, you still can have favorites and favorite bloodlines. I've noticed a bunch of reviews whining about not being able to keep the same hero forever, but that's what happens over 300 years. People die. I always liked the system and felt it was pretty neat that my favorite heroes can live on in their kin with their genes and house name.\n\nMake your favorites advance in level through battle, do what it takes to keep them alive for multiple battles, then make them a regent before they're too old to make heroic babies that have potential to be your new favorite! It's not hard to understand. Hell, if they kill enough cadence and get enough xp, their weapon becomes a relic that can be passed down to others in their bloodline. Cool.\n\nI'd recommend playing this game on easy the first time around to get the swing of things, then try it on hard (if you feel confident about things), then try it on hard with IRON mode enabled (which just means you only get one save that's overwritten after each action you take)... I also played it on Brutal difficulty with IRON mode and I guess you could do that too, I just hope you don't start out that way.\n\nThe different difficulties are there so that once you pick up on the game and figure things out, you can apply the strategies you've learned from a previous playthrough and make sure you don't repeat your mistakes, while having a greater challenge to keep things fun...\n\nThe game is replayable, at least in my opinion. The combat system isn't the most exciting, and that's what makes it tough to want to play again, so I wouldn't recommend sitting down and marathoning it as if you had to beat it as soon as possible. Just take it easy.\n\nThink about your choices carefully and decide what would be the best course of action and things like that, and if you mess up, then load a save and learn from it (unless you're playing IRON mode, in which case try your best to not ♥♥♥♥ things up anymore). At first, I played for hours, but for my following playthroughs I played for maybe 30 minutes to an hour or two a day and got plenty of enjoyment out of it. I now currently have 100+ hours and I haven't played it in a while but I noticed it was on sale for only $7.99 right now and thought I'd write a quick review. It kinda makes me wanna play it again actually, and I think I might.\n\nLong story short, it's a pretty good game, though not without its faults, I'll admit. I do recommend it though, especially since it's on sale for less than half price... Give it a shot.\n\nThis was my first review and I don't think I did a good job, but either way, I recommend this game.","September 4, 2015","true","108.6"," 112 of 132 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","112","132","4","0"

Yet.\nThe game clearly has huge potential, but overall lacks in content.\nThe turn based combat is rather fun. Not that many options, so sooner or later it will get repetetive, but unlockable skills help in that regard.\nOutside of combat, you are managing a very small group of lands, on which you can build one building, to improve the building times, hero training or just add keeps for your existing heroes to breed. As you pass years, not turns, your heroes will drop like flies. I personally don't like how fast that happens, making one generation of heroes fight from 1 to 4 times usually.\nWhen they die, they can leave a heirloom to improve other hero from thier house.\nThe game is about limited resource management (heroes) and combat proficiency (again, heroes).\nOutside of that simple mechanic (to not die out...) there is nothing else to do. If you do that, your heroes will eventually level up and get stronger.\nHe story wouldn't exist if not for the two "voices" of the Massive Chalice, that bring some falvour to the, otherwise lifeless world.\nEvents (text + choices) happen, to help with that. So far, I've seen mostly negative outcomes though.\n\nI would say the game would be quite awesome, if there was more lands available, more building types (3!?), more hero types, customization of houses and heroes... Maybe item crafting? The game is begging for those,\n\nThe game does provide a bit of fun, and while it certainly IS PLAYABLE and enjoyable (if for a short ammount of time), the potential for it is so, so much greater than what it currently is.\n\nSo, no. I do not recommend the game at this point.\nWait a little while, maybe they will improve the game in the places that it's lacking?\n\nIf the game was already finished and the price was half what it is now, I would recommend it.

The parts that could be cool are ruined with only one fight every 10 years and the lack of being able to keep heroes around or leveled up.  It is enterly based on getting good marriages.  However when they added the class mixing it became infinately harder to get (and keep) the classes you'd like to use in combat.  So things seem much more random than I would like for a game about strategic planning and setting up matches for marriage.  Then most the people have bad traits you don't want but guess what your limited number of people means that you get even less of a choice in the type of people you get.

Yes. You will get your money's worth after one playthrough because it simply takes that long to beat it.\n\nThe thing that kept me going was the simple fact that I liked wanting to mate the houses and see what type of combination would spawn from my nests.  Pushing the time to complete a research was also nice.\n\nNow for the bad part.  From year 1 day 1 until year 300, the enemies are all the same.  There are just a few types of enemies (7 in total) and then in the latter part of the game they are simply given more HP.  There's also no "boss" monster either... not even at the end.  The combat quickly felt tedious. At the end when I knew I was going to win no matter what, I skipped the last 2 combats and let my continent fall just so I can hurry it up.\n\nAlso you don't feel any connection to your heroes at all.  They are just as expendable as a lit match. Even if you get awesome ones, they may only end up in a few battles (maybe 5 at most).\n\nThe random events are totally RNG (but I feel as if it leans more on screwing you over than helping).  There's no hint or something to base any of your decisions on.  You pick one and it could end up badly or good.  Heck I've played games where at least there are "advisors" that give you the illusion of making the "correct" choice.  This is totally a close your eyes and pick.\n\nWhen I finally did beat the game, I decided to play a 2nd time.  However, again, I couldn't bring myself to continue after I saw the SAME MONSTER again doing the SAME thing but with lower HP this time around.\n\nI understand that there are a lot of games that re-skin their models, but there has to be more for a game that is focused around combat.  Comparing this game to XCOM is a complete slap in the face where they offered 10 different aliens (I just looked it up and it would be 11 if you count the zombie)  Not counting the reskin for the Mutons and floater and sectoids.

Imagine a crossover of a light dynasty-simulation, some light text-RPG, and a light turn-based tactical game. Yes, it's actually not very deep in any of it's components. And whilst the concept of mixing those is quite good (and the prime reason why I got this game), but it clearly has weak points.\nEffectively, the game comes down to managing your heroes and nation on a strategic view (not unlike managing your base in XCOM) and managing a crew of five heroes in a tactical turn-based battle, which is both affected by your strategical decisions and does affect your strategical situation.\n\nHowever, whilst the whole "breed your heroes to genetically engineer the next clan of super-warriors" is very interesting and the various mechanics like tutoring, personalities and inheritable 'relic' weapons definitely add onto that, the system still feels a tad flat when it comes to content. Most traits are just "+X of stat Y" (or, in negative form, the opposite). Personalities often are similar, albeit here we see some more interesting concepts, like boosts when sticking to the group, or opposed a buff when a hero is alone. But, across my entire gameplay, I felt like ignoring those traits was a good bet, given their actual impact was minimal compared to the additional movement it would have required to actually set up their situations. In the end it really came down to just breed "whoever is the most fertile and has the most positive traits" of the right class and then let RNG throw something useful at you. Across my entire game I tried to specifically create distinct classes (f.e. long-sight, high-dexteriy rangers and quick, extra-strength warriors) but somehow ended up with a wild mix of traits and 'Quick learner' on pretty much everyone. Which apparently was enough to beat the game with ease.\n\nBecause, yeah, it took some failed starts, but that was mostly because the game does a rather bad job at explaining things to you. So, effectively you play, mess up horribly, are forced to restart, repeat a few times, until you grasp the basics. And then the same problem as XCOM kicks in: Past a certain point, you are either already dead or so absurdly strong that the tactical battles become tedious and uneventful.\n\nWhich brings us to the second part of the game, the tactical battles.\nRudamentary movement system with an occasionally clunky UI and initially confusing controls. Likewise goes for the 'cover' system and the AI. At some point you get into it, and it's not bad in itself, but again, casual players would probably need a tad more help early on.\nA big problem, in my oppinion, is the complete lack of a time limit and the fact you start with free stealth scouts (think of Mimetic Skin of XCOM) from the start of the game. It's trivial to sneak around, wait until a single enemy wanders off, then alphastrike him down. Rinse and repeat, unless you mess up it's not uncommon to end missions without even taking damage. This only gets worse as the game progresses (as mentioned) and your characters become more and more versatile and accurate (because, really, the only times where you take relevant damage is either because you make a big missplay or all 3 90% attacks miss).\nShortly summarized, the game really needs some more balance tweaking, both in between little details like classes and weapons, as well as difficulty wise. Which is already on the list of the devs, according to the last info I read.\n\nAnd then there are a handful of bugs and weird design issues. F.e. hitting a group of Bulwarks with an acid vial of an alchemist. Bulwarks will form a layer of armor whenever they take damage, reducing all further damage in the same turn to 1. The problem is, that each hit bulwark will perform the 3-second 'IMA GROWING ARMORE!' animation SEQUENTIALLY. And then, once their turn starts, the armor will break, they take acid damage and the animation will PLAY AGAIN. There are other occasions where the game puts in dumb pauses (even within your own turn's movement) to point you at any kind of buff triggering or disappearing. Which definitely takes time and becomes annoying later in the game.\nAs well, there are a few skills with issues, f.e. Flarrow not actually triggering the blinding explosion, or not revealing the map (or sometimes neither of both).\nBut I'll assume that will be patched at some point.\n\n\nNow, would I recommend this game?\nNnnnnnot sure. I got 20 hours out of it, but I got to say that I doubt I'll play the game again. Simply because the only 'fun' laid in figuring how the shallow, obfuscated gameplay mechanics work. It was a real drag to play through the last couple decades of the game, simply because one fight was as simple and boring as the next, all further research was legitly pointless... you get the point.\nResult : 6/10\nIt's not bad, but it's not really good either, and despite heavy RNG it doesn't really feel replayable to me.\nI would really say this needs some more spice, in form of mutators or content, possibly steam workshop modding. Buying it won't feel like a complete waste, but for the price you can get better stuff elsewhere.","November 17, 2014","false","29.7"," 243 of 333 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","243","333","0","9"

Giving credit where it's due, Massive Chalice is a pretty ambitious game. It takes the best qualities of XCOM: the R&D aspect, the top-down tactical combat system, and that fun little dance on the knife's edge as you try to level up your favorite character while avoiding that permadeath. All those qualities and throw it in with elements of a fantasy kingdom simulator with the whole 'kingdom in peril by a mysterious corruption that taints the land' plotline and the system of marrying off your heroes to produce heirs to continue your war on this corruption. All those things are great. Also? The Cadence enemies? Pretty sick designs and it totally showcases the unnatural corruption feel of what the Cadence is all about.\n\nAll those things are what makes Massive Chalice a pretty interesting game to check out... But not for thirty dollars.\n\nThe eugenics system feels like it creates a funnel where eventually you want to marry off all your heroes together to create better heirs with the right traits and personality and the right stats. (Hard enough as it is to find the right hero with the right traits and personality to marry off at the right time, but that's another thing.) Eventually the relationships between your later-gen heroes become incestous as in order to preserve the genes you want, you'll have to start marrying off cousins togeher. Which is something wrong that I can't seem to wrap my head around.\n\nContinuing on the subject of the eugenics system, let's talk about the bloodline relics. I haven't found the right pattern to create a relic reliably yet, but it seems to come from either the number of enemies you kill and the number of missions you do. Either way, trying to build a relic is frustrating as the Cadence attacks are infrequent through one hero's lifetime. It basically creates a weapon based on the stats of the hero's weapon that you can level up with the heroes that come afterwards. In the period of time you can level the relic, you can pretty much research the next tier of weapons and it would generally surpass the relic.\n\nLast thing I want to talk about are the Cadence Pawns, I have already acknowledged that the Pawns are pretty sick looking but then there's their performance in combat. You see, each of the Pawns have a special ability. Cradles have the ability to spawn more pawns to throw at you; wrinklers can age your heroes with an attack; Lapses can effectively drain your HP... You get the picture. Now my problem with the Pawns are that they are one-trick ponies. They have their little special ability and then the rest of their movesets are routine for every one of them. It makes combat monotonous and repetitive after a while and that's just a bummer.\n\nTo recap. Cool and ambitious project, but it falls short of expectations. Nonetheless, it can't be called an XCOM clone because it does take a unique approach to the genre and I do hope that it can straighten itself out when it comes out of Early Access.","December 13, 2014","false","12.0"," 362 of 511 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","362","511","0","17"

One of the also well-known phenomenons with this company is that it abandons games after they're released (The Cave, Spacebase DF-9, some more, I think).\n\nNow, Massive Chalice is a pretty interesting concept -- it's a fun strategy game with turn-based "medieval XCom"-ish battles. You have to actually raise your heroes -- firstly, you'll have to "marry" two of your heroes, then (if everything would go okay) a child will be born, then he (or she) will come of age, and only after that you'll be able to recruit him/her.\n\nConcept is interesting, because children are able to inherit traits and personalities of their parents. If father is a raging alcoholic (-speed in battle) and mother is insightful (+intuition) it would be wiser to take their children to the researches, assigning them as sages, instead of taking them to battles in your vanguard.\n\nOn the strategic map you will build forts and assign regents (and choose their spouses) there, develop new weapons in your capital, intrude in your heroes' personal life from time to time by choosing a path which they should go. For example, one of your heroes find a hermit that wants to teach him to see the way of communicating with the corruption -- and it's your choice if he goes to live with the hermit for a few years, or stays with you.\n\nYour global mission is to win the war of 300 years. Your enemies are spawns of some sort of corruption that threatens to swallow the whole kingdod if not for your efforts.\n\nNow, this all sounds pretty fun, doesn't it? It actually does. And it actually is fun. The sad thing is, the game lacks content... and balance. Once you'll crack the code on how to beat the battles, the game would start to bore you. Your squad would be consisting of only one hero class (I won't spoil it to you, which one, but you'll get it yourself pretty fast). You would be equpping all of the heroes with the same items. You will be marrying your regents in the same manner, maxing only one parameter.\n\nYou will basically repeat the same action 10-15 times before you beat the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- XCom was repetitive too, especially before the Enemy Within update. But developers were working with balance, so people won't be recruiting exclusively snipers with ghost armor, for example. Alas, I have my doubts that Massive Chalice would get any updates any time soon.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe game is pretty good overall, it's definitely worth buying... on a sale. Paying $5-10 for this title is okay, game's definitely worth it. If it'd be updated with balance changes, new enemies, new items and new building (which I strongly doubt), it might be worth even more.\n\nRight now, I'd advise you to wait for the game to go on 50-75% sale and buy it. Then complete it one time on Normal difficulty with Iron Man option on (which implies that you won't have any saves, except for when you quit the game), and move on to the next game.\n\nRating: 6.8 out of 10.0","June 21, 2015","true","11.3"," 263 of 378 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","263","378","11","10"

Without zone-of-control, cover, flanking, defending, or any other take on actions or positioning gameplay, it quickly boils down into "what dudes are stronger". Massive Chalice fails to deliver on a compelling tactical combat experience for any level of gamer who wants to engage with this (which is what you spend most of your time doing).\n\n* Enemy design follows a similar pattern. Instead of requiring unique tactics or approaches to beating, enemies (such as the one that drains XP, or ones that suicide when either killed or when they get into melee) are one-trick ponies whose tricks don't make the game richer. Enemies combine easy-to-solve gameplay with frustrating risk/reward structures.\n\n* Classes unfold into few customization options, with little way to distinguish characters and builds. While I think this is true of some other games as well, many other tactical battle games excel at this aspect, using a "what can I make work" model to provide gameplay variety. This may be a current content limitation though as well (pre-release only, maybe?)\n\nI Kickstarted and wanted to love Massive Chalice, but I feel the game misses on delivering what I want - a Fantasy Tactics game with interesting army/kingdom management to tie it all together. I'm pretty forgiving of minor issues in games, but I feel these ones are deal-breakers for what the game promises to be.\n\n","January 12, 2015","false","1.3"," 197 of 278 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","197","278","2","7"

The other 10% are a poorly thought out "management" section that lets you fiddle with some things that don't matter(at best you get a 10% increase in something if you manage it well by placing keeps around the map), a marriage system that could be interesting if it had any other effect than just producing new generic heroes derived from 2 heroes you match up, and a barebones research system that gives you advantages that are, at best, boring.\n\nI couldn't force myself to play the game any longer than I did, since I have zero hope that it will change or get better.

The family building, the research, the combat, the events - all tie up to create an absolutely chaotic and unfair experience, but a wonderfully creative one too. Never had I felt so tense in a strategy game, fearing that the difficulty might catch up to the progress of my families, or that a cataclysmic event might destroy one of the bloodlines I careful crafted. Unfair in a sense, yes, but those are the rules of the game and they create a really cohesive experience. Again, “Mazoge”.\nThe randomness of it all also means, sometimes, all goes so well, the game turns mundane - until the next crisis, “hopefully”, if I may say so.\nI really, really like this game. But in all fairness, it asks a lot from the player : to play for 15 hours a couple of 'normal' games to grasp the rules ; to accept the randomness of what might happen to all your work thanks to odds turned against you ; to cope with the same limited recordings of the androgynous chalice...\nHere is hoping that when watching at that Chalice, you might consider it half-full as well!\n","September 20, 2015","true","18.4"," 73 of 93 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","73","93","5","4"

It's an interesting effort to take some of the core gameplay from the X-com genre, and create a sort of mmo browser styled semi-casual experience. After being involved in the Beta, and seeing features I had hoped to see (that were more "bad ♥♥♥/cool/unique") in the final release being dropped from development may have soured me to the game. It is not a, bad game, but I don't know if I'd say that the final product remained competative with what is out there. The fantasy setting, as well as the bloodlines, are novel, and somewhat engaging features that can still draw empathy and involvement from the player's attachment to fictional character. But over time the somewhat limited number of random events, and the limitations on research optimization, have drained my interest in replaying the game. I will say, that the User Interface is now much more informative and the tutorial is perfectly clear. If there was an option to (MAYBE) recommend a game, instead of Yes/No, I would probably select it. However, as the development for the game is over, and DF won't be making any further tweaks, or possibly, patches for some time, I wouldn't want to recommend this game.

My greatest dissapointment comes from my expectations of the game being more akin to an Ogre Battle title with long term bloodlines.  What was delivered was a very blatant X-COM  clone changing the setting, and switching the time scale to years.  Becase of the small squad size, you would think you would get invested in the development of individual heroes. I found I tried to, but by the time I did, I had moved on to the next generation.  Fights only seem to happen every 4-8 years roughly,  heroes are viable from say ages 15-60, An active hero that you don't send to do another job might last 8 fights before dying of old age.\nI only saw 3 types of heroes, if there are more they were either difficult or unclear on how to unlock them.  Caberjacks, Alchemists, and Hunters.\nThe game did not seem very well balanced between the classes.  Caberjacks are strong all around in offence and defense.\nHunters hit a bit weaker, and can't take a hit, but at least have ranged attacks.  they seemed a bit weaker than the cabers, but on facing the exploding enemies, I saw a clear reason for using them.\nAlchemists have bombs, but they bombs tend to be embarrasingly inaccurate, short ranged, and mediocre in damage, not to mention limited in supply.  When they run out the have a mediocre melee attack, but no durablity to speak of.\nGame dynamics seemed like a stripped down Xcom engine.  They have similar controls, but with less classes, and lack of cover mechanics (best I could tell anyway) I found myself thinking If I get in the mood for this kind of game, I'll just fire up X-Com again, and play the better game.\n\nSo in short, not a bad game, but an inferior X-Com clone.","November 13, 2014","false","1.9"," 204 of 301 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","204","301","0","4"

I believe those two adjectives best describe this game. Which is really sad, since it has a lot of charming elements, but even with all that charm, it can't overcome its pacing and lack of content.\n\nMassive Chalice is made up of two parts. The combat is turn base squad game, where you move your squad of 5 (usually) through a map in order to kill everything. The other part is a meta game where you build structure, research, arrange marriages, and deal with random text adventure events.  Sadly, both these parts end up feeling slow and shallow.\n\nCombat feels dull due to the fact that every mission's objective is nothing more than to kill all the enemies on the map.  This is fun the first few times, but it quickly loses it charm, and ends up feeling like a loose collection of skirmish maps stringed together.\n\nThe meta game on the other hand feels unbearably slow.  The premise of the game is that you have to hold out for 300 years in order to charge up a super weapon to win. And at first I found this interesting, but that quickly changed, and in the end, I felt like I was on a super long defend the npc while he opens a door really, really slowly mission.\n\nIn the end, this game made me sad.

Spend time researching things you don't need and you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked on harder levels.\n\nYou need to have enough bloodlines, enough technology (weapons and items), hopefully pass down enough relics, have enough vanguard experience to do well. Mechanically, it is a really interesting game.\n\nIt took me some time to really get and love this game, which I guess is its biggest flaw. At first I thought it was a tad easy mid-game and there were not many options and hunters/alchemists were the best way to go. Suffice to say I was wrong and the late game really shines: Interesting valid tactical skills, difficult battles, difficult strategic decisions that have you second guessing yourself.\n\nForward to later, after rebooting the game several times running on hard, all the classes are interesting, with interesting skills. Caberjacks are by no means useless. As a crowd control class, they really shine later in the game.\n\nTo charge that the game has no depth because it has no overwatch, or cover doesn't cut it. It is different, and as a big lover of tactical games like XCOM and Invisible Inc, I will state that this game is good, just different. Another game to compare this to is King of Dragon Pass (the random events at least), which adds another unusual flavour to the game.\n\nIn summary, I guess the hatred for this game is because of expectations. It doesn't feel like a Double Fine game at all.\n\nThere is not much story or exposition, but as a strategic/tactical hybrid, this game is different, and a really good different: I've been enjoying it quite a bit.","June 7, 2015","true","84.8"," 110 of 158 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","110","158","0","0"

Only people of special bloodlines can fight the cadence. These bloodlines come in the form of houses, each with their own name, banner, motto and castle name. Houses are completely cosmetic and at the start of the game you are able to choose five to be your vanguard at the start. It’s a nice little aesthetical feature that tries to make you care about your characters. The problem is it doesn’t work, because you progress through the game in years, passing ten years is nothing meaning that your characters die often of old age. In fact characters die so much that unlike a game like X-Com where you really care when someone dies because you have spent a lot of time investing in their abilities and appearance. In Massive chalice, the games time progression and lack of character customization means that you become numb to characters. It was to the point that I did not care to learn their names and rather solely based their usefulness on their age, level and traits.\n\nPermadeath by its nature is only an impacting mechanic if you care about the death. Massive Chalice’s core design almost forces you not to care about your units. Because time passes so quickly it means that characters never really level up to a significant point so they never become irreplaceable. In fact the game design makes units become as meaningful as pawns on a chess board. They are very useful but highly expendable and you don’t put much stock in them as you do the other pieces.\n\nRuling your nation is very simplistic and keeps the focuses on making sure you have enough babies being born to provide soldiers in the coming years. It’s a case of building castles to house bloodlines and produce children, building the occasional building that helps with research or training and of course researching new technology. Researching tech allows you to unlock new weapons, items and armor, it’s also where you can recruit a batch of heroes if you’re running low on troops and it’s the tab where you build the few buildings available. There isn’t much in terms of choice when it comes to new weapons and armor, there’s a couple of interesting items that you can research once a certain number of enemies have been defeated. These items tend to share a trait that relate to the monsters it requires such as the boneshell armor that covers your soldier in a protective shell after one hit like the Bulwark monster.\n\nThe UI in the overworld parts of the game looks and responds like a touch screen port. The UI is overly large, bulky and provides no feedback upon clicking it. It’s almost as if the overworld UI design was made with the thought of a mobile release in mind, and to be honest this wouldn’t be very surprising. It does however leave a negative impact on the game, it stands out as not being the correct UI for a PC game, the size of the menus is a perfect size for a touch screen, not for a 2080p monitor with a mouse a keyboard.\n\nMassive Chalices combat is modeled from similar games like X-Com. The game does not really do anything unique or particularly innovative with combat but it’s a solid tried and tested system that works well. There is a variety of factors in battle you must think about which usually comes from the combination of monster mechanics and the variety of armor and weapon effects. Sadly there is not a large amount of variety in enemies. Each enemy has a unique mechanic tied to it such as wrinklers who will add age onto a character if they successfully hit or lapses who if they hit you drain you of XP which can lower your level mid battle which will cause you to lose abilities. The problem with the enemies rears its head later on in the game when you’re just facing the same enemies over and over and the game just throws ever increasing numbers of them at you to try and make battles difficult.\n\nThe game is just a characterless husk, it works sufficiently well in terms of stability but gives no immersive experience. Double fine tries to put in charm with the voice acting of the magical chalice but it fails to charm and instead only serves to annoy and make you cringe. Massive Chalice is light on its content which was surprising when you span three hundred years and it simply does not stand up to games like X-Com. It has promising ideas that were not explored properly which are also spoilt by conservative combat design and a garish aesthetic.  It is certainly not something I would play again and people looking for a X-Com like experience from this should instead just go play X-Com. It’s a sad, deflated disappointment from Double Fine, who have once again turned a promising idea into mind-numbing drudgery.\n\n","July 17, 2015","false","6.2"," 89 of 127 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","89","127","2","1"

Reading over articles about the latest FPS will invariably find a complaint about how simplified, decision-less games are becoming - Massive Chalice is an excellent lesson in why. Design decisions that are not fun in MC:\n\nPoor early game decisions have no feedback mechanism besides the catastrophic failure of a game. Contrast with Civilization, or Invisible Ink - did the war go disasterously? Load a save from an hour ago, and maintain peace; or attack another city; or bide your time, or or or. Did you get caught? No prob - rewind to the previous turn. In MC, once you're in a failure state, you've gotten there through feedback loops and local failure may be avoidable, total failure is inescapable.\nJazzing on that point, individual units are incredibly fragile and disposable - you really get a feel for mortality and sacrifice and so on. Great, right? Except that units must be shepherded (you set up families, breed them, ensure fertility, select for attributes, train them, equip them...) which is great at creating investment and tension... but then you fight three battles, tops, before any hero dies of old age. It is a great concept, but in execution, it is an exercise in frustration.\nBecause everything is random. Congrats, you've got a good hero who is the right class, right age, with the right stats, and now you're breeding him. Except you failed on the random rolls, so your next generation of heroes have lousy stats and traits.\nAND tying it all together, you have to retire a hero to a special structure that you have to build that will infuse new units with their starting XP. That is, if you fail to build and staff this building, you're going to have level 1 units every few battles against a progressively more difficult enemy. And of course, you want to take your strongest unit off the table because they'll provide the most benefit to the new units. He'll also confer his random traits that by now have rolled over to Unaccurate Teamkilling Jerk, by the way.\nFinally, if the game wasn't random and punishing enough, every so often events will pop up that properly model real life with a choice - there was an anti-war rally in front of your palace and two of your heroes, randomly selected (ha ha, the heck with you player and any decisions you'd like to be making!) accidentally killed someone and the public wants vengence. What do you do? Good news - no matter what you choose, there's the chance it will end well! or poorly. And it doesn't matter! Get a dipper bird to play the game instead of you!\n\nIn closing, everything about this game sounds brilliant on paper; but spare yourself the lunch money and buy yourself a pair of dice. At least those, if you want to select "easy," you can just weight.","June 24, 2015","false","10.8"," 59 of 81 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","59","81","2","3"

Very few of the mechanics are communicated at all, there's no narrative reason to be doing any of the things you're doing, and the two characters of the chalice talk for days without telling you anything of use. They aren't even being funny. (and I don't mean that their jokes aren't funny, I mean they aren't even telling jokes. They're clearly written as humor-based characters, except they don't ever deliver punchlines or clever wordplay)\n\nI could play more of it and give it a better chance, but honestly the gameplay is straight-forward. There's some vague threat of evil encroaching on your land and you have to fight random battles with it every now and then. The setup is much like XCOM, so the progression is clearly going to just be that. But XCOM offers a variety of strategies and tactics that let you approach situations in different ways, and the enemies are thoughtful and interesting. Here, your choice seems to be "do damage up close" or "do damage from afar" and there are no advantages to either except that some enemies explode if you're too close to them. The enemies are equally simple with no interesting mechanics. My characters seem to have special skills, but I have no reason to use any of them since the enemies are so easy.\n\nThe character lineage system that sold me on this game boils down to having to pick two arbitrary people to marry off to make babies every time you build a keep. You can choose people with slightly different stats and they'll combine when they have a kid, but the stats aren't different enough to make that interesting, and the characters are faceless avatars that you have no reason to care about at all. And worse yet, you can't even develop any of them, because you'll get maybe one battle out of them before they get old and need to be forever retired into one of the keeps or other things you need to keep the kingdom running.\n\nAnd perhaps there are some interesting mechanics buried in here, but the chalice only ever talks about their memory of high school or that one time their friend did something funny. There's no introduction to what all is possible in this game. I might be missing something incredible, but far be it for the game to inform me of that.\n\nSave your money and your time, folks.

However, if you're looking for a simple game for cheap to get you INTO tactics games like XCOM and such, this might just be for you.\n\nI think I can say that I was severely disappointed... I'm enjoying myself yes, but I expected a whole lot more from it. I was expecting XCOM mixed with Crusader Kings 2 and Fire Emblem. But what I got was a very, very, lifeless, casual game. It's overall minimilistic look keeps me from being immersed in the world and differentiating the characters from one another, they all just form together into one blocky, ps1 grafix mess. The strategy is simplistic and I have no idea what they were thinking with the action point system. Usually your turn is subject to move-move, move-attack, attack-move. But this game says move-move-attack, move-attack, or attack. Which I guess could be tactical, but it doesn't play out that way. The rules are in favor of the candensce... candesce... condesce??? I don't know big bad evil copy pasties.\n\nI wanted a game where I could feel emotionally connected to my units, build up their heritage and watch them grow, but all I saw in them after couple hours were stats with faces attached. I barely cared when my characters died because one would always replace them instantaneusly. This could have been easily avoided had the game's timeline been shortened to let you get more in tune with the characters, and i don't know... CUSTOMIZATION??? I was so disappointed I couldn't customize the houses and sigils as well as name the characters. I know it was a kickstarter reward, but regardless, it's almost inexcusable to PURPOSEFULLY hinder your game to give more insentive for your backers... Also the chalice is annoying. At first it was quirky and interesting, but then the repeated lines made me irritated and kinda droning along.\n\nOverall... if your a tactical strategy fan who wants a challenge focusing on strategy, pick up Crusader Kings 2, especially XCOM if you haven't. But if you haven't played turn based strategies, you want something simple and easy to pick up with a bit of difficulty, for the price it isn't really bad. A rather solid entry level game.

Classes seem interesting as far as I got to know them. As far as I could see the maps look a bit repetitive but well, all in all this part is Ok.\n\n* Everything else is definitely shallow and lacks depth. The main map is nice looking but as someone else said you really spend time staring at the idle map. Heroes come and go, but somehow the UI and the gameplay doesn't really give you time to get to know them and they are just "troopers" to use in the end.\n\n* Bloodline thingy is concept-wise very interesting, but it's also victim of the lack of depth of the UI and interaction, so somehow it feels quite hard to follow and exploit nicely.\n\nA massive work of improvement on the main map and UI could make a really cool game out of this, but till then, i can't really recommend it. Moreover if I dare clicking on the screen after launching it and before the main menu appears, it always crashes.

I see a lot of people writing bad reviews. I spent a lot of time playing this game, and clearly it is not yet finished. HOWEVER to tell you "this game is bad" is stupid. Lemme break down what you can expect from this game.\n\n1. You will get a kingdom.\nyou will have to decide what things you want, and how you want to play the game. do you want to focus on hunters? or maybe have a few Caberjacks backed up by Alchemists. its all up to you. all of your upgrades and buildings will need to be well timed.\n\n2. You will get an army.\nThough you may only take 5 units into battle, you will have a TON of other people to manage. in later game each house begins getting rediculously large. you will have to choose which people are worth being in the group of 5 and which arent. you will have to retire your heroes and have them train your next generation, or let them fight untill they die. Basically you get to be George R.R. Martin and this is your world, and these are your characters.\n\n3. You (can) get a story.\nNOW some people might dispute this. i disagree. The story you get IN the game is pretty much constricted to the very beginning and the very end. however, that is not to say you cant make up your own ledgends. a 16 year old girl took up an heirloom weapon went to battle, and defeated every last cadence on the feild... she ended up retireing at the age of 24 in order to bring up the next generation. NONE of that had to do with the chalice, but you can make some very interesting stories out of this game, if you want to.\n\n4. You will be entertained. I spent 16 hours or so in this game, 16 hours and its not even a finished game yet. there are still things being added, bugs being fixed, new bloodline effects being put in place. so to anyone who is thinking about buying it i suggest you keep an open mind, because this game will only get better.","December 10, 2014","true","16.3"," 242 of 402 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","242","402","5","5"

The nation building is very limited (3 different types of buildings), no politics, no managing your citizens (like happyness etc.) and absolutely no visible changes to your kingdom.

But the ideas didn't produce a worthy end result. Do not buy this game if you want or expect an interesting strategical or tactical challenge. The options you have are extremely reduced, flat and boring. (3 classes, extremely simple or no skill choices, extremely bland upgrades etc.) The game can be difficult, but mostly because you have so few factors you can influence or strategy routes you can take, which is the BAD kind of difficult.\n\nThe biggest atrocity within this product is the straight, shortsighted copy of the (bad) 'activation' mechanic of XCOM: Enemy Unknown as soon as Line of Sight is established. The battles are supposed to feel like a wave of demons attacking one of your provinces. In a blatant failure of design, enemies are just standing around, akin to braindead animals standing around in a forest. (If you use the close combat class a lot, it's often impossible to avoid activating multiple groups at the same time, just by approaching an enemy, while the ranged class allows you to easily snipe them from afar).\n\nThe one interesting aspect of the game, the management of families, is still interesting, but as far as I know can be exploited as soon as you understand how the system works.\n\nI was simple not able to stick around for later stages of the game.

The only personality it has so far comes from the dialogue from the Chalice which is often drowned out by obnoxious UI noises.\n\nMassive Chalice has an incredible amount of potential but it just feels out of reach at the moment and given Double Fines' recent history, I'm not holding my breath to see it realised.","November 14, 2014","false","4.6"," 65 of 106 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","65","106","0","0"

That is a lot like XCOM.\n\nYou are charged with the task of removing “the cadence” from the world which for most intents and purposes is a enemy force filled with multiple types of creatures. This task is given to you by the aforementioned Chalice. The cadence threatens the world and the Chalice can stop it.\n\nThe crux of the game runs on a timeline. With random events that take place as you go. You control territories in which you build things such as Keeps, Sageright Guilds and Crucibles. Each with their own purpose. Death is permanent for your party members. This aspect of the game differs from XCOM in that characters are created from assigning a regent and a partner to a keep for the purposes of siring an heir.\n\nThere are only 3 main classes to begin with; CaberJack, the tank like melee character. The Hunter, ranged scout type and the Alchemist, a mid range AoE type of character. Through having children other types of classes can be made making a total of nine such as the ShadowJack, Enforcer, and Trickshot.\n\nAs the timeline moves along, you must select a Vanguard to send into battle when the cadence attacks. They may attack in any region including the keeps you have constructed which can lead to difficult battles as your Vangaurd usually spawns on the opposite sides of the map of the regent. Making your timely selection to creating a good heir useless. The other thing is through worrying about genealogy is that people die from old age in your vanguard and as well as regents. This is just another added affect that causes stress.\n\nYou can assign people to the sageright guild to increase research rates at the cost of never having them enter battle again. Research takes place as a passive affair. This is also an extreme similarity to XCOM in which you are developing armor and new weapons alongside constructing buildings in different territories. All while dealing with trying to gain XP for your vanguard members and trying to keep the cadence at bay as the timeline moves along.\n\nTHE GIST\nAll of this is fine, its starts off pretty simple, easy to grasp. But its slow and the random progression makes it needlessly frustrating. While you can eventually make up to 9 classes, the initial 3 make it very shallow. Not to mention their tech tress feel rather limited.\n\nIt all feels very been there and done that with nothing really super unique to offer and grab your attention. The music is good during the battles, the voice acting of the chalice often giving advice and narration to the events unfolding are well done. However, it just doesn't have the legs to hold any non extreme turn based strategy players attention.","April 10","false","4.2"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NarwhalRider/recommended/246110/","NarwhalRider","NarwhalRider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NarwhalRider/","165 products in account","I really enjoyed this game. If you like turn based strategy, managing bloodlines and fighting against impossible odds, you'll enjoy it too.\n\nThe Positives:\n\n- Fun strategic combat with 3 main troop types, each with 2 subtypes. 9 classes in all, though you can only bring 5 with you for each battle.\n- Truly epic feel. Your kingdom must last for 300 years. That's 300 years of generation after generation of warriors fighting for you, having children, dying, and having those children fight for you.\n- Marry heroes to each other to produce strong bloodlines. You'll need generations of heroes to survive the cadence. There's even an option for same sex marriages. Just adopt kids to keep the bloodline going.\n- Random events and region bonuses make every playthrough feel different. I'd advise saving a lot, since random events can really hurt your kingdom.\n- Research options allow you to choose what is most important to you, and allow a level of customization (My advice, research Veil armor asap, so useful for archers)\n- So many houses and sigils to choose from. (I've spent wayyy too long just choosing my starting 5 houses)\n- Combat goes from tough, to kinda easy, to tough again, to "you gotta be kidding me" in the final battle. If you make it into the last 100 years, you'll notice the monsters are all tougher, with new tricks.\n- Lost of interesting ideas in this game, the developers definitely didn't want the stereotypical fantasy setting.\n\nSome negatives:\n\n- Chalice voices can get old fast, though they can be funny too.\n- Challenge level of fights can be uneven. Fights get easier once you get some research done and have enough fighters. Then challenge ramps back up round years 150-200, as enemies gain hp, damage, and extra abilitles.\n- Graphics are not everyone's cup of tea. Male and female models are often hard to tell apart. I enjoy the asthetic mostly, but some of you may not. If you're not sure, watch a let's play. (I liked the monster design and many of the design choices, but can understand why some people don't)\n- Some mechanics of the game are not explained well, and you are left to figure some tings out on your own. For example, relic weaopons. If your hero gets a nickname during battle, his weapon will turn into a powerful relic when they die, if they are using the basic form of the weapon (not the researched form, like bone bow or knockback caber) Even if the hero fights with a modified weapon, as long as they DIE with a normal weapon equipped, and have gottten a nickname, they will pass down a relic within their bloodline.\n- Some features, like inter family conflict, seem like they were only partially implemented. Hoping for some DLC at some point to add a few more things to an already fun game.\n\nThose things aside, this game is well worth the money (and even more worth it on sale.) If you're in doubt, watch a let's play to get a feel for the game, then give it a try. You may find yourself getting attached to the families, and yelling at the screen when the Cadence swallows up one of your states. I'll probably do a strategy guide for the game at some point, after I play through a few of the games I got for the Steam sale. Maybe that will help out some of the people having a hard time beating the game.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a strategic game with a fresh take on the genre,  and like the idea of arranging marriages, this is the game for you","June 23, 2015","true","61.2"," 50 of 81 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","50","81","2","0"

For example, the family system; being able to marry off heroes from differing families to create different classes and even more powerful heroes makes for an interesting time... be careful though, you might end up with a single bloodline of only Hunters if you're not careful. It's also pretty cool to watch the lives of your heroes from the day they are born, to the day they go to jail, to the day they die... be prepared, however, you're going to see a lot of birth and death in this game.To add on, beautiful graphics, great voice acting from the two advisors within the chalice itself and a hypnotic and somber soundtrack that really immerses you in this soon to be destroyed world. Then there is the badstuff... well, the bad thing, really.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq1jKGaTaWc\n\nThat being, the combat system. Combat in the game can pretty much boil down to a couple of different enemy types that if allowed to close in, will absolutely ravage your heroes. While this isn't a bad thing, the combat itself is just tedious... and fighting battles isn't half as interesting as what's going on during your forays on the Campaign Map. Truly, I'd be okay with just autoresolving the battles so I can delve further into the lives of my short-lived heroes rather than manually fight every single battle against the Cadence.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this game.

The leveling system from your class of 3 fighters (x2 ranged and one melee) is a two tiered 10 level system. Your fighters are sub-classes which are desginated by lineage.\n\nWhat's unique about the level system is you are not investing your time into a certain character but in a lineage/family. You marry your lineage off to another and make babies. These babies have good or bad traits which are then passed down from generation to generation. Your lineage determines your fighter class as well. You marry off one Caberjack to a Hunter and therefore you make a Shadowjack for the next 40-50 years.\n\nTime itself is sped up until an event occurs (research ending, lineage monarch dying, cadence presence etc etc).

On the surface it has a lot going on and seems like tons of fun.  Sadly, it only takes a few hours to realize how shallow the gameplay really is.  The breeding, training, and research all seem like good ideas but I can't really immerse in it too far after discovering that the only classes worth using are Hunters and Hunter-derivatives.\n\nThe meat of my complaint: they have virtually the same starting health and damage as the other two primary classes, can stealth their way across the map, and eliminate enemies from range with no limit to the number of attacks.  I'm sure the other two classes could be good with a lot of work and research, but why bother?  They fill no roll.  You can literally start breeding nothing but Hunters right out of the gate with zero regard for traits and stats and win every single fight hands down.\n\nIt really feels like a near miss.  The components are there for a solid game, but the core of it - the fighting - is horribly broken by design.  The worst part is Double Fine seems to be satisfied.

The game is lacking in several key areas, as explained below.\n\n1) No explanation of range for hunter weapons - you are left to guess whether your crossbow is in effective range. This should be stated upfront, in number of tiles.\n\n2) There is no point to utilizing any other class in combat besides hunter - enemies such as Wrinklers (melee enemy, they age your hero on any successful hit by 5 years), Ruptures (explode when killed) and Lapses (explode when killed, possibly stunning anything in range) make close combat units a gamble, at best.\n\n3) Mixing the three basic classes (caberjack, alchemist, hunter) does nothing of particular interest  (except for shuffling class skills and adding a few questionably useful new skills).\n\n4) AoE attacks don't function unless targeted at specific enemies (except for alchemist grenades). In other words, you can't utilize the majority of AoE attacks as indirect fire / artillery. They MUST be targeted at an enemy.\n\n5) Most 'heroes' that are recruited are typically stacked with negative attributes that make them useless in combat and useless for generating further hero bloodlines.\n\n6) You can use only 5 heroes in any given tactical combat, but the Cadence have typically 3-4 times more units. Regardless of what skills are used against them (for example, Taunt) they still maximize their effectiveness in terms of hitting multiple units. A Taunted unit should not be able to move to where it wishes and hit multiple units - if it is Taunted it should only be concerned with directly attacking the unit that Taunted it.\n\nAbout the only thing that was done correctly in this game was the music.\n\nIf you're looking for a turn-based strategy game I would recommend avoiding this, unless you're willing to deal with ridiculous odds, horrible random events that can destroy your heroes, and weapons that lack any sort of explanation regarding range and capability.\n\nI'd recommend picking this up on sale.

The marriage and breeding are great! But it doesnt matter how great your people are when battles happen very rarely and no xp is availible outside of them. So anybody you leveled from the last battle is either dead or about to die. So you put in some new blood hoping to earn xp, but the hordes of enemies with ridiculous attacks and abilities mow them down because they aren't leveled. Just about every enemy is downright overpowered, except the damn seeds. Which wouldnt be so bad except there are around 10-15 per map. One enemy makes you lose xp every time it attacks, one explodes when it dies and one can only take normal damage once a turn. Engaging in melee combat is downright laughable as at least 2 enemies explode when they die. It would be a great game if there were more battles with less enemies.","June 24, 2015","false","2.2"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Massive Chalice is massively disappointing. I backed this game on Kickstarter, figuring "it's Double Fine, how could they go wrong?" Well, lately they have a habit of not putting nearly as much love into their games as they used to. What I hoped for was a fantasy XCOM, which is pretty much what Massive Chalice tries to be. Where it fails is that it's so shallow in every aspect. The choices you make on the strategy map are uninteresting, and the combat in particular (which really needs to be the strongest part of a Turn-Based Strategy game) is watered-down to the point of tedium. No cover, no flanking, no range bonuses, no benefit to saving action points. Outside of skills, it's just a matter of getting to a square where you can attack the enemy and killing them before they kill you. Plus most of the enemy designs are not fun at all. An enemy that steals XP from your heroes when it hits? Not fun. An enemy that causes your permadeath heroes that you've invested a lot of time in to age faster and thereby randomly die of old age sooner? NOT FUN.\n\nOn most games I feel like I should put more time in before writing a review, but honestly the game is so shallow that I have a pretty good idea what to expect from an entire playthrough already, and so boring that I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to find out for sure. If you want a good TBS, do yourself a favor and play XCOM instead, or even Banner Saga.","June 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","25","42","0","0"

Its one distinguishing feature - the bloodline system - is kind of creepy (a eugenics program?) and, worse, not implemented well enough to be very interesting.\n\nBeyond that, the game lacks variety - the number of monster types and hero classes are both rather limited - and unintentionally highlights this fact by making an individual playthrough rather long. 80 years into your 300-year run you'll have seen all the enemies and all that will remain is 220 years of seeing them again with bigger numbers. The same tactics work basically from start to finish, and once you've figured them out battles are more chore than entertainment.\n\nIn short, just go play X-COM.","September 29, 2015","false","25.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Some people have said that Massive Chalice is extremely simplified and missing a lot of polish, but I cannot agree with this. Massive Chalice is filled with tons of really innovative and fun mechanics including the bloodlines. When you start the game you have the option in enable a “silly” mode witch adds funny things to the names, mottos, and battle cry of the different houses. These include hilarious stuff like: A motto “You only YOLO once” and tons of various things about the amazement of bacon. Though this feature is option I would highly suggest having it enabled just for the laughs. The combat boils down to a simplified turn base shell with a bit a variance with the difference hero classes. Even though I did start to get bored with the combat after a while, I still enjoyed playing Massive Chalice because of the different mechanics like the bloodlines, training, and researching. I have loved nearly every Double Fine game from past times and Massive Chalice is just another one to add to the list.

I'd say that its major flaw is unbalance, closely followed by a lack of options. However, the combat is fun and largely well-balanced, and the story and lore are well-written and frankly deserve to be explored a little more. Overall still pretty fun, and worth a buy on sale.\n\nOn the subject of the game's lack of balance, the whole idea of the game is that it spans 300 years, so your heros will all die no matter what. Unfortunatley, there are so few battles that it's very hard for them to gain experience. From birth to adulthood (15yrs) children gain experience and traits based on the skill of their parents and of the Standard, so children gradually become more and more experienced, but once they hit adulthood, the only way to level up is through battle. Therefore, a hero is really only good for two or three battles before they need to be retired so they can pass on their wisdom and make some babies. The only reason to keep a hero in battle into old age is so they can level up their Relic, but that's only viable if they have family.\nWhen heroes die, there's no reason to mourn them, because you never got a chance to know them. This game desperately needs a Long War mod to let you really invest in your heroes, as well as some battle type variations to keep things interesting. So not just a mod, a full expansion pack. Then this would be worth dumping $20-30 into.","February 22","true","17.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It features turn-based combat as the core component.  It also has a kingdom building and unit management aspect to it.  The most interesting concept is the breeding system I'll go into more detail so you can see if this is worth picking up.\n\nCombat: The core game play is centered around combat, unfortunately it is a poor execution when compared to X-Com, Fire Emblem, Heroes of Might and Magic or any other turn based game I can think of.  Very rapidly I found myself feeling bored of the bland combat system which is littered with issues.  Your ranged units also happen to be your best scouts, which means you will be moving them around ahead of your melee units often enough.  I assume you can breed some of these scoutlike qualitys later on into the melee units (didn't play enough to find out), but as a baseline it feels horrible.\n\nThere is no reasonable cover system in the game and it's somewhat difficult to be sure weither or not your units are within line of sight with the enemy.  It leads to a gameplay style that is sluggish, wherein you are moving very slowly and eventually setting up for a turn where you can destroy all the enemies within a specific area or suffer the consequences of a nearly non-existant cover system.\n\nKingdom Map: The meta of the game revolves around triage, as periodically two zones within your kingdom will be attacked at which point you must choose which to defend.  If you neglect to defend an area to much, then it goes bye bye.  This is a cool concept and one of the better aspects of the game in my opinion.  A lot could have been done to make this screen more interesting, as a fair amount of your time will be spent looking at it, but in general I give it a pass.\n\nResearch & Building: You will have the option to develop your kingdom by building structures and finding new units, or you can research new technology and combat upgrades.  You can only choose to upgrade one thing at a time, which will take years of gametime (300 year span remember).\n\nBreeding & Unit management: A big focus of the game is on breeding new units.  All of your units will have perks or problems which can effect them in a number of ways.  You can assign units to breed or to help the kingdom in other ways, but once you do they will be stuck there until death.  There are 3 basic unit types: A melee tanky unit,  A roguelike unit that can throw flasks (bombs) and a ranged hunter unit.  Crossbreeding the units will make offspring that have mixxed characteristics of both classes. It becomes a question of who should you choose to breed together.\n\nThe big issue I have with the the units is that they simply grow old and die to rapidly for you to really care about them at all.  You will only ever use a unit in battle 3-4 times.  So you tend not to give a damn about their traits and stats all that much, it's just to much to keep track of when you know they are going to be dead soon anyway.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Sadly the core game play just isn't there, if it was I would be interested in the game, but when the thing that should be the most compelling in your game is the most tedius there is a problem.  I almost wish they would have focused soley on everything you do outside of combat, then the game might be interesting... fun even.  As it stands though I can't recommend Massive Chalice, and with so many cool ideas I just wish it was executed better.","November 17, 2015","false","5.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Just wait till it comes out of EA. I have an unredeemed copy of the game if anyone is interested in trying it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thoroughly enjoy this game in its early phase. I'm also a backer on kickstarter. I'll tell you why.\n\nGraphics The art direction of this game is great. I'm not sure if "low poly" is the correct term but it's very clean and refreshing. All of the visual elements work well and complement each other. It helps that the creatures are so distinct from each other. Shadows and colors really pop.\nWhile characters are somewhat devoid of expression due to the style, I feel attachment to them. The postures and animations in battle and outside have character.\nThe game is hardly graphic intensive but makes up for it with a beautifully rendered art style that is reminiscent of a painting.\n\nGameplay It feels a lot like a streamlined xcom, and I mean that in a good sense. Combat is pure turnbased-- you have the choice of movement, attack, offensive abilities, defensive abilities, and utility. Positioning is really important; you need to anticipate the enemy's turn based on your knowledge of their moveset and movement speed.\nPart of the metagame is in constructing buildings and making decisions of where to place your nonhero characters. You appoint regents, standards, and sagewrights all call for certain attributes. Every time I appoint a new regent I have to deal with the dilemma of appointing someone who would make a good hero. If I make him or her regent, I increase the chance of passing on favorable traits to the bloodline. But I also lose a potential hero.\nBuildings matter as well. Currently I tend to place 3-4 keeps near the Chalice, while rushing Crucibles which help your trainees gain experience faster.\nThe three classes in this game are Hunter (ranged/dps), Caberjack (melee/stun/tank), and Alchemist (mage/utility/aoe). I've gone through the entire game with two keeps pumping out Hunters, and one keep Jacks. The other keep I've reserved almost exclusively for nonhero characters or reserve heroes with High intuition and High intelligence. While Alchemists is strong in the right hands, I've found no significant advantage to them over another Hunter in my playstyle.\nIt's a great gameplay experience with enough of both strategic and tactical thinking. Really scratches my itch for a certain type of game.\n\nSound and Narrative I'm grouping these two together because of how intertwined they are. The two forces personified as two voices, male and female are infused into the titular Massive Chalice. From my understanding, they were two great heroes, a Hunter and a Caberjack (if I recall). They are trying to charge up power to fight back the Cadence invasion. I enjoy the background banter between the two during battle and when I'm making important decisions. It was hard getting used to at first, but over time (literally over centuries in the game) I grew accustomed to their voice. I especially like how personal it feels to be addressed. If I'm correct, the player is supposed to be yet another force that guides the kingdom, all the while receiving guidance from the Chalice.\nMusic is great. That much I can say. You'll have to experience it yourself. Combat sounds are also well done.\n\nClosing Thoughts Overall, I'm really impressed with how the game is coming along in its Early Phases. I believe since Massive Chalice is DF's main project, the issues with funding like Spacebase DF9 can be avoided.\nThe criticisms I have are as follows. Due note that these are heavily discussed in the DF forum community and consider reviewing the discourse between other users and the development team before coming to a conclusion.\nHunters are seriously strong. The Veil armor that makes you go invisible is pretty much all you need for early to midgame dominance\nMin-maxing seems to be the only way. There isn't much room for error when picking combinations for regents. You need to thoroughly consider the advantages and disadvantages. If you ever have a couple with low accuracy, get ready for a wild ride. It's not a bad thing per se if you like powergaming, but it might turn some people off.\nThe last battle is somewhat lackluster. I won't spoil it.\nDialogue gets repeated a lot and it gets tiresome. Hopefully they'll add some more.\n9/10 The highest I ever rated an Early Access Game\n\nI'll make sure to keep up with the development and add in edits for major updates.\n\nEDIT 11/11/14: I'm already beginning to see the expected backlash from upset owners of Spacebase DF9. I was surprised to see Massive Chalice on Early Access so early in development. Currently it's a premium backer alpha. I disagree with their decision to release a game in its alpha stages. Their decision was brought on by some fans who missed out on the kickstarter campaign. With the reputation Early Access has, especially of bad vaporware games that tarnish a truly effective model to support development, it would make more sense to have a Paypal option on their website rather than put it on Steam. That way, if someone who's interested in supporting the game will reach out themselves. Otherwise, they're just going to get bad publicity from people who disagree with the Early Access model.","November 11, 2014","false","17.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

You will handle many encounters upon finishing the game (around 30), so it is a good thing.\n- The tactical maps are not too varied and rather small. But in the end, it helps making the combat resolution faster as you don't have to seek enemies everywhere.\n\nThis fast pace suits the game as it focuses on managing generation of heroes.  You want to see how generations evolve and not linger for hours in tactical and wait hours in the management part of the game. So, I think it is sound design here. This is what will make you love or hate the game. You have to consider if it works for you or not if you hesitate purchasing.\n\nI still felt attached to some of my heroes (not for so long, at best you play 4 times with them). The fact that they are not long-lived makes it so that you are not punished hard when you lose one. And there is always the next hero to be fond of.\n\nThe setting/theme of the game is original (never seen elsewhere monsters), the chalice, the generations of heroes makes for a new experience, never played before game. In this day and age of sequels/clones, it was a good surprise.\n\nGraphics: Atypical but very clean and I liked them. I loved the fact that the armors/weapons get different looks when research advances. It shows care for details.\n\nMusic is also very good. The voices are superb.\n\nThe controls are very well done.\n\nThe game is really balanced in my opinion. Funnily, I read most people use hunters. I used my alchemists (brewtalists to be exact) so there is more than one way to play  the game. This is positive obviously. Some research options on the weapons open tactics as the abilities offered by the different classes.\n\nIs there anything not to like? Well, for me: not really. I just have some regrets though:\nSometimes, it is a bit difficult to understand exactly how stats and traits are propagated. Granted, part of the fun is maybe to figure that out.\nI wished there were better ways to track heroes in the different blood lines. There is a small family tree, but would have liked an overview.\nI sometimes wished there was the (optional) possibility to customize heroes/Houses. But the Houses out of the box are already very enjoyable.\nI somehow, want more... So many heroes were 'lost'. You can assign them to research, training, combat or breeding. I wished there were just more to it (more options), more events, leaderboards of heroes and so on...\nI do realize though that more features could work against the design of a fast paced game with constant choices.\nRelics were a brilliant idea to have some cross generations element, I wished for more. More logs/relations between heroes.\n\nCongratulations to the developers, this is a very unique, well designed, well executed and beautiful game.\n\nI will finish with a last comparison with X-COM :the price. Price tags at release were very different. I would dare to say that quality/price, they are a close match, or maybe even Massive Chalice is the winner there.","June 7, 2015","true","46.0"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","1"

However you soon discover its depth and variety through hybrid hero classes as well as strategy altering weapon, armour and other loadout choices. The combat may not be revolutionary, but it is by no means disappointing. Note that you will end up altering your team composition numerous times during a single playthrough. Your heroes will die both on the field of battle and from natural causes during the game's 300 year campaign.\n\nWhat really caught me by surprise is the quality of the other side of the game. This is where the MASSIVE CHALICE really shines! When you are not commanding your vanguard of 5 heroes in turn based battles, you manage the kingdom. This involves building castles, researching improvements and managing heroic bloodlines. You are in charge of breeding heroes, filling key vacancies, managing bloodline relics, making decisions during random events and so on. What could have easily come out as tedious filler turned out to be a very compelling and unique contribution to the genre.\n\nThe quality of this game is further elevated by its excellent soundtrack, voice acting and writing.\n\nIf you are a fan of the genre, you should give MASSIVE CHALICE a chance. It is much more than just a XCOM clone.","August 4, 2015","true","26.2"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","12"

Uncovering the fog of war to activate the next group of enemies just to kill them always in the same way is a time-consuming pain in the ♥♥♥ and no fun at all.\n\nAnd what the game claims as its biggest gimmick, the bloodline genetics, turns out to be its worst design failure: since your heroes will die anyway, there´s no possibility - at least no reason - in developing a relation to them: XY survived a battle or died? I just didn´t care about it at all since numerous heirs just took over their place. And their different traits and states are just +1 or -1 to their stats. Furthermore the UI is so bad designed, that it´s just annoying to click through the  stats of your heroes that I soon gave it up which affected my lack of interest for them even more.\n\nAll in all the game was so uninspiring, that I wasn´t able to spend more time with it than just two sessions.

First, the monsters. The monsters in the game are varied enough in their appearance and abilities to make them interesting to fight against. One of them steals experience points from characters and can actually drain a level from them, others can wither a character, making them age faster than normal and the sudden appearance of one of them can summon up a feeling of annoyance or dread depending on how close or far they are from your characters.\n\nThe characters themselves are a mixed bag the classes are determined by the breeding of previous characters who join houses (among other things) to meld two classes into another super class that has aspects of both included in it. Another bonus of the marriages between houses is the parents often pass on good or negative traits to their children like some sort of eugenicists wet dream, characters become super soldiers later on because of their genes/heritage.\n\nDespite their status as super soldiers these characters will die, sometimes even without getting into a battle because of how time works in the game, a character who goes into battle at age 20 can possibly die before the next one without any children since people who have a throne are the only ones allowed to make babies. Now on to the bad stuff, if these last few ideas didn't bum you out about character building in this game, some of these will make you less happy.\n\nThe first bad thing about the characters is they all look exactly the same. They may have different hair styles but their faces are completely without detail and there are only a few different hair cuts in the game so none of the characters look unique. It is also really hard sometimes to distinguish characters from one another due to the way colour schemes work in the game, you take them from the noble heraldry and there aren't that many colours to choose from so inevitably you will have a few different families with the same colours. This is a minor gripe but it is sometimes confusing when you have loner character who you want to stay away from the group and a hive minded person who wants to be buddies with everyone for max effectiveness.\n\nA second bad point about the characters is their noble families, you cannot make your own Noble family, the option does not even exist and there is an option at the start of a game to take both "comedic" or serious names or only one of the two but the "comedic" ones slip in through adoption/recruiting of heroes even if you try to block them out.\n\nLastly, there is no attachment to any of the characters in the entire game due to the shortened lifespan of the character, they might get two or even three battles before they die but then they're gone and you have to send in a few fresh faced goons to fight instead... fresh until the next battle anyway. In some cases half or more of your people are sterile at the beginning of the game which effectively makes them worthless even if they are good at fighting they'll never be able to have kids, all they'll be used for is dying when there's a chance to save someone more important.\n\nMoving on, there's the movement of time and the building/research element in the game which I think is absolutely terrible, it's extremely simplified. When time passes it never feels like you have achieved or progressed in any fashion beyond getting new armors or weapons which seems to take forever to do, one final thing I will add is when characters come of age i.e. ready to fight there is no pause function in the game to let you know and setting them up in the combat mission screen is completely clunky and time consuming. I have already beaten to death how characters relate to time so let's skip that part and head straight to the voice acting.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is extremely annoying, to the point where I don't ever want it to be on. There are a few times when I laughed a bit about what they said but after that it became annoying listening to the stupid warrior woman and the wise archer/alchemist guy talk to each other. A few last topics to talk about are random events and the battles themselves which are intended to be a centerpiece of the game.\n\nRandom events in this game add a bit of extra flavor to the game but in the end seem designed to ♥♥♥♥ you over by killing your characters or taking them away from you for periods of time when you actually need them to go on missions or make babies with other ones. It does make the game a little more interesting but doesn't really add much in the way of changing my opinion of it.\n\nFinally, we have the battles themselves. I have to admit that while tactics in the game appear simplistic there are times when you need to think a lot about how you want to move your characters but while the tactics are sometimes deep and interesting the battles themselves do not offer much variation.","July 24, 2015","false","12.7"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

I wanted to love this but I can't.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n1) Just 4 enemy types - understandable considering the KSer budget - however 3 of the 4 are jerks.\n2) One of the enemies drains xp with each attack (lapses), look my boys are all going to die, that creates even a less chance I have that cool badass. And seriously that was the best monster concept a monster that drains xp? bah. Mind you some heroes start out in their 30-50's they aren't long for this world as it is. Now you finally get level 2 and one hit and you are back to level 1. Bah I say, that is frustrating just to be frustrating.\n3) Next monster runs up and explodes beside you, That's cool. However not only do I take immediate hp damage and armor damge. I also take damge again before the enemy turn is up because I am still standing in the corrosive goo. I am not even given the opportunity to get out of the goo first. If I choose to stay in the goo, fine hit me again but at least give me the option of getting out of the goo.\n4) The research/buildings system is frustating. You have to choose either to build or to research new things and this takes serious amounts of in game time. The first keep is roughly 10 years of the game. That is so you can have 2 families producing new heroes. Which you will need, at least I feel you need that. While you are building your new keep you can't recruit new heroes, you can't research new tech, you can't do anything but wait.\n5) For my stupid minor gripe I have to say the intro was just annoying. I have no clue what was going on. For the better part of a minute, half the screen lit up, then the other half. Illuminating the chalice, but no words on screen no nothing. And then you have the main menu page.\n6) Another stupid minor gripe that is probably more me not understaning what to do but I found annoying. One of the tutorial tips said that buy building buildings on the fringe that corruption would be decreated. I built a keep on the outer rim that had 2 points of corruption and it still had 2 points of corruption. meh.\n\nThings I like:\n\n1) I like how combining different regents with different classes gives you new advanced classes. That is super cool but I never really got far enough to see the really neat stuff.\n2) I like trying to combine linages to make new interesting heroes.\n3) I liked how the outer realms gave bonus's but were constantly under siege. You risked a lot by building Keeps/buildings out on the fringes.\n\nThis game has some super neat concepts that I think with the right amount of time and budget would become genre definning. As it stands the game feels half complete and unbalanced.

The idea behind it is well thought. You select five houses from which to craft bloodlines over several hundred years, research and build fortifications to defend swats of land and train heroes to execute your will. Unfortunately the execution is lacking. The tactical turn-base battles are just not very challenging. The game play lacks interaction with its environment. The bloodline crafting is a great idea, except the game always throws cancerous inbreds at you with very little value and the goal quickly becomes an exercise in finding good couples to match and preserve whatever rare dominant characteristic they might have. This is such a restless activity that whatever is left to explore from the research and building systems become secondary at best.

Very simple and intuitive to get into. I felt that the story/voive-acting/atmosphere and art direction were all spectacularly well-done, they all really worked to get me hooked. Combat follows the same format as all other turn based games out there, however with a few great tweaks. The enemies (especially when you take into account some of their special abilities) are some of the most creative and strategically challenging that I've ever come across; have a really awesome hero careful not to get hit by a Wrinkler and have them aged drastically, or risk some damage to age a young novice into his prime. One of the things I had no idea I'd enjoy so much was matching partners together. Ensuring a houses' legacy via their lineage has never been so addictive. I found myself being painstakingly picky about who married who as I tried to ensure that I had the best crop of children coming from my houses. I wish there was a bit more control here as the attributes seem to be mostly random and some of the negative traits can be a little annoying and aren't able to be reversed, it adds to the games challenge and I don't see it as a flaw of the game at all, I just wish I had more control in grooming my heroes into potent killing machines.

But this game has so many mechanics that suck the fun out of it and it really prevents me from recommending it.\n\nAllow me to elaborate.\n\nTLDR;  great idea, poor execution.\n\nTo start, the game is set up such that has the enemies will attack every 10-20 or so years.  This is otherwise fine except,  that time affects your heroes - they will age and they will die.\n\nThis mechanic poses the greatest challenge to the game.   Essnetially the game ceased to be a turn based tactics game and instead gets overwhelmed in favor of, "let's pray to the RNG gods and hope we have the elements we need to continue playing the game".\n\nThe primary challenge of the game is maintaining a set of troops that will be ready to fight the enemy threat when they appear.  You can't have rely on the same army you had before because your heroes age and die.  Throughout the game, you'll assuredly be going through new set of troops every 1 or 2 of these enemy waves.\n\nTo maintain a standing vanguard, you need to build keeps to preserve the blood line for the next generation of heroes.  But that in itself poses problems - your heroes can have bad traits that make then undesirable to sire the next generation, you don't have enough of the right gender, the heroes could be infertile, random events cause their heirs to become unusable, random events cause you to lose the heroes that you've painstakingly prepared.  Heroes are also needed to become sages, do little side quests - that have the possibility of taking away from your pool of available heroes when enemies attack.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining 1 keep isn't enough as the developers have thoughtfully disallowed inbreeding.  So a minimum of 2 keeps are needed.  Which means another 2 heroes that you will be removed from your reserves - that you need to find partners for and breed for etc.\n\nAside from this, AI is fairly weak, and missions don't require much thought.  Overall, it really feels like a pale reproduction of X-Com.  At this time, X-Com 2 is due to come out soon, and I would recommend you save your money and buy that instead.","January 14","false","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

People saying they loved XCOM EU/EW and hate this game because "it isn't balanced" is hilarious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Massive Chalice does a better job at getting me to bring one of each unique class into each battle than any other tactical game I have played. You have a melee class, a grenadier style class, and a ranged class as you three base classes and then merging bloodline will create hybrids. Having one of each base class was a must for me playing and I enjoyed it.\n\nStory: Decent. This is made better with the fantastic voice acting and great visuals. This is yet another claim that boggles my mind- that the "story is boring and XCOM is better". The "story" was by FAR the weakest part of XCOM, "aliens are here, kill them, they only have one master ship, kill it". If you are playing either of these two games for "the story" you are in the wrong genre friend...\n\nCombat: Decent. This one is true. Other tactical games (such as XCOM EW/EU as well as Divinity Original Sin) have produced a much more solid combat experience. Every fight is on a flat surface with elevation never being introduced. Some games (like Divinity) get away with their fights being only on one surface but it can be felt in this game. There is enough tactical fun and content here to make combat fun and thought provoking but not enough depth or inovations for it to be a selling feature.\n\nBloodlines: Great. This one has not been done well in any other tactical game save for some Fire Emblem games (which have even LESS tactical combat) and it has been done well here. Relics that get passed down bloodlines and playing "game of thrones" with regents is great. This is a huge selling feature for this game, if it does not interest you then buying the game would most likely be a mistake.\n\nLength: Weak. Each "generation" needs to be 4x as long with 4x as many battles. You can beat the game in 15-20 hours. This is (IMO) the single greatest problem with the game- the combat was never a selling feature (IMO) for the game and didn't need that much more content (if any) but the world size as well as content feels lacking. It is a shame that mods were never really a deal as a "Long War" mod for this game I would frankly enjoy far more than on XCOM EU...\n\nTower Defense: Weak. I add this in as well even though combat doesn't reflect a "tower defense" style of play the "defending the heart of your country as things come in from the borders" style of play is present in the "world view" aspect of the game. I am a huge fan of "no lost countries" and would never, EVER lose a single country in XCOM- that CANNOT happen in this game. This game is a "hold out long enough to win" style of game with countries/areas that will fall regardless of your actions. I hate this, it would be the first thing I mod out or at least give some way/option to fight to retake it (like in XCOM LW).\n\n\nOverall: You want a decent turn based tactical game with country management and bloodline control there is nothing better on the market. If you want pure tactical combat with nil story and nil country management and nil bloodline control then this isn't for you. If you are somewhere inbetween then I would still recommend, I would just suggest picking it up on sale.","May 29","true","23.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But deeper than changing the skills, the joining of bloodlines supplies a variety of Traits that modify heroes in ways ranging from how many babies they're likely to have (and of which gender) to increasing their basic attributes, which is a direct increase in combat damage, to how likely they are to drop dead from a heart attack.\n\nMany times I found myself weighing who should marry whom, since characters made heads of households can no longer join in battle. Similarly, building the Sagewright's Guild allows you to permanently retire characters for a reduction to research time for new technologies and nation-wide buffs. Finally, a Crucible structure allows you to retire a single exemplary hero to train the next generation (providing bonus experience points) and shape their attitudes (by imparting Personality on others, a learned version of the Trait system that you breed for in order to create the best heroes). Selecting proper breeding stock and maintaining enough quality heroes to repel an enemy attack can be a challening balancing act.\n\nAs far as the tactical combat goes, it does not fair so well in comparison with its most obvious inspiration: X-Com. The lack of variation in maps becomes crushingly tedious over even a single playthrough. The small number of enemy units is disappointing, though they are interestingly rendered, looking like enemies unique to this surreal fantasy universe. But the Caberjack and other melee combinations are punished by the enemies' proclivity for stunning, knockbacking, hurting and aging (yes, age attacks are to be feared since you're spending 300 in-game years breeding heroes. You wouldn't want your prize stud going gray before he's had a chance to pass on his swell Traits).\n\nAlso the lack of any kind of overwatch command and no modifiers because of elevation or posture choices further limit the tactical options. Frequently I found myself wishing for more imaginative gear to research. I wanted items that affected the battlefield or changed the way you fight in more tangible ways than providing simple buffs, healing or immunities (the Skipping Stone being an exception).\n\nSince you're cast as an immortal sovereign, shepherding your kingdom in a three hundred year holding action until the Massive Chalice charges up like a Death Star in a pint glass, various conundrums and questions come up along the way. These opportunities to pass judgments often create lasting consequences that take a few years to show themselves. While being simply text and two or three Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style choices, they add a welcome break from the immediacy of tactical combat and the more considered, long term choices in your breeding program. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be nearly enough of these events, with many of them repeating on a second play-through.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the cubist fantasy art and the unique enemies. Though I wanted more from the combat, I still enjoyed it, even if some of the maps sprawl too much for my taste. The eugenics simulator was entertaining, and I enjoyed (at least on the first playthrough) the occasional problems that my subjects would require my judgment on. I wanted a little more from every system in the game, but if you're a fan of turn-based tactical simulators and are willing to explore a fresh take on how one recruits the units for one's army, I recommend trying Massive Chalice... just ignore the premise of the big stupid cup and enjoy the rest.","July 17, 2015","true","81.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Lovely artwork. Yet the strategic elements in the battles and the way you build up your "base", or in this case, kingdom, reminds me of how X-COM works.\nYour goal is to defend your kingdom for 300years, and a large part of the manner in which you achieve this goal is by breeding your heroes, your nobels. They make up both your soldiers, but also researchers, trainers and parents of future heroes/soldiers.\nI get great fun out of trying to fit together in arranged couples those who will pass on the most desired traits to their offspring. Yet at time I have had to pick whomever I had left at said time. You start with three base classes yet breeding toghether different classes can yield new classes.  I have yet to complete my first playthrough but will definitly play though it several times (even as I doubt that I will manage to move from the normal difficulty setting).\nThe management side aside, ever so often your kingdom will get attacked. Often two or three times at once, yet you can only send out one team of heroes. Leaving you at the hard choice of which parts of your land to possibly loose.\nThe battles themselves are as stated before turn based. Enemy difficulty has thus far always felt challanging enough, with a good (yet not overly large) amount of varied opponents. Nothing has felt OP even as there are some leaps in difficulty from time to time.\n\nIf you like games that are a mix of management and turnbased strategy, then this is really a game for you to try.\n","June 26, 2015","true","12.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/recommended/246110/","senorsantiago","(PoA) ¿Señor Santiágo?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/","666 products in account","A modest amount of strategy to be found despite the simple gameplay formula.\nHaving encountered Double Fine Productions previous work, I was curious to see what Massive Chalice would be like, since it seemed different from their Adventure games.  What I found was a fun but undeniably repetitive & somewhat limited experience.  It got a bit old about halfway through, but I still enjoyed it through to the end.\n\nThis indie game is stylish but surprised me a bit by being unexpectedly barebones.  It boils down to two things:\nAchieving victory in turn based combat scenarios which pop up at regular intervals until the timeline finishes.\nEnsuring your heroes are numerous and effective enough to accomplish that task through wise (optimized) choices in which structures you build (& where), the order in which you research technologies & who you appoint to each office (researchers, trainers, breeders, combatants).\nThe turn based combat feels slow, just not quite fast enough; there is a slight delay between your input and action executions.  It feels especially sluggish given how simple combat is once you get the hang of it.  The AI should take less time to complete its turn, the input delays shouldn't be there & all actions/animations should be sped up slightly.\n\nIt's extremely helpful during combat to advance slowly & uncover enemy units carefully, as in almost any game of this genre.  Coming away from combat with a flawless victory ensures your precious few heroes are preserved for any number of uses, most of all being able to fight when the Cadence inevitably comes again.\n\nThere are some interesting features tied to the combat, but their implementation leaves something to be desired.  Your heroes can actually lose experience and/or gain years of age upon taking damage from certain Cadence monsters.  In my opinion though, the way things are set up here represents poor design choice, despite that it incorporates one of the unique mechanics (hero aging & death) of the game.  For example, Caberjacks & any of their hybrid classes seem like natural frontline fighters & tanks, but using them is entirely discouraged by the mechanics since they are melee range units; to be close enough to attack, they have to be exposed to taking hits on the next turn.  There's a serious class imbalance here given how easy it is for the player to stack a party heavy on ranged damage dealers, especially the area of effect specialist (Alchemist).  Note: I'm speaking about the lowest difficulty setting (Normal) here, and did not play much past my first complete playthrough - things could be different at higher settings, I don't know & didn't bother finding out.  There is in fact an item you can research & equip to protect against the XP loss / age gain, but it's not available until at least mid game and honestly not a brilliant choice considering the opportunity cost of other researches.  Better (apparently) to go full pew-pew & try never to get hit at all.\n\nFurther barriers to party diversity include the method for acquiring new heroes.  Marrying two heroes from separate houses & installing them into a keep guarantees they have children who grow up to form your new generation of warriors, but their class will be a hybrid of the two parents, 100% of the time.  Useful if you wish to stack all one or two class types, a bit obnoxious if youre trying to mix it up.  I'd suggest giving trainees at keeps a chance to become either of their parent's classes in addition to the hybrid option.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of necessary information on items and abilities.  Research on weapons, armors & items doesn't show actual values of the gear until finished.  Character detail panels only show basic info about RPG elements like statistics, traits & more.  Map tile bonuses don't indicate how much effect they have.\n\nArmor research includes a progression from standard to refined then advanced.  There's special research that adapts properties of slain creatures to armor, which is neat, except that this isn't truly an upgrade: annoyingly, special armors replace rather than upgrade Advanced armor, & in the end the specials are a big downgrade from that top tier which makes researching special sets a waste.\n\nOutlying tiles on the map are the first to become corrupted, yet they're the only tiles to offer unique bonuses for building on them.  It creates a bit of risk vs. reward strategy in placing your buildings.  When attacks come, they occur on two or three tiles, but you can only defend one tile per incursion.  Each tile has three strikes; successfully defending one region not only prevents an added strike but removes one from that region if it had any before the attack.  Undefended tiles take one strike & at three are lost to the Cadence, along with anything on it.  Being mindful of this makes it possible to utilize the bonuses & prevent any territory loss for quite some time!\n\nDynamic events that require player choice pop up now and again; these are entertaining but seem to lack any rhyme or reason in their outcome - just random chance of a positive, negative or neutral effect.  One of these that I saw seems to be an easter egg that reveals a good bit of the backstory for this game, on how the Chalice was created!  The story itself is very light & in my opinion had an odd ending.\n\nThere is an autosave but I'd have appreciated a quicksave & quickload.\n\nAs I said right off the bat, Massive Chalice does offer some strategic play despite the very simple formula of: fight, raise new heroes, research & build, then repeat.  I found myself not just rushing through this cycle but stopping to consider hero personalities, traits, age, class, etcetera, all of which affect who should become the next Sage or Standard, who should marry into which bloodline to produce the best offspring, which heroes to take into combat against certain monsters, and so on.\n\nI personally enjoyed the game and do not regret purchasing, but also found it underwhelming based on my expectations.  For that reason I give this a thumbs up but with the big caveat that you should take a close look before buying & decide whether or not it's for you.","July 24, 2015","true","22.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jiiiiim/recommended/246110/","Jiiiiim","The Priiiiiize","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jiiiiim/","289 products in account","Right! Completed a campaign on the starting difficulty. I reckon it took about ten hours all told, and at various points I was ♥♥♥♥ing sick of everything but Massive Chalice has some interesting enough points that it's worth discussing.\n\nFirst off: the obvious comparison to make is X-Com. It's the same basic template of a squad of five engaging in turn-based percentage-themed combat with alien-looking-things.  Backing that all up is a world map where events emerge and you react. There's some research where you use alien-looking bodies. There's a timer. Surely just a rip-off? Well...\n\n...not quite. Let's take a step back: What's the premise? The MASSIVE CHALICE is a superweapon of sorts, charging up to once and for all defeat the dastardly Cadence, a vague orangey blob around the map there that is planning to destroy you and everyone you care about. But it's gonna take a while to charge up - 300 years in fact, so your elite squad is going to be experiencing a lot of change. They've got a fighting lifetime of maybe 50 years if you get lucky, so you don't invest in single supermen, you invest in super-bloodlines.\n\nEach of your castles on the map is occupied by heroic families. The Kuan! The Leones! The Aabershots! The Berrys! Heroes all! Keep 'em married and not covered in orange goo and they will provide you with a fine selection of heroes. Then you cross-breed them with special tweezers to try and encourage positive traits to emerge. I mean in theory you do, I just married off people with high fertility so I could get maximum manpower, which led to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ super soldiers indeed.\n\nThe research you're doing is gradually improving their equipment, both in stats and fancy stuff, and during their short lifetimes, they'll level up themselves and unlock special powers of their own.\n\nBasically it is a balancing act, trying to keep the conveyor belt of babies rolling consistently enough that you always have a good enough five-man force to call upon while trying to boost up the long-term bonuses - I've mentioned research but there's also relics which have to be passed down bloodlines, and gain power every time they're used in battle.\n\nAs long as you make sure to build a few keeps at the start to house your families, minion numbers aren't really an issue, so then it's going to be battles which could be your downfall. Every ten years or so the cadence strikes in 2/3 provinces, and you defend one. Three strikes and they vanish forever.\n\nYou're inevitably gonna lose something. What you have to do is not lose battles, as that will accelerate the process of loss, and at the difficulty I was on, this wasn't a taxing task either. I lost one battle out of maybe thirty, which meant a lot of those 300 years were boring , waiting for the next fight to emerge so I could get it over with.\n\nAbout 200 years in, I'd unlocked enough stuff, advanced my soldiers enough, and came across bad enough dudes, that the occasional interesting battle slipped in. Everything I've said so far is functional and boring, but let's get in the praise for MASSIVE CHALICE now, which is the diversity of battlefield options.\n\nThere's Cradles - upside down jellyfish who spit out babies. Roided-out blue guys called Twitchers, who can instantly swap position with anything. Ghostly Lapses, who causes your heroes to forget how to do things. Spiky Ruptures, who only exists to explode, leaving behind damaging sludge puddles. There's also baddies that can only be hit once and go invulnerable (Bulwarks), and baddies who cause your heroes to age years in a single punch (Wrinklers), potentially having them die of old age in the middle of a fight.\n\nYour heroes are also pretty damn fragile, which means everything can suddenly go 100% to pot in a moment. So at its best, MASSIVE CHALICE is this little battlefield puzzle, where you have a huge amount of enemies around you that you can't possibly all kill this round, so how do you prioritize? Can you chain-reaction the ruptures? Can you knock some of them into a tree so they get knocked out for a turn? Can you smash up the local flora?\n\nIn my favourite battle (barring the final showdown which I shall not go into cos I want it to be a surprise if you play it), I found myself against a very large number of bulwarks, who go almost invincible after their first damage instance each turn. I did not have the damage to take out eight of them simultaneously, so I couldn't just start locking and loading as they would ♥♥♥♥ing murder me, but I had invested in some bulwark armour (researched with their corpses), which does exactly the same for your men.\n\nSo the big men waddle into the centre and absorb the hits and hope they don't run out of health while the alchemist stands at the back lobbing crates of bees at the enemy, which meander around, causing damage to everyone and the hunters prowl around in the shadows looking for pickoffs as the blundering bulwarks try and escape the bees.\n\nLater on I got something from the Twitcher corpse research called Skipping Stones, which let you be the one who swaps positions with anything - there's some really inventive things you can do with them, to force enemies onto certain paths, to save people, to drag baddies into range. I kept a guy alive on 1HP for a good ten minutes on the final battle by swapping him all over the shop\n\nThe other thing which got better as the game went on was my feeling towards Bloodlines rather than specific heroes. X-Com is all about that one sniper who is the best at killing aliens, and you give him a name and ooh isn't he the best. Whereas with MASSIVE CHALICE, your heroes are going to see at most five battles before they die, so you better get used to them fast. Ultimately - I can barely name anyone who fought for me, but I have a strong recollection of the bloodlines they came from (always rely on the Aabershots) but you're not going to be able to tell the same stories about them.\n\nIn summary: MASSIVE CHALICE starts off immensely boring, and gradually increases in challenge and options until it becomes interesting. My normal campaign took about ten hours, so it depends whether you have that time to spare.\n\nI'm gonna try an ubertough campaign and see if that helps or compounds the issues.\n\nAnyway, it's worth a fiver","June 27, 2015","true","13.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","2"

Steals experience (more annoying than anything else when your level 10 character keeps dropping to level 9)\nBulwarks: Tanky piercing ranged mob. Can only be damaged heavily once per turn.\nTwitches: Tanky, high damage, melee mob. Knocks back heroes and can swap places with them.\nCradles: Ranged mortar / seed spawning mob. Deals high damage and can spawn seeds. Spawns 3 seeds upon death, as well.\nWrinkles: Melee medium damage mob. Ages your hero and can instakill older heroes.\n\nLearning all of the mechanics and trying to get strong blood lines going for my kingdom was the best part of the game. After a few battles, I quickly grew tired of the combat and just wanted to keep running my nation. Sometimes random "events" occur and let you choose a few options. These random events generally result in a negative outcome, most often resulting in you having to throw away a hero or getting negative traits.\n\nAt first I had started to level up an enforcer army and a few caberjacks, as I really like the idea of a ranged army. However, the caberjack class quickly outshined the other classes because of their immense amounts of crowd control (my end game team comp consisted of 4 caberjacks and 1 shadowjack).\n\nLate game combat is REALLY bad. I had 2 caberjacks with the taunt ability, and 2 level 10 caberjacks with relic weapons and kill rage which let me easily kill entire groups of mobs in one turn. Anything not finished off by the level 10's would run stupidly towards my taunters positioned far, far away.\n\nI recommend this game. It's fun for $30 but I don't think I'll be playing it again unless:\n\n1) More class depth is added\n2) Researching anything other than weapons/armor/items has a meaningful impact (seriously, by the time you get all of the nation buffs the game is already almost over). In addition to this, it seems impossible to keep ALL of your territory which makes building more than 1 crucible, 1 sagewrights, and 2-4 keeps meaningless.)\n3) An endless mode is added.","May 15, 2015","true","22.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It is a very fun game, however. There's plenty of game time here as well; I finished the Normal campaign in roughly 12 hours, and there is plenty opportunity to replay the game at a higher difficulty and/or with the classic ironman mode which overwites your saves as you make decisions!\n\nAnd decisions are very important, and can have lasting effects. A series of bad decisions on my part led to one of my houses dying out because I had no fertile children left (I accidentally got all the fertile family members killed. Oops.) This led me to resort to inbreeding in another house for several years, and yes, that does seem to devolve your once-noble house into a set of dimwitted, short-sighted idiots.\n\nYou will make lasting mistakes - particularly on your first playthrough - but it's overcoming and correcting these mistakes that make the game so memorable.","June 15, 2015","true","12.0"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

Which is why I'm pretty sure this one has some serious issues.  I've spent an hour and a half with it, and I feel absolutely zero compulsion to continue.  The potentially interesting heredity mechanics are broken by the fact that the battles (this could get better as the game progresses, I suppose..) are incredibly tedious and uninteresting.  Three classes with next to no abilities doesn't exactly motivate me to get deep into a game.  Movement and camera interaction is clunky and unpleasant.

The general idea of some of the complaints stand. It gets mildly repetitive. I plan to take a short break before starting some attempts at Hard/Ironman for this reason.

That's totally wrong. This game focuses on pre-planning, planning in advance and preparation much more than X-COM game and while strategic mode in X-COM serves to support tactical one - by unlocking more guns, armors and stuff for destruction of aliens in tactical mode - in Massive Chalice tactical mode would be a test of your strategical decisions and ability to allocate your main resources - time and people.\n\nThe main idea of the game is not turn-based battles - the main idea is managing of your heroes - which is both simple and complicated. Simple - because there are three positions to which you can assign your heroes. You can have them reigning (supposedly) in a castle, where they would produce more heroes (assuming that you've found a fitting partner for it), you can have them doing research in sage's guild, which would speed up many other things or you can have them training other heroes at crucible, which grants a steady supply of exp for all your heroess and allows them to also pick some good or bad traits from the teacher. All assigments are life-long and you can't undo them. All heroes, who are not assigned can participate in fighting off Cadence (though you can take only five of them into battle - you can choose those five out of all your unassigned heroes).\nAnd then comes the complicated part - the higher level of the hero - the more effective he would be at those assigments - he would be able to train his children, so they'd start with several levels already, he would be able to give all heroes more experience at crucible and... no, he won't be more effective sage, as wisdom comes with age and certain in-born traits. And, of course, high level hero would be able to fight off Cadence better. The other thing you should take into account are traits - they are divided into inborn ones and 'gained' ones. Inborn ones are simple - characters can be strong or weak, have inborn heart problems or be very bright and so on. Those traits can be inherited from parents and can't be changed, so you should look - who are marrying with whom. 'Gained' traits are a bit more complicated - as character can pick them after parents, after the crucible instructor and even after his teammates during the mission, so one drunkard can quickly turn the whole group into drunkards - those traits add a layer of complexity as well.\n\nAnd only after all that complex strategy layer comes tactical one, where your heroes are sent to fend off Cadence in an X-COM-like fashion - tactical mechanics are close to what you get in X-COM - every hero has two actions, attack ends his turn, so you can either move twice or move and attack or attack without moving. Instead of cover mechanics - there is positioning and visibility, since enemies that you can see may not see your characters, even without using all sorts of hiding abilities. Many abilities affect areas or lines or pierce through multiple enemies, so you'd need to do some positioning, before engaging them (and keep an eye on enemies trying to do the same) and eventually you'd get cool stuff, like bombs that create walls and so on.\n\nSo, in general, I'd give this game 4.5/5 - but I warn you that this game may be not fitting for people, who love only tactical games or only strategical games, as it would require combination of both to win - without good strategical management of your heroes you'd get an army of low-level weak clumsy dimwitted characters, who'd miss an elephant at a point-blank range. Without tactical abilities - your army of super-soldiers won't be able to win battles, which would lead to an obvious defeat.\n\nAlso, I've encountered some people, who don't like the graphical style, the style of weapons (a log as a main melee weapon and giant crossbow turned sideways as ranged one - that's too hillarious for them) or find the fact that there are only three main classes a bit lacking for their taste (though there are hybrid classes, which add some to gameplay - for example, caberjack (fighter with that log as a melee weapon) married to hunter would produce shadowjacks - still fighters with a log, but they sacrifice some of their combat abilities for ability to turn themselves invisible, like hunters do). So, if you are among those people - approach this game with some caution.","July 13, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The management simulation sections are similar to XCOM, and even feature similar research mechanics. The combat interludes are similar to XCOM, even down to the 2-AP turns. The character pregression is similar to XCOM, esspecially as far as the two-path ability tree format and equipment layout prior to a fight.\n\nThe biggest difference is that MASSIVE CHALICE features a "character breeding" mechanic. Your heroes will age and, eventually, die of old age. To keep yourself well-stocked with battle-ready warriors, you need to arrange marriages between heroes. They will do the deed, have children with their physical traits, raise them into warriors with their personality traits, and, eventually, die as well and need to be replaced from their own bloodline. It's kind of neat, and keeps your hero-pool continually changing, instead of letting you just stick to the same five heroes forever like XCOM does, also giving a sense of dread as you realize your best troops are getting old, and you need to decide whether to keep them in the field or settle them down to make kids who are, hopefully, a quarter as amazing as they were before they drop from age.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm enjoying it a lot. I recommend it to anyone else who enjoys games like XCOM or Jagged Allience: Management games with tactics-RPG combat interludes. If you're looking to get into the genre, I'd even say to start here and work your way to those others, MASSIVE CHALICE is a bit more forgiving than some.","June 27, 2015","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Game is challenging in every aspect, as you have to make choices on things that will follow up throu entire game and there is rarely an obviously good option to take and it will impact things like what heroes you can deploy in battle, or what bonuses will you get for controlling (with a keep) a region.\nAlthough one must understand that the very mechanics this game is based on may be a bit frustrating for some as you don't care for heroes, you care for lineages. You have to tailor marriages that will give you valuable descendants and classes you will need later in game. There is no telling what will be the perfect composition of classes in next generation as in every battle you have different set of enemies that will require different tactics.\nCombat itself is propably strongest aspect of game as enemies are challenging and interesting and you have a really fun mixture of skills to use in battle.\n\nQuestion is what are this game's downsides?\n\nWell, game can get repetitive after a while. Strategic aspect of game lacks options and feels shallow after first few decades. Events that happen sometimes are a bit to rare and most of the time lacks impact. This game needs an expansion of that aspect. I guess more buildings, events or even lands would make it more interesting and less repetitive.\n\nStill I can recommend this game as it will give you few nice evenings and for its discounted price (~10 EUR right now) it's hardly a bad choice.","June 26, 2015","true","28.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I decided to put out my review now, since I finally feel like I know what the final product will look like. I've also got 53 hours  of steam game time clocked in, and I'd like to think that I'm now somewhat of a MC veteran.\n\nMassive Chalice is a Tactical Strategy game very much in the vein of X-com. You take command of a kingdom beset by corruption called cadence on all sides, and your job is to manage the kingdom's buildings, marriages and research in order to ultimately defeat it. The gameplay is divided into the tactical side, where you command your heroes against the monsters called pawns, and the strategic side where you build, research and manage your heroes as centuries pass and the cadence enroaches on your territory.\n\nI'm gonna go over the game's features from best to worst.\n\nGraphics and sound design: Easily the best thing about the game. The Doublefine pedigree really shows here. The game has a certain papercrafty- jaggedy artstyle that is just beautiful. The graphics aren't the most high-fidelity thing in the world, and I don't have the computer to judge them, but the awesome look of the game really makes it stand out from pretty much everything I've played. Not only that, the aestethic is very unique, and the fantasy world is more than just your standard fantasy setting nbr. 2871. You command caberjacks swinging huge logs, Alchemists with clawed slings, and battle in environments ranging from red-white deserts to blue-green swamplands.\n\nThe voice acting, and music are also a very strong point. The game has a phenomenal soundtrack with some very punchy music, and the voice acting from the two advisors that accompany you through the game is so good it doesn't even get annoying 50 hours into the game. The sound effects are also very appropriate, with each blow, explosion and shot perfectly puctuated, with skitters and screams, and little details like the alchemist's flasks clinking as they run. For the eyes and ears, this game is a treat in this genre.\n\nTactical Gameplay: the combat is really good, as it should be. Instead of an X-com cover system, the game's combat is based around line of sight and positioning. Your group consists of 5 characters that can belong to 9 classes. Enemies can be knocked around the battlefield, stunned and dispatched, and the three main classes have a wide variety of options from Caberjack charges and alchemist flasks to the Hunter's sneaky stealth ability. The enemies start out weak, but suddenly spike up to strong, and then start coming at you in large numbers. Especially in hard, it takes all your wits and skills to make it through each fight, with the reward being the lives of your heroes and stopping the spread of corruption. The biggest weakness in combat, is the variety in enemies. There are 7 in total and each has an advanced form, which give them a re-skin and an added ability. (to be implemented) I think the game could have benefitted from just one or two more Pawn types, because sooner or later in the midgame a certain boredom starts to creep in. Especially in the lower difficulties and when you're doing well. Your maximum level characters are also so powerful that enemies become mere targets. on a successful playthrough, the last few missions tend to be more of a "clean-up". Again, this only applies to normal mode.\nThere is also only one mission type discounting the final mission, but the system is designed around it, and there is a rather large ammount of randomization to keep the gameplay interesting. It's not a huge point against the game.\n\nStory: Pure and simple. You Chalice, they Cadence, Kill. The atmosphere is great though, thanks to the aforementioned audiovisual design, and there are several events that pop up through the playthrough to give you the bigger picture of the kingdom you're managing. The atmosphere is better than the story.\n\nStrategic gameplay: It's mostly a good strategy game. the most unique thing is the Bloodline system. You are given a retinue of heroes each belonging to heroic bloodlines (made by the people who backed this on kickstarter) and marry them together to produce children. The traits, relics and experience all influence the children, and they will grow up to be heroes themselves. The game's campaign lasts 300 years, so heroes don't always stick around for long, but the bloodlines so leave an impression on you. You also manage your kingdom's research and deal with the several random events that keep popping up. The events usually have several options to take, but the outcomes are still randomized, so no matter how many times you've played through it'll be hard to make a "good" decision.\n\nThe strategy layer isn't the deepest thing in the world. Even though the bonuses, the heroes and the events are randomized, the map and the building times are always the same. (Hard mode shakes this up a little bit with extra corruption) If you figure out the right exploit, it can be easy to overlevel and steamroll the cadence. There are only two resources, heroes and time, and everything happens letting time pass, so all you're really doing is deciding on research, marriages and where to defend. And there aren't really that many viable builds either. All item research is around the same powerlevel, and the more necessary research takes such a long time, that there is no point to doing most of the research. there are cool weapons, items and equipment you'll never really want to use, and bonuses that come in way too late to be important. Multiple times through, the Strategic gameplay isn't as interesting as the combat is.\n\nConclusion: Massive Chalice has it's flaws. You can see the effort and love that's gone into the game, but you can also see the points where the constrained budget and developement time prevent the game from fully realizing it's vision. For any fan of strategy games, this is still a wonderful experience and an easy buy. It is a fun, unique and challenging game, that you can have a lot of fun with.","February 8, 2015","true","63.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So many unique elements of gameplay are crammed in that no single aspect of the game really stands out. It's as though Double Fine Productions got together at an IHOP late one night, and after a few dozen mugs of bottomless coffee, started coming up with all these fantastic ideas for a turn-based tactical game.

So I picked this game up in a sale and found myself liking it much more than I thought, keeping in mind I have only spent a little over an hour playing so far. The gameplay is quite good, being partially a turn-based tactical RPG. It is very much XCOM-like, minus Overwatch and an always changing experience. I thought I would hate not having Overwatch as a standard in this genre, but it works out very well. It makes you play a more offensive game while stratigically avoiding taking damage. I will say that the Caberjack (melee) seems underpowered when it comes to fighting because many enemies I've encountered so far damaging close by characters when killed. I personally find having Hunters (ranged bow) with a couple Alchemists (grenade throwers) is best.\n\nWhere XCOM has its base to upgrade, Massive Chalice offers a world to build as your personal stategic will decide how to best handle the ever growing balancing act of whether to give up your best fighters to give you better warriors through their children, benefitting all children yearly, or helping research; or to keep them to best deal with the invading threat. Massive Chalice gives the player only one research or building option at a time which will make you have to decide what you value most as each will take some time to finish.\n\nThe music is fitting, but I don't find it to be one of the top soundtracks (Bastion, Transistor, etc.) What sold me on this game is the comedic voice acting of the Massive Chalice as it really hooked me in. I hope to update this review as I dig deeper into the game and learn more.","August 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's different enough that as someone who likes modern X-Com I liked this game as well, and it didn't make me feel like I should just replay X-Com. The breeding metagame initially feels unimportant but becomes crucial to pay attention to later on, and there's enough to it that you could obsess over.\n\nThat said, there are things holding it back from being super-awesome: The enemy visual design looks bad, like someone was told to draw something evil so they drew a bunch of pickles and covered them with spikes. The environments are rather bland aside from a couple of instances. The writing tries to have that typical Double Fine wit and ends up making the game, one about an apocalyptic event that is swallowing the landscape, feel tone deaf. And over all nothing is as deep as it could be.\n\nSo it's pretty good, just not great.

Well, I would call it a king-pimp simulator with a hint of that X-COM again. The first one is really plain and simple: 5 heroes, some monsters, abilities, 2 Action Points... Nothing fancy here, though fun at times. And the second one is what this game is all about.\nTo fight off a nasty thing dreaming about consumping your "kingdom" the Chalice from the title must be charged. And it needs just some measly 3 centuries. Good thing you are immortal. Bad thing your heroes are not. And without you they, apparently, can't have sex for some reason. So one of your duties is to marry heroes, hoping they are compatible with each other and capable of producing not only healthy, but also promising offsprings with crazy stats and utility traits and personalities until these heroes die.\nYes, heroes here have not only stats, but also traits and personalities. And if you are bad at pimping, then rather soon the crisis will emerge: all your heroes are drunkards with heart diseases that can hardly hit an enemy right in front of them and you can't even 'produce' more because there are only 2 bloodlines which will lead to incent... Basically, you are screwed.\n\nThe game is not bad. This 'marriages and bloodlines managing' is a fresh idea with some potential. But the rest of the game is simply boring. You sit there, waiting for decades until the Corruption strikes (always 2 regions, but you can protect only 1), at the same time hoping the research you started will be finished until then, then wasting an awful lot of time searching for 1 monster hidden somewhere in the corner of the map. And by the next invasion your core heroes will be already long dead, leaving you with rookies who somehow inherit the worst traits of their parents.\nMaybe it is just me, but I also noticed that all melee classes are useless compared to ranged classes. With 5 hunters you can hide in shadows and take out 1 enemy at a time without exposing your heroes and risking their lives.\n\nAll in all, the concept is interesting, the game is boring and dull. Take it with a discount and decide yourself.","January 18","false","4.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At the tender age of 1, I had to tell one of them to get married to another and start making children. I was, as my mother/talking cup called it, an old soul. I chose to breed up the Urdas, with their massive wood making me strangely aroused.\n\nI was then given the choice between spending 8 years learning how to hit people better with the large pieces of wood, or build a castle to let people get married and make children in. Eugenics is okay when you're born from a massive talking cup, you see.\n\nOccasionally the cup would talk. I began to worry I was insane. It told me we had to wait 300 years to defeat the Cadence, who rather kindly despite having taken over the world would wait 8-12 years to attack me with perhaps 10 monsters, ranging from those who charged me, and those who shot me. Some would remove my people's experience, and some would simply age them into retirement or voting for UKIP/GOP/Right-wing party of choice.\n\nAs I forced 60 year old men to marry 16 year old woman for their juicy, juicy fertile bodies, I didn't care because time would fly past and they'd likely die before I ever bothered to learn their names. Eventually, I just learnt the family name.\n\nThere was the Urda, who hit things. There was the Modes, who shot things. There was the other family who never seemed to quite produce enough children to do anything besides provide more children to continue to line, but never enough to fight. Lazy gits.\n\nI made some Crucibles. I told my finest warriors that they were too old to be useful to me, but I won't let them retire or have kids, oh no, they're going to continue to work for me until I find them dead in their bed. When others began to complain, I build some Sagewrights to improve the learning speed of my giant talking cup and I began my Old Age Pensioners working scheme. Sure, they'd die every few years, but plenty more Urdas where that came from.\n\nAfter a few hundred years, I found my bloodlines were flourishing nicely; the subsidation of viagra had helped many 60 year old men breed with their young brides, which is totally okay, because I am the King/Emperor. We had many kids and I would take these children and send them off to work for me their entire lives.\n\nOccasionally, I would have to make a choice. Like a peasants riot; however, as I am the King and without me, everyone dies, I can just tell them to shove it and continue and life will go on. I had an issue with an ostrich that ended so poorly that a third of my kingdom was swallowed by the ocean of evil, so apparently we may be Austrialian.\n\nAfter a while, I quickly discovered that covering Caberjacks in Bone armour, pried from the dying flesh of our eternal enemy and given massive hammers made of time monsters who would release bees from their armpits when an enemy sneezed near them and would suck health out of the newby enemies via stones made from the juice of fallen enemies were rather over powered and broke the game.\n\nAlternatively, I discovered that Hunters could wear Harry Potter's invisibility cloak and massacre the entire enemy force without being seen and broke the game again.\n\nAlchemists, however, suck.\n\nThere are mixed classes; Alchemist prove their worth by shagging the Caberjacks and making their wood highly explosive to the touch. There is also a stealth wood-waving maniac, and a Hunter who can shoot grenades at such little damage he may as well attach a message insulting their parentage.\n\nAnyway, I have to deal with this for 300 years. The same combats, people constantly dying and being replaced by their children, a random choice occasionally destroying half of my kingdom, and my cup yelling at people about its lack of arms.\n\nIt's a good thing I'm immortal, or I'd kill myself.","October 2, 2015","true","24.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","5","8","4","0"

It quickly abandons you as you start to progress through the 300 year war. The combat while not extremely challenging or varied is enjoyable throughout your first play through. The random events come semi frequently and offer a lot of possibilities. During my second play through I used the wiki to look at the outcomes just to see the potential of each situation and was pleased by the range and pros and cons of each decision. I found the art style very hit and miss but I can't fault the game nor praise it either. The music was appropriate and enjoyable to listen to while playing but the two "voices" of the chalice I found incredibly annoying and within 30 minutes of playing dropped their volume to nothing and used subtitles instead.\n\nI had a few issues with Massive Chalice besides the annoyance mentioned above. I was really hoping for more from the eugenics side of this game. It's not often that a concept like this comes up, especially within gaming. I found the pairing / breeding system of the game at best disappointing both in the long and short term game. The 300 year war isn't long enough to selectively breed a really decent army and for the "hero's", the best of the population. Undesirable traits seam fairly common. I really thought there would be a lot more depth and variety in the actual game play. Instead of fighting the same 5 or so enemy types on different maps in different combinations and numbers constantly throughout the game. Finally without spoiling anything I found the end of the war to be anticlimactic.\n\nI mostly enjoyed my first play through of the game even after restarting about 175 years into the war due to some poor prior planning. My second play through was dull before I had even clicked start, I got to 200 years and stopped because I realised I had not been enjoying it at all. I think Massive Chalice had some great ideas and seamed great from the outside and while enjoyable the first time around, it really didn't deliver what I had expected from the game.\n\nIf you enjoyed the eugenics side of games like Crusader Kings 2 this game might give you a bit more (but not greatly) of what you are after but besides that, it's a dull game with great ideas and great random events but that's it. Buy it on sale, it's worth $5 at the most. 6.5/10","January 7","true","41.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

An IMMENSE amount of customization in HOW the game unfolds.  There is no "right way" to play Massive Chalice, but all the ways you'll try will feel balanced to perfection.\n\nI absolutely LOVE this game.\nMassive Chalice is unlike any other strategy/tactics game I've ever played.  Originally, I was intrigued by the description promising different forms of strategy combined with a standard tile-based tactics system.  However, I had no idea how complex theses elements would be, and the result is a truly unique, pleasantly deep game.\n\nThe game is split between battles and planning stages, but the "planning" isn't as simple as outfitting heroes with gear, or leveling up attributes.  You can do all these things, but additionally, you actually have to populate your army by mating your heroes in hopes they are fertile enough to produce babies.  The offspring inherit traits of the parents, and can form unique classes based on how you mix the parents' classes.  Also, be sure to keep an eye on the age of your heroes, because unlike any other strat game I've ever played, your heroes actually die of old age.  You'll want to continue their bloodlines, and take advantage of relics (super-weapons) that can be passed down through bloodlines.\nThen on top of this there are random events, choice of what battles to fight, options to retire heroes for use in research and general army-level boosts, structured all around a "passing timeline" which beautifully incorporated into a consistent style.\n\nIn addition to the typical grid based battle system like so many turn-based strat games, I found an astounding number of "new ideas" for weapons, attacks, skills, environments, etc.  Example:  One environment/map-type has tall weeds you can hide in to increase your evasion.  This is nothing new to strategy games--tall grass/mountains/swamp tile, etc always make it harder to hit you... but in Massive Chalice, these weeds only show up in ONE environment-type--it's the ONLY time you find a tile that increases your evasion.  I took advantage of these weeds twice, in 25 hours of play.  Each bio-style has its own little exploit.  Some I like more than others.  But it completely keeps the turn based battles from getting repetitive.\nAnother example:  There's a weapon that has a chance to knock an enemy "into the future"; you don't understand at first what this means, but then, (years :P) later, during your NEXT battle, those enemies show up and hopefully you're more prepared this time.\nAnd this is just one weapon you can research to develop--that is, if you want to research weapons at all.  I got to the end of the game only ever researching 2 things from the "items" category (health potion, and health buff) and never got to try the other 15+ items...\nAnd I know next time I play through, I can focus my research into a different category and completely change the way the game is played.  And the nice thing is, I WANT to play again.  Especially now that I'm becoming more of an expert in the game's mechanics.\n\nLastly, art is SUPERB, music never dull or repetitive, story/depth feels personalized and is never disappointing, reply value is definitely there.  There isn't really any "fluff" in this game.  Everything has been refined to perfection.\n\nThe ONLY criticism I'd have for this game:  Sometimes it'd have been nice to play through battles at 2x speed.  If you had the option to speed up an enemy reveal, or enemy turn phase, this would be cool.  But really, that's it.  It'd be cool.\n\nIf you've been bored with new developments in tile-based strat games (but still love them) you will be over-whelminging engaged by this game.","September 24, 2015","true","32.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/246110/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nWe are alone and surrounded. The Cadence never rests and their sole purpose is to destroy us. But there is a glimmer of hope, an ancient relic that can wipe out our demonic enemy once and for all. However, it will take three hundred years to charge up the divine chalice to have enough power to destroy the Cadence. During those three hundred years, your heroes will live, fight, reproduce and die. As an immortal ruler, you will remain vigilant. You cannot leave the keep or the chalice, but you can oversee the entire land and dictate everything.\n\nThis is the premise of Massive Chalice, Double Fine’s fantasy turn-based strategy easiest described as a mix between XCOM’s tactical battles and Crusader King’s marital simulation. But it’s not quite as simple as that. The way those two elements come together is what really sets Massive Chalice apart. You start off with a central keep that houses the chalice and five royal families. In the rest of the provinces you can build further keeps and assign your heroes to them. Their duty as regents will be to procreate and thus provide new heroes in order to sustain the centuries-spanning battle against the Cadence. You can also build two separate keeps that will either provide research bonuses or faster training of young heroes. Heroes assigned as regents, sagewrights or standards cannot fight so you constantly have to bear in mind that you need at least five battle-ready heroes. This is a bit tricky at first because deaths are permanent and heroes will die both in combat and of natural causes.\n\nThere are three main hero classes. Hunters are ranged specialists, Alchemists are great for crowd control as they carry explosive flasks and Caberjacks deal damage with brute melee force. Each class has two sub-classes which you gain by marrying different main classes. Also, every class and sub-class has their own unique skill tree. For example, a Trickshot is an offspring of a Hunter regent and an Alchemist partner and has the unique ability to fire off a long-range explosive flask using his/her bow and arrow. Apart from that, each hero has positive and negative physical attributes and personality traits which they can potentially transfer to their children. So you will want to pay attention as to who you’re marrying as it will influence the class and traits of your future heroes. You don’t want to find yourself two hundred years into the fight with nothing but sickly, nearsighted, drunk heroes or even worse, lacking a vital class.\n\nThe enemies also come in a range of shapes and sizes with different abilities. Some will run up to you and explode, some will shoot from a distance and stun your heroes whereas others have the ability to spawn additional minions and throw explosive substances. In a rather unique twist, one type of enemy will actually age your heroes while dealing damage. This could potentially lead to your hero dying of age, not by damage, on the battlefield. Even if they survive the battle, they will most likely die soon after. That’s where your research comes in. Over the years you can assign various research and develop better armor, weapons and items that negate the aging attack, among others. The battles take place on grid-based procedurally generated maps. The battle system isn’t the deepest out there, but it is engaging and satisfying enough to quench that tactical itch.\n\nAnother unique aspect of the game are relics. Once a particularly valiant hero passes away, their weapon may become a relic that can be passed down through generations, but only within that bloodline. Throughout the years, the relic itself will gain experience points and become more and more powerful. As the ruler, you will also be tasked to solve random problems or situations similar to the ones in The Banner Saga. I’m not sure if I just had really bad luck, but almost every choice had horrible repercussions. A few times my choice didn’t lead to any change at all and I never managed to resolve a situation in such a way to get something good out of it. But the biggest problem I had with this feature was that, unlike in The Banner Saga, it just felt impersonal, distant and irrelevant. I didn’t feel the plight of the people and I wasn’t immersed into those more whimsical situations.\n\nThe game’s presentation is absolutely great. What stood out to me the most was the superb soundtrack which hits just the right notes. It has a bit of a melancholic vibe to it which makes sense in the grand scheme of things as you will see dozens and dozens of your heroes die over three centuries. The art style is very nice as well. The environments looks lush and beautiful, the colorful enemy designs are wholly unique as well. Ironically, it’s the heroes that visually lack personality, they seem too plain and bland. Also, male and female models are actually quite difficult to tell apart.\n\nDouble Fine needed this. The famed independent developer lost quite a bit of good will recently as Broken Age didn’t turn out as people expected and the less said about Spacebase DF-9, the better. Massive Chalice is a step in the right direction to regain people’s trust. But even if you disregard all that, Massive Chalice is a great strategy game in its own right with an engaging combat system, engrossing marital simulation and stellar presentation.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","June 30, 2015","true","19.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Says it is cosmetic, but one of the families I picked out, they all fell over dead before I hit 20 years into the game.\n\nEven on Normal the game does not slow this down for you or really give you time to get your teeth sank in before it decides to kill your heroes, your heirs, everyone.

There are a ton of variables you need to master in order to win, and the game is stacked firmly against you in every way in regards to the amount of enemies, their powers, your limitations, etc... Also, there's too much random stuff happening (heroes dying, especially) for you to get a real grasp on what's going on.\n\nIf you're spending 40 hours per week gaming and don't mind running a spreadsheet to keep track of what's going on (what regent has what powers, family trees, and so on), then you can probably, eventually, get somewhere with this game. For me, I'm a few days in and I'm done with it. Here's what I think it needs to make it better:\n\na. Variable difficulty settings. Seriously. Spending five hours trying to manipulate bloodlines before getting decimated by an onslaught isn't fun.\n\nb. More items to research to improve your heroes. You shouldn't have to kill three missions worth of something to then research better weapons. Or anything else to level the field. The monsters with level drain and nearly perfect ranged accuracy who show up from level one need to be fought with something better than a puny hunter with 28% accuracy.\n\nc. Less stuff to keep track of. Is there a reason that I'm made aware of babies, trainees, and heroes? I can't tell if this is necessary to know or not in any practical sense. I either have enough heroes when I'm attacked or I don't. Do I need to know how many heroes I'll have in 15 more years? Why am I shown infertile partner choices when a keep needs a regent? Why is it sometimes a fertile partner and a fertile regent can't have children?\n\nd. More ways to keep your heroes alive longer. Is there some sort of immortality mechanism later? I don't know because I've never made it that far, nor do I intend to.\n\nIn all, unless your idea of a good time is studying a game for hours, taking a lot of notes, and doing a little bit of finite math in the bargain, then buying this game probably isn't a good idea. I certainly wouldn't have bought it had I known it was like so.","November 22, 2014","false","9.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

Every fiber of this game is seamlessly woven together to create a deep and engaging title that stands out among the rest. I highly recommend this product if you're a fan of the genre. You will not be dissapointed.\n\nAlso, considering this is ONLY an Alpha at this stage, expect a lot more improvements and content.","November 16, 2014","true","7.1"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","0"

One key area that it differs from XCom is in the makeup of your team, each character may only get to battle 4 or 5 times at best, assuming they survive, as the game is set up to run over 300 years. Your characters age and die, with a battle coming up once every ten years. This leads to you having to work with what you've got in front of you, rather than just send out the same elite team again and again. You'll also want to adapt the team based on what type of enemy you're up against. Also in line with XCom, you have to research new tech, and there is plenty of exciting stuff to discover there. The tactical battles have varied environments specific to the region of the map you are fighting on, and the range of opponents seems quite large, with each being very different to the other, and certain types that you will come to dread. This part of the game flows quickly, the view is perhaps a little clunky (90 degree rotation only), but for the most part I am happy with it. There have been plenty of moments during this part of the game that have had me swearing very loudly due to misfortune, the first time you flask one of your own high level characters will make you think very carefully before you take a similar action in future.\n\nThe game adopts some ideas from Crusader Kings, characters have various traits that they can pass on to their progeny if you assign them as a regent. This is pretty key, and provides you with a steady flow of new characters to use as you see fit (there are a couple of other non combat roles also). Your keeps can even be invaded, which is a hideously tense battle as your regent and their partner take part in the battle. You'll probably be tempted to get them into the action. You probably shouldn't. Every few years you get some multiple choice events, which can lead to nice bonuses when they go right, and characters dying when they go wrong. Never game breaking but potentially disasterous if you lose a key figure. Over the course of the game, you'll also wind up with powerful artifacts to hand down the generations, intringuingly the artifacts also level up, which is a very neat idea.\n\nI've made it half way through the 300 years so far, and although the game is seemingly repetetive, I am finding the short tactical battles (10-15 minutes) compelling, and whenever one finishes I am always very keen to see my next research item completed and to make other decisions until the next battle crops up. The game maintains a nice level of tension and I suspect it will get very tight towards the end of that 300 year sequence. I've no idea what happens at the end yet mind you, but I've seen enough of the game to know that it is right up my street, it certainly has it's hooks more into me than the other recent game in this vein, Invisible Inc.","June 13, 2015","true","8.8"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","26","50","0","0"

It's good.\n\nI remember wishing while I played X-COM: Enemy Unknown that there would be some fantasy equivilent at some point. Massive Chalice does a great job being that and setting itself apart at the same time. While X-COM does offer more tactical and strategic options throughout its gameplay, MC offers a more overall compelling gaming experience.\n\nThe ability to build dynasties and manage them throughout the course of generations is unique, and something that is quite enjoyable. Breeding in good traits into your various lineages and breeding out bad adds a strategic element I've not encounted in any other game previously. The occasional story elements that pop up while you are advancing the timeline that cause you to make a decision about the management of your kingdom and dynasties is akin to the decisions in The Banner Saga, though definitely less morally heavy.\n\nThe strategic combats are also quite interesting, made more so by unique enemies and the ability to research (over the course of years) new items, weapons, and armor to use on the battlefield. One con is that you do get used to seeing the same handful of foes used over and over again, though this doesn't get tiresome. They remain challenging throughout gameplay.\n\nSomething I've noticed is that it may take a game or two to make it through to the endgame of Massive Chalice. If you find yourself starting over, don't despair, this is natural, and from those I've spoken with, it happens. You're not the only one. It does allow you to hone your strategies for the next playthrough and learn the system just a bit better.\n\nOne last con for the game over all harkens to my initial comparison to X-COM. There is no real customization of the houses that you see throughout the course of the game as they are all predetermined by Kickstarter backers. While it is true that your heroes are very expendable, a feature that allowed you to at least make your own houses and mottos would have been a nice tip of the hat. This is just an aesthetic grievance, and nothign that distracts from how wonderful the game truly is.\n\nTL;DR: Massive Chalice is wonderful. Go buy it. I've bought it twice.\n\n9.5/10","June 12, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mitch0712/recommended/246110/","Mitch0712","Mitch | ﾐｯﾁ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mitch0712/","558 products in account","Double Fine has created a game that is a combination of XCOM-style tactics games, and Game of Thrones-style bloodlines system.  The game switches between those two parts throughout the game as you are constantly trying to ward off “The Cadence” and keep your several families’ bloodlines alive and ever growing. The Cadence is a hoard of decay that has surrounded your kingdom. They will attack sections of your land a few times every decade. And most of the times they attack, you have to pick only one section to save. The other sections will then be afflicted by the enemy.  The different types of enemies represent different effects of time on the mind or body.  Some enemies make your heroes forget their combat experience. Others might add five years to a hero’s age with every attack.  I’ve even had heroes die of old age in battle because of this!\n\nMassive Chalice spans a timeline of 300 years.  As an immortal omnipresent ruler, you will watch generations upon generations of your people live and die in battle or of old age.  You will research armor, weapons, and accessories for your combat team, “The Vanguard.”  You can also construct various buildings for things like housing families or to speed up the leveling of your trainees. All of your research and building takes years to complete.  You have to choose wisely because time is always afflicting your heroes with age.  When they get old, they are less effective in combat and become less fertile.  This can get out of control if all of a sudden you’re trying to defend your kingdom with white-haired, frail heroes having traits like Puny, Nearsighted, and Arthritis.  You also need to pair the right heroes together at a good time inside a Keep.  This will allow them to produce children for the future.\n\nThe art in Massive Chalice is a bit hard to enjoy.  Some parts of the game look beautiful, like the vibrant environments when you’re in combat.  But the basic models of the heroes still look unpolished.  A lot of the game still has a placeholder look.  There might have been some compromises Double Fine had to make with their Kickstarter money.  It’s not an ugly game by any means.  But it also doesn’t pop at all.  The music in the game however, is really great.  There’s some well-fitting drums and string instruments in the soundtrack that kept me in the moment during combat.\n\nJuggling the two focuses, combat and bloodlines, in Massive Chalice is what makes it hard to put down.  Watching your research timers tick down to completion, leveling up your heroes in combat, passing down family relics to future generations, and trying to perfect the genetics of your houses is quite unique.  Massive Chalice offers a very different take on the turn-based strategy genre by making you have to really think about the effects of time.\n\n4/5","June 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In general, for any game, the player’s heroes need to gain stats at the same rate the monsters do.  If the player’s stats lag, the game is too hard, if the player’s stats leap ahead of the monsters, the game is too easy.  This game works on the same balancing concept except that instead of leveling the heroes, you are leveling the Keep.  Heroes get married and produce children in the Keep that inherit some of the stats from the Keep.\n\nThere are about 30 battles in a game, approximately 1 every 10 years.  The average hero can fight from age 16 till his death around age 65 – at most 6 battles.  Then he (and his personal stats) are lost forever and a new hero takes his place.\n\nThe game is about using the hero’s temporary life span to contribute to the improved stats of the Keep/Bloodline fast enough to keep up with the monster’s increase in their stats.  If you can do this really well, you should set the game to Brutal, which makes the monster’s stats better quicker and your stats go up slower.  If you are having trouble keeping up with the monsters, you reduce the difficulty to Hard or Normal.\n\nImproving Keep Stats:\nThis is the fun of the game, I've been playing about 3 days and my longest game is 106 years, so I'm still just getting going, but here's what I've learned early on:\n\n+ If a hero fights in a lot of battles during his life (4+), he has a chance to produce a relic.  This relic in the form of a weapon etc. is passed on from one hero to one other hero and itself levels.\n\n+ Heroes that marry have traits and personalities that can pass on to the kids.  At the beginning of the game most of your heroes have really bad traits, but by carefully selecting the heroes to marry, you slowly select for only the good traits, and the bad traits fall away.\n\n+ When you build a crucible(s) you can make your highest level heroes a Standard, and then all the heroes that are born (ages 0-15) get a yearly experience boost based on the Standard’s level.  That way your new heroes start at a higher level.\n\n+ And of course, Research can boost stats\n\n+ Use your heroes with the best stats for marriage. Almost any hero can win the first few battles, so it's better to invest heroes with good traits in a marriage.\n\nGraphics are good.  Camera controls are good.  Game seems crash proof.  The AI is not the best.  This is not the best turn-based battle game. The fun in this game is learning how to increase your stats even though your heroes keep dying off.","June 7, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has tons of replayability and provides an amazing value for its cost.\n\nThe long version is that I wish this game was more. There is so much potential here and the basic idea of the game is incredibly engaging. You play as a immortal ruler and manage bloodlines that are born and quickly fade, new heroes growing and dying over and over again. Managing keeps and making decisions based on traits is central to the experience and it is by far the best part of the game. The combat is repetitive, but fun, with a slow ramping up of difficulty that makes it feel worth continuing.\n\nThe problem with this game is that so much of the potential is wasted. One of the central mechanics is random events, where something occurs and you get to make a decision with will generate a postive or negative outcome. What almost always happens is something completely random, regardless of what kind of decision you try to make. It feels punishing and without any strategic merit. Instead of making decisions you are pressing a random number generator and likely facing a random punishment that may or may not have any kind of logical connection to the event itself. The events could easily have added an entire layer of strategy, but instead they are pointless and eventually you end up save scumming constantly and just pretending they don't exist. I hate them so much.\n\nAnother issue is you very rarely get to make decisions about anything other than breeding. It is such a missed opportunity to allow players to make decisions about the vast roster of heroes at your disposal. Instead of sending parties of heroes off to achieve objectives, you instead have random events and a vast roster of B list heroes that do nothing but slowly die off.\n\nThis game is worth buying, despite any flaws, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactical squad based combat games. But I will always be disappointed that the great game mechanics that exist were not used to make a much better game.","June 5, 2015","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game tries at every angle to make it impossible for you to build a strong base of heroes. The odds of creating good bloodlines is low, maintaining them is even harder because they grow old much too fast too often. Half way through the game, your bloodlines are hardly producing children. The real way you want to setup, is to get 4 Keeps, 3 of these for your classes, and the fourth purely for creating good marriage mates for your Regents.  This is the best way I have figured out to outmaneuver this game mechanic. Still, there are other ways the game will put roadblocks on your progress. It will take your best heroes, and add "Life Choices" to them, and by the way, the same answer never always works, and that means your heroes will get bad trait consequences set on them, for example Depression, and Nihilism. So your stuck with poorer heroes churning out low quality heroes. We are not even getting into the battle mechanics, where half way through the game, the monsters start to do crazy things to overwhelm your forces. Sure, its challenging and could be fun except for the fact that they get noticeably stronger and duplicate themselves or make your heroes age with every hit so that they literally die of old age in battle. The combination of these elements did not make frustrated so much as feel like there was no truly rewarding experience for my progress - and that's the problem I have with the game ultimately. It's not a journey that you will take with your empire whereby you made wise and intellgent decisions to give you the edge your deserve, no, its more like an endurance race to the end of the time period where you can finally rest from the onlought of unlucky tribulations you escaped by the skin of your teeth. Like I said, I enjoy challenges, but not when the games AI is making things blatantly unfair.","February 4","false","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has tons of replayability and provides an amazing value for its cost.\n\nThe long version is that I wish this game was more. There is so much potential here and the basic idea of the game is incredibly engaging. You play as a immortal ruler and manage bloodlines that are born and quickly fade, new heroes growing and dying over and over again. Managing keeps and making decisions based on traits is central to the experience and it is by far the best part of the game. The combat is repetitive, but fun, with a slow ramping up of difficulty that makes it feel worth continuing.\n\nThe problem with this game is that so much of the potential is wasted. One of the central mechanics is random events, where something occurs and you get to make a decision with will generate a postive or negative outcome. What almost always happens is something completely random, regardless of what kind of decision you try to make. It feels punishing and without any strategic merit. Instead of making decisions you are pressing a random number generator and likely facing a random punishment that may or may not have any kind of logical connection to the event itself. The events could easily have added an entire layer of strategy, but instead they are pointless and eventually you end up save scumming constantly and just pretending they don't exist. I hate them so much.\n\nAnother issue is you very rarely get to make decisions about anything other than breeding. It is such a missed opportunity to allow players to make decisions about the vast roster of heroes at your disposal. Instead of sending parties of heroes off to achieve objectives, you instead have random events and a vast roster of B list heroes that do nothing but slowly die off.\n\nThis game is worth buying, despite any flaws, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactical squad based combat games. But I will always be disappointed that the great game mechanics that exist were not used to make a much better game.","June 5, 2015","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mitch0712/recommended/246110/","Mitch0712","Mitch | ﾐｯﾁ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mitch0712/","558 products in account","Double Fine has created a game that is a combination of XCOM-style tactics games, and Game of Thrones-style bloodlines system.  The game switches between those two parts throughout the game as you are constantly trying to ward off “The Cadence” and keep your several families’ bloodlines alive and ever growing. The Cadence is a hoard of decay that has surrounded your kingdom. They will attack sections of your land a few times every decade. And most of the times they attack, you have to pick only one section to save. The other sections will then be afflicted by the enemy.  The different types of enemies represent different effects of time on the mind or body.  Some enemies make your heroes forget their combat experience. Others might add five years to a hero’s age with every attack.  I’ve even had heroes die of old age in battle because of this!\n\nMassive Chalice spans a timeline of 300 years.  As an immortal omnipresent ruler, you will watch generations upon generations of your people live and die in battle or of old age.  You will research armor, weapons, and accessories for your combat team, “The Vanguard.”  You can also construct various buildings for things like housing families or to speed up the leveling of your trainees. All of your research and building takes years to complete.  You have to choose wisely because time is always afflicting your heroes with age.  When they get old, they are less effective in combat and become less fertile.  This can get out of control if all of a sudden you’re trying to defend your kingdom with white-haired, frail heroes having traits like Puny, Nearsighted, and Arthritis.  You also need to pair the right heroes together at a good time inside a Keep.  This will allow them to produce children for the future.\n\nThe art in Massive Chalice is a bit hard to enjoy.  Some parts of the game look beautiful, like the vibrant environments when you’re in combat.  But the basic models of the heroes still look unpolished.  A lot of the game still has a placeholder look.  There might have been some compromises Double Fine had to make with their Kickstarter money.  It’s not an ugly game by any means.  But it also doesn’t pop at all.  The music in the game however, is really great.  There’s some well-fitting drums and string instruments in the soundtrack that kept me in the moment during combat.\n\nJuggling the two focuses, combat and bloodlines, in Massive Chalice is what makes it hard to put down.  Watching your research timers tick down to completion, leveling up your heroes in combat, passing down family relics to future generations, and trying to perfect the genetics of your houses is quite unique.  Massive Chalice offers a very different take on the turn-based strategy genre by making you have to really think about the effects of time.\n\n4/5","June 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

She had exceptional agility. Excellent sight and she was quick. She was so eager to join the battle. Great things were planned for her. She was destined to gain battle experience, become the creator of House Fletcher relic and then the Standard at The Crucible or maybe a Regent, if she would still be able to bear children when her parents would pass away. At the age of 19years she went out to protect the borders against the Cadence scum under a protective wing of her mother's sister - Jessica. A mission like many before.\n\nNoone expected how accurate the Bulwark's projectiles would be on that day. Amber died defending the borders of her motherland, her body riddled with holes was brought home by her aunt, who would later become a Standard herself.\nHer uncle Michael who was heavily hungover that day, or maybe still drunk after a night before, was sent to The Guild to become a Sagewright. He would never see battle again. Nor his family, for whom it was all the better.\n\nMassive Chalice is a system creating stories. It gives you tools you need to create your heroes, and then it doesn't give you total control over how your tools work. Your choices are not always what defines the outcome of a given situation. Sometimes things depend on chance. Fate if you will.\n\nYou might hover close to defeat. Losing all your heroes in a hopeless battle, to go on 20 years without anyone able to fight, waiting for the children to grow up and then when time comes you'll need to defend against an invasion with three teenagers who barely have level 2 and under 10hp each. You can still prevail if you use them wisely. They will gain experience, in time, they will become Regents of their respective houses. And when their time comes. They too will pass away.\n\nYour heroes will die in this game. They will have children, grandchildren, they will have traits that are positive, neutral or totally negative. You wont have your perfect party built out of them, but you will have some characters that are unusually authentic. They might be sickly, asthmatic, they might be shortsighted. All the positive and negative traits mixed together make the experience a bit like a novel, story-wise.\n\nUltimately, Massive Chalice is a game about challange. You're given pieces.

But I can see that if I WANT  to focus on that side of the game properly, mastering would feel satisfying.\n\nGreat game because the way they handled turn based tactic. It has some similar game mechanics like UFO but has actually very little to do with UFO at all. They are just similar genre, that all.","June 24, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Being a turn based strategy fan(X-Com acolyte, Fire Emblem slave, etc) I was actually pretty excited about Massive Chalice.  The reviews are good, it has all the flavor of a DoubleFine game which to me is one of their best selling points, and it seemed like a unique and interesting take on the genre - I was a fool. A FOOL!  DoubleFine's honeyed potion suckered me in again, and I wish it hadn't.\n\nThe idea is neat - generations of heroes who you can choose to rule, run guilds or fight - and worth elaborating on.  The idea that your heroes have flaws and perks, and you can choose over time how your heroes evolve via bloodlines?  Brilliant. Building and researching and making new items and using unique buildings is, in theory, a great way to spend some time. However, this game is - like most other DoubleFine titles recently - incredibly shallow and gimmicky.  Their titles seem to rely solely on one or two gameplay mechanics and play more like tech demos instead of full fledged games; battles come at random intervals(really?  Are we still doing random battles in the 2010s?) as your kingdom progresses - and when it shows up, instead of something you get jazzed about playing through, the combat is slow, sloggy and boring.  You have very few options(hit a thing, shoot a thing, throw a bomb, or lesser-damage variations of those themes that include knockback), and even your hybrid class characters are lame mishmashes of their predecessors - would you like a shooty guy that also throws potions?  Or a potion guy that also hits things?  Or how about a thing-hitty guy that also sometimes shoots?  And every time I got a new thing researched and got excited for the gameplay to evolve... it just didn't.  Then it was wait some more, more boring combat, wait some more, more boring combat, repeat ad nauseum.\n\nThere are no incentives for furthering the bloodlines or making hybrid heroes since they all feel the same anyway: minor variations on the basic melee/range/support classes of stereotypes past.  Even researching new tech in this game - which should be a slam dunk for ANY game of this type - falls flat, as you can only research one thing at a time AND the thing researched generally doesn't add any gameplay value.  Slightly stronger weapons/armor/heals, items with negligible and limited use during gameplay.\n\nIf you want a game that is an occasional 45 minute time waster when there's nothing else to do, go for Massive Chalice.  If you want a well thought out and executed turn based strategy game, look elsewhere; Massive Chalice is the shovelware title with the pretty, primary colors that grandma buys fromthe bargain bin for Christmas.  It should come packaged with a generic hidden objects game and a collect-a-thon mascot platformer, to round out the experience.","January 24","false","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Massive Chalice is strange, quirky, interesting, and one of a kind.\n\nIt's get compared to X-Com, and that is not in itself wrong, but it feels completely different.  LIke X-Com, you have both the Strategic Layer, and the Tactical Turn Based combat system.  The difference is the scale is much more massive.  You are playing an imortal ruler and the game takes place over 300 years, with each fight taking place often decades after the last ones.  This means while your heroes level up and gain skills like an RPG, you aren't really leveling them up.  You are leveling up their bloodline.\n\nThat's the unique thing here.  You can build keeps and then retire two of your heroes from battle to establish a bloodline.  They won't fight any more and can't normally level up any further, but they will pass on their experience and levels to their children as well as various personalities and traits.  You can also pull heroes from the field to be trainers, further boosting their xp and augmenting their traits and to increase your reseach.\n\nAs your heroes only get to fight one or two battles before they grow old and die, it's all about getting them up a few levels, retiring them to pass that knowledge on to the next generation, and engineering a class of heroes with the best traits and abilities.\n\nThere's a few more thing, but that's the gist of it.  Go in treating it like a typical combat game with RPG elements and you will get frustrated.  Treat it like the completely unique thing that it is, and you will enjoy it.","May 29","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I needed something new to play, and I really had an desire to play Final Fantasy Tactics again, but that's one of the few FF games not yet released on PC. So, I googled "Games Like Final Fantasy Tactics" and this was one of the first hits. The battle gameplay is very similar to FFT, though because of the limited number of classes, it's probably more like Banner Saga. But the overall strategy map is what makes this game interesting and different. The game plays out over 300 years, with 2-5 years elapsing between events. You have to marry your hero characters to make more hero characters, and the skills/genetics of the heroes married reflects in the quality of future generations. You only end up getting 3-4 battles with a hero before they die, so it's an interesting mechanic, and it's been a fun ride so far.","October 14, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VaultBoy13/recommended/246110/","VaultBoy13","VaultBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VaultBoy13/","218 products in account","Massive Chalice is a fantasy version of X-COM where you fight a 300 year war to hold back the Cadence until an ultimate weapon can be unleashed againt it. You build keeps to establish bloodlines from your heroes, these bloodlines allow you to breed better heroes for future battles and pass down relics, which are special weapons that level up in combat.\n\nYou also build crucibles that allow you to assign a hero as a trainer for other heroes. Trainers provide experience to level up the heroes as well as pass along personality traits. There are also sage guilds which aid in research and construction of buildings.\n\nAny heroes assigned as the regent of a keep, trainer of a crucible, or as a sage cannot be used in battles against the Cadence. This makes heroes an interesting resource. There are times when sacrificing a hero to pass a long their genetics to the next generation, despite them being the best option for a hero in battle. Or, you might not put the highest experienced hero in the crucible, because you don't want his personality being passed down to the other heroes.\n\nThe game doesn't have the strategic or tactical depth of X-COM, but it does offer a good range of tactical options. I would recommend putting the game on a harder difficulty than normal, since normal is a walk in the park with some class balance issues.\n\nBattles occur about once every 10 years with the last 30 years having them occur more frequently. This means you'll have 30-40 battles in that time. Heroes die of old age after about 60-70 years, so your roster for battles will change multiple times.\n\nThe game does have a few downsides. The first being the lack of enemy diversity. There are about 8 different enemies, each having a stronger version later in the game, but the game could really use a few more.\n\nThe next issue is research. The majority of the research isn't necessary. There's a large variety of things you can research, but it either doesn't sound that interesting or helpful. Especially, when the healing potions are the main items you'll be taking with you to battle.\n\nThe events, while adding some flavor, are really just an RNG. The RNG of these events can cause two lands that are on the brink to succumb to the Cadence. Or you can get a bonus trait. The main problem is that you have no idea what you're risking with your decisions which makes your decisions even more random.\n\nThe last issue is there's not a whole lot of choice when the Cadence attacks. Whatever land is the most threatened, from prior attacks, is the one that you defend. The only time the choice and rewards really matter is when both lands have the same threat level, or you're only able to save one land. This isn't unique to the game, as X-COM had a similar problem when assessing the alien invasions.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game that anyone bored with X-COM should take a look at. Even more so if you're interested in a fantasy take with some interesting genetics and personality mechanics.","July 19, 2015","true","37.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And Massive Chalice is pretty close to being very good.\n\nFirst of all, if you enjoyed XCOM, you'll enjoy Massive Chalice. It's got the strategic and tactical layering. It's got the persistence. It's got the simplified, board-game-like rules that allow emergent tactical depth. It's got the skill trees and the soldier nicknames. It's got the panic levels. It adds the bloodline mechanic, where you combine your soldiers together to try and found a family of supersoldiers. Also, it's funny as heck. Definitely pick it up during a sale or something.\n\nWhere Massive Chalice falls short of being great, though, is failing to go all the way with its new idea. In XCOM, you get attached to and invest in your troops. Massive Chalice wants you to do that, but after two or three battles with any given soldier...they reach old age. I wish Massive Chalice had gone out of its way to get you attached to the *houses,* instead of the individuals in them. I would have loved to see a family tree in each house, with important or venerated house members highlighted. (Battle veterans, Standards, partners and regents, or people who were involved in game events. They could even blank out Sagewrights entirely, so that "Sagewrights must forsake all family ties" actually had meaning.) As another example, two of my houses got into a feud. Did I hear songs about how the other house stunk when I click on the first house's keep? Did house members take advantage of the chaos of battle to murder each other? No, there was just a minor penalty to accuracy if feuding house members were in battle together.\n\nThe other thing that XCOM did much better than Massive Chalice was to give the plot a sense of progression with well-times changes in objectives and cutscenes that shifted the player's priorities and focus. Massive Chalice just tells you the goal at the beginning, and...that's it. Get to the end.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, and if you have the imagination to fill in those blanks, you'll really enjoy it. Personally, I think the game world is rich for expansion, and I'd like to see more. (Hopefully including some features to differentiate the great houses in meaningful ways, too)!","July 2, 2015","true","22.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The dialouge tries to be witty and is centered around the two sides/characters of the chalice.  None of the lines are amusing and even worse they often repeat their banter.     As for the game-play it's basically a poor man's X-com  lacking any real fun in the battles and the lack of intresting enemy types leaves much to be desired.    Even worse is the maps are all really small but the slow battle speed makes them run longer than they need to.\n\nThe lineage system is the only idea that really stands out compared to games similar to this.   But that itself is limited basically you force marriages and try to pop out as many kids as possible.  Those that marry are never to actually be used again other than for breeding and training their offspring.   When they die you replace them handing a new couple the same fate.\n\nOld heroes are best to be made into sages but this becomes annoying and real fast. Because of their age and collected experince they tend to be best suited for this job on the flip side they die so quickly due to being old.  So I find myself changing these people more than any other non-combat task.\n\nAlthough there are techically more than 3 classes  there is a primary three and they are all boring. Your standard archer type,  alchemist who lobs bombs but are limited in amount and become useless when all are consumed,  and melee with basically a battering ram type weapon more suited for busting down a door than practical combat use  who brings unpredictable and unreliable results.    Most of the time I just go with all archers if I can as it by far brings the easiest experience.   The classes are boring and bring nothing to be praised.\n\nUnfortnately this game was gifted to me so i cannot refund it otherwise I most certainly would have.","January 6","false","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There literally is nothing to do but play a watered down X-com combined with watching a boring screensaver.

I needed something new to play, and I really had an desire to play Final Fantasy Tactics again, but that's one of the few FF games not yet released on PC. So, I googled "Games Like Final Fantasy Tactics" and this was one of the first hits. The battle gameplay is very similar to FFT, though because of the limited number of classes, it's probably more like Banner Saga. But the overall strategy map is what makes this game interesting and different. The game plays out over 300 years, with 2-5 years elapsing between events. You have to marry your hero characters to make more hero characters, and the skills/genetics of the heroes married reflects in the quality of future generations. You only end up getting 3-4 battles with a hero before they die, so it's an interesting mechanic, and it's been a fun ride so far.","October 14, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

It was a long ride, but totally worth it.\n\nA lot of people compare this game to XCOM. There are some shared principles, but you should not see it as an alternative to XCOM, because Massive Chalice is different im many aspects.\n\nWhat really makes this game shine is Double Fine's humour. The enemies, the items, the stories, the heroes have some nice touches that are weird in a good way. There is just nothing more awesome than the warm and fuzzy feeling that you get when a Wrinkler hits one of your wünderpants-wearing heroes.\n\nThe management of your kingdom does not require you to do a lot of planning (at least not in normal mode). What could really be improved is the management of heroes, because you will have a hard time remembering them all. It makes sense to use a paper notebook to keep track of your plans of your heroes. One very central problem of the game is that it's much harder to get attached to your heroes than in XCOM, because your heroes can simply die of old age. The relic system tries to compensate for that, but it could be more epic. I still got attached to some of my heroes during my playthrough, but it was much later in the game. But once the attachment is there, it's just awesome to kick ♥♥♥ on the battlefield with your favorite heroes.\n\nThe battles start rather easy, but get a lot tougher in the course of the game. The artificial intelligence is not that clever, but if you don't pay attention, it will still eleminate your heroes with unpleasant efficiency. There were many situations where I really thought that I was screwed but with some thinking and planning I could usually find a way out of the situation. And that was just awesome.\n\nBut even if you fail during battles and lose some or all of your heroes, the game still gives you plenty of chances to recover. It's certainly not too easy (imho) and you can still play on hard mode with iron mode if you like a challenge.\n\nIn a nutshell, you should get this game if you like\n- getting out of sticky situations\n- weird humour\n- Combining traits, items and seeing how things synergize.\n- Round-based battles with lots of positioning and special abilities\n\nYou should not get this game if\n- You are impatient (A battle takes around 30-60 minutes)\n- You want a really complex game\n- You want a deep story","November 1, 2015","true","33.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I bought this game for $10 during the 2015 Steam Summer Sale and I think it was probably a good use of $10.  I really enjoyed my first playthrough, the graphics have a very interesting style, and the characters and monsters show a ton of variation.\n\nThe basic idea is x-com, but with less research and upgrade options, but much better gameplay, much more balanced and interesting combat scenarios and much less random nonsense, and with a natural "retirement" mechanic in which you generally get no more than 3 or 4 combats out of any specific hero.\n\nInstead of getting attached to certain heroes, you get attached to their liniage, raising other members of their family to replace them, etc.\n\nThe game basically gives you no hints regarding build order or strategy, but despite that I beat the game pretty easily the first time on normal difficulty, so I don't think it's too hard or anything.\n\nOverall I think it's a lot of fun and better than X-Com.  I don't know if I see myself playing through it again, but on the other hand I never played through X-Com a second time either so that's not really a huge knock on the game.\n\nI think if you're looking for a lot of depth or options, I"m not sure there's that much here for a 2nd or 3rd playthrough but it's still a good few dozen hours of fun for your money.","June 28, 2015","true","31.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Meaning it isn't, but it's nonetheless a fun twist on an old shtick. The pitch - turn-based combat married to kingdom management in service of fighting a generations-long war against monstrous invaders - is dynamite, and it marries the tactical and strategic layers together better than any other game I've seen. If there's a "but", it's the game's small budget, which shines through pretty noticeably at the nation level. It's not bad so much as it's thin, so for all of Massive Chalice's strengths, it's a much better fit for Fire Emblem or XCOM fans than those of Civilization or Crusader Kings.\n\nThe 300 year timeline immediately sets Massive Chalice apart from your average turn-based strategy, and the best bits are those that reflect it most strongly. Character permadeath isn't new, but zooming out to such a long timeframe makes it an inevitability rather than a fail-state. That gradual, unstoppable changing of the guard ends up being the game's biggest strength, since it ensures that your tactical team's composition is constantly changing. Marriages you make in the kingdom produce different unit types, and you'll also be juggling units' genetic and personality traits, plus the kingdom's greater needs and the particular enemy types being battled. It's dynamic in a way that no other tactical game is. Also praiseworthy are the enemy types. While there aren't many, each functions fundamentally differently, and most are threatening not just for the damage they deal to your heroes, but to the threat they represent to your long-term plans.\n\nThe strategy layer itself is where things fray, unfortunately. The hold-out-until-battles structure is lifted almost wholecloth from XCOM - despite it being unquestionably XCOM's weakest element - and while the addition of dynasty management, legendary weapons, and random events add some spice, the overall experience is frustratingly static. Also not helping matters is the lack of attachment to your heroes, houses, and kingdoms. Watching 300 years drain from the hourglass was always going to distance you from the individual people you're ruling over, but it doesn't feel like you're missing those day-to-day details so much as it feels like they simply don't exist.\n\nAnd ultimately, that's Massive Chalice in a nutshell. The core systems are all there and range from fine to perfect, but it doesn't have the bits of polish that would make it an instant classic. It's very much worth a playthrough, but will not be the kind of game you'll sink thousands of hours into.","November 28, 2015","true","100.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tie23/recommended/246110/","tie23","TiE23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tie23/","271 products in account","Great example of a "Just one more mission I swear" sort of strategy game.\n\nIt's a little odd seeing so many down-thumbs in the user reviews talking mostly about what the game didn't manage to be. I approached it simply as a scaled-down XCOM with a bit of a fun blood-lines system that you would have expected from Rogue Legacy. It seems that a number of the negative reviews are mostly people who expected the moon with their early access game and felt suckered when a neat strategy game didn't transcend to another realm.\n\nNot all games need to blow your mind. But it's something when a game is able to grab me for fifteen hours in just three days.\n\nComparing it to XCOM is shorthand. It's a slimmed down and more pure experience with far fewer annoying bits like resource management and research (though there is some, it's opportunistic), and it's replaced with a system of bloodlines, marriages, babies, and combining classes.\n\nI want to mention that for the first 200 years of the game it's fairly easy once you get a grasp of the mechanics - the first mission I lost two members in the first turn due to carelessness, but after that rarely made similar mistakes. On normal it's quite a bit easier than XCOM, but by the last three battles in the last 50 years or so I was really sweating a number of battles, having to restart a large number of them.\n\nUnlike XCOM I wasn't afraid to let people die in battles. In XCOM I was a bit of a pansy, saving and reloading multiple times in a level, but in the estimated 20-25 battles I faced in the 300 year campaign I at most restarted a level due to some boned headed mistake I couldn't stand to live with. The march of time and the raising of heroes from birth means that you get a steady stream of heroes.\n\nOh, and about the bloodlines concept, this game isn't one you should fret over who's best married to who; with tons of time speculating on stats and perks. I never spent more than 20 seconds deciding on who to marry who or who to take into battle over another.\n\nI believe things could have been improved to make your familes and vaguards more visible on the kingdom screen to help communicate the flow of heroes being born, aged, and buried. Instead I was left viewing most of my families and soldiers as anonymous people until later in the game when two families started to stand out. One was just a family that bred like rabbits and gave me what felt like dozens of caberjacks.\n\nThe other family was one that I ended up cheering on as father to daughter, mother to son, etc etc as time went on producing my star unit in every battle from around year 50 to 301. I even went so far as to write down their history and anticipate their nicknames. When the thrower weapon "Dream Crusher" became a relic that passed between six different generations it became a tool of nearly guarenteed one-hit-kills. When the holder of the relic died it was always a serious moment when I decided who of the holder's children would be able to carry on the legacy and become my next great vanguard.\n\nIt all started with the team of Mael "Rusty" Fu and his daughter Eleandra "Wildcard" Fu blowing things up together. Then came Aaron "Clam" Fu, who I felt was a poor substitute for his late mother. He ended up having a quiet career until late in a mission he accidentally killed his daughter and heir apparent Jacqueline Fu. With his elder sister dead "Dream Crusher" passed to Bloodroot "Heavyfoot" Fu where he became my most vicious warrior. His son Kane "Red Hands" Fu continued the bloody mantel, but he wasn't able to make it to the final battle in year 301. His daughter Rebecca Fu took up "Dream Crusher" to the final bout where she met her fate. I don't want to spoil it but the ending had me truly excited.\n\nI would happily recommend this game and would give it a solid 8.5/10. I'm not eager to return to it after finishing the campaign in 15 hours, but I was addicted and felt accomplished to finish it.","October 12, 2015","true","15.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This sort of game is built on the idea of becoming vested in these families and their members, so that it really hurts when ill befalls them, and this is a feature that would have really enhanced that aspect. It also would have been nice, particularly given how the game ends, to have a New Game+ mode of some sort, perhaps where the families you had persist, but you're given a new generation at half their current level and the difficulty is scaled up.

You'll get more or less used to it, but it's still a rather weak point except in combat where it could be improved but it is ok overall.\n- There's a lot of random spread into the global management but they are too much pure random, much more procedurally generated random could only be much better.\n- There's too many rules or effects not explained, it's a design choice of the game copying a bad design element of old classic roguelike, it's still a bad design even if some old classics used it.\n- The strategy layer coming from the general management is rather thin. It's more a management game than a strategy game, few strategic choices, not much opportunities to setup plans and adapt plans. The game is much more about series of micro decisions. To be clear new xcom is a bit better on this but not good either.\n\nBut for me the weakest points of the game are design choices that some other type of players could enjoy, the main points are:\n- The general management is designed with a spirit of high negativity, it's copying a design approach of old classic roguelike. It's not a matter of difficulty, it's a matter of being negative. For example you have to bother with paralytic, asthmatic, mostly blind, drunk, sterile, nervous heroes is just pointless and highly unpleasant for me. It's honestly my main grip against the game, and without this I'd probably vote thumb up, perhaps.\n- Mixed classes are by themselves a good design but how you get heroes classes linked to keeps marriages is generating a high lost of control of classes used, and I don't like at all this. That destroys the ability to do thematic replays based on a choice of a set of classes. That point is also a major reason why I am overall more negative than positive about the game.\n- There's many events along a campaign play, the problem is your choice will be random until you know the answers. The events are a good idea but I don't like at all to have to do random choices, and it's infuriating when it leads to a huge penalty and a smash in your face.\n- Too much random in the global management gameplay, that's tedious for me.\n\nFor the sake of balance, I should add that the game has also good and even great points:\n- The combats are very interesting with both depth and tactical diversity at your disposition. And don't listen players complaining Hunters are only valid or that the game has no tactical depth, it's just they don't know play the game.\n- Despite there's only a relative random generation of combats areas, it's still working rather well and don't feel repetitive. It could be better but overall it's a good point.\n- The aesthetic choice of the game could seem bizarre at first, but it works very well, it looks rather nice once you admit the approach, and such aesthetic will never look old. On that aspect the UI is successful too and has a nice and marking look. It's too bad that the "ease of use" of the UI isn't as good.\n- The events are a good idea to setup a story mood along a play, and that works rather well, too bad that the choices you have to do for those events are too much random until you know the events/choices/consequences.\n\nOverall only players that like a lot either pure random and negativity spirit, either squad combats, should try this game.

It crashes on me pretty much every play through. Sometimes it crashes hard where my monitor goes black and I need to reboot.\n\nAs far as gameplay, there isn't really much depth here at all. It's fairly X-COM like with the combat. I like turn-based combat,so I'm a fan of that. In the world view where you're not fighting, that's where the game is super basic. It's got some research tree component to it, and a few other things, but there isn't a lot here. I'd say it'd be worth it for $20.\n\nHowever, that all said, despite that it is lacking in depth, I find that I'm still somewhat hooked to it (but I've only been playing for about a week.. not sure how long that will last).","November 20, 2014","true","21.5"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

The 9 different classes all play fairly different, and the generations mechanic has good and bad things about it. The main bad thing about it is that often times you won't be able to put your heroes where you want to before they die of old age, and that since years go by so quick you don't really get attatched to any one character. The good thing about it though is that it leads to varrying up your party compelation and play styles because while in XCom EU you just always picked your most powerful units, in Massive Chalice you may have the choose between your 62 year old level 6 Alchemist with a lot of good traits and a heirloom, and a 17 year old level 3 Cyberjack with good and bad traits and no heirloom, which come down to do you want an easier fight now but harder fights later or a harder fight now but a more experienced hero when your Alchimist dies before the next battle.\n\nAll in all it has things better then XCom EU, and things that are worse then XCom EU but if you like turn based strategy games that have both in combat and out of combat strategy elements I would say it's well worth the asking price.","June 14, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You and the monsters get more powerful, but the monsters don't change. You change some due to the skills chosen. Terrain is overly simplistic. There's no cover rules and the terrain variation is very limited.\n\nManaging bloodlines is interesting, but if you do it poorly you don't realize it's a lost game until much, much later.

If you're like me and enjoy micromanaging Experience Point gains in XCOM, Fire Emblem, and other tactical-RPGs, Massive Chalice might very well become your new favorite game.\n\nThe ruthless march of time, the negotiation of physical and personality traits, the mixing of hybrid classes - all of these combine to promote compelling decisions of who to send to battle and who to leave to raise the next generation of heroes.\n\nOthers have remarked that the combat is not deep, but I disagree; when coupled with the long-term strategy layer, every decision in combat has an impact to the greater game, and the developers got a lot of leverage out of a somewhat small number of maps with randomly placed elements (compare to XCOM which had a larger number of completely pre-made maps).\n\nIt might take some time to really get a good grasp on the mechanics - perhaps 1 or 2 playthroughs at 15-25 hours each, if you make it all the way. But when it gets challenging enough to the point of spending five minutes on a single turn to make certain that no one dies (and then actually pulling it off, and then actually being able to continue the heroic bloodlines and pass down relics), Massive Chalice is wonderfully satisfying.\n\nPlus, the devs were extremely nice and open about the process of making the game. =) And there are Bees in Bottles and smily-faced rocks.","June 13, 2015","true","76.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I can't help but feel there are so many missed opportunities that would make this from a good game with little replayability to an amazing game with tons of replayability. This is one of those games which I hope they make a second one, it does lead itself towards that.\n\nI have some comments if I may be so bold.\n\n1. No family tree at the end was disappointing, I really wanted to see how convoluted and inbred my houses were.\n\n2. Cadence weapons and armour seemed pointless, bloodline relics and top armour outperformed, so i never used them. Also, bloodline weapons with special affects like fire, knockback or something would have been nice.\n\n3. Would have liked some big boss Cadence to break up the monotony of the standards.\n\n4. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! (The censored word is B_astards, not a rude word, an actual proper term) This game needs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. these heroes are living their entire lives under threat of death by Cadence, being forced to give up everything and join the Sagewrights because they are clumsy, or being forced into marrying an old timer in a last ditch effort to keep a bloodline going. I think in this situation the heroes would be shagging like nobody's business and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s would be popping up all over the place. Yes there was the standard baby random event but that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the kid should have been adopted by a house.\n\n5. Kid's classes was too static, so this kid's a rebel but is the same class as everyone else in the family, sounds like a wannabe. Would have liked some randomness in there so that an alchemist and a caber could sometimes have alchemist or caber kids as well as the majority being the fusion.\n\n6. More optional missions would have been cool, like attacking a seed hatchery or something to win back some corruption points.\n\n*Minor spoilers below*\n\nThe ending was terribly unfulfilling, the little twist at the end made me really hopeful and think there was going to be a "New Game +", where  the Cadence is back and the chalice has been reforged thousands of years later, maybe with the last dregs of your major factions and a bloodline relic or two?

He quickly proved himself a great hunter, and could have easily solo'ed some missions if he wanted. After leading my army for over 40 years, I built a training school, the first of its kind, and retired Red Hands from battle to become a teacher who would soon influence the rest of the nation with his high level and favorable traits. Within a year, news had spread of his new school, and it was then attacked by a large group of monsters with the intention of trying to kill the teacher who had killed so many of their own. I, as King, launched a rescue party to go in and kill the monsters, and Red Hands barely survived, getting down to 1hp at one point in the battle. Several months after the attack, Red Hands came to me and told me of a love child he, which under the law was illegal without the consent of the King. I decided to show mercy on Red Hands, as he was the most famous warrior in all the land. I decided to exhile one parent, and let one live, but I would let the child choose which. The baby girl chose Red Hands, and he had to watch as his lover was escorted away to be exhiled. Unfortunately, the child inherited all its atributes from the mother, and was predestined to be a terrible warrior. Red Hands taught for 12 more years without issue, and died months before his only child old enough to fight in battle.\n\nWhile Red Hands house will probably never rise to power, and more likely will die out when his daughter is married, Chris "Red Hands" Antony will always be remembered as the best warrior these lands have ever seen.","June 12, 2015","true","28.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This disclosure notice is also at the beginning of the video posted below.\n\n--\n\nMassive Chalice is an interesting game. The premise itself is pretty straightforward - take Firaxis XCOM's streamlined combat mechanics, mix it in with a simple base building system, add in a hereditary bloodline for your heroes, and kill everyone with Old Age.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozYFLBaIfNw\n\nEverything Massive Chalice sets out to do is done well. The narrators are hilarious, the base building is well balanced, and combat has a nice mixture of classes to choose from. But I think Massive Chalice suffers from its own success - it's a very simple game that isn't trying to introduce the player to any risky mechanics, or complex strategy. Even on Brutal mode, you won't be biting your nails. Once you get the strategy and mechanics down in an hour or so, it's smooth sailing.\n\nIf you're looking for a game as complex as XCOM, Xenonauts, Jagged Alliance, or Crusader Kings II, I don't think you'll enjoy this title. There's not as much depth as any of those games. However, if you're looking to scratch that tactical turn-based strategy itch - I still recommend Massive Chalice. It might not be perfect, but it's still fun.\n\ntl;dr - Do you like Double Fine humor? Do you enjoy simple, ease-of-use tactical gameplay?

If you're like me and enjoy micromanaging Experience Point gains in XCOM, Fire Emblem, and other tactical-RPGs, Massive Chalice might very well become your new favorite game.\n\nThe ruthless march of time, the negotiation of physical and personality traits, the mixing of hybrid classes - all of these combine to promote compelling decisions of who to send to battle and who to leave to raise the next generation of heroes.\n\nOthers have remarked that the combat is not deep, but I disagree; when coupled with the long-term strategy layer, every decision in combat has an impact to the greater game, and the developers got a lot of leverage out of a somewhat small number of maps with randomly placed elements (compare to XCOM which had a larger number of completely pre-made maps).\n\nIt might take some time to really get a good grasp on the mechanics - perhaps 1 or 2 playthroughs at 15-25 hours each, if you make it all the way. But when it gets challenging enough to the point of spending five minutes on a single turn to make certain that no one dies (and then actually pulling it off, and then actually being able to continue the heroic bloodlines and pass down relics), Massive Chalice is wonderfully satisfying.\n\nPlus, the devs were extremely nice and open about the process of making the game. =) And there are Bees in Bottles and smily-faced rocks.","June 13, 2015","true","76.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I can't help but feel there are so many missed opportunities that would make this from a good game with little replayability to an amazing game with tons of replayability. This is one of those games which I hope they make a second one, it does lead itself towards that.\n\nI have some comments if I may be so bold.\n\n1. No family tree at the end was disappointing, I really wanted to see how convoluted and inbred my houses were.\n\n2. Cadence weapons and armour seemed pointless, bloodline relics and top armour outperformed, so i never used them. Also, bloodline weapons with special affects like fire, knockback or something would have been nice.\n\n3. Would have liked some big boss Cadence to break up the monotony of the standards.\n\n4. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! (The censored word is B_astards, not a rude word, an actual proper term) This game needs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. these heroes are living their entire lives under threat of death by Cadence, being forced to give up everything and join the Sagewrights because they are clumsy, or being forced into marrying an old timer in a last ditch effort to keep a bloodline going. I think in this situation the heroes would be shagging like nobody's business and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s would be popping up all over the place. Yes there was the standard baby random event but that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the kid should have been adopted by a house.\n\n5. Kid's classes was too static, so this kid's a rebel but is the same class as everyone else in the family, sounds like a wannabe. Would have liked some randomness in there so that an alchemist and a caber could sometimes have alchemist or caber kids as well as the majority being the fusion.\n\n6. More optional missions would have been cool, like attacking a seed hatchery or something to win back some corruption points.\n\n*Minor spoilers below*\n\nThe ending was terribly unfulfilling, the little twist at the end made me really hopeful and think there was going to be a "New Game +", where  the Cadence is back and the chalice has been reforged thousands of years later, maybe with the last dregs of your major factions and a bloodline relic or two? But no, it just ends... or they are setting up for MASSIVE CHALICE 2!! In that case then well done, I want it.\n\n*Minor spoilers above*\n\nIf you actually read this then thank you, please make another one!!","June 14, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot of critical decision makings on the deployment of heroes and scenarios that pops up every now & then that you have to make decisions to. Its really cool. The part where your heroes get to age is an added twist to the gameplay. The downside to this is that your heros can die due to natural cause and you might not be able to see your veteran heroes full potential.

It's turn-based strategy, permadeath, bloodlines, relics and strategy where you play as a ruler who is immortal and guides his people in a war that spans 300 years.\n\nSo as a ruler? You get chalise-attuned heroes which means not just any pesant can join your ranks. You can aquire them from mating your heroes in keeps via bloodlines which at random of a hero death may lead to a bloodline-tied relic, an extra-strong piece of equipment that gains effectiveness as the hero it is equipped to gains experience... So you're constantly balancing researching new technologies, building keeps/sage towers or Crucibles (for boosting experience points of your heroes per day by dedicated a hero as a Standard Bearer). Plus? You can't forget about random events... oh yes, they are random, interesting and both rewarding or dangerous. ;)\n\nI'm only on my first playthrough and have made some bad choices and have been paying for them... but it has taught me that no two playthroughs are the same and this game is definitely a gem. I definitely intend to do more playthroughs after waiting for a few patches and changes to the game.\n\nRight now? It's on patch 0.85 and is pretty fun. There is a few balance issues with the game... namely Hunters (the archerer class) is overpowered compared to the other classes. I found using 4 Hunters and 1 Alchemist (a potion-based warriror/mage class... thingy or something lol) was the most efficient team of heroes to use in combat. Mainly because the Caberjack (melee warrior class) has several disadvantages due to the unique properties of the Cadence (the evil forces of the game). For example, Wrinklers are an enemy type that does melee damage and causes aging effects if they hit you... but with a team of Hunters and Alchemist? You can usually take them out before they get close to you... Lapse's are an enemy that cause your characters to lose their memories (experience points in this case) and when they die? They explode and cause minor damage to anyone nearby but also there's a risk of getting stunned... Rupture's are suicide units and wether they die or kamikazi? They explode and do minor damage but lower armor effectiveness (called armor corruption). All three of these enemy types can be easily dispatched from a safe distance. Debateable? But you can research and equip Wünderpants to negate the aging and memory-loss attacks of the Wrinklers and Lapsers... but it takes up the only item slot they get which means no health potions or Max HP buffs and they can still damage you or stun you... so once again, better from a safe distance. Plus, if they get close? Alchemists are decent melee units... so I always sent any camberjacks I recruited to the Sage Tower (helps lower research time) or as a regent's partner for breeding.\n\nSo yeah... Massive Chalice is a darn fun game, but it does need a little patch refining to especially make Camberjacks more effective... they need a bigger healthpoint pool and dare I say more than one inventory slot for acessories out of the gate. Upgraded? Camberjacks are pretty handy... but they usually have an average Hitpoint pool just like the other classes and that's not good when they're supposed to be in the front lines taking abuse.. and abuse they shall take.","November 17, 2014","true","8.9"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

It manages to have bright garish colors yet still seem like it's all muddy brown. Most of the models and textures look unfinished.\n\nShallow- Imagine playing an entire X-com campaign where you used level 1 soldiers the entire time. That's not too much of an exaggeration of the Massive Chalice experience.\n\nDull- How fun would X-Com be if you only had 2 building choices and level 1 soldiers the entire time?\n\n\nPop quiz: there are only 3 classes. The hunter class is the only ranged class. Hunters have almost the same stats as the other classes, can stealth, and shoot all the way across the map at enemies who are mostly melee and explode when killed. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that hunters are the only class worth getting.\n\nSo you build a castle at each territory, assigning a man and woman hero at each castle to crank out babies to refill your ranks. Theoretically, you're pouring over all their stats and traits to come up with the ideal matches, but in reality you're just pairing up hunters because that's the only class you want. Having all hunters by far outweighs any drawbacks of negative traits. The strategic portion turns into nothing but a eugenics program to breed out non-hunter classes.\n\nSet up marriage\nOrder another castle\nwait\nwait\nwait\nboring battle\nwait\nwait\nchoose new research item to receive a boring flat stat increase on existing weapon/armor\nwait\nwait\nboring battle\nwait\nwait\nhero dies of old age, choose replacement marriage\nwait\nwait\nrepeat endlessly\n\nDoes the game get deeper and more interesting beyond the campaign's halfway point? Who knows, and who cares. It was so boring I couldn't bother to play any further. If your game is boring the entire first half, your game stinks.\n\nSpecial mention for the terrible writing. There is zero story to this game. Even though I know story isn't meant to be the focus, it makes the campaign story in X-com seem like Xenogears in comparison. The only, and I mean the ONLY dialog in the game comes from the massive chalice: a magical talking cup made up of two personalities. They try to be "wacky" and somber at the same time and fail miserably at both. One personality says something, then the other makes a sacastic remark about it. It's what happens when unskilled writers try to sound witty. In a game with no other plot or tone, they needed to NAIL this part but failed.","September 3, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Many have complained that the nature of the game (the entire game takes place over 300 years, during which your heroes that fight for you WILL die of old age, as the average lifespan in this game is about 60-70) is such that you can never get attached to the heroes.\n\nBut indeed what is so awesome is that instead of getting attached to the heroes, you get attached to their families. THIS family makes some badass alchemists, and THIS family I can rely on to make great tanks. After 150 years of marriage choices, perhaps a family who made awesome heroes dies out due to some poor choices. Maybe a family of miscreants with crappy traits becomes amazing heroes after some good choices 100 years ago.\n\nMeanwhile as family members have success in combat, they might christen their weapon a relic that is powerful and levels up, and can be handed down from family member to family member.

I got through my first playthrough, but there's nothing in the game that keeps me wanting to play through the other difficulties. Add on the fact that modding is not available, or (as I hear) planned, I don't see myself coming back to this game.\n\nI want to like this game, the core mechanics are good, but it's just a very shallow game.\n\nExamples of shortcomings:\nMost choices you make in management, like marraiges, don't seem to make huge differences. By the end of the game, I had generally positive traits, but it still didn't feel like there were enough traits to make it seem like any one family was really special in a good or bad way.\nClasses were kind of neat, but there are only 3, each with 2 variations, and your control over what classes you get are constrained by traits due to their inclusion in the marriage mechanic.\nThere aren't many enemies, and the main crowd control mechanic is hard movement of enemies. It does add more depth to the combat that I saw at first, but that was about as deep as it got.\n\nRelics are random, and absurdly strong. There are really no other options. You can research a few weapons per class that mimic enemy mechanics, but they still pale in comparison.\n\nResearch is limited to a few techs, that never change based on playthroughs(though they may be unlocked in a marginally different time frame). I also disliked the idea of having to "research" more troops to recruit. I see why they did it, but it seems silly.\n\nPerma-death doesn't hurt much in the long run, really just for that battle. If the dead person carried a relic, it is passed on. If the person had good traits, well you chose someone else for marriage instead of them, who likely had even better traits. I would have liked to see more units needed for battles, and the inclusion of regents in the fighting forces, to raise the stakes. The finale was neat, and if the mechanics of battle were better, it would be incredible to play.\n\nLastly, I'd like to see more done with the overworld. It's the same everytime and is, in the grand scheme, rather small. Basically 5 areas, with 2 divisions (10 total), where only the outer region carries any value. On top of that, the invasion mechanic is painfully simple. Bad guys invade 2-3 areas at once. Defend one area to reduce 1 corruption points, other regions gain 1 corruption point. None of that matters unless a region reaches 3 corruption points, at which point it just disappears. I'd like to see regions be affected by corruption, and lost regions do more than just go away.","June 30, 2015","false","22.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unique classes, graphics, animations, and, best of all, a foundation that takes some of the best genres and mixes them into its own unique brand of gameplay.\n\nIf you've played XCOM: Enemy Unknown you'll be familiar with the combat in Massive Chalice. You have a team of five that you will take into battle, known as your vanguard. This vanguard will gain power through both leveling up and research done in your base. However, there's much more to the game than that. Your heroes will also learn new abilities to use in battle, creating fun, strategic combinations when utilizing various classes.\n\nThe story drops you into a war that will last 300 years. During this time, you will be required to manage your heroes' bloodlines through a system of arranged marriage and pairing. The children they create will inherit similar stats, traits, and abilities. They will also get their initial class training from their parents. Once they reach sixteen years of age, they are then deemed fit for combat and are put into your pool of eligible Vanguard, Trainers, or Scholars.\n\nAs the years pass, you will find yourself losing some of your favorite heroes, only to be replaced by their descendants. If one of those dying heroes performed well enough in battle, he or she will leave behind a family relic: a weapon of great power that gains it's own levels. This relic can then be passed down to others of the same house. This weapon can eventually become a very powerful artifact that will tip the scales of battle in your favor.\n\nIn addition to managing your bloodlines, you will be asked to make decisions on how to spend your precious time. You may build new buildings in your territories, research new items, weapons, or armor, or you can even spend some time recruiting new heroes or adopting children to be future heroes in order to fill out your roster. As the game time is finite, it is crucial to plan ahead and have a goal to strive for. Keeps are nice, but if you build one without a potential bloodline to propagate, that keep will go unused.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Massive Chalice is the fun and witty narration. There are two narrating characters, and their commentary and banter in the background as you wage this 300-year war creates a sense of the world you are defending.\n\nYou can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com","August 2, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You build "keeps" and choose an initial two characters with a variety of good and bad traits and they create offspring with similar traits to create a bloodline.  The strategy is to try and breed out the bad traits while influencing the continuation of the good traits.  All the traits have a real effect on the game and all your people die eventually so you need to always be looking at the next generation and beyond.\nThe voice acting in this game was a real win for me.  Usually in games it can get really repetitive and annoying, but this game the parts are quick and relevant and at times humorous.\n\nThe Average:\nThe combat system feels borrowed from similar games like XCOM and others, not that its bad, just dont expect much innovation there.  Its your basic turn-based combat, each ally and enemy has one move action and one attack action.  You do have the freedom to develop your own strategy based on your preferred play style.  I  particularly enjoyed using the "Hunter" classes and move around the board in stealth fashion.\n\nThe Less-Than-Average:\nIf amazing graphics are your thing you can probably skip Massive Chalice.  What you get is practical but not on par with most games produced these days.\nThe complexity of the game was rather shallow.  There is only a handful of enemy types that get harder as time passes, also there are only three classes although through breeding you can increase that to nine\n\nOverall:\nMassive Chalice is a good game and held my interest to over 50 hours.  The most satisfying thing for me was the breeding system and trying to develop the traits that helped me in combat the most.  I would and have recommended the game to my friends.","August 7, 2015","true","68.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I've played the crap out of it over the last few days and I've got to say for the most part I've really enjoyed it.\n\nThe presentation and style of the game is great, it looks beautiful and has a quirky sense of humor. The character classes are distinct but lacking, as there are only three. Caberjack (melee), Hunter (ranged), and Alchemist (mix of both), although this is set to change with an upcoming patch which will allow players to mix classes. The gameplay is fun, although it did begin to feel a little repetitive by the end of the game. I really enjoyed the bloodlines aspect of the game which gave you the chance to marry different heroes with the hope of creating offspring with the best traits of their parents (this was a little tricky but very enjoyable when done right). If your heroes went through several grueling battles and distinguished themselves there was the chance that their weapon would become an heirloom, basically a special weapon that leveled up over the campaign.\n\nOne of my favourite moments in the game came when a young alchemist named Seargent Ra became my first level 6 character after two battles. With his amazing stats I decided to name Seargent as the next reagent of the house Ra, now Standard had the ‘bountiful’ trait, allowing him to basically have kids in litters. The guy ended up having nine kids and established the Ra lineage as the dominant family in my game. That wasn’t enough for Seargent, when the magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ died he left his weapon behind which became the first heirloom in my game. Two of his ancestors fought in my final battle many generations later, one of them carrying his weapon, the ‘Inevitable’. This is exactly why I bought this game, I wanted a story behind my heroes, I wanted to feel this connection to the characters. The main issue I had that it did get repetitive by end game and I didn’t have as much of a connection with the heroes as I originally did. However I still enjoyed the experience.\n\nOn the whole this is still very much a work in progress but I’ve really enjoyed it so far.\n","December 31, 2014","true","41.1"," 86 of 173 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","86","173","3","0"

On the other, you breed new heroes by arranging marriages (kind of like Crusader Kings 2). The traits of the parents, good or bad, can pass on to the children. Producing children is vital because in-game time passes quickly. Battles occur about every 10 years, thus your combat squad composition changes nearly every fight as heroes die naturally.\n\nOverall, I think it's a decent strategy game for different types of personality. If you are the micromanaging type, you can spend a lot of time looking at character sheets to optimize marriages and squad selection. If you are a casual player, the game is forgiving and does not have a lot of complexity. There are only a dozen or so enemy units which get tougher.\n\nThe art style may not be for everyone. The game sort of looks like if you turned the graphic settings to the lowest, giving everything a slightly geometric, block-like quality. This is by design, makes it unique but I can see it turning some people off.

It made me think of a stained-glass window come to life and worked very well for a medieval setting. The drastic diffences in the look of armor and weapons (especially the heirloom weapons) added to the unique look of the units.\n\nAudio (6/10):\nWhile the music was nice and the dialogue was humorous, I found myself listening to the comments of the narrators repeat over and over again early on in the game (about 1/3 of the way through). The voice acting itself was good, though the female actor clearly understood the witty dialogue better.\n\nGameplay (9/10)\nThe best compliment to pay the game is that it is very similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown in its turn-based combat. The political parts of the game added a lot to the time between battle -- putting emphasis on makin' babies (the more children you have = the more units you have and the more options you have for putting specific people in specific positions of power). Battles gradually got harder as the story neared its 300-year mark, causing new enemy types to appear battle after battle, though I never felt like the game gave me more than I could handle. One issue that I ran into was that I could completely exploit the Alchemist units and by the end of the game could have a squad of fully-upgraded Alchemists who could wipe the floor with their almost OP abilities. Especially since the last mission allows you to continually refill your flasks.\n\nStory (7/10)\nWatching 300 years of a country pass by while I attempted to save it from unknown baddies really emersed me in the world and, although the story is as simple as that, made it feel quite real. Seeing generation after generation of the rulers die out and pass on their legacies made the story unique as it was no about one person or family, but about a country and its survival. Sadly, the ending left me wanting and didn't quite live up to all the work I put into these families. Also, though there were many random events that took place between battles involving non-combat confrontations with the citizens of the country, I felt like there could have been many more of them than I experianced.\n\nReplayability (7/10)\nGetting to choose what families ruled the country gave the game some replayability (especially if you choose the humorous name option), just so you can see what names might come up (one of my proudest warriors was named Slippy Goatbone). Spec'ing out your units in different ways allows you to play the game differently at least few times, emphasizing certain units, skills, or research in order to try out different strategies. The way the game ends makes me think that a second playthrough might have some different dialogue from the main characters, although I haven't started my second playthrough yet.\nTotal: 7.6/10\nMASSIVE CHALICE Main Website[www.massivechalice.com]\nMASSIVE CHALICE Wiki[massivechalice.gamepedia.com]","May 31, 2015","true","18.8"," 38 of 77 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","38","77","0","0"

I've completed my first playthrough in ~15-18 hours, I believe.\n\nOverall, I really like this game because it provides consistently difficult choices which are only going to last a short while before you have to make even more. I should have restarted once I got the hang of everything because you're semi-pigeonholed once you're up and running with the initial choices - however I won and it was fun seeing how far I could get and seeing what I can do with it all.\n\nThere's a really big timeline which I believe is ~300 years. The ultimate goal is to hold off the monsters for 300 years until the Chalice can do something epic and cleanse the monsters (the Cadence) forever(?).\n\nAny time you need a building/research/item for your people/weapon/armor to be made you can only pick 1 of those things. Often research takes anywhere from 5-20 years and you cannot research anything else during that time. You can only hit the "fastforward" button on the timeline and hope nothing bad goes down. Once something occurs the game pauses and you can deal with it, whether it's research or an attack on your lands.\n\nYou've got heroes from different houses and you appoint a male and female regent & partner so they can create offspring. The templates of their traits and tendencies for stats come together and create children that are then trained to be fighters. Your characters are constantly dying from battle but more often from old age, and you have to continually supply new ones to keep things running smoothly. The big battle here is to make sure you appoint people who are very fertile with good stats so you can supply enough for upkeep. You can sacrifice 7 years to recruit new heroes. Deaths of any kind are permanent in here. It's actually a tad depressing, because I actually found Brad Muir (Thed esigner) as a character and watched him grow old and die.\n\nThe combat itself is very reminiscent to a partially simplified XCOM which is not a bad thing at all. It provides challenge from the get-go, with enemies that you absolutely do not want to get close (they'll explode, they reduce your XP on hit, or their melee makes you 5 years older every swing), enemies that keep their distance and snipe, or enemies that create other enemies and you're in a mad dash to kill them so the flow of creatures stops.\n\nYou can save and load throughout your timeline so there's no real pressure if you make a terrible mistake - you can load an older save you'll get an entirely different scenario all together. This is a bit of a player crutch but it's not unwelcomed since I'm 7 hours in and I'm still not through the whole timeline..\n\nThe art is cool and the UI is fairly basic in a good way. All you really see is the damage spread you'll do and the amount of HP left on the creature. Moving and attacking are fairly simple.\n\nCharacters in your ranks gain abilities as they level, each one being a "one or the other" choice down the chain. I've never gotten down the entire chain before dying of old age, so I don't know what some of them do.\n\nThe classes are hunter (ranged stealth DEX), caberjack (melee, knockback tank STR), and alchemist (mid-ranged finite amount of bombs being thrown --- honestly this class seems to be a bit weak, I can't find anything very good about it. INT).\n\nYou deploy up to 5 at a time, and really, less than 5 heroes is often going to be a tough challenge.\n\nI just bring hunters and caberjacks due to the types of enemies I've been encountering. I generally don't want them anywhere near me so I just try to snipe them all before they close any ground. I also like using the hunters to go invisible and scout out the territory so I know how I want to set up.  You can lead enemies into traps if you just set up your hunters and have the caberjack as bait.\n\nSo yeah, totally pleased with my purchase on this one. It's got its kinks, especially if you've appointed characters of different ages offset in such a way that it'll keep stopping you and asking you to appoint people to thrones or roles. Stop, transition animation into building, click on a guy from a list, exit from menu, fastforward on timeline (repeat x5). The kinks, though, especially for an Early Access title are very small and the overall thing has felt solid.\n\nAnd yeah, the art is solid and simple. The environments have breakables/exploding stuff/hazards. It looks good.\n\nA word of warning at the time of writing - DO NOT TRY TO WIN THIS GAME.  THE ENDING IS CURRENTLY IN FLUX AND IT WILL MURDER YOUUUUUU.

Structure specific (Sagewright / Crucible) are the hardest by far. Enemy mobs also have a different spin on them in the ways they can defeat your heroes. Not only do you have to be concerned with your HP reaching zero, you also have to consider the effects of the Wrinker's aging attacks that can be devastating if you use a party of older heroes. The Twitchers also tend to appear at inopportune moments (usually from over a wall) to mix things up.\n\nAs this is an early access review, game ran beautifully from start to finish with no complaints.

If you've ever played X-COM, it's hard to play a dumbed down version of that. Massive Chalice has some really awesome concepts that work better on paper. You get to create several generations of blood and name that will go on for as long as you can keep them alive. They may have some weaknesses and strengths, and many of these can carry on for a couple hundred years. This can be alcoholism, higher HP, lower evasion, better aging, lower lifespan, better stealth, etc. The list goes on and I probably only got to play with a third of what's out there. The important thing is, once you find a strong bloodline, you stick with it and make it stronger. Sounds pretty cool, right?\n\nWell, unfortunately, there's not a whole lot else here. As time goes on, your birthing choices mean less and less and eventually you just want to get the game over with. The combat is challenging, but not complicated enough. You only have so much to work with, and it's not even 1/10th as intricate as X-COM. There's some fun concepts here like trying to plan your means of attack and stealthing in unseen on a group of 10 enemies. But it all starts to become fodder to a point. You get to saying "here we go again..." and finish it like you had the other 20 battles before it. So I just don't see how this game can be greatly improved on full release. I completed it with an emptiness to fill and hope the best for it. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for me. I recommend getting this on a massive sale if you REALLY need to play this type of game.","November 30, 2014","false","22.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Started playing some months ago when it had only 3 classes.\n\nIt was fun even then. Played it through few times just to try different tactics. After the recent patch of hybrid classes it got even better. Squad turn-based tactics - with some random choices that may, or may not, screw you over - with ever changing panic over keeping a proper squad together as your keeps can't keep up with enough worthy heroes.\n\nToss the crappy ones (slow, arithis, multiple negative stats) into guild to do research. Pick ones with positive effects - and later higher levels - for standards. And assemble best ones into frontline fighting squad. And cry when they get wiped. Random chance and mean AI makes each game a struggle at some point. Not enough heroes for full squad? Don't want to sacrifice your good heroes? Which area you're willing to lose.. Balancing for picking least annoying combat and best rewards.\n\nCompared to x-com or a like games this one has kept me interested longer.

The seemingly insurmountable odds stacked against (any non-hardcore) player seem challenging at first, but quickly become either annoyingly time-consuming (with save scumming) or off-puttingly random (with ironman mode) with its difficulty spikes. Making "easy" the only difficulty that fits a player that's not 100% committed always feels condescending. If the game was otherwise a complete gem, this could be forgiven. Unfortunately, it is not.\n\nThe battles and environments are quirky and fun to look at for a while, but quickly wear out their appeal; it's obvious the art style is just a thin smokescreen for hiding sub-par, lazy graphics design.\n\nThe game's lack of variety in difficulty, graphics and strategic content, lack of polish and the baffling decision to let people to create shoddy and very unfunny custom content in the form of Bloodlines (character descriptions/battle dialogue) just leaves an impression that the game's creators don't really want to make the effort to produce high-quality content.\nThe Bloodlines, rife with bad jokes and knockoff GoT quotes, are a testament to the game's shortcomings; the developers have made no effort (yet) to polish the player-created content, but also did not include an option to disable said amateur garbage. It's like a comic book that's sold as the work of a professional comics studio but all the pages are mostly colored in by unpaid and inept first graders.\n\nAt it's current stage, MASSIVE CHALICE seems to be a brilliant concept that's gotten trashed by a lazy, unrefined design process.","February 16, 2015","false","8.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

I am a huge fan of tactical, turn-based combat games. XCom is one of my favorite games. However, this game lacks a lot of contents I'd expect from a game like this:\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT:\n\nIt's just plain boring. Your heros gain skills as they level, but the combat itself is lacking. By the time I reached my third invasion by the Cadence (enemy plant race), I was just tired of it. Each combat scenerio is the same and very repeatative, and you lack a variety of classes and specializations to keep it interesting.\n\nBLOODLINE/BIRTHING:\n\nThis is probably the only interest thing about this game. You assign a regent to a territory and marry them off to someone. Based on their fertility and skills, they'll give birth to a lot of children that pick up some of their traits. You have to be careful not to pair up two people with horrible traits, or you risk a good deal of horrible warriors being birthed.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION:\n\nPractically NONE. What I love about XCom is the fact you get to customize each of your soldiers. You choose their hair, face, voice, what they wear and even give them first, last and nicknames. Massive Chalice only allows you to change your hero's armor and weapon... and that's even limited. For me--customizing my characters is not only extremely entertaining, but it emotionally invests me in those characters and when they die in battle... I actually care.\n\nKINGDOM BUILDING:\n\nYep. Boring. I imagined having an entire kingdom to build things like blacksmiths, guilds, research towers, etc. Nope. You  build keeps to fill a territory and assign a regent, and then you just wait around to birth children to fill your army once they reach the age of 15. You can also research something, but you can only research one thing at  time. And constructing buildings, for some reason, is considered research. Instead of having several different areas to work on multiple projects (building, researching, crafting) you literally can only do ONE thing at a time. And you wait. And wait. AND WAIT some more for something interesting to happen.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nYes. It's an Early Access Game, but based on what's in the game right now... there's not much going to change. The core mechanics are there, and they're lacking. If you enjoy tactical, turn-based combat games... buy XCom: Enemy Unknown. You can get the main game and all expansions for the same price as this game. Plus--XCom is a top-notched game with a ton of content, customization, intenst tactical combat and a great storyline.","February 19, 2015","false","2.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The game pretty much breaks down to as follows..\n\n1. Attack stuff\n2. Build something\n3.  Wait\n4. Wait\n5. Wait\n6. Marry off someone\n7. Wait\n8. Wait\n9. Wait\n10.

Too many random misses/bad outcomes/etc. that just encourage you to reload and hope for a better result, rather than legit strategy rewards. Also really disappointed by the final plot resolution. Especially when playing a second time after half a dozen months more development; Doublefine really couldn't come up with a more satisfying ending?

I still remember when two heroes I threw into a mission alone together (I was stupid) somehow managed to kill almost all of the enemies. I had a breather when I realized how close they were to surviving. But there were still enemies left, and they were basically dead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshroby/recommended/246110/","joshroby","Josh Roby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshroby/","39 products in account","The schtick of the game is that you manage a fantasy realm for 300 years in a prolonged seige from an otherworldly badguy.  You have a few bloodlines of heroes, and the top-level gameplay sees you assigning them to a few different roles.  They can be part of your vanguard (strike team used in tactical levels), you put them in baby farms keeps to produce more heroes (cause the game goes for something like ten generations), they can take on the white to become a sage (speeding your research times), and your most awesome heroes can become standards in the training crucibles (boosting all heroes kingdom-wide).\n\nMeanwhile, the badguy threat the "Cadence" attacks your lands (in which you build keeps, crucibles, and sagewright guilds).  You send in your vanguard and play a blessedly short tactical exercise to take them down.  There are always more attacks than you can address, though, and the Cadence's corruption seeps into your lands, eventually destroying them.  So you're constantly triaging your threats, knowing that you won't be able to keep everything, but holding out for retaining enough to make it to the endgame.\n\nThe endgame, by the way, is when the titular Massive Chalice fills up and can destroy all the Cadence forever.  That takes 300 years.  But you're immortal thanks to the power of the Chalice, so you can manage things until the endgame… assuming you can hold everything together until then.\n\nThe Good:\n\nDividing your resources (ie heroes) between vanguard, breeders, sages, and standards is surprisingly difficult, challenging, and consequential, and continues to be so throughout the game.  Your heroes have various traits, both genetic and acquired via training, and they pass these down to their kids and their trainees (and sometimes their comrades-in-arms).  There is a whole lot of fun fiddling and arranging what traits you want your baby farms keeps to produce.  Or who you're willing to put into the sages instead.  Or who's going to fight for you, or who's going to train the kingdom's heroes.   This is, from a game design standpoint, a real victory.  It is some seriously elegant, downright exquisite, design.  So the strategic level of the game gets an A+.\n\nThe character classes are amusingly different from your standard fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  You have caberjacks, whose weapons are giant, iron-shod logs.  You have alchemists, who sling explosive potions.  Lastly you have hunters, who can stealth and shoot things with their crossbows.  You can shunt these into the tank/dps/aoe structures you're used to, but you don't have to.\n\nYou also get hybrid classes (when a mommy caberjack and a daddy hunter love each other very very much…) which make for interesting combinations.  Trickshots shoot arrows tipped with explosive potions.  Shadowjacks can stealth and then leap out of the shadows with their massive cabers.  And so on.  As you can see, as you start figuring out hybrid classes, things get weirder, not more predictable, and it's lots of fun to explore those new options.\n\nAnd there are relic weapons that get passed down from generation to generation, leveling up as they get used, and becoming incredible items of power.  Nothing says dynasty of super-powered warriors like a crossbow that's been passed down within the noble house for 200 years.  Towards the end of my playthrough, which youngster got bequeathed a relic more-or-less determined who was going to be in the vanguard.  There's a lot of thematic power in that decision, where you're figuring if this 13-year-old lordling shows enough promise to be given the mighty Monarch crossbow.  I really got into it!\n\nWhile there are a lot of Game of Thrones elements in there, it's also notable what things are _not_ carried over from the most popular fantasy property of the day.  Namely, you have all these noble houses in your kingdom, but they do not conspire or scheme or complain to you.  They don't have petty rivalries, they do not undermine the realm with their ambitions.  This would be a natural development to pursue, but ultimately it would detract from gameplay.  Your job isn't to convince the realm to fight against the White Walkers Cadence, it's to manage that fight.  Good on the designers for not falling down that rabbit hole.\n\nAlso the game is pleasantly gender-neutral in regards to you, the sovereign, even though it sticks pretty strongly to the gender binary for your baby farms regents.  I'll take my victories where I can get them on this front!\n\nThe Not-So-Good:\n\nThe game suffers from the common trope of the Big Final Battle being unlike any other battle you've fought before, so all of the expectations and strategies that you've honed over the course of the game are just slightly off-base.  (Mild spoilers; skip to next paragraph to avoid…) Instead of using your team of five heroes sweeping an area for the 15-20 badguys hiding on a map, you set your team of five heroes to defending a single target against wave after wave of badguys who teleport in every few turns.  Worse, there is zero indication if you have four waves to go, or one, or fifteen.  Given that part of the game is resource management, withholding this information does not do the endgame scenario any favors.\n\nMore mundanely, except for that last one, the battles all have the same objective: kill all the badguys.  Every once in a while, the game mixes things up and has the badguys attacking a keep and you have to defend the regent of the keep… by killing all the badguys.  I often complain that the objectives of tactical games miss a lot of potential, and this game unfortunately falls squarely into the same trap.\n\nThe UI does a good job presenting a torrent of information that you need to manage, but there are some unfortunate lapses.  The worst is the fact that, while every character has a Strength, Agility, and Intelligence stat, nowhere does it tell you what those stats actually do—and they don't operate in traditional "Agility to hit, Strength for damage" ways.  Luckily a quick internet search will answer these questions, but still: not something I should have to do to understand the game.  More puzzling, this is a known problem and could be addressed in a very simple patch, but it hasn't been.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis is a slick, powerful, engaging game, and I'm holding off starting another playthrough because I've got stuff to do.  I know if I start another, it will consume all my time like the last round.  I still haven't explored the Alchemists hardly at all, and feel like I missed some clever uses for caberjacks.  I'm eager to try it again, but I'm not sure if I want to play at Normal difficulty like last time or submit myself to the harrowing of a harder difficulty level.\n","January 2","true","27.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To you I can only say - I'm sorry for you, do your research better next time and be glad it wasn't an expensive game.\n\nThe breeding is somewhat repetitive, but hardly time-consuming. The point of the game is to enjoy some great fun of Tactical RPG focusing just on the battles without so much of a story, which makes the game really replayable (haven't yet, but do believe so). I really like the simplified movement/action points system, that's one thing that was a bit too tricky in Deadly Games back in the day, but this is really simplified. Think of it as a big chess game with a few variations in pieces. You do a bit of research for gear to make sure they are viable as the game progresses as well as making sure they are replaced and you have a decent variety, but aside from that it's pretty straightforward.\n\nIf you thought this was a different type of game, sorry for you. But if you like me went into this knowing EXACTLY what type of game it was, you won't be disappointed.","September 18, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

XCOM is better, but this game is still worth experiencing.\n\nRather than being about cover management, the tactical combat part is about trying to kill enemies before they ever get a chance to attack you, where the enemies are dumb as bricks. So, sometimes entertaining, and sometimes rather unimpressive, and on the whole a bit less great.\n\nThe strategy layer is a closer match though; it's got the same level of researchyness, with the additional hero breeding mechanic. I think the tactical combat's balance kind of wears down on the strategy layer though: there are many elements that make it easier to focus on upgrading and breeding only one class, but the tactical rewards for diversifying do not really make overcoming those elements worthwhile.\n\nOh, and the voices in this game are rather unimpressive. Every once in a long while during a battle, one or both of the chalice-people will say something useless from their rather small set of things they can say. My favorites being "Good riddance!" when an ally dies (if an enemy was killed in the crossfire), and "Ha! Following my advice paid off!" (or something like that) when nobody has said anything.

On one hand, it embraces the purity of XCOM2012-style (or perhaps I should say "traditional board game style") actions and has the trademark Doublefine carefully crafted aesthetic running through every level of the audiovisual presentation. On the other hand, it muddles everything with occasionally pointless RNG and has perhaps three too many systems going on simultaneously in the geoscape.\n\nDid I mention it's an XCLONE? It's an XCLONE.\n\nThere's some interesting bits resulting from the nessesarily disposable nature of your soldiers as you carefully curate their family trees to produce increasingly powerful and skilled individuals in the classes you want. It's a great twist on otherwise normal "level up your units" game design. Sadly this is muddled by the irritiating intrusion of RNG-based inheritance and a bunch of other random crap that turns what should be a selling point into a HR hellscape. Thankfully, the game doesn't randomly choose from the two choices you're presented with for skills when units level up.\n\nDid I mention it's an XCLONE? It's an XCLONE.\n\nThe geoscape-level strategic game is neat because it forces you make a bunch of decisions all at once. You can search for new heroic bloodlines, build castles, or research new developments in fighting the corruption that threatens the world. Somewhat irritatingly, the game forces you to choose between building and researching because the titular Massive Chalice can only do one thing at a time. For plot reasons.\n\nEvery so many years while you scan for alien activity charge the titular Massive Chalice to win the game, there's multiple incursions from aliens bad anime Symphogear's monster antagonists, the Noise the Cadence and you have to pick which pre-defined region you want to defend (based on rewards and the strategic situation) because you can only respond to one. Because plot reasons. The zones you don't respond to have their panic corruption meter increment by one tick.\n\nDid I mention it's an XCLONE? It's an XCLONE.\n\nTactical combat is pretty fluid, even though there's a complete dearth of voicework for your units (one of the perils of letting Kickstarter backers do custom war cries for their backer house). Each unit gets two "actions" on your turn, and they all move at once. One class snipes with crossbows. One class uses grenades. One class hits things with a caber. There's a bunch of hybrid classes but they're just "Parent class, but with a twist from the other parent". Movement is done on a square grid, and units die pretty quickly on both sides.\n\nOkay so you may have noticed a bit of, shall we say, a theme so far. That theme being "XCOM2012, but with some wierd addons that muddle the everliving crap of XCOM2012's super tight design". Literally the only three big "design elements" that Doublefine didn't T.S. Eliot off of XCOM2012 are the house system, the endgame, and the fact that there are enemies that drain XP from your units when they hit them.\n\nLet's pause for a moment, and let that last one sink in. I'll allow that it's a pretty tiny bit of XP that gets shaved off, but level drain has never, ever, been a good design element. Not even in D&D. It's thematically a cool thing that the enemy does, but it's really emblematic of my issues with Massive Chalice as a whole: The game is so focused on style, mood, and its bloodline stuff that it sorta misses out on why XCOM2012 did things the way it did and tends to awkwardly stumble around when it's not winking at you. And the fact that the game absolutely nails its aesthetics so perfectly makes its 'original design, do not steal' gameplay all the more annoying.\n\nBut no-one buys or plays Doublefine games for the gameplay, really.","May 28","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are several levels of strategy you need to think about when playing.\n\nYou only control a small squad of 5 heroes when in combat, which means you need to use terrain and other tactics in order to survive. The death of a single hero in combat affects other areas of the game.\n\nEverything surrounds a single goal: protect the massive talking (multi-personality I might add) chalice at the center of the map. The chalice is surrounded by regions which in turn are surrounded, from all directions, by the enemy which creeps ever closer. The big talky chalice promises it has a way to defeat the enemy but says "It takes time. A lot of time", so we have to defend it until then.\n\nPlacing keeps and guilds in each region takes time - I'm talking years. Fortunately the years move quite quickly. Unfortunately, the lives of your heroes span those years in real time, which means they get old and they eventually die of old age (unless killed in battle).\n\nIn order to maintain a line of heroes you have the option to make them regents (or regent partners). This stops the heroes from entering the battlefield and instead focus of making the next generation of heroes. You now need to find the right combination of heroes to produce offspring with attributes that can defeat the enemy more efficiently.\n\nOverall I found the game to be semi-light hearted, enjoyable, and also a challenge. You're often attacked on multiple fronts which means you have to pick your battles. The character models could do with a little bit of 'prettifyling' I suppose, but hey, you're not pairing them together for their looks now are you? :)\n\nIf you're looking for a new turn-based challenge, have a look!","November 12, 2014","true","2.3"," 40 of 82 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","40","82","0","0"

The main thing this game has in common with XCOM is the combat mechanics and permadeath and these are not bad game mechanics so I believe it's acceptable. Every choice matters and your soldiers (named Heroes) WILL die and you will have to accept this. I love this game but not because of its combat, (which is very light strategy and needs some fine tuning to be satisfactory) but because of everything outside of combat. You rule a kingdom and control when time starts and stops. Time means everything in this game, as well as the age, experience, fertility, and traits of your heroes. Even some enemy designs revolve around these subjects, a type of enemy can cause you to lose experience, or make you older by 5 to 10 years, or even make you sterile. Your people WILL die on the battle field. Accept it. The artstyle is fantastic and the gameplay outside of combat is very intriguing and interesting. Now for the enemy types, the only thing I have a problem with is how powerful the enemies are. I don't mind a challenge but I believe some tweaks would improve their combat mechanics, such as for example, the Lapses who when hit a hero they drain experience, the amount of experience should dialed down. Also the variability of hit success can be infuriating at times, (f.e. 87% chance to land a successful hit and misses can be very  frustrating.) This game is a work in progress for sure, however despite it's flaws it is well worth the price and extremely fun, satisfying, and very challenging. 9.5/10! In case you don't think this review is helpful because I may be confusing in how I feel about this game, it's worth the money if you enjoy strategy games like XCOM. If you don't enjoy those types of games then you won't enjoy this one. Simple as that. For thirty bucks though this is worth it.","November 16, 2014","true","14.7"," 29 of 60 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","29","60","0","0"

Through out the game you will build keeps to further bloodlines, crucibles for training and Sagewrights guild for research.\n\nYou will also engage in some genetic engineering through selective pairing to get the best possible heroes.\nThe heroes you pair do a few things. 1. They have a chance to pass along some of their traits (positive and negative) to their kids. 2. They pass along some of their XP. This alone fixes the massive flaw in XCOM, by the midgame of XCOM any new recruit you get is useless to you. Now your new recruits are able to scale in power as the game progresses.\n\nThe other big flaw involves "losing" a battle. While there is no "ironman" mode that I can see, I play with it self imposed on myself. In XCOM ironman mode, a team wipe is essentially a loss state. You likely have no team of soldiers that can adequately replace a team that fought something tough enough to get wiped by. In MC, a team wipe hurts, you spread more "corruption" (Panic) and obviously you lost your heroes, BUT it is not a game over scenario as you have a team to fight with comeing through the ranks (at least you should) infact, losing members of your team can result in the creation of a "Relic", a weapon that it bound to the bloodline of the hero, can critical strike, and grows stronger as you use it.\n\nThe game is a blast to manage if you love XCOM and CKII. It is still unfinished at this time, the only feature that I can tell is missing is hybrid classes, but the game plays great without it right now. If there was one thing I would add to this game it would be an active/reactive combat system like Gladius, but that is just me being wishful for Gladius II...\n\nThe actual tactical battles are cleverly done with some cool maps and the different types of enemies add some good depth to the combat, certain enemies need to be approached the right way or they can really cause problems at different points in the game. Lapses in the late game are nasty, wrinklers in the mid game, Bulwarks in the early game. They all attack very differently (especially in the case of Lapses and Wrinklers) and in ways that are thematically appropriate (messing with time) and not simply a case of one just hitting harder. The one knock I do have is once the 5-6 different enemies are rolled out it kinda stops, eventually they all become "advanced" versions of the same thing, no reskins, no different mechanics. That is an area for improvement as the game moves to launch.\n\nThere is no difficulty setting I can see, but the games difficulty is more than adequate, however as you get a bit more familiar with the items you can equip, you can use the imformation about the types of enemies you are facing to give your guys a leg up. In future playthroughs I am going to try and not look at that information before battles as the game got a lot easier once I started really looking at the types of enemies I would face pre-battle.\n\nOne successful playthrough (3rd try) took me about 25 hours and it already has great replay value in the randomness of it's design. As it sits right now it is worth the price of admission and this game will only improve as it gets closer to launch.\n\nThe short version is that this game took XCOM and made it better in almost every way, even in it's presently unfinished state.","November 23, 2014","true","91.6"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","0"

Where it differs is in the meta-game; rather than building a base and managing resources, you're managing the family trees of your squad.  You do still research equipment and choose buildings for the different regions in the kingdom, but it's a more limited set of choices than you may be used to.  The overall aim of the game is to survive as a kingdom under threat, until the titular Massive Chalice is able to purge the threat from your lands forever.\n\nThe heroes that make up your squad (up to 5 at a time) are born, they age, gain experience and abilities, and die.  They will die a lot, and saving and reloading when a mission goes poorly won't save them.  The timeline that you are trying to survive through means that even if everything goes according to plan, your heroes will still eventually succumb to old age.  The trick is to ensure you have enough new heroes being born (with beneficial heriditary traits) to replace them.\n\nOn a functional level, the game looks and sounds beautiful.  The art design is outstanding, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it win some awards at the end of the year.  It is still in Beta, but I've not experienced any game-breaking bugs.\n\nI've followed the development of the game throughout the process, from concept art to playing it on Steam, thanks to DoubleFine's excellent TeamStreams.  I understand why certain decisions have been made, and while there are some tweaks I'd like to see to the balancing, overall the game is challenging, fun, pretty, and a triumph for open game development that I hope more developers learn from in the future.  :D","November 15, 2014","true","23.3"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","0"

So far, I like the game, and I see potential for continued improvement before the final release.\n\nThe game does play like a fantasy X-COM in a lot of ways, but I was also reminded of the random good and bad traits from Rogue Legacy. These affect your strategic choices because many can be transmitted genetically (so be careful who you choose to found bloodlines) or socially (so be careful who you appoint as trainers). I also feel losing a valuable soldier hurts less in Massive Chalice than in X-COM, because all your soldiers are going to age and die anyway. It's a neat twist.\n\nWHAT I LIKE:\n- the graphics are charming; I like the style\n- the choices on the strategic planning map are challenging and I feel there are probably multiple good (no "best") choices\n\nWHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE CHANGED:\n- unit variety I'd like more than three classes, and some way to "blend" abilities of different classes (e.g., one parent's an alchemist and the other's a hunter, so the kids they raise are a little bit of each)\n- silly catchphrases make me roll my eyes a bit; maybe the "serious mode vs. silly mode" setting (I forget what it's actually called) isn't implemented yet?\n- eventually, I'd like to see an option to let the timeline extend beyond 300 years\n\nAnyway, I've enjoyed what I've played of Massive Chalice so far, and will be on the look out for future updates.","November 16, 2014","true","2.5"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","0"

For instance to be a healer you have to research this health potion, that you can equip on anyone. (you only get 1 health potion per character if they have it equipped, and it heals for 10 hp). But you are limited to only one item per character, this wouldn't be a problem if your characters could hit anything for their lives.\nSo you have to get the item that makes their accuracy higher (by 15%) even with this I found my guys still missing point blank shots, or missing against inanimate objects. More often than not I had scenarios where my guys didn't hit a single thing, and everyone just died. I mean come on! their warriors, dedicating their lives to protect a kingdom and they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.\n\nAlso the mechanics of their hit rates seemed all over the place, Sometimes I found  at the furthest distance you can be from an enemy you get a better hit percentage, but sometimes that idea went right out the window. Also there is no indicator of how far a move can go before you move your character. leaving me with guys one space shy of being able to hit something a lot of the time. (attack ranges of at least your characters needs to be displayed) many games like final fantasy tactics, or Disgea execute this much better.\n\nSome voice acting issues\nsome of the banter between your 2 chalice deities or w/e seems like it was cut short, and some cut scenes show a glowing light when ever they talk, but they stop talking and the light keeps flickering, and it feels like you missed the end of a conversation half the time.\n\nillusion of freedom\nyou are given a lot of choices to upgrade your kingdom, but I found myself not making it past the 4th or 5th battles If I didn't stick to a precise set of upgrades. Enemies get a lot harder each time you have a battle.\n\nThere is a nice pull and push in fighting back oncoming enemies. You are attacked by 2 groups, one you can kill, the other takes 1/3 of the tile. So you have an important decision on what you need to defend. However some tiles ie. the most outer ones (going to be attacked 1st every time) have perks to them. like makes research faster, or lvls up your guys faster. having them only on the outer edge of the map seems stupid. there should be a perk per tile. You're going to loose tiles no matter what and it feels like a whole one step forward 2 steps back process.\n\nLeveling up your heroes:\nThis is a hard mechanic to get your 1st play through, and you won't rly know how to do it efficiently until like your 2nd-4th play through.\nYou heroes die of old age pretty fast, so instead of lvling them up you really need to pass down (items/relics) that get better with every generation. Also parents pass down traits, some good some bad. So don't get attached to anyone, get attached to bloodlines. This is a cool mechanic too, buuuuuuuuuut to do this you need higher lvl heroes to become rulers of their keeps (bloodline homes) and it's rly hard to start a bloodline when all you ever have are clumsy dorks who usually have crappy stats to begin with because they are lvl 1, and you can't really get anyone better because they have to die off, and by that time you may or may not have already lost the game.\n\nlevel design:\nsome levels have really cool mechanics, like moving obstetrical that can be pushed or destroyed by enemies and this lets you block off areas, obstruct enemy vision ,and is a pretty cool mechanic, buuuuuuuuuuuuuut( sigh) it's only in 2 levels. The one with the egg shaped blocks that can move around, and the other level with geysers.\n\nvisuals:\nAWESOME! Doublefine is great at making games with their own character, and this game is no exception. I just wish the game was not so frustratingly, and sometimes, impossibly difficult.\n\nThis game has a long way to go if it's going to be good, and I want it to be good, that's why I got it.To support them, there was a kick starter and stuff, but they still need a help.     :(","November 13, 2014","true","6.0"," 26 of 54 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","26","54","0","0"

Light because it doesn't have the depth and content of XCOM. There is little explanation on what Cadence really is, and there are only 2 types of missions; defend the keep and defend the territory, aside from the final mission. That said, the game is also about half the price of XCOM.\n\nThe concept of bloodlines is interesting but unfortunately, the drawback is that your heroes die so fast from aging, you will not develop any attachment to them, unlike XCOM. You will have to plan carefully on what to do with your heroes, making sure that you have a sufficient fighting force and at the same time, enough set aside to research and continue the next generation.\n\nIn my opinion, while the game is fun, it needs more polish, balancing and CONTENT. I wouldn't mind paying more if the game has more content. As it stands, I would rate it a 7/10.","November 16, 2014","true","38.7"," 24 of 50 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","24","50","0","1"

The game is great as it is, but will only become more balanced, polished and rewarding in the run up to the spring 2015 release.\n\nI kickstarted this game, and the team have been really responsive, streaming their development progress every couple of weeks the whole time, and it's been fun to be a part of, so if the idea of helping fine tune a game's mechanics sounds cool to you, I'd definitely consider Early Access. So far they've been responding really well to everyone's feedback with several significant balance tweaks in the short 3 weeks since the backer beta began.\n\nEven if you just want to play the game, there's a fine XCOM style strategy already working here with a generational twist, and if that sounds like your thing, I can totally recommend picking it up either now or once it's totally done in the spring if you'd rather play something completely done - but you can play it start to finish right now and have a great time.\n\nAdd in super distinctive art direction and a wonderful soundtrack, as well as some very Double-Finey touches to the world building and writing, and this is one of my favourite games of the year, which is quite an achievement for something that's still got a few months of development left to go!","November 11, 2014","true","107.6"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","0"

But especially here the good outweighs the bad.\n\nGood:\n\nA great Tactical Turn Based RPG/Breeding Simulator. Aside from units seemingly not having "Facing". I'm not always doing the same thing with my capital either so far, a few times I've researched more pools of heroes to have more people to breed due to an irritating loss due to a few mistakes in combat facing a new type of enemy. This one time one of my forts was empty, so I set a 1 year old as the regent and married him to a 3 year old girl because I was low on choices (despite not knowing how likely they would be to breed). Then they had babies twice right away at ages 16 and 17. I was like "Success!". I feel the game gives you "enough" choice. For example, I had the choice of defending an area with no blight but I would get more XP for killing stuff, whereas the other place already had blight but I would only get a baby girl for defending it. It would be more risky to let the blight spread where it is already, but more rewarding for my heroes to take the non-blighted land.\n\n\nNot Good or Bad:\n\nSome people complain about the graphical style, saying it has "Bad graphics". At first it was jarring for me. But as I played about an hour into it, the style just works. It reminds me of some of the art in Civ, just in 3-D. As your heroes age, it shows in their faces. This simplified style works wonders here, as you can tell they are older just by looking at their faces. The style remains consistant throughout the game and works well in most if not all areas. It also gives it more of a painted fantasy storybook look. I wouldn't change it, but adding some new particles or lightning might further boost the look.\n\nThings I would improve:\n\nFree equipments. I think the research time should be cut and you should have to "build" equipments consuming monster parts. If you lose a group out in the field you lost those equips, if you lost one dude out in the field, but you won, you get his equips back. It just bugs me a little that once you research something, you immidiately get 100+ free items through the course of the game.\n\nBad:\n\nCrucibles are too hard. There are ways of dealing with every enemy and situation in the game (so far) that I've found out by using each class's different skills (Clobberjacks for stunning things at right times, bombing enemies from around structures, using the hunter to scout ahead a bit, etc). Except for Crucibles. They seem to outrange you, and not only that they can kill any ranged person in one shot because they do like 14+ damage. If you use both actions in your turn and "ran" into the sight of one, you are dead as soon as it's their turn. Even Clobberjacks like level 5 with the second teir armor seem to go down to like 1/3rd hp. Since they are ranged it is sometimes hard if not impossible to get to them in time to stun them too. You either catch them around a corner and stun/bomb/kill before it's their turn, or you get unlucky and have to fight them in the open. I found on a level where there are more than 2 Crucibles, I should always expect to lose a guy. Even the brute kockback teleporting fist dude can be dealt with, but these crucibles...","December 11, 2014","true","11.1"," 55 of 113 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","55","113","0","0"

Once I start playing I have difficulty turning it off as there is always "one-more event" that I begin counting down to and the battles are engaging and well designed.\n\nI really enjoy the "recruitment" process of marrying off your heroes and having them found dynasties to continue producing heirs and playable heroes. It's a great twist on how heroes are usually recruited, especially with the ability to breed for particular traits.\n\nIt's great how much the game is actually affected by this mechanic, as you need to decide when to essentially "retire" heroes in order to benefit from their strengths in future generations, without them dying before their time.\n\nIt would be good to see one or two new classes be brought into the fray, there would obviously be alot of work required to maintain the excellent balance that already exists, however the addition of extra classes would prevent it from getting stale too quickly.\n\nI also enjoy the random events that require decisions to be made and years later the full repercussions of these events are revealed, for good or bad, it really makes you take the time to think on your choices, as you can't simply save / load a file to rethink your decision.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good turn-based strategy with roguelike elements, a gameplay and difficulty similar to the likes of X-Com, however it is certainly by no means an X-Com clone.\n\n","November 25, 2014","true","14.1"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","20","42","0","0"

Where the game is now, however, it's not /quite/ there - but it more than easily has that potential. The attacks on your kingdom force you to truly build up a team of heroes that rival the forces of the Cadence, while at the same time making you choose which of those heroes will carry on a bloodline, teach trainees, and who will carry on the research. The balancing act is, by itself, a game that put me to a bit of a challenge, at first.\n\nAs I said, I feel that this game wants to do two things at once, which is fine. But in the wise, immortal words of Ron Swanson; "Never half ♥♥♥ two things, whole ♥♥♥ one thing." My first playthrough (which ended up with me having zero hunters and no idea how to get out of that bind) was a complete flop - But it frustrated me in a way that I /wanted/ to find out how to remedy that situation. So, I started anew and quickly built up three keeps, stocking them each with one of the classes, figuring this would keep my army strong with new recruits and my sagewrights pouring in.\n\nHow wrong I was. Quickly, it became apparent that I had partnered with each of my regents, Queenmakers. My female population boomed! That wouldn't have been an issue if most of my males had survived past the Regent's deaths (I've only had one hero die on the battlefield, so far, my regents just refused to die). As it was, I struggled to balance out my kingdom. It was wonderful and challenging just enough because you cannot replace regents, you cannot pull back your sagewrights. But now, in year 150, I've found that simply bolstering your ranks with new recruits from the research/build option, that's never an issue.\n\nBut it should be! And while, yes, I should be able to recharge my kingdom with new blood, I find that I'm able to do so easily and without effort because of this; There's simply not enough to build/research that I can't spare 15 years to recruit three times in a row. And this leads me to my next point...\n\nThe combat is fantastic! I love when the Cadence get the balls to move into my territory and the balancing act of which territory will get an extra corruption. Now, being in Early Access I understand the sameness over and over, but each battle I try to go into with a fresh perspective because the enemy types aren't always the same. However I've come to realize that currently, hunters are extremely powerful. Not because they're overpowered, but because Alchemists and Caberjacks just aren't up to snuff yet.\n\nThe Alchemist does have a nice aoe attack, but it pales in comparison to a hunter because of the lack of vials. And while they're "weak" physically, most of mine do actually punch things pretty hard - so they're not totally useless after they've blown their load all over the field, but I just feel like having the hunter would do more for me. Caberjacks, on the other hand, hit like Optimus Prime and if you equip them in the Bulwark armor they're actually fairly tough tanks. But they lack the range of their hunter counterpart and still have the same HP pool on most heroes.\n\nNow, I know these things can be breeded out through genetics of your bloodlines, and that's fine. I just don't feel like the other two classes are quite up to par just yet - which is terrible because it caused me to build another two keeps for more hunters and another for Caberjacks (as a just in case) but I completely disregard my alchemist line except for Sagewrights. Which, in a weird way actually works out well because I've bred them to be intuitive and that helps research times. Except, I'm out of things to research.\n\nSo, in closing, Massive Chalice has great potential and while it is still in Early Access, it's the perfect time to get this kind of feedback in for the developers to look at. Again, only halfway through my (second) playthrough and I can see replayability being a thing, because I want to know how some of those random events turn out in other ways. If you're on the fence about this game, I highly recommend it, especially if Double Fine can keep up the work.","November 18, 2014","true","8.4"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","18","38","0","0"

Challenging but rewarding leveling\n5. Great difficulty, challenging but never unfair\n6. Character breeding. Take two characters together, make a keep, slap them together, and boom! Warrior baby! or lowly peasant baby, all depends really.\n7.Ability to research different upgrades, buildings, and character skills for different play styles\n8. passing of weapons of fallen heroes\n9. The story plays over 300 years so you have to plan in advanced to get good heroes that were created due to the hard work of their ancestors who you controlled in battle leading to a lineage of heroes.\n10. Random events occur as time passes and you get to pick the result, each with its own consequences\n\nAll is not perfect however. There are a few drawbacks\n\n1. Only 3 classes\n2. Not too many abilities for each class\n3. The tutorial is a bit convoluted. It confused me more than it should have. It plays like all other tactical games but you wouldnt know by the diagram they throw at you.\n4. Not a lot to reasearch\n5. A lack of options in most areas. There are a few but not nearly enough","November 12, 2014","true","13.7"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

Broadly speaking, the game divides into two distinct segments: the "grand" strategy map, where you'll mostly make choices with regards to things like what to research, who to marry to whom, how to react to certain events etc., which are interrupted by enemy attacks in the tactical maps, which play out very similarly to XCOM missions if without quite as much detail or tactical flexibility.\n\nThere are some genuinely intriguing design decisions here - marrying off heroes of two separate classes will create hybrid classes, opening up new options in the tactical maps. High-level heroes will leave behind heirlooms when they die, letting their legacy live on through those relics (which can also be levelled). The Cadence (the evil guys) will always attack more than one region at a time, leaving you to make broader strategic choices as to how to defend your territory with the ultimate aim of surviving for the 350 or so years the game spans.\n\nThe graphics are charming, albeit simplistic. They do fit the theme of the game, which is light-hearted and fun. That doesn't mean it's a simple game; it's just simple to get into. The controls are easy to pick up, but it's the broader context of the game that's harder to master. Building lasting bloodlines, ensuring a sufficient diversity of hero classes through shrewd marriages and the like...all the while cheering for the battlefield victories of individual heroes you'll come to know, love and mourn as they pass.

You control a squad of heroes against a force of maurauding monsters. Instead of aliens, however, you fight the Cadence. Demonic entities that can corrupt the land, steal experience from your champions, and even age those they touch by years at a time. Your champions wield bow, flask, and caber in the defence of your kingdom.\n\nYour advantage in this war? An immortal king (the player) who can guide the battles of the nation over the course of centuries, and the Chalice, which can charge up over this time to lay waste to the Cadence on a global scale.\n\nOver the course of 300 years, you'll research new weapons and technologies, build keeps and other fortifications, and most importantly, guide the destinies of heroic bloodlines. For while the combat is similar in concept to X-Com, you do not recruit new heroes out of thin air. They must be bred.\n\nThe strongest champions become regents, and through arranged marriage, their children are made stronger. Weak traits are weeded out, strengths are promoted over the course of generations. Will your bloodlines become strong enough to make the final push to wipe out the Cadence?\n\nWith the latest patch to the beta game, there are now Hybrid classes that greatly mix up the combat, and I have been having a blast. (although the pure Hunter, Alchemist, and Caberjack classes are still fun). Personally I like the ****/Alchemist hybrids the best.\n\nIn short, the game gives us tactical, squad-based combat on an epic scale, and somehow makes Eugenics fun.\n\nGo play it.","January 20, 2015","true","101.2"," 39 of 81 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","39","81","0","1"

It might as well be called "Massive Time Sink", but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like similar games in the tactical campaign genre, this one involves a lot of careful planning and unnecessary soldier deaths.\n\nThe thing that sets it apart, however, is the breeding system, where family lines continue on through the ages, passing down training and useful traits. While these bloodlines are kept mostly safe in keeps, it's possible through poor luck or poorer planning to lose one entirely-- which keeps things interesting.\n\nBasically, if you enjoy short rounds of tactical combat spread over prolonged strategic campaigns, this is an excellent game. It's strongest when you're making interesting decisions, and the random events keep things lively, but it's not as fun when you've made a fatal mistake but still have an hour of gameplay before the inevitable loss claims you.","November 22, 2014","true","12.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Simple-enough to use, but all the things you want are there: line-of-sight, rotation, stealth, alternate attacks, visible chance-to-hit, etc.\n\nGraphics are very obviously polygonal--such that you wonder if its intentionally stylistic.

Building up one unit almost has no pay off, apart from being able to give someone in his/her bloodline a boost when they die.\n\nEnimies get really hard really fast, I have heard this complaint from others, but it's true, I have completely wiped a few times.

I know its still in beta, but getting past around year 100 is extremely difficult, to the point of impossible, and the gameplay has too much missing. (i know this sounds silly, missing is a good mechanic that can make things more lifelike), but in a strategy based game, especially at higher levels, it makes it very hard to plan attack strategies around the immensly strong enemies when you miss so often. each character has their sweet spots and you can even upgrade an item to make them more accurate, but it is still stressful. The alchemist which are supposed to be weak units that must hit from afar only start with 5 bombs, and you have to be within 2-3 spaces to get anything higher than a 60%, so they die. alot. even melee units, some units will get around a 60% when attacking at point blank. yet some get 100%. im not quite sure how this is supposted to work.\n\nIts a fantastic game, however I don't believe a strategy game's difficulty should be based around missing your target or not.

Combat isn't as complex as XCOM since there isn't cover or many advanced tactics, but it is still fun. The game will last you about 15-20 hours, and it does have some good replayability since you can take a different research route.

The talking Chalice is going to purge the monsters in 300 years, so you have to survive that period with the help of the warriors you recruit, manage and guide in turn-based X-COM-like battles. There is a twist - be it a kingdom management projects or hero level-ups, it takes long time. LONG time. Years, decades, literally. So the value of each investment and decision is becoming critically high.\nYour heroes are aging and dying of old age, as well as in battle, so you have to account for it by retiring them from active roster to form a family and produce offspring - your new cannon fodder. You can also retire them to research and training instituions- with age heroes get increased "wisdom" property, which is good for those activities.\nOne hero can only participate in a few actual battles, so you can't get a fighter from first to last level in a single lifetime.  This way, it becomes important to find the right time to retire your leveled-up hero to the family life - for the children of leveled-up characters will be automatically pre-leveled-up in accordance with their parents, and so can continue the advancement.\n\nGood stuff:\n-Beautiful design\n-The feeling of advancing despare and desperation, the all-powerful Time and Death.\n-Gameplay is easy to pick up and is quite enjoyable.\n\nNot so good stuff:\n-Story is rudimentary\n-There are not a lot of options for research/kingdom management, and even less of those are really worth consideration.\n-The game is "evil"-tough. I'll elaborate on this. In turn based combat games, like X-COM, there is usually a strong feeling of risk and the enemy outgunning you. It's tough, as screw-ups can lead to devastating effects for the whole team, and you have to take chances, think strategically and even just pray for a lucky outcome. This is part of the appeal, because it adds suspence and a semblance of realism.\nIn this game, though, the toughness is not of a risky, but of a depressing kind most of the time. Your team is screwed up from the start: your options for strategical advance and recon are limited by abilities/landscape. Also, there is almost no chance for blind luck to give you joy once in a while. I do understand that it's the part of the idea that your fighters will die messily and often. But mission after mission of "we are blindly rushing in a pre-arranged death-trap" kills fun rather sooner than later.\n\nStill, all in all, it's an interesting game with a potential, as it's still in EA stage.","January 26, 2015","true","13.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

It's hard. It's relatively bug-free.\n\nMC seeks to address a lot of the issues with squad-based tactics games like X-COM, primarily by making character death less of an issue. The fact that even your best warriors will eventually die of old age means that losing a few in battle doesn't NECCESARILY require a restart of the entire mission. Heck, if they die in battle they might turn into a magical weapon for your other warriors to use.\n\nThat being said, there are issues, though most of them just come with the territory in this type of game. There are a lot of things to research and build, and all of them take a long time. If things start going badly for you, don't expect them to stop.

So I made sure I wasn't attached to anyone, but I couldn't really be anyway, also...being attached to characters is what makes a game fun.

It's a game that is at the same time very neat, and very clunky.\n\nFor example the combat (one of the things you'll be doing the most) is laid out in a neat way, the UI is good. You get a lot of information (although not enough like the game not telling you if you'll be in the range for a melee attack) without it cluttering the interface.\nThat however doesn't make the actual combat any better. While at first it might be enjoyable to experiment with various classes you quickly discover strategies that work best for your current line-up and stick to them.\n\nFor example if you play with a lot of hunters you'll be doing a lot of sneaking and alpha striking the enemy to blow him up before he can react, as kaberjacks you'll notice that enemies take damage by getting knocked back into walls AND into units. So you'll abuse that fact for more damage+stun potential, alchemists are really only good against the weakest enemies in the game. so after the start they only really serve to make kaberjack and hunter hybrids. But that creates a problem for the other game mechanics.\n\nThe breeding. It is supposed to be a big part of the game but really it turns into a chore. The mechanics are never explained properly so you have to do a lot of guesswork to understand how to do it properly. It is important to remember that your kids will not only get the traits of the parents, but also possibly random ones or traits from the OTHER members of the family tree, OR perks that you didn't even know the family has. This is extremely frustrating in the early game and if not managed properly becomes a problem in the mid and even late game.\n\nImagine this scenario. You decide that you'll base your early game on kaberjacks (and you have to decide who to base it on early because you only get one castle at start). Cool. You built your castle, you find a good young couple with a high fertility rating and good kaberjack stats and mush them together. Recipe for success right? No.\n\nNow it took your super fertile mating pair anywhere between 0 and 40 years to pop their first baby. They might NEVER get one even though the release day patch supposedly altered the numbers. But hey, there is a kid! Oops he's asthmatic and anaemic. So he can't run and he has reduced hp. WHy is that?! Oh because both family trees had those perks hidden in their genes and you had absolutely NO way of knowing that. Enjoy.\n\nNow imagine you're doing this for 300 in-game years while having to constantly bring in new blood (and new bad traits) because upkeeping a family that is provided for is apparently a really hard task.\n\nSo yeah, neat idea, pretty dull and clunky execution. Same you could say for most of the game.\n\nHonestly if this is how Double Fine keep doing things I think I'll just stop buying things from them altogether.","June 20, 2015","false","11.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/246110/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview of the .96b beta\n\nShorter Review: A mixture of kingdom management, tactical battles, RPG, and hero breeding that  produces a satisfying game requiring thought and planning  Still being polished, but looking promising, and worth it if this is your area of interest.\n\nTo review Massive Chalice, you need to start with the story.\n\nYou're an Immortal regent, bound to a mysterious chalice holding the souls of past heroes.  That chalice is the only hope of your nation to cleanse it of the foul creatures that threaten it, the mysterious Cadence.  You'll rally heroes to fight, decide how to run the kingdom, and figure out how to survive.  Good thing you're immortal, because your heroes are not, and you'll need to plan how to use them, marry them, retire them, and pass on their legacies.  You've got a 300 year war ahead of you until the Chalice is powerful enough to end it, and everyone who started the battle with you will be dust when it's over . . .\n\nMassive Challice is a game that combines several play mechanics in a way that's easy to pick up - hard to master.  That's not an emplty statement - it's the truth, because the simple parts interact in many ways.\n* A straightforward, effective, but deep tactical battle game where heroes fight monsters.\n* An RPG system where you manage characters, equipment, and skills.\n* A straightforward, but detailed hero-breeding system where you establish lineages of heroes - who inherit traits, legacies, relics, and more.\n* A (rather light) Kingdom management game that consists of making choices of battles, what to construct, and how to react to random events.\n\nIn Massive Challice, you alternate battles with the Cadence and managing your kingdom and heroes over the course of 300 years.  One moment you're deciding who to attack, the next deciding what to build next, then responding to a random event, and finally trying to figure out if you should intermarry two heroic linages - then another battle may arise.  You're constantly scaling your strategy and tactics as you play, and how the different levels of the game mesh is a big part of the challenge and satisfaction - there's something about watching a new, well-trained hero of a class you unlocked due to an unusual marriage wield a weapon of his bloodline on the first go to cause massive damage.\n\nThis means that this is a game of planning and management - even when you're whomping on the Cadence.  Because time is tight, resources are limited, and enemies are tough you are always constrained, always evaluating, always scheming - and often regretting.  Death is permanent, decisions aren't reversable (well unless you're using a save game and not playing in Iron Mode), and time and resources lost aren't easily reclaimed.  You will start over, you will reload saves - and if this is your kind of game, you will go back again and again.\n\nThe combat, I think, deserves special note as it's well balanced.  There's 3 main classes and descendents via crossbreeding can unlock 6 more classes.  Stealth, special abilities, the right equipment, planning, and above all patience are requires for victory.  Pulling off massive kills and victories is quite satisfying and good planning is rewarded.  This is a precise, well done part of the game that was both deep yet completely accessible and intuitive.\n\nRegarding "Hero breeding" part of the game, it's straightforward on the surface - you get (or build) Keeps, appoint a regent and a partner, and they have kids (if they are capable of it).  Children inherit mental and physical traits and level up depending on parental experience - and other factors and structures.  The challenge is in avoiding bad traits, ensuring linages ("Relic" weapons are tied to a bloodline), balancing ages and genders, and determing what classes you want the next generation to be - you can easily mess up or destroy a bloodline.  Its fun, but At times can be wearing as you juggle combinations, though when you get a truly satisfying and fun character it's worth it.\n\nIf there's a flaw in this release it's that the kingdom management part of the game still feels a bit light and there's not a lot of guidance.  The kingdom management is decent, but I'd like to see a few more options for research and development, or to at least see some unlockable options earlier so you know what there is to work forward to.  Research opens up more as the game progresses, but is rather lackluster for the first third.\n\nI do think the game lacks good tips and guidances for the more subtle situations like good breeding and so on.  Perhaps thats part of the challenge, but it can take away from the fun.\n\nThe game's presentation is effective.  It has an angular look that puts me in mind of board games and low-poly games.  Character appearances change as they age.  The music, well done and subtle, sets a strange, almost somber mood (and is a strong point in the presentation).  The narration of the two souls in the chalice is decident to amusing, adding some levity and making you feel not so lonely (hey, you're immortal).\n\nI also feel the game should be praised for avoiding bog-standard fantasy classes.  There's no generic warriors, there's ram-wielding Caberjacks.  There's no thieves, there's stealty Hunters armed with enormous cannon-like crossbows.  No wizards either, but Alchemists who fling flasks of explosives with sharp-edged cestas called "Throwers."  As you breed heroes you unlock even more classes: Brewtalists, Trickshots, and more.\n\nIt's rather refreshing, and the subclasses get interesting as well - I think my personal favorite is the Caberjack/Hunter fusion called a Shadowjack who can go into stealth mode DESPITE wielding an enormous two handed battering ram as a weapon.\n\nYes, this game has characters who can spring out of the shadows and wack you with a giant log.\n\nAnd finally, let us close with the story.  Though the plot itself is compelling, I also enjoy how things happen to create your own narrative.  Random events change things.  Heroes grow, fight, sire offspring, die - or retire to teach or manage buildings (and then die).  You find yourself getting attached to bloodlines and some specific characters.  I still have fond memories of Freya "What's-Her-Face" Yurgin wielding the magical bow "Fang", or "The Beard" Nguyen the Brutal Brewtalist who retired to teach the next generations.\n\nI hope this game spawns others.  The idea of a kind of semi-procedural dynasty builder is compelling.\n\nI reccomend this game with a few limits - after all we're talking $30 bucks here.  If it was $20 it'd be no problem.\n* If this game sounds like it's up your alley, then it's worth it.  Certainly I have no regrets, feel I got my money's worth, and consider it replayable.\n* If the game sounds cool but you're not sure, wait for the full release to see what people say.  Its got a bit more tweaking and isn't exactly friendly to learn, so it's not something for everyone.\n\nI'm quite positive on this game.  I hope this launches a series, as the fusion of mechanics and long-term planning make this a fun, interesting, and satisfying game.","January 17, 2015","true","33.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

But a must buy game!\n\nOverall on of the best stratagy games out there!\n\n(NEW, game release review!) The release of a game update made the game so so so much better! its like a complete new game, a DLC to the game you can say.  I really like how you can feel so close to your heros/family in this game.... and you scream at the computer if one dies! i have done that so many times, that i felt embaressed when i did it.  My brother comes running up the stairs, "are you ok brother!?" then I scream at him, "no way brother! raphtin potter died!"\n\nI love the main map, I love how the tec works in the game, but I wish I could research two tecs at the same time. I wish there were more buildings to build.  But I only want more in the game because I like is so much!  I love the time line in how it works... after years your heros die and you need to breed a new set of heros every 40 years or so, and your tec and buildings take years to build and research.  most of what I wrote about is in the battle, but everything in the main map screen I really like. With the new controller support it feels like a completely different game, but I say that because I enjoy playing with the xbox 360 controller.... I give Massive Chalice a 9/10!!!\n\n1. I am playing on a surface pro one, which I can play games like crisis 2, whicher 2, skyrim... but this games graphics are not as good as xcoms and xcom works way better then this.  MC is very laggy even after putting it in windowed and revolution low, and taking off all the visual effects.  I played Gang Beasts from doubled fine and it has the same problem!!!!  I hope they fix this\n(UPDATE: FIXED GRAPHICS :)\n\n2. voices are good, but they need to put the voises together so there are no pauses in the cinamatics.  Also they need to add more voices into the game for the characters.  After they kill someone a comic book animation pops up, making it look like the character say something, why not make the character just have a voice over? also the cinamatics are very boring, make the speaks voices together without pauses\n(FIXED THE CINAMATICS :) but they still need to add voice overs for the families once they kill a bad dued)\n\n3. I am not sure why, but one of my guy attacks a ghost looking guy, and he does 2 damage (which it said he would do 11-15 damage), then another guy with the same weapon attacks and kills it doing 15 damage to it.\n(UPDATE: STILL NOT FIXED :(\n\n4.

The musical direction is superb, the combat has its own unique yet familiar feel, and the game will have you do some selective breeding.

The hybrid classes are what filled my ranks however, each one is unique and they mix classes from both of the parent's classes.

I like the concept and much of what's implemented. Haven't had time to play alot yet but I can list some +/- at least.\n\n+\nThe gfx style is kind of an aquired taste but it reminds me of games such as the Interstate '76 series. It's quite nice in it's simplicity.\n\nThe Bloodline Genetics system adds some depth to the game.\n\nThe voiceover for the chalice ... ghosts?\n\nFighting. It's not very complex but satisfying, mostly.\n\nEasy to get started but from what I can tell mastering it will take some practice.\n\n-\nRandomness. Yes there's always gonna be some degree of randomness but I feel it's a bit harsh sometimes. Like spawning in the middle of a big pack of cadence, assigning two healthy middle age heros to a castle and having one of them dying in a year with no children. Etc. If bad luck like this was rare I guess it would be fine but it's happened a couple of times in my short playtime.\n\nI think the time progresses a bit fast. Now don't get me wrong I don't want the game itself that much slower, build and research times don't need to be longer. But I'd like to spend a little more time with my heros. To get to know them better during combat etc. Mabe more frequent encounters would work as well.\n\nAbout half of the cadence I've faced so far explode making Caberjacks alot less useful than hunters and alchemists. This might work itself out when I get further and can start upgrading armor, get them to higher levels etc. But early game I don't really see the point to them. The cadence that don't explode can be killed just as easy by the two ranged classes. And while caberjacks get charge at level 1 and it has a knockback it has cooldown and if it doesn't finish the cadence off it can just walk up and explode next to the caberjack when your turn ends. Would be good if even at low levels with no upgrades to gear caberjacks had more health or better damage mitigation so they had better survivabilty,","January 28, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I like the concept and much of what's implemented. Haven't had time to play alot yet but I can list some +/- at least.\n\n+\nThe gfx style is kind of an aquired taste but it reminds me of games such as the Interstate '76 series. It's quite nice in it's simplicity.\n\nThe Bloodline Genetics system adds some depth to the game.\n\nThe voiceover for the chalice ... ghosts?\n\nFighting. It's not very complex but satisfying, mostly.\n\nEasy to get started but from what I can tell mastering it will take some practice.\n\n-\nRandomness. Yes there's always gonna be some degree of randomness but I feel it's a bit harsh sometimes. Like spawning in the middle of a big pack of cadence, assigning two healthy middle age heros to a castle and having one of them dying in a year with no children. Etc. If bad luck like this was rare I guess it would be fine but it's happened a couple of times in my short playtime.\n\nI think the time progresses a bit fast. Now don't get me wrong I don't want the game itself that much slower, build and research times don't need to be longer. But I'd like to spend a little more time with my heros. To get to know them better during combat etc. Mabe more frequent encounters would work as well.\n\nAbout half of the cadence I've faced so far explode making Caberjacks alot less useful than hunters and alchemists. This might work itself out when I get further and can start upgrading armor, get them to higher levels etc. But early game I don't really see the point to them. The cadence that don't explode can be killed just as easy by the two ranged classes. And while caberjacks get charge at level 1 and it has a knockback it has cooldown and if it doesn't finish the cadence off it can just walk up and explode next to the caberjack when your turn ends. Would be good if even at low levels with no upgrades to gear caberjacks had more health or better damage mitigation so they had better survivabilty,","January 28, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

As a turn-based strategy genre fan, I was very excited and looking up for this game as some kind of a new XCOM. However, it is not as what I hoped for. I couldn't feel any emotion or any regret for the characters upon their deaths. They would have died for old age anyway with or without diving into a combat which would make their basic characteristics doesn't matter at all. The game could have been better if there are more developments are put in the game. I couldn't see much the same from the original XCOM.

Try this game!\n\nThe combat comes down to a very few things, range attacks, AoE, melee and knock back. The enemies have there own strengths and weaknesses, but though the use of your Heros you can over come the enemies (mosly by combos of keep you enemy away and taking them down one at a time). The story is well something intresting, you can have it narrated straight forwerd or silly.\n\nThe combat can be overwellming when you have to many enemies to fight off at once (4 or more different provoked enemies will kill someone or your whole party)\n\nWhat I hope comes to the full version is\n-more classes\n-AI boss enemies (maybe evolving like you heros though some breading)\n-AI that know how to run away to fight again with there fellow enemies\n-AI that try to flank or trick you into a fight\n-more weapons\n-making your own custom Families/House (banner and Names)\n\nAll in all really good game, you may find your self saying " oh just a few more years, just a bit longer".","January 10, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

They're arranged in alphabetical order which is nice. All of these are pretty great like this one battle cry "For Glory!...or something." Oh man I bet this game is going to be great.\n\n10 min in: Okay picked my houses, now to go on to the game. Okay so I'm some immortal commander, giant talking chalice with two spirit things. And some kind of encroaching darkness on the land I have to keep back for the next 300 years so the chalice can charge up its super awesome attack to vanquish it for good. Okay why didn't you ever do this sooner? I guess I'll accept it for now. Oh look an attack is going on, better go take care of it.\n\n12 min in: Hey this looks like xcom, oh cool all the characters have different traits, like faint of heart which will make you weaker when your allies die. That sounds like something from xcom. At least all the houses i chose are what these guys are from. Oh whats this? These guys have kids? That sounds pretty cool. I can have different blood lines, this is going to be sweet.\n\n13 min in: Hey...why do these controls look a lot like xcom's...\n\n14 min in: Okay time to move my guys...Wait thats how you move them...Oh no this is exactly like Xcom's movement system.\n\n15 min in: Hey look an enemy, alright so how do we...wait what? Enemy in sight...darkness outside the field of view...Oh you have got to be kidding me. This is XCOM! Its literally the same game but in a fantasy setting. Okay maybe I'm just judging it a little too early. After all if this is like XCOM, its a very long game before you learn everything. i'm sure there will be mechanics that make it vastly different from XCOM.\n\n20 min in: Seriously the combat is a direct rip off of XCOM, except this time only one guy can shoot things that are 2 feet in front of him and still miss. You even have units that use grenades! Oh I'm sorry "Alchemists" that throw "flasks" Yeah nice save there.\n\n22 min in: Okay beat the first battle, now on to the non-combat section of the game. I bet this is where it will diffirentiate itself from XCOM, i mean there is no way they'd copy that as well...right?\n\n24 min in: Oh so i can assign regents to a keep, putting them in charge of it with a partner. Then they procreate, have kids and they also become heroes which i can take into battle, or assign to lead into a keep? Hey thats pretty neat.\n\n28 min in: Okay I took care of everything here, now i just click on that play button there....Oh come on! You copied that from XCOM too!? The map is just like the base from XCOM, come on double fine! Whatever, maybe theres more than meets the eye. After all 300 years are supposed to pass, there is going to at least be more mechanics than what i'm seeing right now.\n\n30 min in: Alright it appears 5 years have passed and, oh a new battle, alright lets go to that region and protect it. Now lets go to the screen and select my heroes to fi-ITS THE SAME AS XCOM'S! THE DEPLOYMENT SCREEN IS LITERALLY XCOM'S BUT JUST WITH THEM STANDING OVER A CHALICE! OH COME ON! Whatever just lets see these classes. Alchemist, Caberjack, Hunter, and...Is that it? Are you seriously telling me there are only 3 classes for the heroes? Really!? You couldn't even copy XCOM on that with their 4? Are you kidding me?\n\n32 min in: There are lot of these Rupture guys, they explode and leave behind some kind of acid that damages units caught in the acid...just like in XCOM.\n\n35 min in: More of these Rupture enemies? Geez is the whole level nothing but these guys?\n\n38 min in: Oh my god the whole level was nothing but those guys...\n\n44 min in: Alright i have all this stuff set up, my regents are making babies so I'll have future generations to lead, i built this guild to research new stuff for me, everythings going pretty good...wait what? A bunch of my guys died, how? Old age!? What! Okay I understand this game takes place over the course of years, but these guys were barely level 2! And they died in their 40's! They didn't even make it past 50. Whats the point of leveling these guys up when not even 10 minutes later they'll die of old age!?\n\n50 min in: Yay more babies born, some have grown up now, Rory is a bit of a grown up now, and he isn't too bad. He's a hunter, got the hawkeye perk, I think he'll make for a fine soldier.\n\n55 min in: Another battle...terrific.\n\n63 min in: Battle won, I'm done, I'm getting really sick of this.\n\n65 min in: Yo guild! You have literally contributed nothing so far! You have done nothing to benefit our fight against this darkness. What have you done at all? I keep giving you members that end up dying of old age, but yet you continue to do nothing. Fine whatever I'll just go build this citadel thing.\n\n67 min in: So you put units in here to train? Okay I'll put Rory in here, he did well in the last battle so leveling him up is a good idea.\n\n70 min in: Finally I found a use for you guild. Research this health potion thing to heal my soldiers up.\n\n72 min in: Another battle, another day. Yay...\n\n74 min in: Holy crap someone actually died!? Wow okay thats...I really don't care. You want to know why game? Because unlike XCOM I can't bring myself to actually care about the people i'm sending in to fight. I don't grow attached to them, and unlike with XCOM, I don't cry and mourn when one of them dies. Which since you are obviously ripping them off, is a blatant failure.\n\n78 min in: HOW DID YOU MISS!? EVEN WORSE HOW DID YOU NOT ONLY MISS, BUT THROW YOUR FLASK OFF A CLIFF!? YOU SOMEHOW NOT ONLY MANAGED TO MISS YOUR TARGET WITH A 85% CHANCE OF HITTING THEM, BUT YOU ALSO MISSED AND THREW IT OFF THE CLIFF! YOU ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\n80 min in: Oh hey look its some kind of blue lady enemy made of energy. Just like X-nope not going there. I saw her earlier but she never managed to hit me with her ranged attack.\n\n81 min in: WHAT! SHE DRAINS XP WHEN SHE HITS YOU!? AND YOU CAN LOSE AN ENTIRE LEVEL IF YOU'RE HIT ENOUGH, AND YOU ALSO STILL TAKE THE NORMAL HEALTH DAMAGE!? Even XCOM didn't do that and it was incredibly difficult without it! Don't pad your game out with artificial difficulty!\n\n85 min in: Wait the losing battle system is just like XCOM's but worse...My patience is thinner than ice right now..\n\n88 min in: You know its been a few decades now, when am I getting Rory back? I know he's not dead so...where is he? He seriously can't still be training.\n\n91 min in: Seriously I don't see any difference between this and XCOM.\n\n94 min in: Build a keep here, and...Hey that area i wanted to build something on is being attacked, I better take care of that.\n\n96 min in: Alright i'm in...level bland as ever, everything literally inferior to XCOM? Yep.\n\n97 min in: Oh look more Ruptures, and blue ladies, and a ball with two legs...you know I'm just over an hour in and yet this game still only has 3 enemy types? All of which are rip offs? I guess they have a motiff of ripping off, doing worse, and giving less with this game don't they?\n\n100 min in: Units are dying but I can still win this.\n\n105 min in: Okay make that 1 guy left, at least he's an alchemist. Sure he's low health but he can deal damage from a distance and his range attacks also have an area of effect, just use that move on the last two enemies that are right beside each other and I win the battle.\n\n108 min in:...He died...He threw it...and he failed so badly...it went back and hit him...killing him...He had a 95% chance of not only hitting them, but killing them too...and he somehow manages to throw the flask at himself...\n\n110 min in: ...ffffFFFUUUU-*screams of rage destroy everything in a 200 mile radius.*\n\n4/10 Get XCOM: Enemy Unknown.

For an early access / beta the game it performs well with little to no bugs (there were 1 maybe 2 but they were so minor I can't remember them).\n\nThe aethetics of the graphic design is a pleasure to look at and the UI is quite clean and easy to understand. The rolling time line is punctuated with births, deaths, attacks and the occaisonal random event. In essecence theses are a test of your strategy. Do you have enough characters? are they upto the task ? Do you have enough breaders and other trainees to full the other roles?\n\nThere have been one or two comments previously saying this is no XCOM. This is true but the game is not trying be that. With the exception of the turnbased tactical combat, the game is not about micro managment or drowning in a sea of stats but rather seeing how a few crucial decisions playout over the long term.\n\nAll in all an enjoyable game thus far.\n\n","February 28, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This means moving each individual piece across a map to remove Fog of War until you see the enemy and then, finally dealing with them. In addition, some of the enemies blow up when you kill them and some of your characters only do melee damage. . .  so you have to deal with only using them in melee range, but also not killing the enemies that blow-up with them. It doesn't have the speed, long sight lines, and variety of ranged attacks that made XCOM an enjoyable strategy RPG either.\n\nI'm in love with the concept of Bloodlines and family traits for a generation-spanning RPG, but the appeal of that is killed by the fact that the game is a strategy RPG. Additionally, I imagined handsome heroes growing up from adolescents who are learning their craft to young adults honing it, to mature adults achieving their legacy, to elders securing and nurturing it, but the art is so stylized that the humans look monstrously mishapen. . .  I'm not wondering what my hero's kids will look like because it will just be some flavor of ugly.\n\nUnfortunately, Massive Chalice's ideas had some great traits, but they were bread with some ideas with bad traits, the resulting offspring has suffered.","June 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's mostly about staying outside of the attack range of enemies, and ganging up on them one at a time. (By the end of the game you can sometimes eliminate one enemy per soldier per game though).  The soldier classes are pretty fun, especially the caberjack, which can push and stun enemies. If enemies are stacked in a line, he can even stun more than one. He synergizes well with the alchemist, who can drop some bombs on the enemies he's shoved together. The hunter is a little less impressive, but it's excellent to have one on the team due to the stealth abilities they get from the start. I understand DF is also working adding some hybrid classes.\n\nThe strategic game has a pretty steep learning curve. Your soldiers will maybe get 4 combats in over the course of their lifetimes, and so you need to build a dynasty. It's a mix of ensuring fertility (many offspring), experience (new soldier experience depends on regent at keep and standards at crucibles), and positive traits (a bit of eugenics between experienced regents and desirable mates). My first couple runs, I couldn't fill out my combat roster on the 5th or so combat.\n\nGripes: later on there are advanced versions of the enemies, which basically just have 2x hp and 2x damage.

Also, points for being one of a few Early Access games that's actually complete, but just needs more content (you know, the way it's supposed to be).\n\nStory: the story is, you are a god-like entity brought into being by the Massive Chalice to save the lands from the encroaching Cadence, which you will do over the stretch of three hundred years. I liked the dual voices of the Massive Chalice, and there's nothing to really complain about on that front.\n\nGameplay: You control different houses, and attempt to keep the bloodlines going throughout the three hundred years required for the chalice to activate while fighting off occasional incursions and doing research to improve the lands/heroes. It's a very good system, and the moment the game gave me a character in the Armstrong lineage named "Alex-Louis", the idea of passing down his Alchemist technique through the Armstrong line for generations never stopped being funny.\n\nThe rub (and indeed, the caution part of this tale) is in the combat. This game most clearly takes influence from XCOM: Enemy Unknown and (to a lesser extent) Fire Emblem: Awakening. Problem is, it lacks the balance of the former, the insane depth of the latter and the expediency of both. One of the things I liked about those games (I'm using them for comparison because it's exactly the same turn-based combat XCOM was) is that you could move through a turn quickly. You could immediately end your turn in both games if people still had moves left but you were satisfied with your position. You could tailor FE:A to move through combat and turns quick, and you could switch to other people in XCOM while a squadmate was still executing his/her turn. It kept the game from being too slow, and I feel like this combat lacks it.It's also not helped by the characters taking strangely wonky path that would sometimes do a near 360 to get to a box when they could just step four paces in a straight line. Also, I despise how the camera would linger on an enemy after you miss, as if to congratulate you on an unlucky dice roll and slow the pace down further.\n\nOn top of that, the balance was fine right up until I hit the Bulwarks, which I felt were introduced long before I had the capability to deal with them. It kept going on like that from there. Also, like XCOM, the game has a fog of war which the enemies aren't supposed to hit you from until you find each other. Problem is, some of the enemies don't obey that rule, and I'd keep getting hit by ranged units that'd come flying out of the fog of war with (metaphorical) guns blazing even though I hadn't discovered them yet.\n\nAlso, do you remember how you'd kinda chuckle in XCOM when it'd say you had a 95% chance to hit and you'd still miss like...1 out of every 8-10 shots? Enjoy the most deceptive percentage system in history, where 90% means you're gonna miss 2-3 out of every 5 shots. At one point, out of curiosity, I actually reloaded a save to see how many times I hit an enemy I had an 80% shot of hitting. I got 12 out of 20 before I stopped. Maybe I got unlucky, but that actually feels like a very accurate representation of the accuracy in this game. I understand it's gamblers fallacy to assume 80% means I'll hit four out of five times, but there's a massive difference between that and a near constant 50%.\n\nWhich leads to the chief complaint about the combat system: its ambiguity. I have to guesstimate how far the enemies are going to move, the percentage system lies to me, caberjacks never seem to be close enough to help anything, and there are the glancing blows that are the RNG's way of saying "you're not appreciating this combat system enough, allow me to screw you over because the unreliable hit percentage wasn't enough." The entire point of strategy and tactics is that a game should do more or less what you tell it, with a little room for surprises. If something goes wrong, it should be because I took a chance and it didn't pay off, and hopefully I'll have enough options to compensate for that. It shouldn't be because the system is so unreliable that I have no idea whether my tactics will work or not. It desperately needs refinement, is what I'm saying.\n\nStill, the generations system is awesome, and makes the game worth playing, and for all its frustrations, the combat system has its moments.","January 15, 2015","true","12.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It could be seen as a fantasy X-Com, however it brings many different tweaks and features to the table. This is something I've supported since Kickstarter and I have not at all been disappointed. The developers have been amazing. I know many have become leery of Double Fine because of Spacebase DF9 but do NOT let that dissuade you from enjoying this exceptional game. Now obviously the game is not finished yet. It still needs it's final polish and is missing hybrid classes at this point. As of now there are only the 3 main classes in the game the Hunter, Alchemist, and Caberjack (my personal favorite). However, during production there was talk of an additional fourth class if the game sells well. The art style takes a little while to get used to but I enjoy it. Gameplay may seem a little unbalanced right now but as everyone knows this is still early access. What distinguishes this game from X-Com is the idea that it takes place over 300 years. Because of this you will not be able to play the entire game with one or even two squads. Your heroes will die one way or another, it's up to you to choose whether this death is in old age or if it is a glorious one on the battlefield. If your heroes are experienced enough when they die they will leave behind a wonderous relic for their family to use. The way you get more heroes is by establishing Game of Thrones style family keeps in regions, and these keeps produce more heroes from your chosen bloodlines to protect the lands. So if any of this sounds appealing to you I would definitely recommend this game. Especially because Double Fine has involved the testing community to the extreme and will gladly incorporate your input if you leave it on their forum.","November 11, 2014","true","19.9"," 24 of 53 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","24","53","0","0"

And that's because I want to emphasize that the game is still fun, just VERY VERY frustrating.The game is very fun and could be very addictive... once they fix the issue of difficulty and others. Think of the game like Xcom if it met with Game of Thrones, with the idea of making families out of heroes that will produce offsprings. On paper this is fantastic and for the most part the execution is more than decent enough when you consider the budget. The mechanics of choosing X or Y is not as punshing as XCom where the latter makes you feel like you just ruined the lives of millions  if you choose one continent over the other. Some complaints I have right now that will make me stop playing the game for now in hopes they'll be addressed:\n\n1. Right now how far you get in the game is EXTREMELY dependent on how lucky you are with your initial role of heroes, ages, and classes. For example I just rolled a game where I had like 4 melees and 1 archer. I then made the highest ranked melee into the regent and gave her a partner to produce babies. By the time I built my second keep to get a new regent, I only had one Archer at a decent level, and once I put that one as a regent to give me high level archers I was basically F'ed because I had no other archers for battles, so now I need to fight battles with nothing but melee and alchemists. Which is extremely hard once you hit level 40.\n\nSo the issue at hand is that the regent/lineage system needs rework. Having to wait 15 years minimum for your next generation of a specific class is horrible. You don't get enough heroes.\n\n2. Heroes don't level up unless you bring them with you to battles and use them to kill enemies. It's fine by itself if you were given higher level heroes, but you tend to be given low level heroes.\n\n3. Bulwarks or w/e they're called are broken. So is whatever system that decides how many enemies you gotta fight at a time. I'm in year 40 and I got a map with bulkwarks in groups of 2 and I had to fight like 10 with nothing but melees and one archer. This was a pain, but then like three more appeared. If you're gonna have these guys gain a shield after an attack at least don't make it where damage goes down to 1. Or lower their base damage, because 5-7 per hit is ridiculous.","December 16, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I've tried two playthroughs by now.  The first went haywire so I restarted, the second I made it to Year 300 (end game). I think there's a bit of a learning curve still :)\n\nAnyway, I really, really like the game. It reminds me of a hybrid between XCOM (new one) and The Last Federation. The XCOM part is somewhat simpler in regard to the combat, yet it has its own flavor and you have some pretty clever things you can pull off with the different classes, equipment and skills. As to the Kingdom/Base Management it's two widely different beasts. Where XCOM had a lot of smaller research paths and many types of equipment there are fewer in Massice Chalice, so every choice counts - and smacks - like a b*tch.\n\nIf I had to pick one great feature of the Kingdom Management it's the breeding for various traits in the regents' children. It makes a heck of a difference. If you marry two regents with bad traits your resulting heroes will be so pathethic it's painful.\n\nRight now it's not just playable but also enjoyable. I don't know for sure if there's just a lot more learning to do for me or if there are genuine imbalances in the game. I miss the feeling of late game XCON where you're very powerful and just kill scores of enemies. Actually, the second game I'm not sure I'll actually be able to complete, and I got this nagging feeling that maybe, just maybe, I shouldn't have paired that decent regent with that too young, unknown spouse.\n\nPerhaps with the right bloodline with the right traits and personality ...","December 19, 2014","true","155.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

A lot of people are jittery about DF having another early access game, but the situation has been made perfectly clear: MASSIVE CHALICE is COMPLETELY FUNDED for the next six months, which is the perfect amount of time to tweak this game to perfection. You may notice a few rough edges and for some people an intimidating learning curve, but the mechanics of this game are solid and have a surprising amount of depth. Like many tactical games, you might build yourself into a corner or find yourself on the wrong end of RNG, but when this game is humming, it's an amazing experience. I can't wait for DF to put the finishing touches on this game and I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nOther Misc Facts:\n-3 base classes currently, hybrid classes planned for future update (which ups the number of options significantly)\n-Get your highest level characters to be regents: XP is passed on to children of the house. The higher the XP, the higher level your trainee heroes become.\n-Relics spawn occaisionally when a hero dies. Usually happens when a hero kills a lot of cadence throughout their life. Get these early and keep them in the hands of the fighting members of the family. They level up and turn wimpy heroes into super men/women.\n-Be smart about movement and sight. Scout ahead with Hunters (using their sneaking ability). Sometimes your sight range is greater than theirs and often it is greater than their movement/attack range. Find the enemy first and utilize crowd control abilities to slow down the enemy (Flarrow blinds enemies for a turn, Knockback can shove enemies into other enemies and can stun each one affected, Prime Target can draw strong opponents away from weak or stranded heroes)\n\nHave Fun guys!","November 12, 2014","true","21.2"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

"Well that's fine, nothing wrong with that, I'm just happy it made it."\nI purchased the game for the $20 price tag on steam, and loaded it up. I started my new game and... was immediately filled with regret, and it was for one simple reason.\n\nNo customization.\n\nWhy, I thought? Was it perhaps just something I had to unlock in game? I decided to google and find out. And the first 3 responses to my search made my interest in the game sink from heavily interested to almost absolutely nothing.\n\n"There was a kickstarter tier that allowed you to create your own house and that's the reason you can't make your own." Is basically what it boils down to... and from what I have read, there was at one point an interest in including a Create-a-House function in the game post-release, which is fine IMO, but then I read in a more recent post that the idea was scrapped because it wouldn't be fair to backers.\n\nNow I have shut the game down and lack enough interest to even bother trying the tutorial. I'm glad I didn't have to wait 2 hours to find this out either, so now I can get my money back. This may seem harsh and all, but I wanted to post this up somewhere and hopefully let someone in the know might be able to bring it up to whom it may concern:' "You lost a sale because I am not allowed to have my own family."\n\nI'll even be fair and say: If I could even just make one single custom family for myself to represent my own line, I don't mind if my other 4 families are pre-designed by the backers. But the fact I just plain cannot have my own input in the lore of the game or have some semblance of interaction beyond just being "the player" ... To be blunt: If you don't care about me, why should I care about you?","August 20, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

This is a game that wants you to take a second and come up with your own storyline, and if you care about the heroes in your kingdom you'll have a lot more fun than speed running, min-maxing, and generally just treating it like an old SNES game that needs to be beaten than an interactive and deep story/narrative driven epic like it is.\n\nEdit: After playing some more, I wanted to make some remarks about the other reviews here. A lot of people complain that the game doesn't really have much in the ways of a tutorial. This creates a really good environment though. In the game, you're new to everything. You're learning what is going just like everyone else, so not knowing the exact stats of a Bulwark but instead getting a narrative description of what it does is actually really satisfying and flavorful.\nAnother point, I've come to really enjoy the breeding. Some people say it isn't predictable, but I can clearly tell which bloodlines are carrying what traits. Yes, some of them will show up more randomly, especially if you have regents with personalities that cause personalities to not be followed, like rebel, but that's honestly how life works. If you have 5 kids, they'll have core beliefs and fringe beliefs and both will make up who they are.\nFor me, a very solid 8/10. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews or why so many people are agreeing with them. I feel like it has to do with how quickly people want to burn through a game on Steam, but this is really a good Double Fine production and it shows with good narrative storytelling and character development.","December 15, 2014","true","22.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It's X-Com style combat with the generational traits that Rogue Legacy has. There's a pretty strong emphasis on breeding your bloodlines well to concentrate good traits and training ability as early heroes tend to be pretty mediocre (if not flat out bad). Surprisingly fun. The main thing is that it's hard to grow attached to individual characters as they get rotated out pretty quickly; however the bloodlines seem to often breed a couple of traits 'true' for many generations, giving them a bit of a personality of their own.\n\nCombat is fairly simple, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing; I found that I didn't really want to spend hours on a tactical map at a time, since so much of the activity happens strategically. The tactical combat is just enough to be interesting without being too time-consuming, maintaining a quicker pace than e.g. Medieval.","November 12, 2014","true","27.6"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

I've become aware of a small scandal brewing about this developer's past games, but this review is written with ONLY THIS PARTICULAR GAME in mind. I have no idea what happened with the developer's previous games, and thus that is not the concern of this review.\n\nIn the time I've spent with this, I've really enjoyed it. It has all the features it claims to in about the way you'd expect them, so if the description looks interesting, you'll probably enjoy it. The game has a fairly simple core mechanic: survive until x year. However, the facets that go into maximizing your chances for survival are many and are quite novel. I really enjoy pairing my strongest fighters and securing even stronger future generations.\n\nThe music in the game is lovely, and the voice acting is far better than I had anticipated (actually I hadn't anticipated ANY, but the voice acting is really very good). The visual style is a little... art over realism, as it were. But it serves the game well enough that I, as a huge fan of realistic graphics, found myself not caring at all that I wasn't looking at lush forests and TressFX hair.

It can be challenging as you have to plan ahead to have a balance of classes and also take care of the special buildings that give bonus to hero development and research of new 'technologies'.\n\nWhat should you do? Have your best hero available to do battle or marry him with a fertile hero of another family so his offspring have a better chance of being as good (or better!) than himself? Should you appoint your most experienced hero as the standard to be followed by young heroes and risk having only inexperienced youngsters to fight the next invasion? Will they be able to survive without more powerful items and armor? Who will research it?\n\nCombat itself is not that original or satisfying at this point, mostly because of balance issues. There are some enemies, especially later in the game, able to single handedly criple or even destroy an average party. Also, there are only 3 classes available. This greatly limits the number of tactics you can use to overcome the battles, and can lead to some repetition during the 300 year timespan of the game.\n\nOf course, this is an unfinished product, so we can hope for the combat to get a little better and the planning phase to get more polishment and shine even more.\n\nThat said, if you like original and challenging games, Massive Chalice's world is surely a good palce for you to play only one more turn.","November 11, 2014","true","13.5"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"

It's so much like X-Com that it even has the same UI and controls, the same panic level and pick between two battles features, the crap RNG and touchy map movement. All that said, X-Com is an awesome, addicting game, so, I mean, eh, this can't possibly be that bad. I'd wait until it goes live but if you like X-Com and want more of that, this gives you X-Com with a low-fi fantasy skin.\n\nAt the moment, the classes and mobs do not feel well balanced, with at least one seemingly useless class and a number of monsters that are just no fun to fight, but this will hopefully change before a full release. The gameplay stretches on for years in game but feels more breakneck than X-Com which is supposed to take place over a few months. I didn't find it very enjoyable: I was simultaneously bored by the lack of battles and overwhelmed trying to get a handle on mechanics, stats, traits and personalities before my soldiers died.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/246110/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you took you standard turn-based strategy game like X-Com, added a little bit of the Sims and Pokemon breeding, and sprinkle on the sass and humor of Double Fine all over it, you get something close, yet at the same time nothing near what Massive Chalice is. A definite evolutionary experiment for the genre that can end up being revolutionary or a downright disaster. You might wanna take some notes, eugenics is involved.\n\n\nGameplay: 92/100 A-\n\nMassive Chalice plays like any other turn based strategy game at first, moving your units into positions which offer a greater tactical advantage, setting up a trap, or pulling off a successful raid. While the combat mechanics are all familiar, moving, using skills, on and on, that is about as similar Massive Chalice is to other games of the like, specifically X-Com: Enemy Unknown, since it's one of the more recent successes of the genre. The rest of the gameplay isn't even on the battlefield, but in your kingdoms, putting units together in partnerships from the multitudes of clans, breeding them to produce offspring who will pass down traits to help improve your army as time goes by, some will die of old age, others in battle, some at random, some not so random - the list just goes on and on and you have to decide which way you want things to go, all the while fending off this nebulous invading force. Essentially, Massive Chalice takes away the random chance with the units and puts it in the players trusting hands, making everyone your responsibility. Good luck!\n\n\nAudio: 90/100 A-\n\nBeing an Early Access game, things are bound to change, and the music isn't exempt from this. That said, the music that is currently in the game is well made and fits the atmosphere of the game and environments. This goes for the sound effects as well, since some sound like placeholders for better samples, others feel well polished and ready to go into your ears. The voice acting is done fairly well, too. The two main voices coming from the Massive Chalice itself, features a male being and a female being, both two different personalities that bicker and support you all at once or at each other. At times they are hilarious, while other times they can be a bit of a downer as you're trying to turn the tide of the war and one pipes up and says "Their numbers are endless and instantly replaced, we must grow into maturity..." or something like that.\n\n\nVisuals: 95/100 A\n\nThis is something that has caused some discussion within the community, both positive and negative, while Double Fine has never been known for its realism, especially visually, some complaints have been that the visuals are too simplified, but this is my review, not theirs, and I respectfully disagree. Now, I will agree that the graphics are simple, harkening back to the early PC days of Another World or Alone in the Dark, and more recently Minecraft, I don't think that they are too simple for the genre, you have to remember that graphics are part wow-factor and part world building, and if one fails in its mission, then the graphics mean nothing in the end. With that in mind, the style of the characters, the landscapes, the flow of water, the weapons used, they all fit into this world. It's not perfect, again - early access game still, but it has a firm style of what it wants to look like and sway this way or that.\n\n\nContent: 97/100 A+\n\nI touched on some of the things you need to juggle in Massive Chalice outside of combat alone. I found myself spending a fair amount of time deciding which members of my team should be taken out so that they can go and get freaky with one another to make me more soldiers. And then you have to build castles and other structures if you want to advance certain technologies or unlock other classes of fighters, fixing disputes with your citizens, and then deciding which battle to engage in when that time comes. Oh - and did I mention the whole game is essentially on a giant time limit? Yeah, the clock, another thing to fight. You will be spending a lot of time tweaking and tinkering with everything in this game and you won't have much choice because as time goes by, your current fighters get older and will die. Lots of people will die. You won't have that one badass from day one who kills everything, but you may be able to pass down trinkets and whatnots that hold special abilities and stats that can be passed down from generation unto generation.\n\n\nStory: 86/100 B+\n\nThere is a story, believe it or not, but as I played, it felt like it took a backseat to the gameplay. It's still there, but it wasn't interweaved into the gameplay as other games, it gets mentioned here and there, but the fights seems a bit disconnected to the rest of the situations happening. But maybe this is something that'll get hammered out at a later time as the core gameplay is worked out and balanced, which isn't a bad strategy at all. What story there is, is constructed decently, so it's hard to make a judgement on something that isn't finalized.\n\n\nDesign: 88/100 B+\n\nFrom a purely mechanical standpoint, Massive Chalice is a massive undertaking that works for the most part. The ideas are there, they're original for the genre, and they add many layers of replayability to the game outside of a dice roll. The battlefields are laid out in creative ways, offering plenty of opportunity to form a strategy. The variety is also a welcome sight, from the characters, to the enemies, and the landscape itself, which you can use to your advantage as well, not just by hiding behind, but offensively.\n\n\nPerformance: 86/100 B+\n\nI had to play this at a lower to mid-range settings on my current computer where the game ran the smoothest and looked the best. While there are a fair amount of options to tinker with, the game seems to run at a slightly slower pace, especially in battle, but I have to reiterate this - Early Access. There's still a bunch of work to be done at almost every angle, optimizing code and programming and who knows what else. There is some clipping here and there, but nothing as notorious as the "I can't shoot through walls, but lemme take a shot through a building" glitch from X-Com: Enemy Unknown. Failed psychic school my ♥♥♥.\n\n\nVerdict: 90/100 A-\n\nMassive Chalice is a massive risk, but with all that risk comes potential. It's nice to see a company actually attempt something with this much ambition and still try to make it the best they can. There are issues, of course, but these are more growing pains than pure stupidity. Do I recommend? Yes.","March 10, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/recommended/246110/","Melovinci","Icarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melovinci/","483 products in account","I was prepared for the same disappointment with Massive Chalice as I was with Spacebase DF-9. Long story short, people paid money and the Double Fine gave up on making the game, leaving everyone with a game that essentially never left alpha. But funnily enough, that wasn’t the case. Massive Chalice is essentially XCOM cross the map from the Game of Thrones introduction.\n\nThe enemies are varied and you can use their corpses ro craft new weapons, items and armor. Someone dies and there’s no getting back up again. Every mission is very simple: Kill all the Cadence monsters. With no variance, the game can be a little repetitive at times. But I don’t enjoy this game for the combat.\n\nAlmost unheard of, but one of the best parts about this game is the micro-managing between battles. And here’s where the Game of Thrones comes into it. You have several families/clans under your control which you place into keeps around your kingdom. Each clan has a dominant class and by intermingling different clans, you can produce hybrid classes and place emphasis on certain traits. You are an immortal dictator with complete oversight of your kingdom, the oversight and totalitarian control needed to save the realm.\n\nI have picked up some issues. The classes are really, really unintuitive. An alchemist has a giant claw and throws flasks, a hunter has a crossbow and a caber just bashes the ♥♥♥♥ out enemies with a caber (log of wood used in the Scottish sport Caber Tossing). The hybrid classes are even more confusing with names like Blastcapper, Enforcer and Boomstriker (lucky guess as to what hybrids they are).\n\nAsides from this, still a good game. It has a simple eloquence to it which Double Fine have always had a knack for. Even though your heroes die of old age, the next generation start at a higher level, meaning that you feel like you’re progressing despite losing your best warriors to the ravages of time. Double-Fine have made some game design choices which are great. Knowing about the game before I started, I expected heaps of flaws. But somehow Double-Fine have managed to find ways around it.\n\nFor full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/08/23/massive-chalice/","January 4","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to make your attention on your population which directly affects the heros you can choose in a single battle, also the age of your heros does have the same effects.\n这确实像幽浮、兄弟战团或者其他的什么回合制策略类游戏，不过这里有些不一样的地方，你不是选择你的战士，而是选择你的血统。你需要时刻注意你的人口信息，它直接影响到你每场能选择的英雄数目，当然，还有年龄。\n\nThere are actually 12 types of units rather than the simple 3. And each type is unique. In the right usage of your abilities that you can make it easy to defeat your enemies. i.e. Due to the lack management of population I use only to Shadowjacker to fight a battle, but I won(In a stealth->recon->stun->attack process). So there is a lot much fun.\n这里不单单是3种单位，实际是12种单位。每一个单位都是很特别的。使用正确就能轻易击败你的敌人。举个栗子，由于我对人口管理的疏漏，我有一场战斗只有2个潜影破坏者，但是，我通过潜行-〉侦查-〉击晕-〉攻击的流程赢了那局。所以我玩这游戏不会少乐子\n\nAnd there are different types of monsters.

Massive Chalice is an excellent blend of long term strategy and turn based tactics.\nto give you a comparison, it plays very much like a low fantasy version of XCOM Enemy Unknown. You take on the role of the faceless (and mute) commander, You place your buildings into your lands. The enemy attacks several provinces at once and you can only defenc one of them.\nBut unlike XCOM, your heros have a limited lifespan and will eventually die of age if the enemy doesn't get them first.\nto save some of their valuable traits you can marry your heros off in order to breed the next generation of cannon fodder. This adds a whole new dimension to strategy and it is something I wish more games could implement.\n\noverall I would give it about a 4/5\nthe only downsides are the blocky looking art style which I don't like but seems popular these days. and the fact that it seems like it will have limited replayability, there are only so many ways to do things so I feel that aside from achivement hunting it won't get to many repeats from me.","January 25","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem is, even though the game's finished it looks unfinished. The zen graphic they adopted make everything look bland and forgettable, not to mention the combat locations, after the first combat you neither distinguish, nor you care where you are fighting.

I've seen several games that went through Early Access and were later abandoned by the developer, so it's nice to see an example that turned out to be a polished and fun game.\n\nYou'll see a lot of people commenting about how the play style is similar to Xcom, and they're right.  I do like Xcom, but I actually like Massive Chalice better than Xcom because of the way heros can be married together to form families and offspring, and eventually new heroes.  The traits and stats of the parents influence the traits, stats, and initial experience level of the next generation of heroes.  With some clever planning over which hero I marry to another, I can have a batch of fresh new recruits leveled up and waiting to replace the aging (or dead) ones.  Contrast that with Xcom, where you lose one of your soldiers and they're just gone.\n\nI feel like Massive Chalice's building placement mechanic improved on the 'base building' mechanic seen in Xcom.  I don't have to worry about excavating some area, and providing power or anything silly like that.  Instead they added bonuses based on what building you place and where.  They simplified the building concept while also improving on it.  I also like the random events that come up and require a decision to be made.  The decisions made for those events have lasting effects on how the game progresses, and add flavor to the story.\n\nI hope the developers consider making a Massive Chalice 2.","January 9","true","60.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved it. I was super into x-com, so I saw this on sale and gave it a shot.\n\nIt's not quite as fleshed out as x-com, the game feels a bit bare-bones, but the there are a lot of really interesting mehcanics that aren't immediately obvious. For example, there are only 3 classes, but by marring together heros from 2 different classes, you can create mixes. The regent determines the weapon and armor, and their partner determines they're sub-class, so there are actually 9 different classes. Also, the hero-breeding is really deep, heros have actual genes. So some genese aren't expressed, but can still show if you marry them with somebody else that also has the dormant gene.\n\nThe music is super catchy, that's always a huge plus. The combat is similar to x-com, in that it heavily rewards taking it slow, and picking off straglers until there's nobody left.\n\nI DEFINETLY recommend playing on Ironman mode, even if you have to lower the difficulty. X-com is way more fun when played like a roguelike, and this game is too.\n\nI played on ironman normal mode, and I found it to be slightly too easy, but pretty close to perfect.

Good explainations available on the wiki.\n\nRandom events are far to frequent, catastrophically good or bad, and with almost no guidance as which choices are more or less risky (because almost all answers still have an equal chance of good an bad out comes).\n\nWorth full price at $20, but definitely worth trying at 30-50% off if you're only a little intrigued.","April 10","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like the genre then I absolutely recommend you give this a shot!\n\n-----\n\n+Interesting macro management.\n+Varied enemies that encourage the use of different tactics to defeat.\n+Pleasant art style and animations.\n+Nice sound direction, both in music and sound effects.\n+Lots of quirky humour.\n+Plays well with a controller.\n\n+/- Macro Management can be a bit chaotic and unclear what's actually happening under the hood.\n\n-Only three weapon styles. (Though abiities can vary and they each compliment each other well.)\n-After the initial learning curve, maybe a tad on the easier side. (If so, crank up the difficulty!)\n-Potential for end game tedium through the final quarter of a campaign. (Though personally it kept me quite engaged.)\n\n-----\n\nI wasn't expecting to enjoy MASSIVE CHALICE as much as I have done thus far. I suppose it is similar in a lot of ways to the recent X-COM games in that the game requires you to succeed at both managing a base and also managing the strategic battles, and like X-COM if you fail at either element too badly you stand a good chance of losing the game.\n\nThe "Base" component of MASSIVE CHALICE places you as the immortal leader of a small kingdom that spans several hundred years over the course of the game. You're expected to manage the continual repopulation of your roster of heroes as they die to old age through a Game Of Thrones-ey family system where you build keeps and assign lords and ladies to have lots of heroic children. These children may inherit some of the personality quirks or physical traits of their parents as well as experience points or even family heirloom weapons. This ensures that over the course of the game you can maintain a sense of growth in your hero roster as the game progresses through the family ties.\n\nYou can also spend time researching new weapons, armours and items for use in the field and the game occasionally throws up points of contention amongst the populace for you to make decisions on which will have either positive or negative effects, similar to what you may have seen in The Banner Saga.\n\nThe battles themselves present you with a variety of legitimate threats that I'd rather not spoil for you that escalate as time progresses. Enemies are interesting in that the threats they pose are often not necessarily tied in to their raw power in terms of health pools and damage they can deal. Encountering them in unexpected combinations can make for some interesting tactical puzzles and this is doubly true with the nature of your ever changing roster of heroes. You may not have a full set of tools available for you to tackle these problems with depending on how the baby-making situation goes.\n\nI've got a fair amount of experience with games in this genre and for me this game was refreshingly different and thoroughly enjoyable.\n","October 31, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was pretty laggy which made the game seem more frustrating on top of early access.  I was bored recently and revisted it on my PC.  When it runs smoothly, this still isn't the best game ever or anything, but the tedious parts are reduced and I feel now like I could recommend it.  There is also a bit more strategy than what I mentioned below which was based on early access.\n\nThere's some cool ideas in this game but the level of strategy is really wanting.  XCom analogies are appropriate: there's no cover, half the enemies explode, you start the game with ghost armor and five grenades.  Managing the range of the exploding enemies and map items is most of the game's combat phase.  There's no mechanic that encourages you to rush (like meld in XCom EW) so keeping a balanced team and taking each stage really slowly guarantees you the win.  The unforgiving explodiness and lack of cover dynamics means that if you do rush, you're guaranteed to feel the pain.  The strategic phase is original and fairly fun, but as an XCom veteran who beat impossible difficulty I find the battles too gruellingly boring to keep playing.","March 17, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You just found it.\n\nA brilliant and storyline filled with witty jokes and sassy sense of humour which sets you against the "Cadence", an demon/plague like species which soles purpose is to decimate your people and corrupt your lands.\n\nSeeking a way to defeat the Cadence, you, the master ruler of the lands, seek out  the power of the Massive Chalice, hoping to find a way of cleansing the Cadence. The Chalice is played by to charming voices, an pervy and sassy man and an wise and witty woman, whose purpose is to play the role of advisors trough the game.\n\nThe game starts with you waking up in front of the Chalice. The voices are telling you that you manage to achieve what you wanted: An way to purge the Cadence. The punch line? This purging will take 300 years to gather the energy and research necessary to be completed and mastered.\n\nBut fear no more! Thanks to the powers of the Chalice you achieved immortality and the power of the "Eye of Thundera" (you basically have an extended vision of the role Kingdom, anywhere you want)! All you had to do was sacrifice your body, becoming entangled to the Chalice. (Y).\n\nThroughout the 300 year timeline, you must build upon your territory different alternative building's and research new and better gear; You must forge an strong bloodline of ferocious fighters to defend against the Cadence to ensure the Chalice is not damaged. For that, you will control the marriage of your warriors, being them infants or nor, transforming this game in an interesting but twisted and  kinda sick,  "Game of Thrones" thing.\n\nLike Pokemon, you will have  3 starters classes: x2 ranged and one melee. Your fighters are sub-classes which are desginated by lineage, thus being necessary the wisdom of Game of Thores again.\n\nWhat's unique about the level system is you are not investing your time into a certain character but in a lineage/family. You marry your lineage off to another and make babies. These babies have good or bad traits which are then passed down from generation to generation. This traits may be good for combat or bad, like good eyesight, giving you better visibilty of the terrain or alcoholism, meaning your warrior will move less tiles and atack less because will be with hangover. Your lineage determines your fighter class as well. For instance, if you marry off one Caberjack to a Hunter you will be making a Shadowjack.\n\nYou will be controlling the family clans  that you send out to defend from atacks in a turned paced duel. Each class will have an amount of tiles that can walk or atack and so does the enemy. With more battles, more experience your warrior get. Experience which that can be later used in a very intriguing skill tree.\n\nWith the passing of time and accumulated experiences, your warriors may create legacy gears which, with the eventual death of such warrior, will be passed through his linage, generation after generation, getting stronger and stronger.\n\nTime itself is sped up until an event occurs (research ending, babies being born, old members of the lineage dying, cadence presence,...). With the advent of time, the atacks of Cadence will become more often and in greater number. They start atacking one land in the early game and then, late in the game, three or more, making you have to choose wich terrain you will be sacrificing, since you can only defend one at a time.\n\nFor the amount of time you must spent calculating the odds of your strategies to work, for the huge amount of laughs this game will give you and for the connection you will be forging with the families you create (or not, You can be an insensitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that will be sending young ones to death just to buy time for the true meaning of the game...(No worries, I ain't judging ya)) all I have to say is: Buy this game, it sure is worth playing it.\n\nBut be warned, the game may become repetitive, but, since it's cheap, who cares?","May 29","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Technically a little goofy, fantasy version of X-com. But here is the thing; it lacks the thing that no games of this type should ever, ever lack.\n\nCustomisation.\nLet me bring up a personal example; I wanted to play a "serious" game, like the end if the world is actuall coming -the game has a literal checkbox for that, wich is pretty neat.\n\nSo I have spent quite some time to choose noble families which had battlecries I liked, had flags i liked, and names I liked. It took a while, since I am not allowed to choose their banners, or give their names on my own, but choose from a long list of pre-determined combinations.\n\nSo I finally got my noble houses, and heroes, and started to play. After a while I even had characters I've remembered and liked; Milea Fenris the hunter, and Jake T'elos the caberjack.\nWhen heroes get a certain level, their weapons become relics, that are stronger than the average weapon, and can be passed down in the family to other warriors. The heroes themselves also become famous enough that they get nicknames (sounds familliar?),\nHOWEVER! The game chooses them automatically, you have no say in the matter. This is how my favourite archer, hero of the saltlands, became Milea "Whats-her-face" Fenris, and my most stalwart frontline warrior Jake "Mr.Pancakes" T'elos.\n\nThis was the point where it bacame an issue that you cannot choose the look of your heroes, name them, choose their nickname, customise their attire.\n\nWhich is really sad because the game is charming, otherwise atmospheric, and interesting. But this really kills it's replayabilty. I hope massive chalice 2 will deliver better.","April 25","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charybdian/recommended/246110/","charybdian","Charybdian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charybdian/","409 products in account","Double Fine's inventive take on turn-based strategy with rogulike elements is reminiscent of X-COM with a twist in the form of lineage. Players alternate between managing their empire on a broad scale and taking part in tactical battles against a horde of enemies known as the Cadence. Between these skirmishes, players assign researchers to develop new technologies and regents to manage outposts. These regents have families, and depending on the traits of the regent and their spouse, their offspring will exhibit shared traits.\n\nWhich is excellent in theory. Each regent will train their offspring in one of three different main classes: Blastcapper, Alchemist, and Hunter. The Blastcapper carries around a wildly practical battering ram, which to their credit can actually do some damage and is useful for breaching doors that don't exist anywhere in the game. Unfortunately, these heroes cease to be useful or practical heroes almost immediately.\n\nIn one of the first matches against our eternal foe, the game introduces a new enemy that will run up and gleefully explode next to any of your heroes. Not only that, it leaves behind a toxic residue that saps health and armor at the start of every turn. In every subsequent match except one, this enemy appeared. This wouldn't be a problem if all of my heroes weren't nearsighted inbreds that can barely function on the battlefield. More than half of the enemies I encountered were these blitzing bombers, so doing the sensical thing and trying to lead with the strong melee class was useless since they kept getting hit by explosives.\n\nThe second class, the suicide bomber, has an acceptable melee attack but their claim to fame are the explosive flasks they lob at the enemy. Yes, those 5 flasks your bold hero starts off with will serve them well on their journey: two flasks to roast their teammates, two to fling blindly off cliffs or so far away from the enemy as to be useless, and one to hit a single enemy yet fail to kill it. Even if the teamkilling allstar is sitting directly on top of the enemy, they may only have a 70% chance to hit, and chances are they'll just fail and do their lineage a service through self-immolation. Even if they could hit anything, their maximum range is atrocious and as mentioned before, the kingdom is inhabited by a very proud yet blind people so enemies will pop out of the mist and blindside you regularly.\n\nLast but certainly not least, the Hunter. A ranged fighter equipped with a giant crossbow, the only useful class has unlimited ammunition, the largest range, and can use stealth to scout and reveal enemies before striking. The only downside to this class is that the tutorial doesn't expressly mention that once you assign a regent that blind idiot family will never stop popping out melee brawlers and only melee brawlers.\n\nThe other classes appear to have interesting skills further down the line, but your heros are far too frail and inept when faced with the supercharged enemy roster. Aside from the basic enemy minion, each foe has far more unique skills to help them survive than your elite warriors. The first ranged enemy not only deals damage from long range but sucks experience points from your heroes. Those delightful exploding fiends deal heavy damage in an area, and if a hero happens to stand in the residual gunk they suffer huge penalties. There is also a ranged enemy with piercing attacks that can toughen their hide to drastically reduce damage. It feels as though all the really neat abilities are reserved for your enemies, and I couldn't help but start rooting for them after a few matches.\n\nIf the thought of watching generations of people grow and produce unique heroes is appealing, Massive Chalice will deliver. The tactical combat feels shallow and frustrating at times, though after slugging through several relentless bouts with inept heroes, who knows; one of them just might hit something.","June 4","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
