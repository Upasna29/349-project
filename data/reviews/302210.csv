Graphics are a little rough and the controls suck... but the atmosphere is great, and that is what counts with these types of games.\n\nRegarding compatability issues, Im on windows 7 with and AMD card and a i5 processor and had no issues what so ever, other than an arm stretching glitch in one room, which was just silly to me.

I had this on back on the Xbox original consol, it sold as a budget title. So $5 is no bad deal for a trip down memory lane for me. This game is a Resident Evil 1, 2,3  knock off. It does have issues, but most of this is due to the age of the game. The story is solid. The character moves when you need him to. The clues are all laid out. The Settings are fun. I am especially fond of the museum. The grafics are dated and so is the gameplay. The movement especially , no matter what way you are facing you must press up in order for your character to move.\nAll and all I do recomend the game it is one of those older games that got missed back in the day. If you have an afternoon free and you are waiting for the next big release game, try it is only about $5. If you do not want to pay that I am sure this game will go sale on the big Steam Sales possibly for $1 or less. And it is anly about 600MB. not much room at all, barly took me 3 min. to download. So I say give it a try.","October 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Ugh!  Long story short, this is a fun survival horror game that was unfairly maligned when released.  Solid game play with an adventure feel like mixing Resident Evil 1-3, the Silent Hill series, Eternal Darkness and the Indiana Jones movies.  Definitely give it a check.\n\nPros:\n\n-Old school survival horror gameplay\n-Decent graphics with fun monsters to fight, excellent locations to explore and entertaining bosses\n-Excellent, creepy sound design\n-Engaging story with 2 characters to switch between\n-Travelling inventory save/storage character is well-implemented\n-Satisfying campaign length (took me about 10 hours, some of my gameplay time was spent paused)\n-Solid selection of weapons\n-Cool mix between puzzles, exploration and combat\n\nCons:\n\n-Clunky controls and unable to remap movement keys (you get used to it)\n-Story conclusion is somewhat half baked\n-Character models could use some work\n-2 different characters but no different abilities\n-More melee weapons would be fun\n-Body part targeting mechanic is under-utilized (necessary in boss fights but really nowhere else)\n\nRating:  7.8/10\n\nFans of overlooked, underrated horror games like Cold Fear, Cursed Mountain, etc., should have a blast with this!","November 27, 2015","true","15.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","12","14","3","2"

(compared to most horror titles now, the enemies seem a bit goofy and unthreatening, but the soundeffects they make are enough to still get your heartrate up, especially when you hear them coming but dont know where from)\n\nOverall enjoyment: 8/10\nEspecially when you get it for a buck like I did.\n(recommed Hard Difficulty on first playthrough)","April 11, 2015","true","2.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Only minor problems with the game, controls seem a little clunky at first but they don't take much to adapt to. It's been awhile since a game truly gave me the feel of suspense without resorting to jump scares, gore or even music. the ambiencde is subtle but effective.I'm not even a horror gamer, the only game that I'd play is the Last of Us and that was probably the worst i went, as creepy as some others may be they don't achieve what these 2 games do.","December 4, 2014","true","4.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/302210/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","Curse: The Eye of Isis is an action adventure on the likes of early Resident Evil games where you play the role of two different characters on a mission to remove a curse from your family as a result of displacing the Isis statue. While the overall story is reasonable, I got really frustrated with the game on so many levels.\n\nThe keyboard controls were so awful I ended up using a controller, but those controls were only slightly less awful. The biggest pain was the ever changing camera angles which seemed to be almost purposely meant to frustrate movement on a level I have never experienced. The combat was absolute trash, especially the boss fights. When a billy club can dish out more damage than a mortar cannon, you know there's some serious issues. There's an endless supply of respawning minions that further make combat more mundane than entertaining. Finding the next objective is near impossible. There are no way points and there is no objective list to aid your quest. You do have a fat dude sidekick that always spawns after whatever obstacle you were trying to overcome, but he can't help you get past the obstacle. The inventory system was a mess to the point of not having slots available to pick up key quest items and no way to actually drop items other than giving them to said fat man or your alternate character.\n\nI honestly can't believe I finished this game because there were so many moments where I just wanted to rage uninstall. If you're like me and enjoy enduring constant pain and misery, then this is a title worthy of playing. I'm going to go walk on some broken glass barefoot now.","June 4","false","12.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

The controls may be a little meh but you can change buttons to your own preferences. The game may be overlooked but it is a classic gem. The background noises in the game are eerie and bone chilling. The only con i have about this game is the game doesn't like Steam overlay and the In-game status always crashes and it tells you you're not even playing the game even though you are but it's not that big of a deal. But I wished that they fixed that. Besides that, Curse: The Eye of Isis is an awesome survival horror game. I definitely recommend trying out this game.","December 23, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(When your avatar moves forward, use up, moves back , use down, moves left (from avatar view) hit left, and ofc. move right with the right arrow key, but all movement is from avatars perspective)\n\nThere is barely room to turn with your mouse.  I been hugging quite a lot  of walls.  when you move forward, and are almost at the end of the screen, the picture in the screen moves to the next scene.  No way to look around decently.   And when you look at your avatar while trying to move, you have to think in opposite direction (left = right and vv) very confusing!\n\nI am sure the controls take some time to get used to.  I doubt I will finish it, so far I found it too annoying to continue. Been hugging too many walls.\n\nSo recommended? For the atmosphere and story, YES, but for the ancient controls NO. Not to be played anymore anno 2015, unless its for old memories' sake.\n\nBecause it is now 2015 and gaming world changed a lot, I put it on not reccomended.  Time for a remake maybe?  In modern style, I will sure play it again.","January 23, 2015","false","3.2"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","15","33","0","4"
