It's probably best game made by Data East. Sorry Windjammers and Street Hoop. However Data East died in the early 2000s, so I was a bit surprised to see a new Magical Drop pop up in Steam. I bought it for five euros when it was released.\n\nWhat I expected: Magical Drop HD\nWhat I got: Magical Drop for Tablets\n\nFull of bugs and questionable design choices, this was a major letdown for me. Even though the game is sharper and higher resolution, the art and effects used look a lot worse than in the original arcade games. it really gives you the "cheap mobile game" feeling. The game also has characters from another game called ghostlop, which doesn't fit into the game at all. Could have spent that time making more MagiDrop characters as there are only eleven in the game while MD3 had over twenty.\n\nWorst part is that the Developer Golgoth Studio promised a patch that would fix the issues in the game. It was supposed to be released somewhere during 2013, but right now is 2015 and I'm still waiting for that patch. Well, not seriously waiting for it, but still. Same studio has also a Toki remake in the works. Or had. It was greenlit in 2013 and there has been no word about it after that, so it's probably vaporware now.\n\nIf you liked Magical Drop, don't buy this game. If you are just looking for a cheap puzzle game, then don't buy this game. It's not worth it and there are better alternatives available.","January 4, 2015","false","2.2"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","47","55","0","1"

People have wanted this for a while.\n\nCONS: On occasion, this game will request that I purchase the full version. I've only ever had the full version on my computer, never the demo. Why am I getting the demos notifications? Multiplayer has trouble working, game is full of spelling errors and crashes. Voices are unbelievably grating. Achievements are broken. The developer is a slimeball. Huge jumps in difficulty.\n\nOVERALL: The developer said they'd fix these issues, but has refused to comment on it since. They "apologized" to users who spent money on it by dropping the price to 1 USD. How does that make it any better for the people scammed out of their money? They have moved to a new developer name and are now taking yet another beloved franchise and giving the illusion of restoration most likely just to scam more people out of their money through their nostalgia. Tactics like this are despicable, this dev has so little interest in their products that their steam adverts are recycled from phone app pages with no editing. This behavior should not meet Steam's quality standards.\n\nSCORE: 1/10","March 9, 2015","false","5.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

Mainly because it has so much potential, however many key things about the game is broken or lacking.\n\nI've had several crashes, no native joystick/gamepad support, alt-tab during a game over causes issues on comming back. The AI on normal is absurdly easy then becomes absurdly difficult (may be on my part, however good old google fails to bring up much on strategies or information on the game other than old hype and reviews), buttons fail to respond when many things are going on concurrently.\n\nAside from all the complaning its' the basis of a really GREAT game, and that's really just a shame.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justchris/recommended/204960/","justchris","justchris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justchris/","109 products in account","I really want to recommend this game, because it is Magical Drop, and Magical Drop is one of the best puzzle games out there (1000x better than Bust a Move, which is so meh). And this is Magical Drop, but it's Magical Drop without Puzzle Mode, or the Quest Mode that was added in Magical Drop 3.\n\nAll it has available is Versus Mode, either in Story Mode or Online. Which is basically where you play Magical Drop against an npc or other player, to see who can get the most matches the fastest.\n\nPuzzle Mode was just an endless mode by yourself, to see how long you could keep going before the game beat you. It got progressively harder as you went along, and it was the most fun mode in the game.\n\nQuest mode added a small RPG element, or more board game element to the game, although not sure if that would work the same without requiring quarters like the arcade version did.\n\nANYWAY, for $.99 ($.89 on sale), the game is pretty fun, but without Puzzle Mode, it's just not complete. Until that is fixed, I can't really recommend it.\n\nOH ALSO, this game does not like to run in full screen mode on large monitors, so run it windowed.","June 21, 2014","false","2.4"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","0"

The graphics are decent, and the designs of the game are nice (though perhaps not the series' best).\nIt's worth the price on sale and is fun for as long as it's playable for you.\nThe game itself can be fun, but there is no difficulty curve. Just difficulty. Even on Normal. One minute the game will be challenging enough to be fun, and then suddenly you'll spend the next five rounds swearing that the AI is cheating and wondering if you really should have bought this game until you ultimately rage quit or win by pure luck. This especially happens with the special Ghostlop mode, which can be smooth sailing until its impossible-seeming final boss.\n\n"Auto-save" is also apparently broken, it seems. My personal control settings are never saved and I have to play the tutorial every time I start up the game again. For a while I thought this was just because my display name had special characters in it, but ever since changing my display name it still glitched.\n\nThe translation is unrefined though and at times incomprehensible. The game was obviously made for Magical Drop fans, but some of the dialogue exchanges probably aren't any more understandable with background knowledge.\n\nThankfully, the developers seem to be listening to fans and are still patching the game, so maybe it'll get better. But at the same time, the patch seems to be delayed and the gaem's been released just too long for its current problems to be excusable.\n\nI truly WANT to like this game. I do. But perhaps I would be better off seeking out the previous entries in the series rather than letting this one constantly disappoint me.\n\nEDIT:\nSince I bought this game, it has dropped down to $0.99\nFor that price, I suppose it's a good enough buy if you don't have a previous Magical Drop or don't have a similar game. That's a low enough price for it to just be a novelty, so if you're interested in it then $0.99 is a fine price for it.","July 16, 2013","false","8.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Oh, and if you only bought a copy for yourself and want to play online let me tell you that the lobbys are empty, I wonder why that could be? *sarcasm*\n\nLet's be fair: it still can be fun, but something like this should be an early access beta or something, not a full game. It's a shame cause Magical Drop III is awesome... So, if you like puzzle games or feel nostalgic, instead of waiting a patch that will be out after HL3, what about trying to get another game of the series?, I assure you it would be a better idea than buying this and I'm sure you'll enjoy a lot more","January 6, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I hope you enjoy hearing the same four voice lines repeated over and over again constantly during a match with absolutely no moment of silence, ever. I mean seriously it's insane the degree to which the developers have chosen the most obnoxious possible voice lines and made it so they repeat endlessly through the course of a normal match, it's amazingly stupid. I don't understand how anyone could ever think that the way the voice acting works in its current state is anything approaching acceptable, I have to put the voice acting on mute.\n\nThe game has serious problems with inputs where I never feel like I can move as fast as I want or need to because the game keeps dropping inputs, this kills the game completely. A fast paced puzzler where you the game is limiting how fast you can go is unacceptable. Quota is also an incredibly stupid game mechanic that's completely at odds with the notion of trying to set up big chains to win by filling your opponent's screen, so you have two victory conditions that are opposed to one another and it's stupid and it reflects a badly designed game. I get that it's supposed to prevent matches from lasting forever when you have two relatively even skilled players but this is not the way.\n\nMusic's okay, art's okay, sound effects are the worst thing I've ever heard in my life, gameplay's broken and also badly made.\n\nThis is a bad video game.

There is also another style of playing the game, as the game developers combined their alternate puzzle game and fused it into this game, so you could actually be playing two different game modes at the exact same time!  I can't exactly say in words how frantic this game is, but I think most people that picked this game up at the same time as me only played through it once and ended up never beating it because the game mechanics were too difficult.\n\nAt later stages of the game, the only way to beat your opponents are by chaining together increasingly large and complex combos, which would make this game incredibly frustrating for anyone who expected this to be a casual game.\n\nI would highly recommend anyone to try to find some videos of this game before buying it, because I think a lot of people won't have the patience to actually sit down and try to beat it, even if there are infinite continues (which is also a mechanic of unlocking some bosses/achievements - aka no death runs).

It's simple but fast-paced, and it's surprisingly deep. I didn't even know this game was coming out, so I was very excited to see it on Steam and picked it up immediately.\n\nMagical Drop V has been something I've wanted for a long time, but sadly, it's a huge step backward for the Magical Drop series. It's definitely worse than #3 in all aspects, and I'd even put it behind #2. The gameplay works sufficiently well, HD graphics are nice, and the music is mostly unchanged. Unfortunately, the controls are bizzare, the single-player mode is lacking, there are fewer characters, and the game must have been translated by a third-grader (insultingly bad at times).\n\nThe inclusion of a different puzzle game's mechanics is interesting. I couldn't figure it out, though.\n\nIf you're interersted in this, I'd highly recommend looking up Magical Drop 3 instead. It was a Neo-Geo game, but there have been a few ports. Magical Drop fans will be disappointed. It's still a decent action-puzzle game, but it's far short of its potential.","November 15, 2012","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Garfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhaf/","85 products in account","I like this game, but if you don't already have very fond memories of the Magical Drop series from Data East, then you'll probably be frustrated by this game. As others have mentioned, the lack of puzzle mode, or a practice mode is a bit disappointing. Also, the intergration of the "Bruce" character into the story mode is a bit strange since his mechanics are so different from the rest of the characters.\n\nHowever, the game's overwhelming difficulty is what really kills you. If you're like me (you love the series and played it a lot) then you can probably complete "easy" story mode with some work. I'm no slouch, but I can never get above a "B" rank. Normal story mode stops me 2/3'ds into it. No matter how fast I can work the Xbox controller's d-pad, I still can't seem to complete any of the main characters. The game's AI is out of whack, or the speed is too fast, or something. I suspect it may have something to do with your own computer. For example, even with a little lag, I can do better with this game on my old laptop than I can with my new desktop.\n\nAlso, as of April of 2014, you probably won't have any luck getting matched online to work since so few people play this game. I haven't played against a local player or a lan match, so I can't really say anything about that.\n\nStill, for all the problems, I purchased it for the nostalgia. I definitely enjoyed the easy story for what it's worth. The graphics are nice enough.","April 12, 2014","true","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Look at the price. Buy it.\n\nIt is my hands down favorite title of this genre. Better than Bust A Move, Puzzle Fighter, or dare I say Puzzle Bobble. The objective is to match colored balls in groups of three or more. If you set them up right they will chain together and add rows to your opponents screen.\n\nIf you've never heard of it that's because it's never been outside of Japanese consoles except for Neo Geo, a hard to find Gameboy title, and mobile. I have been a fan of this series since the 90's and would have spent a whatever was asked if this were a disc import like MagiDro F before it made its way to PSN. I had honestly thought MagiDro Touch was the last in the series but imagine my shock when I happened across this gem! At this price. It's everything I wanted from the game. No major changes just the additon of online battles and some humorous Engrish thrown in to the mix to make story mode somewhatly plausable. The character unlock conditions are hellish as well but the downside is that I see a certain drop pattern more than the others.\n\nThe music and CVs are the same as before but they seem remastered as well.\n\nI will calm my fangirl down enough to give an honest review so: Visual 8/10 Audio 7/10 Gameplay 8/10 Online: BROKEN\n\n[EDIT] After some intense gameplay there are some hiccups. No controller regonition, Team mode freezes, Menu locking, and Online is broken. Developer promised work on the online half a year ago but no dice. I still suggest it if you have someone to play local matches with and don't mind a lot of arcade mode!","December 26, 2013","true","14.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The gameplay is solid, the art and music are passable, but the gameplay makes up for all of it.  It's fast, fluid and very simple to get into.  Definite buy if you're into Puzzle bobble/Bustamove or fast paced puzzle games like puyo puyo.\n\n\nThe core gameplay is to pull orbs down from the top of the screen and then make columns of at least 3 of the same colour. If the column is connected to any more orbs of the same colour they'll all pop, and the goal is to reach 200 popped orbs before the other player, or make them mess up and overload their side with orbs.\n\nIf you play as bruce you get a mix of Puzzle bobble mechanics and some new twists which make it really enjoyable, his playstyle is harder to explain but is a lot of fun in action.\n\nThe AI is competant and will challenge you thoroughly, and there's local AND online multiplayer modes so you can play with your friends.\n\nThe story mode is about what you'd expect from this style of game. A short conversation between two characters followed by a duel, but each story mode is a decent length (about 12 levels) and has pretty good difficulty progression.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a solid 8/10.","March 25, 2013","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

That game charmed my socks clean off my feet.  I remember trying in vain to find copies of the game at used game and hobby shops in the local honch, Yokohama, Shibuya, Akihabara, and even Ginza in Tokyo.  So imagine my surprise when, after 7 years stateside, I see Magical Drop V on steam.  The thought that I'd be able to play a new Magical Drop brought me unparalleled levels of happiness.\n\nI guess I don't have to tell you how badly this title crushed my spirits.  It feels a bit like someone drew a stick figure on some wideruled paper and called it the Mona Lisa.  Don't purchase this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quemaqua/recommended/204960/","Quemaqua","Quemaqua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quemaqua/","199 products in account","I could forgive everything people had to say about this game that was bad but for the following: the fundamental gameplay is broken, and that for the single simple reason that there's a delay between catching a ball and being able to move. I haven't played a Magical Drop game since MG3 on the Neo Geo and Magical Drop Pocket on the Neo Geo Pocket Color, but neither of those games had any delay, which made it possible to control your character and move to the side however many spaces you needed to to line up a shot. You could do this reliably, making chains very possible. In this version, there's a half-second delay and no visual cue to let you know the character has caught the ball and can move, making chains almost impossible. I consider myself a pretty decent player, but I can't play this at all. It's basically a different game because of this.\n\nOther issues abound. According to another Japanese reviewer here, the Japanese translation reads like auto-translation. I can say for certain that subtitles do not display at all during story mode in Japanese. The game also crashed to desktop 3 times for me in the first few minutes, and according to another Japanese reviewer, this happens when the game is set to Japanese. You must play in English to get the game to work. Even after buying the game, it still acts as though it's the demo, giving you options to unlock the full game.\n\nI'd forgive all of this if the core gameplay worked well. It doesn't. If you're absolutely brand-new to Magical Drop, perhaps you could forgive it. I don't see how that's possible if you've already been playing the series for years.\n\nA shame, too, as this seems like it had real potential. I'm very sad to learn that this never got reliably improved upon, and even more frustrated that no other reviewers mentioned the control delay which, for me, makes the game an absolute chore to play (it feels significantly slower and less frantic than prior games in the series).","December 19, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
