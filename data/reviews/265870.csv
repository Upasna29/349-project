"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/recommended/265870/","ujuidarehcram","UjuidarEhcram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/","989 products in account","Alpha Kimori is a sci-fi Japanese-style RPG set on a planet that humans have colonized and fled to, and home to two warring factions: one that wants to reclaim Earth, and one that wants to live in peace on their new home.\n\nThis game is really bad.\n\nIn a good RPG, combat requires some tactical decisions and creative use of skills and abilities to beat tougher enemies. In Alpha Kimori, combat is purely a grind, with 99% of fights requiring nothing more than mashing Attack, 1% requiring the occasional Defend command to heal, and 0% of the fights requiring the use of a skill. The sole exception to this rule is the final battle, which is the game's only interesting fight. I highly recommend using JoyToKey and setting up a turbo controller so that it will do the button mashing for you.\n\nIn a good RPG, characters are deep and memorable, live in an interesting world, and take part in a grand story. In Alpha Kimori, the plot is dumb and predictable, the heroes have no interesting qualities, and the world is shallow.\n\nHere's the plot: one faction likes to kill animals and people to drain their energy. Our heroes are the only few people that think that rampant murder might be wrong. So, after murdering a few hundred bunnies and birds, the heroes decide to abandon their home for another faction that is only a little less bloodthirsty. A few times, they remember the one defining moment in their lives (the one time someone said that killing was mean) in the form of about ten flashbacks to the same event. There's supposedly a romance in there too, but our leads have less chemistry than oil and water.\n\nI should also mention that the quest design is awful. It mostly consists of running through the same dungeons over and over again, sometimes taking the long way around just to stretch out the game.\n\nThe graphics look decent, except that the character won't stay anywhere near the center of the screen. The music is upbeat but not at all memorable. The controls are sub-par, and the game is in desperate need of a sprint button.\n\nI really only continued this game out of a morbid curiosity to see how bad it would get. The bad news is that this game really just isn't even entertaining. For most of my playtime with Alpha Kimori, I was actually playing Mario Golf and letting the turbo controller do all the heavy lifting. This game is a tedious mess, and I can't recommend it to anyone, even if you get it free.\n\nThe developer needs to get the first game right before continuing with this "trilogy".","July 1, 2014","false","5.5"," 100 of 116 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","100","116","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhashbrick/recommended/265870/","therealhashbrick","ManiacMal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhashbrick/","2580 products in account",""So Hashbrick do you recommend Alpha Kimori Episode 1?"\n\n"Absolutely!" is what I would have said if it didn't have so many things wrong with it.  At this point it is nothing more than a "Well if you like RPGs and don't mind a huge let down...be my guest"\n\nLet's go down the list of everything that just makes this a disappointment in any regard.\n\nCONS\n\nShort - 5-7hrs depending on how hard you grind there isn't much going for it.  The story has a hard time taking off and when you are done you are still wondering what exactly went on in that short time frame.  This is exactly why RPGs were never made in episode form originally, it is hard to tell a meaningful story in a short period of time.\n\nSoundtrack - Get ready to hear the same damn music over and over.  One of the songs actually sounds like watching a citcom where it hits the high notes and out comes the actors running down the stairs with their names appearing.  It is a very odd taste of music and you will groan everytime you hear it even with the short episode.\n\nLack of Strategy - The only time you will ever use "skills" is on boss fights to quickly defeat them, other than that the whole game is cruise control of spamming just attack and watching ♥♥♥♥ die.  There is no weaknesses or status effects just a minor attack up, attack down system.\n\nRedone & Overused Areas - Get ready to go to the same damn areas you go through in the beginning of the game with the exception of the final area that is new everything is rehashed for every quest and side quest.  You litteraly do not venture more than a woods right next to your town and nothing more.  There is times where you wish they'd just wipe the enemies clean and just let you run instead of running into lvl 1 ♥♥♥♥ at lvl 32 just cause its the very first area but you need to do quest X here for the 10th time.\n\nStory - Extremely weak story of a love triangle (or lack there of) between a brain dead, can't think for myself female that is obbsessed with the main character to the point it makes you sick.  Then this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes the chick you could care less about while you hunt for another chick on the other faction to realize that you could care less about your own morals that were forced on you by your crazy ♥♥♥ parents who have no problem to just kill you off if you fail your exam?!?!  Oh ya and something about some alpha ship that came from Earth to this planet, with two factions; one that wants to get back to Earth and one that wants to just stay and make the best of it, who then made these Kimori human like things but not considered humans who consider themselves gods, while 7 souls of angels that turn into some kinda gem thing implanted in 7 different characters that can call these angel things in battle, while the other faction can turn into enemies and the reason to kill monsters on the planet is to harness their ki energy for....reasons.  Confused yet?  Good don't expect anything else when it ends there is nothing if anything explained in this crazy mindless plot. (It is suppose to sound like a run-on because of how short the episode is and how much they jam in your throat)\n\nItems That Don't Matter - Throw your items in the garbage, you will never use them if you are on par with the levels you should be.  As for weapons and armor you will get hand outs during the story no point of ever using the stores ever...\n\nLack of world building - There is no detail in most the areas you will travel through, just plain grass, caves, one town and a small one with little to nothing in it.\n\nCutscenes - Not only will you see the same cutscene cut up in different places over 10 times in different points in the game as they ram it home that "this is the defining moment of change!"  You will also be greeted to ingame cutscenes that require npc movement that takes so long and you can't move until its complete.  The graduation ceremony you watch 3 npcs walk up take their document and go back to their place, for what, what point is there making the player wait a long ♥♥♥ time for no gain, no dialog, just movement...  Seems like they just did one flash back and cut it up cause it was too much work.\n\nPROS\n\nGraphics - looks good for a 2D RPG, models are nicely detailed.\n\nBattle Engine - While not having to actually use it much, it is overall a well built battle engine turn based menu system.\n\nCharacter Building - While being short it does a ok job at detailing some of the characters and giving them a background, this is probably the shining moment in the game and the only shining moment.  There are some cliched character of course but for the most part the reasons and ambitions are clearly detailed throughout the short episode.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nIf you like a RPG with a meaty story, look elsewhere.  If you don't mind grinding mindlessly and go through the same areas over and over again for a little piece of pie (the story or lack thereof) then by all means take the plunge.  I can't recommend this game based on the obvious issues with this game there is no meat for the lover of RPGs and in retrospect if I had known it was going to be what it was I probably would have not pushed myself through the entire episode.\n\n2/10 - extremely average run of the mill RPG with little to no reason to actually need to experience it.","December 23, 2014","false","5.1"," 97 of 125 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","97","125","4","5"

Just going to echo the major points, though:\n\n1. Combat is too simplistic. Just spam your high damage ability and grind. Nevermind any kind of "balance" concerns, it never even attempts any kind of depth by giving things like ability/class variety, itemization, consumable management... nothing!\n2. Writing is too awkward. I can forgive the above point and a weak story/premise if the writing is good (especially since this is an RPG where the focus is on writing).\n3. I did complete the game. The "hours played" is a little long because I left the game on for an hour or so while I did other stuff. I don't think the game is too short. If anything it's too long. I say this because this game IMMEDIATELY throws you into grinding. And there's plenty more grinding to be had throughout. On top of that, you revisit the same areas all the time! Basically this is a ~2 hour game stretched into 7 or so. And you can't avoid at least doing some grinding. I was about level 37 on the last boss and he presented the only challenge of the game. If I was... I dunno, level 25 or something I don't think he would be beatable.\n\nMore on the writing-\nThe major problems come from two sources: everything is too direct and on the nose (Main character is told to kill, he states that he refuses to kill. Every person has to explain everything like how the government is fascist and fascism is bad. People outright point out their own biases and then say, "But you're not like that" within one second of meeting someone, etc etc) and the dialogue itself is awkwardly phrased. It sounds like it's written by someone with a passion for writing, but their first language isn't English? Like if you were to meet this writer in person you'd be impressed and say, "Wow, your English is great!" but it's not up to snuff when it comes to dialogue in a written story. The phrasing is always SLIGHTLY off. On top of that, it neither attempts to be natural or what I call "movie dialogue" (where each line is meant to both move the plot forward AND demonstrate a [thin] personality within 5 or so words).\nSo- to put it more simply- it's kind of a pain to read.","July 6, 2015","false","9.6"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","48","59","0","2"

As well, the main character's primary conflict, that he refuses to kill the creatures on the planet, goes against the gameplay completely. Often, the topic is discussed immediately after a segment of nothing but killing creatures.\n\nand\n\nb) The battle system is boring. I played two hours of the game (of the about six that most people say the game takes to finish) and the battle system doesn't evolve past "heal when needed" and "dump specials on bosses". Most of the fights I got through by hammering the Enter key.\n\nI don't recommend this game at all. It's all right visually, but doesn't have anything decent to put inside that nice wrapper.\n\nEDIT\n=======\n"Thank you for your feedback, AtomicPineapple. Please note that during battles, none of the Ki Creatures are killed. They are defeated and chased away. The focus of the game is more to its anime inspired story. We understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea." - the developer\n\nThat's the thing, though, this IS my cup of tea, generally speaking. My top recommended tag is "Anime" for a reason. The plot isn't even the problem, it's when the character's start talking that everything falls apart. There's also a laundry list of technical issues that I didn't get into in the first draft. For one, I can't get the game to fullscreen for some reason without it crashing. As well, the control scheme is completely off and there doesn't seem to be any way to change it (as far as I can tell, the only movement is with the arrow keys and the only way to input a command is with the Enter button, meaning I have to constantly move my hand off of the movement controls while my left hand does nothing, except occasionally hit Esc which is somehow the Cancel command) Not only is the control scheme off, but nowhere does it tell you what any of the buttons do, so it's also confusing.\n\nMaking a story focused game is fine, but it doesn't mean you can just phone in the "game" part of the game, which is what the player is going to be spending most of their time on. Even if the story was mind blowing, I don't want to sit through hours of boring combat to get at it.","April 23, 2015","false","2.7"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","24","30","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Palpatini/recommended/265870/","Palpatini","Jando Calrissian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Palpatini/","548 products in account","Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode One is Sherman3D’s first foray into making an in-house video game, with their previous work having been mostly outsourced programming and artwork for games such as Drawn to Life and Scribblenauts - and a fairly good first game at that. Sherman3D have brought something fairly unique to the table by releasing a Malaysian-produced Role-playing game more in-line with classical Japanese RPGs than anything.\n\nAlpha Kimori takes place in a future in which aliens known as Centaurians have invaded Earth. A god-figure known as alpha Alpha - a giant spaceship - comes to the planet and rescues a chosen few humans, who are in-turn protected by 7 Angels who serve it. Alpha brings these humans to Kimori, a new planet in which humanity can begin anew.\n\nThe humans quickly run afoul of eachother and split into two warring factions, the Bidarians and the Jinrians. The Bidarians wish to drain Kimori of its resources (Crystals known as Ki Crystals) to create an attack force to take back Earth by force, while the Jinrians wish to live in harmony with their new planet and embrace the second chance they have been given.\n\nAlpha Kimori follows Rick, a genetically-enhanced Bidarian supersoldier who begins to question whether the values he was raised on are morally right, or if he was just raised to believe they were. The story is a politically-rich tale with surprisingly complex themes of morality and legacy, and there are enough twists and turns to keep you gripped and waiting for the next scene of character interaction to find out where the story is going.\n\nThe story is definitely the most important and interesting aspect of Alpha Kimori, and you will find yourself pining for the second episode by the time you’re finished with the five hours this title delivers. Despite a few spelling errors and awkward translations here and there, the story is detailed and well put-together, and will definitely have you thinking about it afterwards.\n\nThe game is designed much like a standard old-school JRPG and doesn’t have that many unique aspects going for it as far as gameplay is concerned. It is an unfortunate example of an average game in this respect, as what it does pretty much just works and isn’t that interesting. This is especially noticeable at times in the story when you are expected to backtrack through areas littered with the most basic of enemies.\n\nMuch like in Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, the combat system is a standard turn-based tirade with attacking, special abilities, guarding, and items. There is no substance and no interesting combat options. Even when you unlock one of the most important plot-related abilities, it’s just slapped in the Skills menu with your other abilities. The only thing setting it apart from regular JRPGs is the fact that combat order isn’t dictated by a speed stat - instead the player characters always go first, except for one minor exception found in an extremely easy fight later on in the game.\n\nI found the biggest problem with the gameplay is how insultingly easy it is. I didn’t find myself challenged by a single fight until the final boss, which was just straight-up unfair unless you have a good stockpile of powerful healing items. For the most part I found I could win fights in a single turn, which was only furthered by the fact the critical hit rate in the game is ramped up all the way. Critical hits happened so often that it looked like they may as well have swapped the crit rate with the normal hit rate.\n\nMost new areas came with enemies that were only slightly more difficult (Generally more health and a tiny bit more damage) but with exponentially increased experience rates. In one area I was getting 100 experience per enemy, only to have that boosted to 300 per enemy in the next. This made me feel like I was permanently overleveled and made the game a breeze, coupled with the fact leveling up restores all your health and Ki (The game’s Magic Points).\n\nDisappointingly, the design of the game feels like a lot more effort was put into artificially extending the game than creating anything with substance. You are repeatedly sent back through areas that have no relevance to the story whatsoever, and some parts even damage the story just for the sake of 10 minutes of added length.\n\nThe backtracking isn’t all bad though, as graphically the game is spectacular for what it is. All the graphics are beautifully hand-crafted pixel art very reminiscent of Phantasy Star and the Super Robot Taisen series, and the battle graphics are fully animated and a joy to watch, and each area was designed extremely well and rewarded venturing from the route you were to follow, making the backtracking a perfect chance to go back and find things you’d missed the first time around.\n\nAccompanying every area, battle, and gripping scene is Alpha Kimori’s absolutely superb soundtrack. There is very little to complain about with the music in the game, with every song perfectly orchestrating the importance and emotion of every scene. The composer of Alpha Kimori really outdid themselves and I applaud them for creating such a beautiful soundtrack, which is most definitely the best part of the entire game and made my experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a few major problems with Alpha Kimori, but these could all easily be fixed, and I eagerly await the second episode with fingers crossed hoping that they have done so. I would recommend picking up this game if you value story more in video games more than anything else, as it is a spectacularly well-told story which now has me craving the second episode just so I can find out what happens!\n\n7/10","April 26, 2014","true","5.9"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","1"

In fact a soap opera is better.\n\n\nUpdate! I got developer comments. That's awesome.  That makes the dev's credibility go up a notch in my eyes just for that.  And, given that I think I'll add some more detail to this review so they, and others, can understand exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n\nWarning! Small spoilers along with *a lot* of text below\n\n\n\n\nThe issues I have with the story are more to do with the character interactions.  I played right up until the two main characters have spied on the lady in the cloak and it's time for graduation.  I've got three specific examples I can show right at this point in the game:\n\n1. you are ordered by one of the elder's to follow the woman in the cloak. Why does this person order you, someone that's not even graduated to follow someone?  I could see the motivation for choosing the MC as being an internal political struggle since maybe the MC and his family has leanings towards the other elder you are supposed to deliver the package too, a test of loyalty for the character to see if he is willing to follow orders since he doesn't like to kill and may be conspiring with the enemy, or some other thing.  However, whatever the motivation is for having the MC follow the woman in the cloak we aren't shown any of it.  All we have is a blatant plot hook that the player is smacked in the face with.  The Elder even says something to the effect of "she trusts you" but we don't know that. The Elder certainly shouldn't know that. It makes the Elder come across as either knowing way more and being scary intelligent, which it didn't for me, or just some dumb guy that has powers of the script.\n\nAside from the fact that having a non-graduate tail someone who could be an enemy spy instead of trained government agents the presentation to make the MC as a choice could've been better: Something like "that areas mostly for trainees, you being there makes perfect sense so go ahead and catch up and see what you can learn"  It's not great but it's better than "Plot character appears and forces you on a quest"\n\n\n2. On the day of graduation the character "confronts" his parents with his lack of desire to graduate and be a soldier.  This has several flaws:\n\nA. The MC seems entirely unaware of the situation he's in and how his opinion will be construed. Either the MC doesn't understand his situation and therefore is stupid or he does understand the situation and doesn't care if his parents reject or report him and is willing to accept death.  Now if he's aware and is willing to accept death he's either brave or depressed at his existence maybe verging on suicidal.  However, we don't see any of those traits in the MC prior to this.  We see only a sort of vague resistance to his situation.  He'll avoid killing the beasts if he can, but if the player chooses to charge headlong into every fight killing every animal drenching the characters in the blood of the fallen that's all good.  So the MC is neither directly opposed nor directly for.  he's only sort of "meh"\n\nB.  His parents reaction is so over the top it is unbelievable.  The line "I'll kill you myself" is probably what pushed it over the edge for me.  That single line says so much about the characters relationship with his parents as well as theirs with him and yet the response to it is "oh well I guess I should go to graduation then".\n\nC. There's no variation in the text.  It seems like a small point and yet throughout this whole very intense conversation the text is the same.  I don't know if there is inflections or raised voices or anything. It reads monotone.\n\n\nI have no problem with the plot being straightforward. Straightforward is fine. I don't need a bunch of choice trees like mass effect to enjoy a game.  But I do need to be able to believe the characters.  With this game I felt like I was watching a presentation not playing a game.\n\n\n\nHopefully this makes my point of view a little more clear and also doesn't come across as emotional.  I have tried to present my examples objectively without rambling. Feel free to comment and let me know if this comes across as too personal instead of professional.","May 27, 2015","false","4.5"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","2"

I picked this up in a bundle and i don't believe this game as a stand alone is worth $9.99. If you are a fan of this retro style jrpg you will probably really enjoy this game and for an rpgmaker game it goes above and beyond the typical bad steam rpg game.I think some of the others reviewing this particular game took it way too seriously and didn't enjoy the subtle charms that Alpha Kimori offers.\n\nThis is the first in a trilogy and is the only one currently on steam so keep that in mind. The 2nd can be purchased on the offical website.\n\nPros:\nGreat Music\nEngaging Story\nFun artwork and Styles\nEasy to learn battle system\n\nCons:\nFirst hour or two is basically fetch quests.\nAreas constantly reused with reskined monsters\nBattles can get repetitive","August 12, 2015","true","7.6"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

But there are some issues with it:\n1. Length - the game has such a lack of content and stuff that is there is being rehashed over and over and over. one Flashback scene in particular\n2. Difficulty - the game is painfully easy, even without fully utilizing your abilities and training you will have no problem at all\n3. Items - or better the lack thereof. there is basically one weapon for each character for sale at some point and they are pretty pricy too.  few pieces of armor/helmet and accessory's i have found ONE in the whole game. Not that you would need any in regards to -2-.\n4. Scripted events - no matter how strong you are, how you wipe the floor with event enemies the outcome of the battles won't change in the slightest. It starts to get very annoying at some point. I can understand that the linear path has to go to a specific outcome but there are better ways to make that happen.\n5. Ending - this trilogy is probably never gonna finish. Part 1 came out in 2011, part 2 (which is not on steam yet) in 2012 and then the dev seemed to abandon the project. The last feedback on how far part 3 is progressing was from 2012 so its safe to assume that the project is dead.","July 16, 2014","false","6.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","2"

(The only reason is to make the game longer than already is)\n\nThe game has few songs, and many times it repeats the intro song inside the game, even in a boss fight. The songs aren't bad but the repetition makes them seem old really quick.\n\nYou will be walking around on the map most of the time without any reason. The World Map is useless and has a disguised loading.\n\nthe story of the game is really shallow for a story made by a developer that wants to create an anime and a manga about it,\nThere are lots and lots of repeated scenes in the game, and the worst of all 3 episodes got cut off the game even knowing that it was totally possible to put these 3 episodes inside it.\n\nResume...\nThe game is forcibly long and the missions are mostly unnecessary.\nThe songs repeat a lot and they pisses you off. The battles are long and tiring. Not forgetting that the game is absurdly expensive comparing to the games of the same platform.\nThis is one of the WORST RPG MAKER GAMES that exist!\n\nThat's the reason I say: don't waste your time and money playing this garbage game.\n\n-------------------\n[PT-BR]\nNão recomendo!\nO jogo pode ser graficamente lindo, e ter um bom ar de jogo de Nintendo DS.\nPorém peca muito em ser extremamente longo e demorado.\n\nAs batalhas são muito desbalanceadas:\nO golpe normal dos personagens tem quase a mesma força que os golpes especiais.\nOs bosses quase sempre usam ataques massívos, que causam cerca de 35% de dano, alem das animações serem extremamente longas e lerdas.\nFora que as batalhas muitas vezes são forçadas. Pois muitas vezes você vai estar lutando sem nem saber o motivo.\n\nA maior parte das missões do jogo são forçadas, onde você deve fazer X coisa para um npc que não vai influenciar em nada na história. (tudo pro jogo ficar mais longo)\nO jogo possue poucas músicas, e várias vezes vai ficar repetindo a música de introdução dentro do jogo, seja em cenário ou em boss fight. Não que as músicas sejam ruins, mas o excesso de repetição é muito desgastante.\n\nA maior parte do tempo voce vai ficar transitando de um mapa para outro sem motivo algum. Fora que o World Map é inútil, alem de ser um loading disfarçado.\n\nQuanto a história do jogo, pra uma desenvolvedora que almeja fazer um Anime e um Mangá em cima do jogo, a motivação dos personagens é muito rasa.\nFora que há uma repetição de uma cena no jogo várias e várias vezes.\nE como não bastasse, o jogo foi CORTADO em 3 episódios, sendo que podiam muito bem ter lançado um jogo completo com os 3 episódios.\n\nResumindo...\nO jogo é forçadamente longo, e as missões são em suma parte desnecessárias. As músicas se repentem de mais e chegam a ser irritantes. Fora as batalhas que são muito longas e cansativas.\nAinda que o jogo é absurdamente caro se comparado com outros jogos da mesma plataforma\nEste é um dos PIORES JOGOS de RPG Maker que existem!\n\nPor isso eu digo: não perca seu tempo, nem dinheiro jogando esse lixo de jogo.","August 13, 2015","false","9.0"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","4"

You could grind and buy the weapons and armor in the stores like I did, but nearly everything but the shields are given to you just by wandering around.  It's not like the encounter enemies really need it.  And the prices for the (only) weapons in the shop are in the 4000-6000 range, while most of the enemies don't drop nearly that much gold.  Everything else in the shops is priced at nearly 1/10 of that.  Lots of artificially forcing you to walk everywhere, with tight corners to force you to battle monsters.  Oddly inserted fetch quests, having to randomly grab 50 of an item, which I conveniently had through grinding.\n\nNear the end of episode 1, I was Level 37 with all the equipment upgrades and could crash through scores of enemies without really needing to heal (even outside of battles). But the last boss fight of the episode nearly slaughtered me.  2/5 - 1/2 of every character's HP from the two group attacks each round, with two extra individual attacks.  The best healer is the only character who has a group attack at that point, and my characters spent most of their time healing, and still losing HP.  Two of the characters' healing skills only healed about 1/5 HP.  Either the encounter enemies were too weak or the boss was too strong.  No group heal skills, but all characters have individual heal skills.  Only two characters can heal strongly enough to offset the continuous damage.\n\nSupposedly your character wants to live without killing or hurting, but you can't help but slaughter the local wildlife.  It wasn't ever made clear if those monsters are also part of the Ki Monsters that I supposedly hate killing.  There were several battles where I'd defeat the super-powerful boss and then the plot would still show me defeated.  I was death on RPG rails and everyone called me lazy and under-achieving.  It doesn't seem like your performance affects the plot much.  In fact, only 3-4 skills per character at Level 37.  Pretty vanilla for the understated town badass.  Any other skills probably won't exist until the next episodes.  Doesn't seem worth the grind to find out.\n\nNice animations, good sprites.  Seems like it's based off of one of the RPG Maker engines, so it was odd to hear my laptop fan (2Ghz x4 Core i7, FirePro M5950) running at full-blast for 2D tiles and it still wasn't smooth.  I don't think I'd try it on the minimum specs.  Maybe it was the AMD drivers, but more visually impressive games are smoother and less demanding.  It's probably RPGMaker, which never seems to be smooth in full screen mode.  The game didn't seem like it would run in windowed mode, though (Alt+Enter).  It would show a window, but only display 1/4 of the screen in it.\n\nIt has potential, but because of the plot on rails it seems more like I'm playing a visual novel with a high encounter rate than an RPG.  Seriously, one weapon upgrade.  It might be worth $5 (half the price), but I'd look around and catch it in a bundle or on sale, rather than paying full price.  2D JRPGs are nostalgic, but it's not like they're uncommon, even today.  And better ones exist, both new and classic.  Go back and play Phantasy Star IV, Final Fantasy VI or Grandia (3D maps, 2D sprites), instead.","June 7, 2014","false","11.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Like usual, your character is super special and can help to save to world. You can harness power from Ki crystals, and control a large robot exoskeleton to assist you in your attacks.\n\nGameplay consists of the normal RPG maker fare. Click to select attack, click enemy to target, repeat. You can explore a few towns, including the large starting town, and encounter many battles in the overworld map. You can see the enemies on the map, so avoid them if you are tired of grinding.\n\nThe story did not really grip me in the beginning, and I quickly found myself clicking through dialogue to get to the next scene.

But anyways even though the game lacks the comfort for players to play, the story picks up and is actually quite interesting.\n\nCRITICAL HIT\nCRITICAL HIT\nCRITICAL HIT\nThe game became too easy the moment you started getting a million critical hits. To be honest, monster grinding would be even more boring without the critical hits. However the critical hits amount surely did astound me as it seems like its 100% critical hit count against monsters. There were a couple of "boss" like fights but really weren't too hard due to your large health and "mana" pools.\nOne of the most annoying things about the game that I found were the monster walking paths. It literally seemed as if the monsters were spazzing with some spazzing towards you. It was really annoying and unpredictable so I couldn't even avoid those useless low exp giving monsters. They also should have put more teleporters to different regions so I wouldn't have to worry about those pesky spazzers.\n\nOverall nice short game.\nRating: 7.3/10\n\nAlso, don't criticize me for my tastes, but I genuinely enjoyed the theme song BiRD by the oh so famous robot singer.","December 30, 2014","true","6.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DTAltair/recommended/265870/","DTAltair","DTAltair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DTAltair/","665 products in account","First off, I do like the artistic side of the game and the story line is a more new one to me so it was good to feel like you are engaging in some new. But the game itself kinda ruined that with the playability of it. There was numerous things that I didn't like:\n1st: Event processing. Half the time I wanted to explore the map after an event, but then its like, "nope, teleport back to town".\n2nd: The level system & Equipment. Played for 2 hours, am level 20's, and have not gotten any new weapons or armor (I bought the tunic and bandana at the start). The only weapon that is of use costs 15000$ and you will never be able to afford that for quite some time. I had like 6k or so when I stopped. There is no "cool new weapons or armors", your strength is only from leveling up, so you never feel like you are actually becoming powerful. It feels more gringfest then anythhing else.\n3rd: Skills. Super unoriginal skills. Each person has their own keyword for their skill (as far as I got there was God, Metal, and Angel). So for example your first couple skills for the main character is "God Sword, God Focus, God Blast". Also with that, everyone has the same skills. Each person has a heal, a KI restore, and a Power attack. Since everyone's health and KI grows at the same rate and everyone basically has the same skills it feels like all the party members are the same. It's like playing with duplicates of the main character.\n4th: There were some holes in the story as well. The biggest one for me is the part where you have to go recieve a canister and then you have to go get a special KI crystal to trade (which was a huge pain to walk back and forth with). The leader tells you that he will pass you for the graduation exam for doing it and you don't have to kill any KI creatures. This is where the problem happens with story. It is basically nearly impossible to avoid enemies. They have sporadic pathing and some are really fast. So you know, you kill like 100 KI creatures with the amount of traveling you have to do. I tried avoiding them at first thinking that if you killed one it might affect the story, but nope, apparenlty you can just slaughter them all, and still be crying about how you are trying to be peaceful and not kill them.\n5th: Health & Items: Basically you only level up to face the bosses. All enemies once you level up enough you will be able to 2 hit them with normal attacks only. They only deal 20-30 (this is being level 20 range) damage and you have 1106 health. You want to just ignore them all, but then its like, "oh this boss might actually kill me because he deals 200" You basically gring to fight bosses. You also collect KI crystals to use to restore health and what not. They heal by 10% 25% and 100%, (from what I have seen) and you get an abundance of them. I do a long sidequest and he is like here is 3 10% health crystals. With your health pool and how fast you level up, your health will never get low enough to actually start using them. All they do is just sit in your inventory.\nSo all in all with story and artwork I would give it a 4/10.","December 30, 2014","false","2.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The story is easy to get into, and the characters are interesting.\n\nThe bad: Movement is slow.  I mean really, really slow.  You walk along a long path with no ability to speed it up.  You have to wait for the NPC to leave the screen before you can move, and there's no way to skip anything such as cutscenes or fastforward things like battle animations.\n\nThe ugly: No matter what you do in battle, if you're scripted to lose, you're going to lose.  Even if you one shot the enemy, once the battle is done it'll pretend like you lost the battle, making it feel like there's no point to winning them.  The finale brings up an interesting aspect of the story, namely the ability to (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS) harvest the gems of enemies and add their strength to your own (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS) but there is no mechanic in game to do that.  You're also greeted with a strength +100 gem, but it's the only one you get and it's impossible to get more.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth $5 or even $10, but for a five hour game it's not really worth $15.  Get it on sale if you can, because there's a part 2 that steam needs to add (and a part 3 they need to make supposedly) that will eat your money away if you buy it at full price.  It's not worth $45 ($30 for both parts for a 12 hour game) for however many hours, but it's a fun game for a one and done.","December 18, 2014","true","7.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/recommended/265870/","PhyreMatrix","PhyreMatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/","941 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. A futuristic RPG about two warring nations who have populated a planet after being driven from the Earth. Sounds like a decent plot to base a game off of. So why did this game fail to entertain? There are a number of reasons which I think it just isn't up to snuff.\n\nFirst off, lets talk about the main character. Ugh, Rick, is our typical angsty teenage boy trying to "find himself". He's always so depressed because people are always fighting but does he really do anything about it? No, he says he won't fight, but then doesn't want to disappoint his parents. Then he has this elder friend who asks him to fight, and he has this whole inner struggle that is just plainly boring to watch. He makes me long for the days of the silent protagonist. Do you remember Chrono from Chrono Trigger? Never said a word the ENTIRE game. Still had more personality than Rick.\n\nSecond would it be too much to add a RUN button? It might be one of the lesser annoyances of this game but I feel like if you're going to have me travel to the forest a half a dozen times the least the developer could have done was add a run feature. Instead I'm trudging through the same dungeon at a leisurely pace for the 10th time I'm sent there for something.\n\nThird, the plot. I feel like this game wants to give that whole moral dilemma type of vibe with the dialogue. But it's constantly hammering this idea into you with long winded diatribes from Rick and Co. about who's side is right about the war. And as much as he seems to dislike his people for killing animals and whatnot he defends his nation every chance he gets. And to make matters worse is there's one flashback that the characters all seem to play every time they reminisce about the past. This flashback of ONE event happens literally half a dozen times. If you're going to use life defining moments in time use them sparingly for maximum effect. Not every time a character has some inner conflict. It loses it's effect if you're showing the same flashback scene several times in one section.\n\nI could go on ad hominum about the things wrong with this game including the boring battle system. The one thing I appreciate is that it's just the first episode. I can't express how disappointed I'd be if this was supposed to be some 50 hr rpg in one shot. I probably won't bother with the second episode if it's going to be more of the same as the first.","January 24, 2015","false","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

As an RPG, its battle system is just standard basic attack, magic, and item commands selected from a menu, with an option to defend and recover HP/MP, but doesn't offer anything beyond that.  Enemies show up in the field and battles can be avoided for the most part, which is a step up from having to deal with completely random battles.\n\nThe game could have stood to have a wider variety of music tracks.  You'll be hearing the same upbeat town theme a lot of the time, which will sometimes end up clashing with the tone of the story when things take on a more serious mood.  The first episode is also really short.  Taking my time with it and walking away from it every so often, I still managed to get through it in under 10 hours, and a good portion of the game has a lot of padding from battling and backtracking.\n\nOverall, it offers enough where I could recommend it if you really like older console RPGs and can get it for cheap during a sale.","October 14, 2014","true","9.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/265870/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","Alpha Kimori (ep1) is a fun little RPG (in JRPG-style) that while not perfect does prove that with effort a small group of people can use RPG Maker to put something together worth your money. RPG Maker has a seedy reputation due to some people abusing it but it’s far from a bad piece of software, and in the right hands can be used to everyone’s benefit. Alpha Kimori is one such product that stands as testament to this.\n\nThat said the game doesn’t try to be anything more than it appears to be, a very traditional RPG in the style of old SNES classics. Characters have HP/MP that you use in the usual turn-based format to launch your staple attack/magic/healing commands (given different names in this case, but still the same), and you run around from place-to-place viewing events. So if you’re looking for something that stretches boundaries you’ll be disappointed. But, if you can enjoy that style of old-school gameplay then Alpha Kimori is a very polished version of those styles. I should mention here that battles are not random but instead initiated by contacting enemy sprites on the field.\n\nStory-wise things are interesting but feel a little scatter-brained, as if not all the dialogue is in the correct order. For instance our main characters occasionally have drastic shifts in their points of view within the very same discussion, rather than seeming like a solid progression from one view to the next over the course of several discussions. Still the story it’s trying to tell is interesting enough, there are plenty of tropes but it’s still trying to be its own property despite that. Similarly most of the characters are likable, the above mentioned shifting back-and-forth on positions sometimes detracts from them but in the end they’re mostly solid.\n\nSome blatantly not so great points include there being a little too much backtracking for its own good as you revisit a small set of locations many times, it could have stood to have a few more songs for world locations and events (for instance it continues playing the bubbly, upbeat city theme even when events get serious which detracts from the scene taking place), and it’s very easy to begin with and even simpler if you spend more than a few minutes grinding with nothing coming close to beating you.\n\nSo make no mistake, if you don’t like this style of game then Alpha Kimori will NOT change your opinion on them. But if you do then this is a well-polished game that clearly has intent to go somewhere and should keep you content for the 5-7 hour playtime the first episode purports.\n","July 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It has great graphics and a superb battle system, but as an RPG, it story falls too flat and the characters are too one dimensional.\nFirst of all this is a well made game, most of the times. It really feels like the developers took their time to craft a great battle system. This is the shiny moment in this game, the enemies become cannon fodder and the games go no further than medium difficulty. The songs at the beginning and end are great, in my opinion. This is a great game for beginners and those who want to have fun.\nAlas an RPG is only as good as its story and characters, and this is where the game makes its greatest mistake. The story is not bad, but it is mediocre. Don’t worry when the game finally lets you run around you are going to figure out the plot in minutes. Just talk to everyone in town.  You also only get one weapon upgrade which you get from the characters automatically just buy shields and maybe some armor. By the way save all your items for the final battle and it will be easy.  I could go on with the list of problems, but I feel as if this is one of the better RPG Maker games.\nI hope this developer puts all three episodes together for 15 dollars. As it stands this is a tech demo that tries to be a game.

I've seen how there are many negative reviews simply for the fact that this game is made from RPG Maker. This is what you would call a biased review - the "reviewer" is letting their feelings for RPG Maker-created games get in the way of seriously taking the time to actually go through the game. One reviewer I've even seen admitted to reviewing this game before playing it. Judging a game by it's cover, or anything for that matter, is never a good idea.\n\nNow, the game itself has a very unique story that includes warring human factions, were-people, robot fighters, and angels. All in the same game. That's fairly interesting in itself. JRPG's, on average, have the player grind a bit or search for powerful items just to beat some kind of boss. This is not the case for this game, mostly: although I did grind a wee bit (maybe ten battles total), this amount of grinding is rather low as far as these genre games are concerned. This helps to flow through the story better. The music isn't what you would consider outstanding, but I found the theme to be pretty good. I particularly like how the theme is implemented into major boss battles, giving them a more "adrenaline rush" kind of feel.\n\nNaturally, this game is by no means perfect (nothing is perfect). This does not mean that you, the reader, should shy away from this gem. The only complaint I can think of for this game is that it's rather short (beat it in ~5 hours). I strongly feel like there could have been a lot more story put into this first episode in the series, especially with the main character development.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this JRPG and simply can not wait until Episode 2 becomes available on Steam.","November 11, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then I have news for you: you've played this game before. It's not on your Steam library, you say? Oh, no, don't worry, it wasn't on your Steam library. This game was actually the tutorial sequence on the very first turn-based RPG you ever played. You just didn't know. You have doubts on what I'm saying? Don't worry, so do I - a Great Doubt, in fact.\n\n"Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1" is the first of a turn-based RPG trilogy developed and published by Sherman3D. Let me start off by saying that this trilogy is not yet complete! Only Episodes 1 and 2 are available at the moment, and only Episode 1 is available through Steam. If you wanted to get Episode 2, it would have to be either through the game's website[www.alphakimori.com] or somewhere else. But why am I talking about Episode 2 when I haven't even started talking about Episode 1? I'll touch back on that later, but for now, let's get to the meat of this thing.\n\nThe story of "Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1" is... umm... well, to heavily summarize: on a planet called Kimori there live two human tribes, the Bidarians (tech people) and the Jinrians (beast people), and they're at war! Your protagonist through this war will be Rick Brightheart, a young Bidarian who's more indecisive than a drunk CEO under stress! Rick is confused about a few things, such as why he should be fighting, who does he really care for, or if there's a bigger meaning behind all of this. I can't answer those questions, though, because that'd be spoilers. The other two main characters are Vanessa Avery and Yuki Furikai, though you technically don't find out about Yuki until a while later, but the trailer for this game reveals her name, so no point in hiding it. Personally, I found both Vanessa and Yuki to be more likeable than Rick, though that's subjective.\n\nNow, what's the relationship between those three characters? Well, the trailer and the game's website talks a lot about a love triangle, making you believe that romance will be a huge part of the story.  And then you play it and it's... not that much about the romance. Like, it's there, but it's not the biggest nor the most interesting aspect of the game's story. Bad advertisement on Sherman3D's side. So, what is the best part about "Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1's" story? Well, I mentioned that Rick isn't that great of a character, but I don't hate him. He starts... OK, but he does develop, and the same can be said for Vanessa and Yuki. They do have a bit of charm to them, and they'll grow on you as you keep playing. However, like the characters, the main plot - the "reality" of the war between the Bidarians and Jinrians - also takes a while to take off. The story unfortunately fails at hooking you early in the game, which results in you mostly dragging yourself through it for the first couple of hours, hoping that it'll eventually get better. Yet, it does get better, and I was actually a bit surprised by that. But still, pacing could have been done a lot better.\n\nDespite the company's name, you will not find 3D objects in this title; the game offers 16-bit styled graphics, much like classic Final Fantasy games and the sort. And in that department, it looks great! The game's colors are varied and vibrant, which is really important in keeping you at least somewhat awake during otherwise dull moments. The sprites in this game are pretty well-made, too. I was surprised to see that not only do the playable characters have custom animations, but all the enemies do as well, and they look just as good as the main cast! As far as the actual designs go, there's nothing that really blew me away, but the art-style all throughout is consistent. However, these are just the basics of graphics. As far as extra, special stuff goes, there isn't really much to talk about. There's a few particle effects here and there, none of them are noticeably impressive, and I can't seem to recall any fancy lighting effects either. Overall, I do really like the art style of the game, and I can appreciate what it does, but it doesn't do anything to put itself above the crowd.\n\nOK, let's talk about the most important part of this review - the gameplay. I am sorry to announce that this is where the game falls the shortest. Remember when I said that you've played this game before? Well, that's because "Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1's" turn-based combat system is just the absolute basics of the genre: basic attack for average mobs, "Ki Attacks" for bosses, rinse and repeat. You have no status ailments to worry about, no special attributes that only affect certain enemies, etc. You have no strategy. The game doesn't even try to spice things up a bit! In turn, the game's also ridiculously easy - and short! It took me about 6 hours to beat the game, grinding constantly mind you. And the only time I actually felt challenged was with the final boss, where the difficulty just spikes out of nowhere and I actually had to think for once - which was actually great, and it just makes you wish the rest of the game was that intense! Outside of battle it's just go here, talk to so-and-so, do what they want, go talk to blah-blah-blah, bleeeeh. Levels are nice to explore the first time, but after having to revisit one area more than three times, it gets old quick. Now, I will say that I can handle repetition pretty well, and leveling up in the game doesn't take too awfully long. But if you're impatient, I'm sorry, just... just skip this one.\n\nThere's a few songs in this game, and they're not bad, but you will hear them... over... and over... and over. You do have the option to mute the music if you get sick of it, but when muting a game's soundtrack acts as a solution to a problem, there's an issue. As far as sound effects go, I was not amused. Almost all of them are really underwhelming and don't contribute to the game's already weak immersion. I do like the main theme song for the game - "Bird" by Hatsune Miku. It's a nice little tune, I must admit. But otherwise, the sound design of this game is simply nothing special.\n\nOK, we're getting close to the end of this review, and I have to answer the big question: do I really recommend this game? Look, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle repetition and dull moments, stay far, far away. And personally, I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - I'd only buy it on sale (I got it from a Humble Bundle). But there's another issue: like I mentioned, this is supposed to be a trilogy. And again, Episode 2 is not available through Steam, while Episode 3 is nowhere to be found! If you do end up liking the game and want the sequel, you're going to have to go out of your way and get it from somewhere else, and probably end up paying more than you would with Steam sales (not to mention, Steam is just more convenient, honestly). Episode 2 was released back in 2012, so for the third episode to still be undone 3 years after just doesn't give me a good vibe. And I'm ashamed to admit it, but that's why I'm recommending this game. There is some potential with this franchise, and I want Sherman3D to do well so they can continue it and improve it. Even if it's not that good, this game does have a certain charm to it; you can tell it's a very humble product from a very humble company, and it does feel like they put their heart into developing it. I'm not too awfully fond of just Episode 1 alone, but I do want to see the Alpha Kimori franchise grow. But that's just hopeful thinking on my part. I recommend this game on sale; this game could probably benefit from a price drop, as you'd be getting a more accurate "bang for your buck" then. Even then, don't expect to be blown away by anything from "Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1."","May 9, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rilebre/recommended/265870/","rilebre","Rilebre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rilebre/","165 products in account","So I got Alpha Kimori in a recent RPG Humble Bundle, so my first point of contention is pretty irrelevant to me, but geez, this game is not worth 10 bucks. I mean, I don't want to sound cheap here, but see those 3.5 hours? I beat the game in those 3.5 hours. Yes, I understand that the game is short because it's being released episodically, but I'm pretty sure I'd have to buy episode 2 if I wanted it. Which I don't. And not because of the length.\n\nThe first blaring flaw in the game is translation. Sometimes translation issues give a game character. Other times they feel lazy. This falls into the latter. The translation is stiff at the best of times and grating at the worst. This doesn't help the fact that all the characters are stock, dusted off from the JRPG bin. The whole thing is pretty tired. Even trope characters can be interesting and fun if they're presented in an interesting way, but you're not going to get that here.\n\nAK plays as a linear jog from point A to B, with the only mix ups being thrown in are honest to god fetch quests. If you're going to send me on a fetch quest, at least try to pretend like it's something important. Rather than deliver 50 ethers to a guy with the most stilted sense of logic I've ever run across.\n\nThe battle system is boring. It's RPGMaker's stock battle system. That's it. You can attack. You can use a special attack. The main character had a whopping 4 special attacks by the time I finished.\n\nFor as much as I disliked this game, I feel like there should be more for me to complain about, but there isn't, because the game is 4 hours long. There's just nothing to it, and it's definitely not worth buying.\n\nPros: Some of the artwork is decent.\n\nCons: Poor Translation, Irritating Soundtrack, Bad plot, bad characters, boring battle system, some of the rendering on the art slides is grainy for evidently no reason, no real choices to make in a game about morality, I could probably go on but I think everyone gets it.\n\n0/5\n","December 29, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/265870/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","A short but interesting game.\n\nPresentation:\nAs you start up the game you are greated to a anime sounding soundtrack, and to be honest I did not know what to think. The style is very JRPG and I am not the biggest fan of the genre. Eventhough the presentation made me think JRPG and indie, I was very suprised by the game. It is not a game of the year ofc, but it is still a fun little titel.\n\nGameplay:\nWell it`s a turnbased attck game, you have your basic classes the warrior the mage etc. But this game is set in a future like theme, so everyone has there own abilities based on the stone in them. It`s hard to explain without spoiling the story. The gameplay is decent but get`s repetative and slow very fast. Only the story really keept me going. A big flaw for me was the short amount of grinding I needed to do, in order to become a unstoable god. This balance flaw should be fixed in my opinion.\nThere are also a few fetch quest whitch makes a lot of the gameplay whitch was not in any way interesting.\n\nCharecters:\nAll the cahrecters are pretty great. One thing I did not like was the fact that the charecters personality are really...one sided. This is not a bad thing, but this stops cahrecter develpoment and makes the charecters really boring at times.\nThe main charecter dose not belive it is ok to kill, therefore his "girlfriend" helps him out by killing the creatures he is told to. This reapets throughout th story again and again, I will talk more about this in -story-.\n\nThe main bad guy is your starting leader and he believis it is ok to kill creatures in order to go home, the main good guy belives the opersit. I will talk more about it, but as said the charecters are really one sided and stays that way throughout the story.\n\nVisuels:\nThe style is 8-bit and it suits the game for the most part. Not much to say here since the game is as short as it is.\n\nSound/Music:\nThe music is pretty great, the soundtrack remeinds me of other games from the same genre. A small problem about the music is that it loops and repeats in every area, and when you enter a new area. This can make the music a bot tiresome at times.\nNow about the sound. The speciel attack sound is pretty....loud! I needed to constantlly turn up and down my volume becouse new charecters had a highpich speciel attack. This is not a flaw, but really annoying.\n\nStory:\nThe story is as folows: humans has been removed from the earth becouse of aliens have taken over. They find another planet to live on and are split into 2 factions. The ones that want to go back to earth and the others that want to live on the new planet. These factions are at war, becouse the first faction wants to kill the ki creatures on the planet, in order to power thier powerfull robots.\n\nThe main charecter hates to kill ki creatures and his girlfriend kill for him, in order not to make himself a bad name around town, when the main charecter gets a chance to join the other faction, he goes for it.\n\nWithout spoiling to much, I can say the story is good at times, but really get`s boring at other times. The climactic ending made up for it in my opinion, but really judge for youself.\n\nConclution:\nThe game is short, a weak RPG, and gets really boring at times, still I found the game enjoyable, eventhough it has flaws, This for me was a decent game, and if you are a fan of the JRPG genre, you could give it try.","December 30, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I find the story very interesting; it's like an anime... that I can actually understand (for the most part). O-o Whaaaaa?!?!\n\nThe Earth is doomed; God manifests as spaceship Alpha; along with Seven Angels, they transport the chosen of Humanity to a safe planet. There, Man breaks into two factions: one that wishes to stay put on the new planet, one that wishes to use that planet's resources to attempt reclamation of Earth.\nYou play as a human aligned with the latter faction, though you have significant moral qualms.\n*stage is set for the game*\n\nI always read the Negative Reviews over the Positive; I won't echo further what those say, but they do seem to raise legitimate concerns.\nMy only significant problem with the game (as of now, again, not far into it - not expecting too much since I did read those Negative reviews) is the lack of any resolution options. Playing on a widescreen TV, if I go Fullscreen, the corners are cut off; if I go Windowed, I can't squint enough to see everything comfortably.\n\nPlease keep this in mind Sherman3D!!!\nI eagerly await the sequels... but... wait... *off I go to play Episode 1 some more*","December 30, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It lusts to be a better game, and while what is at its base is decent, the episodic nature that can be healthy for most forms of gaming just doesn't click with this sort of game. Just when some character development is made, the game ends, and the sequence of events leading to the "climax" feels hurried and poorly explained, leaving us with a cliffhanger of sorts that feels more like a transition than an ending to a product.\n\nTo give credit where its due, the ability to avoid most encounters thanks to their corporealLater on they make the enemies track you, which gets a bit comical once you get a good conga-line of enemies following behind you. Thankfully the battles themselves are quick and harmless, and while there is no autobattle feature, rapidly tapping enter until everything is dead seemed highly effective in every situation except boss battles.\n\nThe mythology is interesting enough, and while the core story concept seems to have some depth, we only gather so much before we are booted to the credits. For the length of the game, flashbacks occur far too often, encircling the same scene from different perspectives. While this idea could work well in a different context, the scene they use is a bit too boring, and gets further ridiculous as they show the amount of people tied into this one fairly mundane encounter. One flashback was enough for this bit, but it occurs at least 6 more times, JUST to make sure you get the picture. The heavy-handed plot is definitely worth the watch however, as I got a good chuckle once I realized what they were going for, but don't expect any real thought-provoking moments. The protagonist in particular is a classic case of insensitive prick with a harem complex, and the dissonance of "I don't want to hurt any innocent creatures" combined with him and his constantly changing female companion slaughtering thousands of said creatures is just silly, especially given that his "reluctance" is the main driving point of this first chapter.\n\nWhen it comes to pacing the game is sporadic, as the lack of fast travel has you going through the same enviornments and encounters without adding anything to pad out the repitition. It would be okay if there was a variety of locations, but almost every mission objective is a little farther than the last within the same four areas, and there are no shortcuts that are always open to you. The shortcuts they do provide are often story specific, and while they usually teleport you back to save time, they aren't always a two way street, which had me flinching every time I found out I had to go through that same forest with the stupid purple bunnies for the 10th time.\n\nUltimately, Alpha Kimori is a b-tier RPG with a lot of camp to it that keeps its charm even after it outstays its welcome. The effort is genuine, and I will honestly consider picking up the rest of the episodes once they're released, for there is something at the core of this that I can't help but admire. I enjoyed my time with it, and while my attention was mainly focused on the show I had playing in the background, I've found myself thinking about it well after finishing and I couldn't tell you why. Definitely worth the pickup if you can look past the flaws and enjoy the heart that it has.","November 30, 2014","true","9.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The Ki Skills attack did the same amount of damage as the normal attack most of the time. I used the healing skill a few times but most of the time I would lose the same amount of life with the next attack. Further is the combat slow. If you don't like that you can walk past the enemies without problems (Most of the times). Don't buy this game if you only want combat.\n\nThis game looks kinda like a visual novel: There isn't much of a game without the story. Only in a visual novel you get to choose what you want to do, in here you just go do the thing you have to do to get to the next part in the story. The battles doesn't make a change what the story will do. One of the battles I won without even getting damaged but the story said that the main character Rick (The one you play) got so much damaged that he almost couldn't get up..\n\nThey don't show you where to go, you have to find out yourself if you have to go to the school or some other place. I always got lost whenever I had to go to a new place. The first time I had to go to the school building I ended up in the Item Shop..\n\nThe walking is very slow and you can't walk till the npc are done walking. They don't have a sprinting button (Which they should add) They don't show where you can and can't walk. I bumped into stuff almost every time it was possible.\n\nI also miss a button that can lower the music. You only can mute it. And whenever I walked outside of a building the music would go louder..\n\nOnly buy this game for the story or watch someone else play this.

The monsters who fly move around rather quickly, I am using the keyboard but I still have to chase them quite abit before being able to catch them to start a battle - that is definitely annoying, I can't imagine how infuritiating it would be with using the mouse.\n\nOverall, I'd pick up this game when it's on sale.","March 28, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I can say the music is very much memorable and the mood of the game is never at a low point due to the colorfulness. However, the events were unfolding in a rather rushed manner at the start and some things made me think "this feels like something an elementary schooler would write". The characters weren't exactly weak but their development could have been handled better. I don't know anything about the development of this game but it wouldn't surprise me if this was a rather rushed job or just geared towards a younger audience in general. But on that note, Miku singing the theme song is supportive of the latter thought.\n\nHowever I did enjoy the nostalgic turn based system, though with the large stat increases between levels I never really felt challenged until the very end, and it still wasn't that much of a challenge. Then again, that may have been intentional either because of the shortness of this entry (which I do hope isn't going to end up to be the last of this title) or a desire to minimize the tediousness of level grinding as can be experienced in other JRPG's or other RPG's in general.\n\nThough as I progressed through the game it felt like things were improving, noticeably, in these areas I've mentioned. In the beginning some of the grammar and speech of the characters wasn't well written but became nearly natural closer to the end, and this is something that will be hard to miss when one plays for themself. Something about the very end of the game was rather strong, though I can't pinpoint what it was as some of the same mistakes could be spotted. I feel that the developers have the potential to do better in the next entry after seeing the end and I hope to see episode 2 in the future to see if my hopes aren't for naught.\n\nUltimately, try not to go in with high expectations like I did. This game is fun and worth the price if you're willing to get used to it as I did. It's short length (about 5 hours at my pace) was a bit of a letdown, but not crushingly so. I found myself satisfied with this game and don't regret taking the time out of my day to give it a try.","July 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

As much as i disliked the game i played the entire first episode just to see the story.  Leaves you on the worst cliffhanger wanting more.  Hopefully by the time episode 2 is released i will have forgoten the story and not care to find out.\n\nCon: Terrible game mechanics.  Leveling up just adds more life to drag the boring fights out longer.  You were so overpowered the entire game that you find yourself constantly avoiding fights and slamming the action key to do basic attack as fast as possible.  On occasion the fight took so long you had to heal.  Skills and items were worthless in a fight except for heals.  On top of that, you spend the entire game in only 3 different maps + the city.  They rehash those 3 maps so much you will be banging your head against the wall becuase you have to go back there again for the 6th time.  Everytime you run an errand you dont just go to that one map, you have to go to all 3 of them again.\n\nOtherthoughts: Just watch a good anime if you like stories.  Save you the carpal tunnel from repeatedly hitting the enter key for 10 hours.","February 22, 2015","false","7.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"
