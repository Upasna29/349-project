Its not terrible, in fact the first hour or so is fun, but definitely not worth the price. Especially once you realize that when you've seen the two types of track youve pretty much seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nSo I love ancient Rome. An ancient Rome chariot racing game is an awesome idea. It reminds me of the chariot race missions in Shadow of Rome. (A really really fun PS2 game. If you are a fan of gladiator games, get it!  And enjoy cutting people's arms off, beating them with it, then tossing it into the crowd..) But this review isnt about Shadow of Rome. Its about Qvadriga. Which unfortunately, is no where near as cool as the concept could be.\n\nNow, I wouldnt have as much of a problem with it if it wasn't 20 freakin' dollars. So what do you get for 20 dollars? A tiny-graphic boring game. I normally dont really care about graphics if the gameplay is engrossing, but this game unfortunately lacks that quality, so all you keep on thinking were damn, this would be cool if it actually had decent images of the action.\n\nSo a basic rundown. You start, and pick your faction. Different factions have different abilities that are explained in tooltips. Some are stronger, faster, can handle their chariots better. Then a map appears with different regions. There are many different regions, each with different tracks in them. Lots of tracks to run on with many random events is a giant plus, except for one issue which shall be explained later.\n\nWhen you start, you can pick one region, and each region has 1 track unlocked. Then a screen where you can look at your  charioteers, get vet services, repairs and healing, and upgrade your horses and chariots. Heres the kicker. Once you pick your first track, you cannot leave it until you get your "fame" up enough from racing. So if you pick a hard as hell track (as I did my first try), youre pretty much stuck. Pick which charioteer you want to race with, and you are off.\n\nThe graphics are really simple, a top down view of chariots on a track. Looks like tiny mobile game graphics. There are two modes, one where the action stops every 10 seconds to give a command, one where it doesnt but you still only are give a command every so often. The commands are accelerate (to a certain level, then you can't), brake, crash right/left (slam your chariot into an opponent a la ben hur), lacerate (whip an opponent), small/medium/large move left or right (each one moves you farther across the lanes), watch for attacks (basically a block) and control (basically do nothing, but it makes your control go up), and finally whip (allows your horses to get a burst of speed, but you can hurt them).\n\nThere are many different tracks to race on, some narrow, some larger. Each track has a brief paragraph about its history. Every time you race there are slighty different variables on the track, described in a simple sentence before the race. Theres lots of these, both bad and good and they provide some variety.\n\nYoure going to need it. This game is grindy as hell.\n\nSee, you get money for racing, more if you win. You use this money to buy better guys, horses and chariots. You also need to pay for vet and repairs from racing damage. Each wheel, horse, and charioteer has a life bar. Take too much damage, and a horse dies, leaving you to pull with 3. Go too fast, and your wheel gets damaged. Go too fast around a corner and you can topple your chariot, leaving your guy to be dragged by his horses. You then have the option of running (and the other guys can hit you, or hanging on till youre in a safe spot to run.\n\nThere are stats, represented by icons. The different stats ccombine to make the upgrades (say a horse with two speed icons vs a horse with 1 speed and 1 endurance - which one do you want.. The two speed will be faster but weaker than the 1 speed 1 endurance)\n\nBut theres only 6 guy types (stats: skill - how good of a driver you are, and constitution - how much damage you can take) and 9 horse types (stats: speed - top speed, and endurance - same as con but for the horse) and 9 chariot types( stats: acceleration and size, again same as con but for the chariot). And they are expensive as hell.\n\nIt also costs money to travel from track to track, and you can't race certain tracks till you get more famous. So you will probably doing the same race over and over just to get enough cash to go somewhere else.\n\nTheres two types of track, a tight oval type and a longer wider type. Except for this, there is absolutely nothing to differentiate them.\n\nA $20 game this is not. It can be fun for a little bit, and if it had some kind of multiplayer it'd be pretty fun. But as it is, its just boring after the first hour or so.","June 15, 2014","false","11.3"," 199 of 265 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","199","265","0","7"

But don't judge a game on your first impression as you wouldn't judge a book by its cover (I have a feeling you'd like books as much as I do if you've come here). This game delivers unexpected levels of tactical depth and attention to details, and truly deserves its sale price if not its full price.\n\nThe core gameplay is based on managing your speed and taking the decision to whip your horses to push them over their limits, or whip your opponents to incapacitate them, ram their chariots, cripple their horses, trample your dismounted rivals - playing it brutal is all part of the games, and the capable AI will use every trick in the book.\nCampaign-wise, racing is rewarded with denarius (the currency of the Roman Empire) to build your team with upgraded chariots, horses and skilled drivers-slaves. Good results also increase your fame which will open up the doors of more prestigious stadiums, several dozens of them available in seven provinces, up to the great Circus Maximus of Rome if you prove worthy. Completing a campaign requires about 10 hours of gameplay, more if you invest time to skill up your team of slaves and acquire the top quality chariots and horses.\n\nThe little things: random events spice up each race. Cities offer various bonuses and some historical background. A random name generator use the cultural origins of your recruits and your rivals to give them all unique names. Successful drivers get their amount of victories tracked after their name. Last but not least, you'll pick up some Latin vocabulary to impress lesser-educated nerds!

It plays like an old tabletop board game, or perhaps something from the earliest days of pc gaming. It's very well designed in terms of balance and mechanics. The problem is the price for the extremely limited amount of content this game represents. Qvadriga is an excellent $3 to $5 cell phone game, not a $20 pc game. *If* you can get it on sale, for an accurate price, then I highly recommend it, but in a world where indy games with staggering levels of content like Xenonauts and FTL are $25 and $10 respectively, charging $20 for this anemic little game is both insulting and insane.","June 17, 2014","false","11.2"," 71 of 105 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","71","105","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/297760/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?A top-down racing/strategy game based on Roman chariot racing.  The game plays in either dynamic (real-time) where you give your aurigas orders on the move, or static which plays as turn-based control over sections of the course (rather like a board game).\n\nYou start the game with three men, their chariots and horses belonging to one of 6 factions (each with its own strengths/weaknesses and a couple of extra upgrade points).  You visit the shop for repairs and upgrades, then kit out and send one team into a race at a time, allowing other teams to recover from your last folly (if you can afford the fees and repairs, that is)!\n\nWhen playing the turn-based variant, each 'turn' lasts for a highlighted section of track around the circus.  Looking at the section and the positions of your opponents, you have a choice of moves you can click (only one action is allowed per turn).  Crucially, these include speeding up or slowing down, switching lanes, taking a defensive stance or whipping, blocking or even crashing into your opponents (no-one said this was a clean fight)!  If you're playing the dynamic version the chariots never stop so you have to think fast and give orders with good timing.  What you choose is pivotal to your survival and your success.  If things go bad (and they will), your man's chariot will break up, leaving him dragging face-first in the dirt.  Do you risk everything by insisting he hangs on until the very end (after all, a finish IS a finish...) or do you tell him to run away while he still has his life?  Your escapee causes the race to be forfeit but at least your man is still alive (if he didn't get trampled...).  New men are expensive to recruit, and no racers means no more game.  You have been warned!\n\nTo keep things fresh, each circus has its own pros and cons, there are random events that help or hinder you, crowds might lob objects at you, or the debris of other casualties might just finish you off.   While it might seem that luck plays a hand, strategic moves will win the race.\n\nGameplayThe game is entirely mouse-driven and is accompanied by a decent PDF manual.  The races are simple and intuitive (all choices are displayed on screen in front of your horses and you simply click the move to be made that turn).  However, the user interface for the shop and upgrades is a little confusing (the game could really use some tooltip text help for its buttons as well as mouse-over feedback to show what can and cannot be clicked) but once you understand how to use it and how to buy the most suitable upgrades, everything is fine.\n\nLongevity and value]The game brings that level of addictiveness associated with any game where you upgrade and then progress a bit further each time to earn more upgrades.  Your campaign is lengthy and is retained between sessions so you can pick up where you left off last time.   This is no 10-minute throwaway game.\n\nThe idea is genius and it's a unique and original game.  Production quality is best described as 'functional' with no added polish (there is no fun commentary as was advertised in the video, and it lacks any graphic touches like cut-scenes of a win (or a tragedy).  This by no means affects the enjoyment of the game and will mean it can run on any level of kit, but it's sat firmly in the £15 territory where a little bit more polish is usually expected.  This is a minor gripe only as the game is otherwise excellent.  If you have doubts, there is a free demo you can download.  The game can also be bought on Android/iOS (full game with no in-app purchases).","February 9, 2015","true","7.6"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","36","48","0","0"

However the game play does get a bit repetitive as the racing part of it is really all there is.\nThe price is a bit of a factor, I feel it is quite overpriced for what it is, at best this is a $10 game but realistically a $5 one.\nThe addition of multiplayer with leader boards would have made this game epic fun and more worth the price tag.\nA bit more depth in the gameplay would have also been helpful too, such as having actual stables to train horses, riders etc. Really any game content outside of the racetrack would have been nice like using money to build your own mansion adding to your prestige level that would in turn attract more skillful riders, chariot builders things of that nature.\nIn the end it is pretty clear this is a tablet game converted to be played on pc, and the tablet version is exactly the same at a lower price so this gets a thumbs down.","June 16, 2014","false","3.9"," 53 of 82 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","53","82","0","0"

During the races you have options of shaking the reigns, whipping your horses, crashing your chariot into other players, whipping other players,  moving the horses from lane to lane and must avoid obstacles as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paralipsis/recommended/297760/","paralipsis","paralipsis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paralipsis/","504 products in account","This is neither a massive nor a complex game. Instead, it is simple, elegant, and surprisingly dramatic for a turn-based game.\n\nThe premise is that you manage a chariot racing team, from humble beginnings on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, through to fame and glory in the Circus Maximus of Rome itself. Races are broken into ten second turns. On each turn you can give a single order to your charioteer, which could be speed management, a positioning manoeuvre, offensive, or devensive action. You need to play to your strengths at any given moment, and maintain a high level of situational awareness. I was particularly impressed by the AI. It's smart, but will still make risky decisions which can make for the kind of bloody and brutal chaos one would expect from any Roman sport.\n\nWhile at its heart, there is a fairly simple press your luck mechanic (i.e. do I push the horses and risk injury, can I take a tight turn or go wide, should I protect myself or go for position, etc.), the systems are well designed to create emergent situations where finding the right balance between risky and safe is a constant learning experience.\n\nBetween races you spend your winnings on keeping your team in good order, and upgrades when you can afford them. There's not a ton of complexity to this management layer, but it is still nice when a better component to your racing team comes up for sale and you can afford it.\n\nHaving sunk over 10 hours into Qvadriga, I'm not sure I'll be dedicating a great deal more. But that was more than enough for me. I felt that the game respected my time. There was a progression, but it felt like it was far more about my skill in the game improving than it felt like I was grinding to go forward. When I got over my initial hump early in the learning curve and gained some confidence, then I was able to bet heavily on myself during most races and plough through the mid and late game relatively quickly. Even late in the piece though, random events at the start of a race (annouced before placing bets), a single bad move or dramatically unlucky roll could easily lead to a disastrous outcome in a particular race.\n\nThis is definitely not a game for everyone. The RNG can feel really harsh while you are learning the game. It's definitely possible to mitigate its effects with skill, but at least for me that skill took several hours to properly cultivate. I came close to giving up, but I'm glad I didn't, because it turned out to be well worth my time. I also felt like I had to be willing to take more lost races than I was used to in a single player game. Early on, just coming out ahead in terms of earnings to expenses is really the order of the day.\n\nMy one tip for anyone who does end up playing this game, never whip the horses while at the end of a high speed turn. Every time I did it I crashed the chariot. Even if there was just a few degrees before opening up into the straight, whipping my horses just before fully opening out into a straight was invariably a recipe for disaster. Most of the time in this game any advice will be based on relative positions between you and other racers, as well as the exact condition and abilities of your Quadriga. But in this one case though, it's a 100% bad call to attempt this kind of manoeuvre. Many a race was lost stubbornly confirming the futulity of this move.","February 17","true","13.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

I took some time to read some of the reviews and all those negative reviews are about the pricing and i personally it shouldn't be mentioned in a review at all especially on steam where the price tag of a game vary very often...\n\nAnyway let's just talk about this game...\n\nI never even thought that it could be possible for me to enjoy a turn based racing strategy game, but the devs from Turnopia proved me wrong...\n\nI actually put more hours on this game that i even expected to and those were quality hours i enjoyed playing this game. The game is kind of difficult since you can't really have a viable strategy that work 100% because there is many factor in consideration, some random events, the probability to hurt your horses so they lose some of their maxmum speed, your chariot can broke and sometime get totally destroyed and the actual skills of the pilot are all things that can influence the game result...\n\nI personally like that kind of game that are challenging and sometime even if you plan all the way a perfect strategy, anything can go wrong from one turn to the other...\n\nThere is differents race tracks that change the play style i use, some have more chariots than others and the numbers of oponent can vary from differents race on the same exact track.\n\nYou can manage your team and have up to 4 pilots, 4 chariots and 4 pack of horses that can have differents stats that influence the outcome of a race.\n\nThe options are quite limited for the management, but it's a simple game with some twist in it that make it fun to play in my opinion. If you want to play an easy game where you can win everytime without much difficulty, then i guess you should avoid this genre since the game can be frustrating some time.\n\nThe game can become repetitive after some time, but what game don't get repetitive after spending some time in it anyway?\n\nI recomend this game if you like the turn based slow paced strategy game, there is another mode called dynamic races , that is pretty much the same thing, but more fast paced and can be hard to hit the right button in the right time.

The graphics are from the 90s if not late 80s.  The game will not hold your hand - if you act stupidly, the game has no issue with punishing you.\n\nThat said, this is the best racing game I've played in a very long time.\n\nIn Qvadriga you control a team of charioteers (aurigas).  You're responsible for selecting them, buying and upgrading horses and chariots, and paying for medical care/repairs when things don't go well.  Your sponsor will give you certain advantages:  Perhaps your aurigas are tougher than average, or your horses faster.\n\nOnce you've taken care of maintenance and the like, it's time to race.  Simply put it's three times (usually) around an oval track, with rewards for finishing first, second, third, or even simply finishing.\n\nThe commands are intuitive enough once you've played a few games:  You can accelerate by shaking the reins, whip the horses (which might hurt them and lower their overall speed), pull back on the reins, change lanes, whip to the left or right to try and injure enemy drivers and horses, or ram your cart left and right for the same reason.  Action by default is turn based.  There is an option where the turns run together, simulating an RTS, but I feel it's not worth it.\n\nSince the commands are simple enough you can focus on strategy.  Whipping the horses is a great way to surge past the enemy ... but if you hurt them too badly it'll hurt their base speed and you'll be paying for a vet later.  Sometimes beating the crap out of your enemy is the answer, but that tends to slow you down.  Do you take the turns at full speed and hope you don't crack a wheel?  Or do you focus on stabilizing your chariot or even slowing down to make sure everything you make it?  Having your chariot shatter under you and being dragged is no fun.   Letting go of the reins and getting run over by an opponent is even worse.\n\nStrategies are affected by random events.  For example in a recent race my auriga was so mad at the world 'he' decided that accelerating by shaking the reins wasn't an open, and if I wanted to win I'd have to rely on the whip much more than I like.  In another event drunken spectators thought throwing trash on the outer lane of the track was great fun and several drivers got hit in the head.\n\nDon't let the graphics scare you off.  This is an intuitive racing game with good strategic potential.  Enjoy!","January 16","true","5.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Conceptually it goes back to a board game origin, but it has been quite successfully brought to the PC. The rules aren't too complex, but there is strategy in the development of the drivers, the horses and the chariot. And there is likewise a lot of tactical decision making during a race. The inclusion of random events keeps the game from getting stale.\n\nThere is also a business aspect in that doing well in races (and making smart bets!) will give you more money which allows for chariot upgrades, better horses and more qualified drivers. Also money is needed to care for injured horses and drivers and repair damaged chariots.\n\nOne of the great aspects of the game is that it can be played in small blocks of time, a race not taking more than ten minutes at a time.

However, the game itself is fun for both turn based strategy fans and fans of sports games.  The game is slow, but that's because it's turn based.  The subject matter makes a turn based approach believable.  There are also RPG elements, although simple, that gives the player a sense of progression throughout the game.  And while it's not terribly hard to beat, winning the Circus Maximus three times feels like a tremendous accomplishment.\n\nDon't be overly aggressive.  I think the AI is overly aggressive, so being more conservative is a pretty good strategy.  Prioritize your speed around the track (take turns as close to the middle as possible) before attacking other racers.  Whipping your horses will wear them out quickly and you may regret doing it at the end of the race.  Finally, learn to block.  Blocking is easy to do, but difficult to master.  The AI is really good at blocking which explains several of my second  and third place finishes.

As with most of Slitherine's game, if you are a warmonger they are excellent for the most part. Some are overblown, intentionally tedious (to make the player and fanbois "feel" smarter and deeper than they actually are). Some are restrictive for the sake of, well, stuck up intellectuals who demand a certain formula tailored to their egos as opposed to their actual "gamer prowess" and above all SERIOUSLY overpriced in total. You can look for sales though on occasion or consult Robin Hood for further advice. The company's self aborption is only matched by the items listed above in relation to Slithrerine's "Personality" as a company making almost any pruchase , no matter how much you enjoy the game itself, come with a bitter aftertaste, and waiting for the "10% off kings" to go on a decent sale would leave you on your deathbed. BUT, all that being said.\n\nThis game itself is a gem for sure, with almost no games of this nature out there it makes the choices...well...nil for the most part. The "open world" campaigns if you will/want to call them that, I prefer the term, "Career mode".., are excellent, leaving a great deal of room for immersion and personalization...certainly one of those little games you keep on your comp forever and come back to when you wish to get a little playtime in.

You effectively just need to pay for repairs as appropriate and select the squad that has the highest health. There is nothing on this side of the game that is even noteworth. Every skill is reduced to a three point scale, where you either have zero, one or two of each stat. With the racer, chariot and horses each having some skills.\nBecause there is no variance in the types of races there is no question between whether you put in the horses with higher endurance or not. You race your healthiest and highest scoring squad every single time, no question.\n\nAlso, the time played on this game is screwed up because there's a start menu that counts as the game. So that was open after I stopped playing and added way a good amount of time to my playtime.\n\nSo the game doesn't offer much on this side of the game, what does it offer in terms of racing?\nUnfortunately there isn't much here either.\nEach turn you choose between accelerating, whipping ("advance acceleration"), lane changes, stability for turning corners or some form of attack on your opposition.\nThat doesn't sound like an issue until you start to see how much of a grind that actually is. There is always a clear best decision, I think the only time there's debate of which decision is best is when choosing which attack. Unfortunately the attacks are too strong. One bad attack against you and you've almost certainly lost the race and might as well give up.\n\nI don't know what you should pay for this game. But I'd certainly be waiting for at least 70% off.","June 15, 2014","false","15.5"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","30","54","0","0"

The sounds are adequate, but nothing more.  This is a simulation and racing strategy game.  Crash your opponents?  Lash them with your whip into submission?

This is one of my "Game of the Year" picks.\n\nQvadriga is a single-player chariot racing set in the Roman Mediterranean. You choose one of seven factions to race for, and your "stable" is one of several your faction may operate in each city.  There are many cities to race in across the various provinces.  Each city offers it's own special bonus, like half-price drivers, or cheap chariot repair.\n\nEach city has it's own racing stadium, varying from 8 lanes wide to 4 lanes wide, and generally either an oval or a U shape. Your tactics have to change to reflect the number of teams racing and the width of the track - a six-team race on four lanes is very different from 8 teams on 6 lanes, and so forth.\n\nYou can have up to four teams in your stable; you start with three.  Drivers, chariots and horses each have two skills to be gained, at up to two points for each skill.  For drivers, it's constitution and driving skill; for horses, speed and endurance; and for chariots, acceleration and durability.  So there are 9 combinations for each skill, and three sets of skills, for 729 different driver/horse/chariot combinations.\n\nEach race has a special condition, given before the start, which mixes things up.  You might have corrupt Praetors drinking up some of the prize money, or fog making everyone more cautious, or two teams fighting at the start line, or even a track littered with previous race debris for the crowd's amusement.  Add to that the various chariot/driver/horse combinations and the width of the track, and each race is different and unique.\n\nYour faction gives you a set of skills to begin with.  For example, the military faction favors skillful drivers and horses with good endurance, along with heavy chariots.  Other factions have different mixes.  This provides the initial differences between teams in a race.  You must learn to adapt to your equipment and drivers - is your team going to win based on fighting other teams, or getting ahead early and holding the lead, or coming from behind in the final lap?  And bear in mind, as your gear and horses and drivers change, your tactics will have to adapt as well.\n\nOnce you are in a race, you have a number of actions you can take each turn.  You can slow or speed your horses, or really goose them by whipping.  You can change lanes (subject to someone being in the way, or your momentum in a turn) and you can crash into other teams or try to whip their driver.  Most actions, including cornering and even just driving, carry a risk of damage, which increases as you take damage through the race.  So you really have to consider every turn carefully; even if you are far in the lead coming into the last turn, one mistake can see you with a destroyed chariot being pulled along the track by your runaway horses.  Each race has it's tense moments and you can go from being on top to crashing out in an instant.\n\nOnce the race is over, you get money if you finished; more if you placed in the top three, and then if you win, you can collect your private bet if you placed one.  Your teams will need repair, rest and healing, which cost money; this is why you start with three, to let them come back to full strength over several races.  Your drivers will be ranked by victories, and as your fame climbs, you'll gain access to other cities and regions, and can compete across the empire.  Eventually, the goal is to become the leader of your faction empire-wide, and in Epic game mode, to become the most successful rider in the empire.\n\nIn short, this is a great racing game with a good deal of bloodshed and heartbreak, and more than a little historical accuracy.  It's well worth it if you like racing games and history at all.  There is nothing else like it out there.  Highly recommended.","July 13, 2014","true","2.6"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

While I might normally say go get the mobile tablet version (on which I have countless hours), this is the perfect price point for this time suck of a game and make no mistake, it's unlikely they'll slash it more.  So if you've been on the fence, pick a side now!\n\nLike the very best of games out there, it's a mechanically-simple approach to turn-based racing - chariot racing, mind you - that has clearly been inspired by similarly-themed board games of old.  Also like the very best of games out there, its simplicity belies its depth.  While races last about 5-10 minutes of real-time at most - making it the perfect pick-up-and-play game - you only have a handful of actions you can do on each turn, Qvadriga provides a tactical experience that gives you the right 'feel' of racing around in ancient Rome.\n\nUnlike the staggered starts of the Olympics, chariots will line up side-by-side or even one behind another with random start positions, leading to seemingly unfair, foregone conclusions.  However, unlike the Olympics, it's perfectly okay to kill your opponents or their horses by whipping them to death or smashing your chariot into them, which might also damage their wheels enough to throw the driver out, only to be dragged to near-certain death.  Not satisfied?  It's also perfectly okay to position yourself to block opponents, often causing them to violently smash into your backside, hurting their horses, and therefore their overall speed.  Just be mindful that what you can do to others can also be done to you.\n\nWhile there are similarities to other racers like Gallop Racer or Derby Owner's Club in that you must manage your horse's stamina during the race (too much damage and they slow down, whip 'em to make 'em go faster at the risk of hurting or killing them), the true depth of the game comes from tactically positioning yourself and upsetting your opponents to get ahead.  This will be difficult at first, but you will soon be able to second-guess the guy behind you with a pretty good degree of accuracy.  Do you try to take the inside lane and make the turn at speed, risking your chariot flipping over?  Do you hang back a little bit so you can whip your opponent from his chariot?  Do you smash your own chariot into his horses, hoping to drop his four-horse team to a three?  Or do you sacrifice the health of your own horses and whip 'em for that extra burst of speed, possibly slowing you down for the remainder of the race if you bleed them?\n\nWith single races available, the meat of the game is actually its campaign mode where the goal is to gain enough fame for your team to be invited to the Circus Maximus, the most electrifying arena in Roman entertainment where you can race for the millions (AND MILLIONS) of your team's fans.  Essentially you will start off by picking one of the available historical factions which will give you various starting bonuses, but don't worry too much about that as you will eventually replace all of your drivers, horses and chariots over time.  From there, you start racing, hoping to survive those early moments until you can make enough money to afford some good stuff.  Nothing will stop you from winning, mind you, if you've got the wherewithall to do so.  In between races, you will be able to see your team's fame on the local level (with several cities to make your name in) and on the global level.  Then you can manage your team, from pure maintenance to purchasing upgrades with your winnings which includes faster, stronger horses, higher quality and more durable chariots, and tougher and more skilled drivers.  Each stat for each component of your entry plays into your tactics for the upcoming race.  If you front a team of toughness, chances are you'll want to do your best to take out the city's top leaders (who are easily identifiable by their faction color and the number of wins they hold) whereas a faster team will be more dead set on getting a podium finish.  Finally, before each race, should you choose to do so, you can place a bet that your team will win and the payouts are tremendous if you manage to do so.  Keep it going and if you don't manage to kill all of your drivers, eventually new venues will open up to you for more glory and fame and money.\n\nOverall this is a wonderful little gem of a title and while it won't necessarily hook you with its bland visuals and minimal sound design, once you figure out its magic, you'll be drawn in wholesale.","March 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","2"

After recently giving it a shot, I have found myself a little suprised.\n\nQvadriga is a turned based chariot racing game where you use your mouse to select what you want your driver to do each turn. There is a campaign mode, where you manage a team of chariots, and a simple, single race mode. In campaign mode, you can upgrade your drivers, buy them new horses/chariots, and travel to a number of different arenas.\n\nThis game can be rough getting into with it's archaic menus and lack of a proper tutorial. I found myself really frusterated after my first couple races and almost uninstalled. It is a game that really requires a bit of patience and the will to learn through trial and error. Once you get over the learning curve and start figuring out how to tackle each course, it becomes quite enjoyable.\n\nWhile I would recommend this game, I don't think it is worth it's 19.99$ pricetag. $7.50~ seems a little more reasonable to me.","August 18, 2015","true","11.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

As others have said it can definitely get grindy.\n\nMy biggest complaint is with some of the implementation.\n\nFor instance, when your chariot gets wrecked your driver will be on his belly holding the reins - your choices are to continue to hang on or run for safety. If you run for safety your driver immediately runs towards the outside stands without any regard for his safety. Will he wait until another team goes by to clear the way? Nope - he'll run right into the side of the horses and get killed in the process. Will he run to the center if it happens when he's in an inner lane? Nope.. again, towards the outside, heedless of oncoming chariots.\n\nAs others have said, there's also very little in the way of management.\n\nI *want* to like this game.

This game is based very much on an old Roman chariot racing boardgame called Circus Maximus where you have to design your team and you then do a single race or a series of races. But this game adds more to that premise.\n\nFor one thing the game introduces factions which all have their own concentrations, some build quality chariots, some have the best drivers other have tha fastest horses, there are quite a few of these traits that are introduced in the game which makes choosing your faction quite intriguing.\n\nAnother thing the game adds is random events at the start of each race which might affect just you/someone else or everyone equally. For example you miught be prevented from whipping for the whole race which will penalise horse teams where endurance is high but speed is not. Also you might ahve a race where all the old wreackage is still on the track from the previous race making it far more deadly. Or you can be forced to start from a certain lane or have a rival in a race. These add loads of variety to each race.\n\nIt also introduces faction leaders and leaderboards where each faction leader is ranked. You may make it you strategy to assassinate your faction leader in order to get your own best driver on the leaderboard adding extra strategy to the already packed with excitement races.\n\nYou get many different authentic Roman and non-Roman race circuits from basic ones where you start off, up to the Circus Maximus, where you have to win three times to complete the game.\n\nAs for the races themselves these follow the boardgame quite closely in that you can whip horses to make them go faster for a short time but this can damage them, you can try to whip other adjacent drivers or ram them or their horses, you can get damaged travelling over wreckage, you can be dragged and trampled to death etc etc. Its all very very Ben Hur in the most ruthless way possible. Of course though there is also a racing game in here and you can just try to win races through skill and speed.\n\nThere is loads to enjoy in this game, I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised when I played it as to how much variety, strategy, and fun there is in here. Its probably one of my top twenty most favourite games of all time actually, and definitely one of the best purchases I have made over the last few years of gaming.\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\nAnd yes this concept would make a flaming wicked Nascar sort of game if converted! I remember playing  Grand Prix management game with this sort of overhead view and it was great. Someone has to make a modern racing game out of this!","June 14, 2014","true","2.4"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","28","57","0","1"

Its turn-based, which is something I really love and totally think there is a niche market for. The execution and final product leave something to be desired, though.\n\nPros:\n+A turn-based roguelike racer is an awesome idea.\n+The historic setting could be cool with the right details and execution.\n\nCons:\n-The whole program feels clunky, with awkward and bland textures and colors.\n-The nomenclature is confusing, and can turn new players off.\n-Overall, its fairly slow - sometimes to the point of being boring.\n-The asking price is outrageous.\n-The tutorial is wayyy too text-heavy, when it could just show you instead of having you read single-spaced text blocks. I don't mind reading, but the presentation will give you a headache.\n\nIts probably worth a go for less than five bucks.

And, what's just as important, there's a clean interface that helps avoid struggling with them. You learn the basics and you're off, and then you have quite a gentle learning curve until becoming a master charioteer.\n\nOnce you're a bit more accustomed to the game, there's a pleasant semi-trance state that you can fall into during the races. It's good and bad at the same time. While there still are decisions to make, you've probably encountered similar situations before and know a good way out of them. After you've reached this point it is nice to zoom out and see the chariots go, and admire how believable their movements seem.\n\nUnfortunately there's not much else to do outside of that. The campaign is very welcome if a bit barebones, but in the end it becomes a comfort game that you can Alt+Tab to and run a race or two to before getting back to work.\n\nI do hope the developers use the great design in place for a more ambitious game, be it historical, fantasy or any other kind of racing. It simply needs more content and variety to mix things up a bit.\n\nWhat is there is very well balanced and thought-out, though, and is definitely preferable to a chaotic mixture of bits and pieces that don't really gel together or a feature creep that tends to plague other games. Nevertheless, in the end you are left wanting more.","December 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The graphics and sound are purely functional, but they do serve their purpose.  I always play in turn-based mode, and the fun comes from analyzing your situation during each of your turns and trying to choose the optimal action to improve your situation.  These actions include things like: Do I flog my horses for a brief burst of speed now at the cost of horse endurance?  Do I flog my oponent and risk losing my whip, or crash my chariot into him and risk becoming stunned?  What's the closest lane that I can safely take a turn and set myself up nicely afterwards?  And so on.\n\nIf you enjoy lite strategy, you will probably find some enjoyment here.  But it is lite and probably best enjoyed in small doses.  Doing pre-race team management and completing a single race probably takes about five to ten minutes.  You will be frustrated when things randomly go wrong, but also elated when you round that last corner a bit too fast, overturn your chariot and grin as your driver is able to endure long enough to be dragged over the finish line, winning you the race.\n\nHowever, the price seems a bit steep.  At $10 I could wholeheartedly recommend buying it, but at $20, you might want to wait for a sale if you're on the fence about it.  Matrixgames has a demo on their website, and you might want to watch a "Let's Play" video to see the game in action.","January 16, 2015","true","18.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

There is a lot of strategy involved. The learning curve is pretty steep, but as you get the hang of it, you really get sucked in. Usually set backs are not game breaking. On my first play through, I lost my drivers and chariots quickly, and could not recover, but only because I didn't know what I was doing. I went back, looked over the tutorial, started a new game, was more careful this time, and I've been having a great campaign. I've had my set backs still, but always have recovered from them and surged to new levels despite them. A word to the wise: don't imagine this is a game you can easily win on your first race. You will have to work hard for each victory. But they are all the more rewarding when they come.\n\nYou will also quickly develop rivalries with other teams' charioteers (called auriga in the game). Currently, I've got a very heated rivalry going with a fellow named Alpheaus. After he took out two of my horses and almost killed an auriga at the very start of a race, I've had it out for him ever since. And he likes gunning for me, too. Makes the races very interesting when he's around.\n\nIn response to critics who say there are only two types of track: first of all, each type has many variations within. Some are longer, some are shorter, some are wider, some are thinner. No two tracks are exactly the same, and each one has unique strategies required to be successful. Second, in ancient Rome this is exactly how it was. Two types of track (Greek style and Roman style), but with variations all over the place. Each race also will have a random event at the start, sometimes good, sometimes bad, to add to the variation. There's also different combinations of auriga skills, chariot types, and horse quality.\n\nIn total, this is a great game. I think it is worth $20. But if you can pick it up on sale, that's always good, too. I give it a 9/10.","July 5, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Be warned however, it's a time sink, this game will grab your interest and won't let go. You manage a stable of up to 4 aurigas (charioteers) and enter them in chariot races around the Roman empire. The campaign mode is great, and ends only once you accomplish 3 wins at the Circus Maximus, which is easier said than done. You are then scored based on how well you've done up to this point. If you want a greater challenge, then tackle the Epic Campaign.\n\nYou start the game by picking which faction (color) you want to represent. Each has a set of three attributes it values over others, and will determine the way you play the game. Your aurigas (charioteers) have two attributes, Skill and Constitution, your chariots' two attributes are Quality and Size, while the horses are rated by Speed and Endurance. You must pick a faction that fits your play style. If you want to be aggressive, then pick a faction that focuses on Size, while if you prefer to stick to the innermost lane and outpace the other charioteers, then pick a faction that focuses on Skill.

It is unique (ancient Roman chariot racing - nuff said ^^), very tactical and contains a LOT of diversity. The game comes with six different factions you can select to play with alongside the upgrades to horses, qvadrigas (chariots) and aurigas (drivers), it has a huge selection of tracks to race on (over 40) you have to unlock by gaining fame and the AI is quite challenging in actual fact.\n\nThere is little in the way of luck that will determine the outcome of a race but your choices during the three (sometimes four) rounds that will either make or break your guys, steeds and chariots. To me, it's a little gem out there and I really like to see the game out here on Steam finally so it may get the attention it deserves. Don't shy away from the admittably blant 2D graphics, this game is a must-have if you like a unique, tactical challenge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoostus/recommended/297760/","hoostus","justus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoostus/","137 products in account","As many other negative reviews note: this is an interesting concept that becomes repetitive all too quickly. I first heard about Qvadriga via Rock, Paper, Shotgun that called it the Best Racing Game of 2014. I find my tastes often align with RPS so I was looking forward to trying this out.\n\nQvadriga is a one-man effort from Daniel Soria at Turnopia games, "a humble attempt to achieve the ideal of turn based games". He delivers a relatively unique concept in his chariot-racing game: your charioteer has a pretty decent chance of dying. And there's often not much you can do about it. You're often at the mercy of the RNG. In many ways it feels like a rogue-like. I finished 37 races in my (unfinished) campaign. I came in first on about 33% of them. I had 8 charioteers get killed in the line of duty.\n\nIf you embrace that, it means you sometimes are rewarded with more interesting stories than most racing games will give you. Let me tell you about the time that my top-ranked charioteer had his chariot disintegrate underneath him rounding the corner on the final stretch; he was in first place and rather than lose, let his horses drag him the last stretch across the finish line. Or the time my rookie charioteer gambled it all on a risky inner-lane turn to take first place. Or the time, just seconds after the race started, my #1 charioteer got whipped, stunned, and then was whipped to death before the first turn!\n\nUnfortunately, moments like those -- great as they are -- don't make up for the short comings. There seems to be no relationship between "famous charioteers" and their skills in the races. I consistently beat the globally famous guys with 16 wins....and lose out to some no-name guy in the backwaters of Syria. The game seems to level-up your competitors so they are always approximately the same skill as you.\n\nDespite playing for hours, I never once had a charioteer level up. The game gives some indications it is possible but I never saw it happen. That lack of progression contributes to the sense of sameness. I went from Hispania to Gaul to Italy to Macedonia to Syria and the races felt the same no matter where I was. There are a few varieties in track (some are narrow with just 4 chariots, some are wide with 12 chariots) but that's about it.\n\nThe "sports management sim" part of the game is pretty thin, as is the campaign. If these were better developed it might make up for the repetition and randomness/lack of skill of the races themselves. I quickly amassed more money than I knew what do with (80,000 denarii and nothing much to spend it on) and often spent it travelling the world just to see if anything was different anywhere.\n\nThe core racing is fun but just doesn't offer enough variety. You also have to accept that some races are unwinnable through no fault of your own. If you start out in the middle of a pack of 12, and get lashed by a neighbor, you're going to have difficulty placing. Likewise, sometimes you'll get a random event -- like the one where your charioteer gets bribed to brake after the first turn -- that makes it hard to come out on top.\n\nThose aren't the end of the world, since the game does give you a kind of rogue-like feeling of failure being okay. But it often made me feel like success and failure wasn't really up to me or my tactics. I won around 1/3 of my races but in 1/4 of my races I didn't place in the top three and I had essentially the same team the whole time. (Sure, I went through various charioteers but their stats were all similar.)\n\nThere's a lot of potential here but as-is, the novelty wore off for me after a few hours. I'm glad I picked it up on sale and only paid $5, so I feel like I got decent value from the game.","February 27","false","5.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

I get the distinct feeling that it was inspired by it, and it's taken that as it's base and then developed from there, iterating on it and improving and extending on that for the computer and tablet platforms.\n\nYou take on the role of a manager of a Chariot stable, home of anything up to four Aurigas (Charioteers) and their associated Chariots and Horses. Before each race you'll get a chance to manage your stables, purchase specialised repairs if necessary for your stable, and make bets on your charioteer if you feel confident enough that he'll win.\n\nAdditionally in the campaign mode you'll be racing around the empire of Rome, building up reputation in smaller venues at first and buying and selling progressively more skilled and expensive items for your stable, eventually working your way into the Circus Maximus itself. The campaign comes in normal and epic mode, depending on how much of a challenge you're up for.\n\nChariot racing can be a horrible sport!\nStatic turns are the way to go, allowing you plenty of time to assess the field and figure out your next move, you've a slew of options to control speed (Hint, you want to go fast, it's a race you know), to move across the various "tracks", the inside tracks are narrower and afford tighter turns but you'll need to take them slower unless you want to wreck the chariot and end up with a dead rider.\n\nThe outer tracks mean more distance but you can maintain that speed, this means there's a clear risk and reward involved in working out the optimal place to be on each turn, particularly in the early stages when the field is packed, and you really, really don't want to wind up fighting with another charioteer.\n\nWhipping boys...\nCombat happens as well, there's two options, lacerate (which means using your whip to whack at the horses and the rider, it's more frequent, but less damaging) and crash, which will hurt far more, but can only be done once or twice per turn. Needless to say, the better chariots come with wheel blades, making Crash a far more temping option, especially when a well timed crash will either shred the poor horse to pieces or the wheel on the cart, instantly taking out the rider.\n\nThere is also a "watch" option to avoid an attack if you expect one to happen, and a "control" option to better ensure stability if you think you're coming into a turn too fast. There's a lot of control here, and turn by turn as the race unfolds, you'll be required to continually think and re-adjust as you're going along. A few tutorial races will help you get into the swing of things.\n\nIt's a bit dusty to look at though...\nWhilst the various events can impose weather effects which do show up in game, a nice touch, graphically the best way I can phrase this is as "Vanilla", along with the sound and music, it's functional and decent. But it's not exactly going to amaze or thrill. One problem I had was that the unity engine used (4.3) kept failing and crashing until I performed the D3D9.DLL fix (Payday2 vets will know what that implies), if you're getting unity failover errors, this is definitely the first thing to look at. It seems that the Unity engine is a bit finnicky. Worth examining if it's a problem.\n\nQuietly addictive...\nFunctional presentation aside, this is a really, really good game. It's one for strategy buffs though, don't expect heart pounding action, but if you like the concept of a thinking Roman's race through the Circuses. And managing your Chariots and building up an excellent stable whilst gambling those coins to help keep you afloat whilst hoping that your Chariot's wheel stays on for this one last lap... well, this one definitely gets the thumbs up.\n\nVerdict An easy sell to Strategy buffs, especially fans of Slitherine games. Wishlist it if you're not sure though and ask a friend who has it to discuss during a free evening.","May 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","12","31","2","2"

Smart design, smart gameplay, loaded fast and runs perfect. It could use some fleshing out of the gameplay, but that may come. The size of the gameworld, the number of tracks and the current details concerning the riders and the factions, all seem to be a preparation for a larger game.","June 15, 2014","true","14.2"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"
