"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/303430/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Wow, Roundabout is one of the most casual, fun experiences of the last few months, maybe even years. Don’t go and expect a deep game, because Roundabout doesn’t take itself seriously, not even for one moment, and that’s its biggest appeal and the reason why it is such fun. This is one of the reasons that I play games.\n\nIf you take a second to look at the screenshots you might think you’re dealing with a Crazy Taxi clone here, only shown from an isometric perspective. But I’m glad to say that you couldn’t be more wrong. In Roundabout you control a limousine (driven by a female driver named Georgio Manos) that spins around. Always and all the time. This makes navigating through the streets damn hard, but oh so much fun. And it’s the essence of Roundabout.\nYou’ll die frequently while playing this (not literally), especially later in the game when there are even more objects to avoid. Dying doesn’t really have a penalty; you just spawn at a checkpoint. The checkpoint system could’ve been implemented at bit better, because sometimes you spawn very close to where you died and sometimes the game takes you more than a few steps back. This is random; I had times where I would die at the same spot and respawn at totally different places. Small annoyance, but nothing frustrating and it certainly didn’t make the game any less fun.\nThere’s lots of stuff to do in the city/world of Roundabout, but your main objective is to pick up passengers and bring them to a specific location. Along the way you can pick up coins that will increase your multiplier. Bring your customer to their location unharmed (well, the limousine shouldn’t be destroyed is what it actually means) and you’ll earn a nice amount of money in return. But hit something along the way and the combo is lost. You can also stand still if you think you’re about to hit something and that way bank the combo instead. The money can be used to buy cosmetic things like a different limousine skin, hats (for on your limousine) or horns. Or you can buy some properties that will eventually make you more money to buy even more stuff.\nContrary to what you would expect is that Roundabout is an open world game. Meaning you can go anywhere you please and take on any job you want. There’s no set order. Discovering the world at your own pace makes the game so much better. Whenever you’re not taking on missions you can drive around and find hidden collectibles, do some challenges, find more cash, try to complete challenges in order to unlock more power-ups, buy properties and even perform crazy jumps  (yes, you get the ability to jump after a little while). And this brings me to the power-ups that you can equip, but bear in mind that most of these have to be unlocked by completing a certain objective, like running over 2500 people, or hitting a certain amount of traffic cones. But anyway, you can eventually unlock a boat to drive over water, a tool to make your limousine smaller or a weapon that shoots traffic cones. There are more power-ups to unlock and they’re usually quite handy. So it’s only logical that you have to work a little for it. During your first playthrough you’ll probably use the slow motion power-up the most. It does exactly what it says and it allows you to drive easier on busy roads.\nMissions can be finished in one way, but each mission has a set of objectives that range from ‘don’t hit anything’ or ‘don’t explode’ to ‘collect every coin’ and ‘don’t use power-ups’.  Completing these objectives affect the rating you’ll get at the end of each mission. If you want to 100% the game you have to complete all of them. Some are relatively easy and some are harder than you might think.\nEach mission starts and ends with a FMV movie, and sometimes one is triggered halfway through a mission, or at a checkpoint. Okay, so it’s basically quite random.\nThe actors and actresses in these little clips are terrible at acting, but they do this intentionally. These could be people randomly picked up from the streets, I don’t know. It’s so cheesy and corny that at the same time it’s also very funny. And some of these spoken lines (actors and narrator) really are funny. The movies give the game an identity of its own, which is a smart thing to do when you start a new IP like this.\n\nThe graphics are cartoony and use a lot of bright colors. Textures are sharp but not extremely detailed and the engine runs at a solid 60fps. There is a bit of stutter when the FMVs start though, but this doesn’t happen all the time fortunately.\nThe voice acting is cheesy and mediocre, but as I said, this was done on purpose. Same goes for the acting. The sound effects are relatively basic with people screaming, cars crashing and explosions. No big effects here. The music has a 70s funky/soul vibe to it and this is exactly the vibe the game is aiming for, since it’s set in the 70s.\n\nUnfortunately this isn’t a very long game and if you speedrun through it I guess it could be completed within 90 minutes. But you’ll probably just enjoy the story and if you take your time, occasionally going out of your way to collect and buy stuff, then this game could easily take you 4 hours or more. I finished the game around 40% (about 4 hours of playtime), so 10 hours total playtime would be a fair guess if you ask me. Considering the price of the game this is more than enough content. And there are still the standalone challenges that you can play to earn a place on the Leaderboards.\n\nRoundabout is nothing short of excellent. I had an amazing time with and I wish it was longer, with even more missions to complete. It’s become an insanely fun game meant for young and old gamers alike and you owe it to yourself to buy (and play) this. You won’t be disappointed, believe me.\nNow, where’s my approval stamp ?\n\n[Rating: 83/100]","September 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 118 of 134 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","118","134","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/303430/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Most of us have been gaming a super long time by now, and anyone who's been around can tell that ideas are slowly running dry. Innovation is something more or less absent from the game industry as we see the market pump out bland shooters, uninspired retro platformers, Diablo-likes, or roguelike-likes sticking with elements they know sell while struggling to find ideas that haven't been exhausted already. Every great once and awhile a game comes a long and changes everything capturing the hearts of players everywhere by simply presenting us with a mechanic so strange and simple yet is an absolute blast to play. A game that makes the player stop and ask "Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?"\n\nRoundabout is unlike any other game I've played, utilizing a concept more original since the world was graced with the likes of Katamari Damacy and its genre bending gameplay and definitely channeling that same spirit of creativity and imagination. The humorous 70's B-movie story of Georgios' epic rise to becoming the worlds most famous rotating limousine driver is told through the campaigns many quick narrative driven missions. Each twist of the story brings you to different locations on the map, with key events being triggered by large yellow exclamation points that are just as tricky to get to as the missions are to complete.\n\nFor such an out there and crazy concept Roundabout works incredibly well and plays like a dream with the swift and responsive controls of a rotating object through maze-like obstacles that is slightly reminiscent of the offbeat classic Kurukuru Kururin which spent more time in my GBA than probably any other game available for the system. Roundabout takes this concept of quick wit and extreme navigational skill to the next level, applying the quirky but obsessively fun sport of spinning to a GTA style sandbox world with an impressive map that you are free to explore at your leisure.\n\nDon't feel like continuing the campaign? Tackle some side missions or test your skill against the world with some speedruns. Don't feel like pushing your rotating skills to the test and just want to relax? Take a spin around town and use your hard earned cash to buy various property, upgrades, and cosmetics in the form of hats and new horns! The choice is really yours, Roundabout is a sandbox with tons of possibilities offering open ended explorative gameplay that anyone can hop right into.\n\nYou'll spin your way through bright and sunny suburbs, crowded streets of the city, all the way to the snowy outskirts of the countryside all in a hilarious and dramatic journey to face down your ultimate rival and take back the title as the best spinning driver around. Finding your way to events is almost as much fun as the events themselves as you fight to go with the flow and use the rotation in your favor, bumping and crashing into everything in the process. You'll be whipping around in circles bringing your colorful cast of customers to their designated drop-off points in the fastest possible time like some sort of tweaked out Crazy Taxi.. Crazy Limo?\n\nRoundabout has a seriously great sense of humor and tells its B-movie story in the best way possible; FMVs. Those not familiar with the long lost form of pop-culture might find this aspect of the game to be cringe-worthy, but as an old school fan of the likes of Tex Murphy, Bad Mojo, and Night Trap the style satisfies every nostalgic craving perfectly and even exceeded all of my expectations of what sort of imagery campy yet memorable FMVs are capable of.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of FMVs to fall in love with Roundabout, though. It's a game that bursts with a style of its own, a game by people with a great sense of humor targeted towards those who don't take themselves too seriously. Its addictive and accessible obstacle course rotating action set to only the grooviest of tunes and the spiffiest of visuals. Roundabout comes from a history of quality game making, and has nothing but love put into its collaboration, making this one hell of an entertaining trip","September 24, 2014","true","16.0"," 72 of 85 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","72","85","0","6"

Causing mayhem on the streets comes naturally when trying to maneuver a car that never stops spinning. Inspired by games such as Kuru Kuru Kururin, controls are responsive, yet actually controlling where you drive is challenging.\nOne can play through the main story fairly quickly, yet that is only part of the game. Numerous fun challenges await, there are collectibles en masse to be found, and a good amount of customizations to be unlocked. As a finishing touch, there's several goofy extra options, such as the Roundabutt mode.\n\nIf you are looking for a unique gameplay experience, and enjoy indie games that take themselves seriously, but have a lot of fun while doing so, Roundabout might just be your kind of game.

You play as a limosine driver that revolves, as you pick up a cast of strange characters and drive them throughout the city of Roundabout.

The levels and challenges may have your head spinning at first, but donut panic, as with time comes mastery and soon you’ll be running rings around the missions that once left you eating dust. Once you feel you’ve got the basics down, there’s plenty more to keep your engine running, like a fully fleshed out e-sports mode hosted by a fleshless commentator. You’ll have to spin to win if you want to dethrone the speed kings, no bones about it. And of course there are a whole host of varied power-ups and vanity items to put a brand new spin on your trusty limousine.\n\nYes, there’s no end to the fun you can have in Roundabout, so what are you waiting for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/303430/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Depending on how you feel about FMV, Roundabout will be either one of the best or most cringe worthy games you ever play.\n\nIt's a master of the sort of low budget, 70's nonsensical cheese that's so absolutely horrible in every way that it becomes hilarious despite itself, and Roundabout leverages this against a goofy mechanic to keep it from ever becoming too much to handle. As professional limousine chauffeur Georgio Manos, you must navigate the streets of Roundabout City, picking up passengers, battling the bad guys, and taking special unicorn "medicine" to make sure you stay the absolute best driver in the business!\n\nBut what sets Georgio apart, you ask? Her constantly revolving limo of course! With it she can traverse the windiest roads, the highest roof tops, and the most populated beaches twisting and turning around obstacles (and only killing a few thousand innocent bystanders in the process).\n\nIt's legitimately absurd, yet the act of driving a continually rotating car around these sandbox levels is surprisingly satisfying once you get a hang of the confusion, and provides a level of controlled hilarity as you attempt to navigate some of more maze like environments and inevitably wind up crashing into things along the way. The lack of any penalties for completely wrecking your car keeps the frustration away, and the game simply becomes a lot of goofy fun as you drive/crash your way through the surprisingly large environments collecting all manor of limo swag and miscellaneous stacks of money left lying around as you go from one crazy mission to the next.\n\nWhat really makes Roundabout so great though is the sheer ridiculous of its FMV cutscenes, which are so incessantly outrageous and over the top that it's hard not to laugh and groan  at them in equal measure. There's a look and feel to them all that's almost like watching your friend's bad homemade movie, laughing at all the wrong places and loving it for the wrong reasons. Only in this instance Roundabout it in on the joke and laughing right along with you.\n\nIf there was anything I could say against Roundabout (aside from the disappointing performance issues that will hopefully be fixed in a patch), is that once you get through the FMV in about 3 hours, the novelty of a rotating limo has all but entirely worn off and there's really little more for you to go back to. It's a great ride if you can appreciate it for what it is, but even as someone who greatly enjoyed it the ticket price still seems a tad higher than it maybe ought to be. If by chance you actually have an aversion to FMV and B-movie stupidity, I'd be surprised if you come away from Roudabout with anything but a confused look on your face, wondering what you just witnessed and why I'm raving about it.\n\nTo that I say, phooey on you!\n\nFull disclosure: Roundabout was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

The B-Movie style of cutscenes with atrocious acting, awful script-writing and all sorts of other 'mistakes' are worth quite a few laughs, while the gameplay of your constantly rotating limousine is tricky, challenging and save for a few instances where you'll call foul, bizarrely entertaining.\n\nEnough time has been spent harping on the nature of Roundabout's live-action cutscenes with the comedy that it brings, so I'll merely be parroting the good points regarding the humor, acting and production quality that is all borked on purpose, which is what makes it so enjoyable (I swear, they use the same damn briefcase three or four times for different characters!). What isn't as mentioned as often is how smart Roundabout's humor is, where unlike Swery65's recent work, they're not trying too hard, reaching for jokes or bizarre moments to really try and elicit a laugh out of you when it just clearly won't work. An actress looking directly at the camera, children doing their worst (see: best) cheer for excitement, a rich man who calls just about everyone Jeeves while making rotation-based puns, there aren't many outright punchlines in Roundabout (at least as I can remember), so the numerous laughs I had came from the sheer ridiculous nature of the passengers Georgio (which is a woman's name???) picks up during her time as a rotating chauffeur. Cutscenes don't overstay their welcome even if they pop up during a mission, generally staying under one or two minutes to not keep you too long from the gameplay. The actors come in, get the point or plot (yes, they try to tell a story in this game) across, try and get a chuckle from you, and then get on with it, not pulling a Family Guy and jabbing a gag at you until the writer's get bored or you turn it off. At worst it makes the game quite amusing and at best it makes you want to press on to see which weirdo hops into the back seat next and what their deal is (and to see if they'll say 'Let's go, Georgio!' which makes me want a t-shirt of that line).\n\nYou're no doubt well-aware that you drive a rotating limousine in the game, and if you wondered if controlling such a vehicle is weird, it is... At first, that is. The entire map of the game is designed in such a way to prey upon your constantly spinning ways, but your rotation is done automatically; all you have to do is steer your ride and avoid smashing into everything along the way. Controlling your limo is nice and responsive (you'll quickly get a feel for the controls within a short amount of time) though it's far from a supercar, so changing direction instantly won't be happening which will result in bashing into a few obstacles here and there, and taking enough damage will result in a violent explosion killing you and your passenger - But you'll respawn at the last checkpoint in order to try again. Death is only a minor setback in Roundabout, where you're only penalized with lost time and not being able to get a 100% rating on your current mission. Later on you'll be able to cause your limo to jump (among other changeable upgrades), allowing you to access rooftops and other areas in order to pick up extra horns to sound off with, multipliers for your score by collecting coins and murdering civilians in cold, unpunished blood, or cash in order to purchase property for more money collection, paint jobs or hats for your vehicle. If you're not playing Roundabout for the comedy, you'll be playing it for the various elements of being a collect-a-thon (the Sick Jump tokens hidden away, cash stacks, horn unlocks), a completionist (acing every mission's objectives which isn't the easiest thing ever), a competitor (there are various challenges and mini-games with leaderboard support for your friends or the top spot), or just going through the main story which is fun all on its own.\n\n\nThe only major complaints I have about the game is that when you're required to push objects with your limo, it can get a little squirrely and annoying with the floaty physics, but these moments are far and few between. While the map is designed both for and against your rotating ways, finding yourself between two obstacles within close proximity can mean that nudging one will make you change rotation direction and nudge the other in quick succession, not giving you much time to recover and taking a death in the process. In most cases like this you can find an alternate, less tightly squeezed route, so you'd be actively putting yourself into challenging little moments like that. The final big issue I have is that trying to slip down cliffs or hills that specifically aren't made for your limo to drive on will result in death nine times out of ten. What happens is that your vehicle will bump against the geometry of the slope which will count as crashing into something, which will result in a few seconds of erratic twitching followed by an explosion before you can drive back onto solid, flat ground. Again, you'd be putting yourself into an instance like this, but the ensuing twitching of your limo before the kaboom makes it seem like the collision on slopes wasn't quite polished out.\n\nRoundabout rides that line of comedy and gameplay incredibly well, being funny while also handling and playing well and having plenty to do for various forms of completion. Your replayability will stem from your desire to reign over the challenge leaderboards or to get 100% on absolutely everything or to simply just play through the story again and encounter all the bizarre people hitching a ride in the back of Georgio's limousine and how they interact with our silent protagonist. Once you get past just how utterly silly the game is, you have a very enjoyable, fun time on your hands - All while spinning on and on and on and on...","October 10, 2014","true","2.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/303430/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Roundabout is a strange game in where you take control of a spinning limousine and must try to take customers to their destination without the both of you dying in a fiery explosion. That is easier said than done, as the city of Roundabout is filled with people equally as crazy as you and will happily ram into you if you don't get out of the way in time. Your limousine can never stop spinning or even change which direction you are spinning so that makes navigating anywhere trickier than you might expect. It sounds difficult and it is, however there is no way to lose a mission, if you blow up you will respawn nearby and are able to try as many times as you want. If you are a competitive gamer every mission has a leaderboard to take on, though if you are not there is only one reason to even try and that is the money multiplier. It is a system that rewards you for not crashing and at the same time causing as much mayhem as possible while collecting coins scattered about.\n\nWhat is interesting about Roundabout is that it’s an open world game and you are able to explore wherever you please outside of missions. There are three surprisingly large maps to explore and are filled to the brim with collectibles like hidden money stashes, car horns and “sick jump” icons that reward you for reaching them. Early on in the game you earn the ability to make your limousine jump and are encouraged to leap from rooftop to rooftop, adding a lot more fun and variety to the game. With the money you have earned you can purchase real estate around the town, allowing you to take your share of the money they make. You have to personally travel to each of your buildings to collect your share and if you don't, the money from you share doesn't stack, meaning that you have to collect your money or that business won't make you any more profit. Even though it's open world there are still obstacles that can kill you everywhere and if you die while outside of a mission you will be teleported to a nearby mechanic shop. That can lead to you trying to make your way across the city only to die and respawn from where you started until you manage to get across. With how large the maps are, some form of fast travel would have been nice.\n\nEnvironments are colorful and full of activity, like rabbits, fairs and pedestrians to run over Carmageddon style. There is plenty to see in the world of Roundabout from shopping malls to explore or great snowing mountains. Pedestrians scream and flee from the spinning limousine of death and make a satisfying splashing noise. There is plenty of blood and you are rewarded with cold hard cash to mow them over. If that bothers you there is an option to turn off violence and another one that makes the pedestrians scream gleeful things and giggle, which somehow makes the whole thing creepier to be honest. There are multiple other things to mess around with in the options menu like big head mode or changing the game to nighttime and it's all great fun. One minor nitpick is that you must exit your game and go into the main menu to activate or deactivate whatever options you want. It is a very cheesy and tongue in cheek game with a crazy world to suit. You can jump over planes, visit shopping malls and replay any previous missions for a shot at a better rank on the leaderboards. There are no graphic options so you may want to try the demo beforehand to make sure you can run it.\n\nKudos for having a demo on PC, which has become far too rare on the platform. Your limousine can be customized by going to a mechanic shop with a purple wrench icon, where you are able to purchase preset color schemes and hats for your limousine. Yes those hats, this is a weird game as you are no doubt aware by now. They are rather pricey however and there is a decent amount to buy, so it will take you a while to buy all there is to purchase. Side missions are blue stars on the map that have you bouncing a soccer ball on your spinning limo, avoiding cars falling from the sky and destroying police cars chasing you. They are all great fun that also include leaderboards, though they do repeat the same ideas, only in different areas of the map. By doing certain objectives like running over a certain number of people you can earn powers for your limousine that include driving on water or shrinking your limo to fit into tighter places. This game is constantly surprising you with its insane gameplay ideas and you truly never know what to expect next.\n\nSpeaking of Roundabout being an odd game, all the missions have a cheesy FMV cutscene of whatever customer you pick up in the mission. Our protagonist Georgio Manos is a mute driver that started the idea of a spinning form of transportation that really took off somehow. From children to billionaires, you will have all type of wacky customers that don't seem to mind that you run down dozens of pedestrians on your way there. The same actors are used in some situations but the tongue in cheek approach they take to that issue only serves to make it funnier. Eventually you meet a girl that is seduced by your awkward, wordless stares and becomes your love interest and the driving force of the story. It's not an interesting story by any means but it will have you laughing all the way through. The music in this game has a 70's disco vibe and while not outstanding it fits in very well to the world around it. Roundabout is a very creative Indie game in a sea of 2D platformers and RPG Maker titles. While rather on the short side if you are not into collecting everything in sight, it had me constantly thinking “wtf” and grinning like a doofus the whole way through.","November 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/303430/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Roundabout is something relatively new in the indie game sphere, offering crazy gameplay combined with silly FMV cutscenes. You'll take role of Georgio Manos (Kate Welch) who just got her licence to drive a limo... in a new way (because normal driving is too mainstream).\n\nGameplay is all about driving a limo that's constantly spinning. I hope you haven't even expected some realistic play, because there isn't any - it's made to be entertaining and hard by its own way. You don't control the car from the position of the driver, you just choose the direction it should drive. That doesn't mean it's easy, it's actually pretty hard, the game will lead you to many puzzling situations where you'll have to use proper timing for all driving. To help that, you can use several skills like time slow down.\n\nWhile the story is linear, between mission it's all about your driving in the open world (cities). Mission selection is based on driving (well, spinning) to specific place - that usually makes you stop at many places nearby, doing side missions and challenges.\n\nWhat's outstanding, are the cutscenes. They are made in 70s style with a lot of silly and funny dialogues, it doesn't even take itself much seriously. And neither you will take it seriously, considering there's nothing normal in the game - all you'll do is watching great cutscenes, spinning through the checkpoints, running over people and jumping.\n\nAnd that's what, in the end, made me disappointed. While I love the acting and whole sillyness, after about half an hour the gameplay feels too much boring and frustrating. I'd like to see this gameplay in some other (bigger) game as a funny minigame but building around this mechanism a whole game isn't something I could appreciate.\n\nWhat's also a big disappointment is the length of the game. If you won't hunt for highscores and achievements, you can expect less than 3 hours of gameplay. (I haven't finished it as I asked for refund, but you can check other reviews and howlongtobeat for this piece of information.)\n\nSome people might be surprised by the hardware requirements in compare to other casual games. I haven't got much performance problems overall but there were places with bigger amount of light effects which sucked most of my FPS (and it couldn't get turned off in the settings).\n\nI understand why so many people like this game, though I haven't got the same impression. I feel like I would rather watch all those cutscenes made into a silly "Roundabout: The Movie" than to play it with gameplay that spins me round and round... which is not entertaining for a long time.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 8","false","0.8"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","0"

Oh, it probably won't make me laugh. Oh, it'll probably be another case of Goat Simulator where it burns out within minutes once the slender novelty has worn off. Except Roundabout isn't that, it's actually genuinely a really well designed spin-your-car-around videogame first and foremost and then there's this massive level of slick silly and polish on top of that to round it all off.\n\nIt's mainly a series of mini-trials punctuated by FMV cut scenes. Drive over a star, collect a passenger, complete the trial as fast and as cleanly as possible, ranked against your friends list for the obligatory "I WILL BEAT YOUR SCORE" stuff. It's a joy to move around in, it's a game you can and likely will get better at but even if you don't, the game doesn't care. You have to call up the report card yourself so you can just carry on messing around and no-one will bother you. It's a simple but wonderful solution to making what could be a really ridiculous twitchy time trial game into something much more accessible.\n\nIt drops the ball on the funny at times but it's all such a glorious bag of silly mess anyway, the odd joke misfire doesn't matter. Everyone seems to be genuinely enjoying themselves, it's that knowingly rubbish sort of FMV but it does have a message tucked inside it that's simultaneously obvious but also the sort of thing that videogames don't really tackle, especially in a silly mainstream-daft sort of way like this. That's appreciated, especially when you consider how games that tread this sort of silly route normally manage to either ignore these things or just plain get on the wrong side of it. It's a game with a good heart, really.\n\nSo yeah, Roundabout.

You play as Geogrio Manos, the world's first revolving limousine driver. The game seems pretty simple until you get into it, because the car will never stop revolving, and you have to manuver through the crazy ♥♥♥♥ this game has lined up for you.\n\nJust to get the negatives out of the way, the game doesn't run great (my computer is garbage), so that's just a problem on my end. Also, whenever I change resolutionsettings, the next itme I start up the game, it's a black screen, so I have to delete the resolution settings EVERY TIME I play the game. I hope that gets fixed.\n\nNow for the long list of positives. The FMV is brilliant. Even in games that I get invested into the story, I usually do skip a cutscene or too if they go on too long or if I just don't care. I've never skipped a cutscene in this game because it's just so funnnnny. The acting in this is really entertaining to watch. The gameplay itself is great. Navigating the maze-like Roundabout City is made difficult when your car continuously revolves, so you have to move quickly and accurately to not go up in flames. The missions are great fun to play, which are always sandwiched between beautiful cutscenes. The story is absurd, and everything about it is just so entertaining. This game is also funnier than most games. The stereotypical characters you pick up in the game are so damn funny, and even the horns, hats, and paint colors even have funny names. You can customize your limousine to have a different paint job, and roof ornament (hats), and to have a different horn (I go with the sleek Hyphen paint job, which makes the entire limo green). The game might be really short if you do nothing but missions, but if you try to get all the collectibles, and do the challenges, then you're gonna have a fun time.\n\nIf you think there's a game that is better than this game this year, just think if it has FMV.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RegretZero/recommended/303430/","RegretZero","Unbreakable Will","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RegretZero/","420 products in account","Ever wanted to drive your own limousine? How would you feel about becoming the world’s first rotating limo driver? Running people over? Driving underwater? Playing Soccer using cars? These are all things one can do in Roundabout- it’s so unlike every game we’ve seen before and doesn’t really fit nicely into a genre due to its uniqueness- and yet, unfortunately, I’m not sure its best efforts are quite enough to make it a good game.\n\nThe dialogue and character design is actually quite good. Granted, nearly every line of dialogue will melt your brain a little bit, but that’s what they were going for, that charming B-movie feel… and they nailed it. The team did a fantastic job and definitely invoked the comedic feel they were going for- players will be chuckling to themselves as they progress due to the effective comedy one can find in Roundabout. The narrative and method of delivering narrative (video clips) are definitely one of the game’s main strengths.\n\nAs for the gameplay, driving around a constantly-spinning limousine is about as fun and difficult as it sounds. Trying to drive around a city picking up powerups, running over pedestrians to increase your score multiplier, and doing your gosh-darned best to avoid other vehicles and various obstacles the game throws at you is an exhilarating experience. It’ll leave you breathless and desperately asking for more. About an hour and a half into the game, you’re given the ability to jump, which pretty much turns the madness meter up to 11.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything is well in the world of Roundabout- this is one of those games that seems faultless for the first hour or so, but then reveals its inner flaws as time goes on. Think of it as a bag of trail-mix… plenty of candy, but also lots of disappointing elements mixed into the bag- and that’s perhaps one of the best ways of describing Roundabout- a mixed bag of good and bad elements.\n\nFor starters, the game is missing basic features that should have been at the foundation of its game design. A lot of the flaws are actually very strange, considering the obvious thought and care that’s gone into producing it. For example, Roundabout‘s options menu having 4 separate audio sliders to allow a lot of customization in the way the game sounds,  but missing the ability to rebind keys… a basic setting that every game should have.\n\nAnother issue with Roundabout actually has to do with the way rotation is implemented, and how it affects the player. Unfortunately, there are no invincibility frames after being hit… which, frankly, doesn’t make sense. It’s very possible to become wedged between two objects, taking the five hits and exploding, within a second or two. This issue becomes particularly apparent when jumping is introduced as a major gameplay element- one bad jump and you’re dead, as landing in a bad spot and becoming wedged will unmercifully kill you in a matter of seconds. Luckily, respawning is generally a quick process, though sometimes the respawn locations are mediocre and cause an annoying loss of progress.\n\nThe biggest issue Roundabout is faced with is its world design. One of the most important aspects of any video game is its world/level design, and unfortunately- this is seriously lacking here. A well-designed world has several characteristics: it should be living, breathing, immersive, and larger than the player. Unfortunately, the world of Roundabout has none of those things; Nothing in Roundabout feels alive, it’s like you’re the only person that actually matters and everything is there simply for your amusement. Rather than creating an immersive, living world, they’ve created an amusement park with only one person in it- the player.\n\nSure, there are cars driving around and pedestrians sitting around, but nobody actually DOES anything. The cars you’ll see with either be driving in a looped circle around a roundabout or moving forwards then backwards in a straight line… nobody’s GOING anywhere or doing anything. The pedestrians just sit around, waiting to be killed (though they will try to run away if you’re going to run them over) and you’ll never REALLY encounter another vehicle that’s driving anywhere in particular. Everything in the whole wide world is merely there for your sake, to make driving around more difficult or interesting.\n\nThat seems to be a reoccuring issue with Roundabout- it’s all about this illusion that you matter, your actions matter, they have an impact- but they really don’t… and that’s not even all of the issues Roundabout has! Stability problems, poorly thought out purchase options (the land available for purchase, which generates money over time… but you have to drive back to them all in order to actually get any of it), similar minigames at different places… I could go on, but we’ll leave it at that.\n\nAt the end of the day, Roundabout showed a TON of promise and potential- but it’s plagued with so many issues that hold it back from being a great (or even a good) game. As it is right now, Roundabout is fairly mediocre… and that’s really unfortunate. It had a lot going with it due to the interesting method of delivering its comedic narrative and novel gameplay- but that opportunity is wasted due to all of the issues it has… ESPECIALLY due to the effectively “dead” world you’re in throughout the experience… which really ruins the illusion of actions having impact. If you still want to pick up the game and give it a try yourself- go right ahead. Roundabout has a lot of issues, but it has a lot of great stuff to its name too… so if you’re not bothered by anything I’ve mentioned, this game could be just right for you. Otherwise, it’d probably be best to wait for a sale sometime down the line.\n\nRead the full review: on http://rgz.ca/gaming/roundabout-review-the-rotating-chauffeur-simulator-that-has-a-few-issues/\nBottom Line: If you're willing to overlook all of the issues Roundabout is plagued with, it may be a worthwhile buy. Unfortunately, due to its "dead" world with only a quickly vanishing illusion that your actions matter in the slightest (among its other issues) it might be worthwhile to hold off until a sale comes around.\n\nDisclaimer: A review copy of the game was provided for that purpose.","September 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But damn, this game was a blast!\n\nYou play as Georgio, a limo driver who invented a whole new style of driving: the constantly spinning style. While part of me assumed that it would just be frusterating to drive a spinning limo, it is suprisingly fun. Every turn where you don't crash feels like a great victory. Every time you dodge a moving car, a relief. Yet failing never felt that frusterating. With a very forgiving checkpoint system, Roundabout is able to keep you moving forward when it could of very easily just been flat out brutal. Truth be told, if you want a brutal challange, you can get it here too by trying to get high scores and completing every objective. But the only goal I had while playing was to get the passenger where they needed to go.\n\nThis is because of the campy and hilarious FMV cutscenes in every mission. I will be absolutely honest and admit I played this game solely for the humor and it delivered. The acting was bad in a good way. It managed to straddle the delecite line of being bad enough to be funny, but not to go over the edge to miserable. I never cringed or felt the need to mock the actors/characters in the game but rather was constantly amused by what they had to do or say. Every actor was just so earnest in the role that they played and it sold the enitre game. It helps that the story was cute as well and the perfect length.\n\nThis game was exactly what I hoped it would be.

HA HA HA HA!”\n\nRoundabout is a game about a chauffeur called Georgio who owns a limousine that always spins in circles. It takes this simple idea and puts it into a cartoon like open-world  with a few upgrades, some cosmetics and a few basic game mechanics mainly obstacles which you have to dodge, drive around and even jump over. At first, the game seems fun, colourful and quite funny. The map seems huge and the people you drive around seem fun and wacky. So why the negative review? Well…\n\nThe game just doesn’t work. At least for me it doesn’t. It’s not that the gameplay doesn’t match the story of the vibe of the world doesn’t match the characters. It’s just that there are too many things wrong with the game. Bugs and glitches are very common, I found myself easily once every 5 minutes getting wedged between 2 small objects or getting hit by something that I didn’t actually touch. When jumping onto things the limousine gets stuck and sometimes glitches slightly into the ground instantly killing you. That’s just PART of the reason why this is a negative review.\n\nLet us start of with the gameplay. The gameplay starts off very fun and feels fluent and awesome, but after a few missions, it just starts to get so repetitive. Pick up X get to checkpoints A B C drop off at Y and dodge around a bunch of stuff along the way. There was no variation in the game. Even the challenges were just so boring after a little while. The gameplay did not fit in with how the world worked. It was just too easy to get hit too easy to die. It made the game frustrating and at some points feel unplayable.\n\nThe story, while being alright, was only 2 ½ hours long, there are only a few characters that you pick up throughout the game and they’re all wacky and funny and stuff but it’s just so freaking short. Other than the story, there wasn’t much stuff to do other than the few challenges and going back to 100% all of the story missions completing tasks such as “Complete in under 30 seconds” or “Complete without hitting anything.” There are upgrades and hats and paint jobs you can unlock and buy but the best upgrade can be acquired within 2 minutes of finishing the tutorial mission. The rest are just cosmetics.  I mean if you want to get literal about it. You can complete the 8 F*CKING HOUR challenge that is basically “Desert Bus” but with this game’s art-style. What is Desert Bus you ask? It’s a game where you sit in first person in a car tapping left every so often so you don’t fly off the road, for 8 real life hours, and this game has a replica of it.\n\nSo let’s get to another issue I have with this game. Who is it aimed at? At first you’d think children because of the colourful world and the wacky cartoonish characters, but the game is very difficult and frustrating. Not to mention the part where you run over pedestrians creating giant pools of blood on the road. So, achievement hunters? I guess, but it seems like even if you are an achievement hunter you wouldn’t waste your time with this game and have to sit there tapping left for 8 hours straight just to get that 1 achievement. So people who just want to play a short low budget indie game? Then why is it 15 dollars? I just don’t understand.\n\nThe music is alright, very cartoony and upbeat, it’s good for this game. Nothing too crazy and like with a lot of games with not great music. I just put on my own music in the very small amount of time I spent driving around this game’s open world.\n\nThe game looks cute, the real life cutscenes are very nice and compliment the game’s atmosphere. All the characters are brought to life by their costumes, and I generally I enjoyed the game and how it all looked.\n\nNow the final part I want to go over is how the game runs. The game DOESN’T run at 60 FPS most of the time. Which I find crazy because I reach the minimal and recommend requirements for a game that isn’t very tanky graphics wise so it is just straight up poorly optimized. Also, micro stuttering from time to time.\n\nTL;DR\n\nRoundabout has a simple concept that it applies to a funny open world. The gameplay is frustrating, there are bugs and glitches everywhere. It’s extremely short and the entire game just doesn’t feel very complete. Also it’s way overpriced for the amount of content in it. This game will stay dead in my library never to be played again, by me at least.\n\n4/10.\n\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curator page  here!","January 22","false","3.1"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

When you nail a section it is incredibly satisfying. Losing and retrying is not frustrating, the restart timer is short and the checkpoints are plenty. The FMV videos are really well done, definitely a huge part of my enjoyment of the game was my enjoyment of the cutscenes.

Five collisions and you, as well as your clients die a fiery death as your vehicle explodes.

Kate Welsh does an amazing job as silent Georgio Manos, who is interacting with the passengers using mostly facial expressions. But everyone else is on top of their game as well while trying to be as cheesy and hammy as possible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainSpam/recommended/303430/","CaptainSpam","CaptainSpam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainSpam/","220 products in account","So I tells you what you do:\n\nFirst, take a simple, yet unique gameplay element.  Like, say, a limousine that's constantly spinning.  One that, through a delicate balance of timing and control, you have to guide through a city, weaving through parked cars, buildings, boulders, and whatever else it can throw at you.\n\nNow, polish that one gameplay element.  Take it as far as it'll go.  Be creative.  Have fun with it.  Maybe there's points where spinning *backward* is the key.  Maybe you should spin over water, too.  Can the limousine jump?  Sure, but it'll be spinning the whole time.  Polish the gameplay until it shines.  A built-in speedrun mode that's solid and fun won't hurt.\n\nThen, build your game's world.  A silly, spinning-obsessed city full of pedestrians who don't quite have the right-of-way, cars that park in the most inconvenient of places, construction sites set up so a well-trained limousine driver can spin through them, and a cast of goofy characters all waiting to be chauffeured around town, not a single bit of it being taken seriously.\n\nFinally, sprinkle in actual live-action acting.  The sort where a bunch of people with actual cameras and sets filmed themselves getting into a limousine and acted out the story.  A delightfully cheesy story, no less, one about romance, weddings, civil disobedience, skeletons, murder, and tourism.  All acted out by a cast who were clearly enjoying themselves while they did it.\n\nIn short, if you don't at least get a good chuckle out of Roundabout, it's possible you don't have a soul.","April 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

However for some like myself this game will represent everything there is to love about gaming.\n\nGameplay:\nGeorgio Manos takes on the city of Roundabout in an attempt to be not only the world's first revolving chauffeur but also its best! The core mechanic of constantly spinning seems strange and disorientating at first, but it soon becomes second nature and the thought of moving in a straight line will seem absurd. The bulk of gameplay ‘revolves’ around reaching a location by passing through checkpoints whilst avoiding damaging your limo, it is in this respect that the game is simple, anyone will be able to clear missions by taking hits and resetting their last checkpoint so in that sense reaching the end of the game is simple. However passing each mission does not complete it, each mission has several other additional objectives that require you to achieve certain goals in order to 100% them, this can be completing the mission without taking damage, achieving a certain multiplier or streak and usually two time based goals with the faster one usually requiring you to use the speed boost through some if not most of the mission making it more challenging. If you are a completist when it comes to meeting extra objectives you will get more than enough out of this game to feel frustrated each time you almost meet an objective but oh so satisfied when you finally do. There is also a collection element to the game which has you pick up stacks of cash, buy property and customizations to your limo and collect blue coins only attained through jumping which is unlocked a little ways into the game and gives a platforming aspect to the game in a couple of missions but is primarily useful for collection purposes.\n\nStory:\nThe story of Roundabout is delivered mostly through FMV, and it is in my opinion glorious. I adore the unashamedly and purposefully bad acting and although it may not be to everyone's liking I personally love it. The FMV really facilitates setting context to each of the missions and is supported by voice over at certain points within each mission at the checkpoints which is just as funny as it is useful for telling the player what to expect. Big props have to go to Kate Welch who plays Georgio, I already had known of her from youtube as ‘shegeekshow’ and she really gives a fantastic performance especially considering her unique position as the silent protagonist and the only person who doesn’t get any lines. It would also be unjust not to mention Jillian Carol who plays Beth, Beth features the most in the game beside Georgio herself and is definitely my favorite aspect of the game, I don’t want to spoil why she is the best part of the story and the FMV in general but without her the game would not have been as wonderful as I find it to be.\nThere is an over arching plot to the game and I honestly didn’t expect it to be as interesting as it was because it didn’t need to be nor did it have any right to be, but I found myself straying from my original method of playing each mission over and over to get 100% completion near the end so I could move on to each new mission to see how the story was going to develop and ultimately conclude. Is it a narrative worthy of an oscar? Of course not, however it wasn’t designed as such and didn’t need to be either however it has an unexpectant depth and charm which makes the experience this game offers all the more worthwhile.\n\nOther:\nThe soundtrack is complementary to the fun and jovial nature of the game and along with the voice over within missions it prevented my initial expectation to play the game whilst listening to podcasts, it was simply too happy and enjoyable to sully my full experience that the audio provides to the game.\nBonus challenges and leaderboards add even more content and enjoyability to the game, just knowing you are so close to the top 10 or 50 or 100 makes you want to play to get further up the chart even if you have already completed all the objectives, it also quickly improves how good you are at the game.\nReplay value - not applicable to everyone as already mentioned, but this game offers you so much more than just completing missions and moving on to the next one to see the FMV. Completionist gamers will love this game. Having spent about 8 hours in game and 2 hours just having fun messing about has only gotten me to 70% completion and I intend to make up the other 30% left to go. I also envision this being a game I come back to again and again perhaps every year or few months just to have a good time and to see how quickly I can get through everything.\nI purchased this game on sale and to be perfectly honest this is a game that I would gladly pay full price for, however I do feel like this game had everything catered to me and as a result I felt happy to buy the Deluxe Edition Content not only to support the game but because I had the insatiable desire to see more from this game. For others who feel less enamored with the idea of the game at face value I say this game is a must buy if it is on sale if you even remotely think you might enjoy it.\n\nRoundabout could be a perfect game for me from a subjective perspective and regardless of anyone else and their feelings for this game I will love it unendingly, however there are a couple of issues that I think would be unfair for me to overlook just because of my adoration for the game and these are:\n- the menu will very occasionally (3 times for me across 10 hours) became unresponsive (only seems to happen when you constantly restart the same mission in quick succession, which can help to put you in a better position to start a speedrun by having you face a direction at first to make the start faster.) The quit to menu option always still worked on the menu and going to the main menu and selecting to go back in fixed this every time.\n- sometimes restarting a mission that begins beside a wall or obstacle will cause you to restart and take one hit or damage straight away (it appears to be due to the position the limo starts in after being moved from your current location back to the start point) restarting a second time always fixed this problem for me and as such was not bothersome.\n\nConclusion:\nI love this game, it pushes all the right buttons for me however it is not going to be to everyone’s taste. That being said I think for those who have an interest and who will ultimately get into what this game is and represents, they will have an enjoyable experience that perhaps in part can be found elsewhere but in full can only be had with Roundabout.","November 21, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is satisfying when you are successfully and very forgiving when you screw up, if you blow up you are just respawned. It take about three hours to complete the story and you can probably get another three or four hours entertainment out of it by completing extra challenges, achievements and finding collectables. You could spend a lot longer on this game if you want to fully complete everything but it will become tedious.\n\nIf you consider the core gameplay in isolation this would be an enjoyable but ultimately forgettable casual game. However the game also has brilliant cut scenes. They are live action clips done in the style of a cheesy 70s B-movie that completely don't take themselves seriously. These elevate the game to one that I will look back on fondly.","April 25","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That, in combination with the odd cutscenes which is all 70's B-movie, makes this a game worth its own weight in gold.\n\nKeep in mind though, this game's weight isn't very high.

I sure as hell didn’t but now that’s all I want to do and no thanks to freshman developer No Goblin and their first game, Roundabout. On the surface, Roundabout is kind of easy to explain but the nuances in the game play elevate it above your standard limousine spinning game.\n\nIt is 1977 and you take the wheel as silent limo driver, Georgio Manos. I never understood why she never speaks but it does make for some awkwardly funny moments between her and her passengers. Yes, Georgio is a female. A gorgeous one at that, but that’s neither here nor there. Skipping any kind of real introduction, the game starts right off with your driving lesson. I breezed right through the lesson, with a whopping 50% and not meeting any of the objectives. Still passed though. From then on out its nothing but semi-controlled chaos.\n\nSpinning ( and jumping…yes, jumping ) through tight streets and hairpin turns is challenging and you tend to die a lot. And I mean a lot. But the low success rate does not hinder the fun of the game at all. In such an open world game that is driven by streak based scoring and challenges, like trying to bounce a soccer ball on the roof of the limo as many times as you can or staying clear of as many falling cars as possible, its hard to get mad a the constant dying.\n\nYou are a limo driver so it should be a no brainer that part of the game is chauffeuring a zany pack of characters around town. These riders are one of the best aspects of the game due to the hilarious live-action cut scenes, filled with actors I assume are No Goblin staff, friends, and family. The kids are my favorite. Not to mention the tender moments between Georgio and a certain female passenger. See, this game even has a love story! The scenes have a very Troma Entertainment feel to them ( given studio head Dan Teasdale’s involvement with Lloyd Kaufman, its no surprise ).\n\nRoundabout is just a ridiculous game. Everything from the funky 70s music to the smooth spinning and fiery explosions. Its rare to see a game be so outlandish but work so well at the same time. I skipped over a lot of the other wacky things this game has to offer in this review but my suggestion is to plop down the $15 ( $12 during the launch week ) and get yourself a copy. Now.\n\nBuy Roundabout\n\nQUICK TIP – If you have a xbox or playstation controller, use it. The game is much easier. You will still probably suck, just a fraction less.\n\nThe Breakdown:\n\nStory – 3/5\nI only got to 12% but I could feel something developing.\n\nVisuals – 4/5\nIts not real life but its a video game through and through.\n\nGameplay – 4/5\nIts fun. And isnt that what video games should be?\n\nSound – 5/5\nThe music alone deserves 5 stars. Also, between the pedestrian screams and sweet sound of crashing and exploding, it has top notch sound design\n\nEntertainment – 5/5\nI played for hours without any sense of time. Most of the time I was grinning from ear to ear.\n\nReplay – 4/5\nUnless you are some spinning badass, it will take a couple replays to complete the game. And I could see this becoming a party game. Easy to challenge your friends.\n\n- See more at: http://gourmet-gamer.com/#sthash.8MUKGQkj.dpuf","September 18, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnduringBeta/recommended/303430/","EnduringBeta","EnduringBeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnduringBeta/","209 products in account",""Delightfully charming" is how I remember Roundabout. The game can be divided into two parts: the gameplay and the full-motion video.\n\nThe gimmick of this game is that you are a limousine driver who is constantly rotating. Thankfully, in the town of Roundabout, all roads, cars, and other obstacles are laid out just perfectly for you to snake around to get people to their destinations. The game is as casual or as serious as you want it to be. There are lofty objectives and super-pro highscore boards, but if you explode in a fiery wreck, you'll start back up nearby in a jiffy. Additional mechanics and challenge are layered on slowly, and getting through the game I feel is pretty attainable.\n\nThe characters and video are the real delight of this game, though. Taking place in the 1970s, various employees of the developer's company don silly costumes and deliver so-bad-it's-good lines of dialog. Of note is that the player plays Georgio Manos, a silent protagonist whose primary role in the game is turning (with slight variation) from the steering wheel to see who hopped in her car. Yet she is still very compelling!\n\nHammy? Yep.\nSelf-aware? Oh yeah.\nHilarious? Georgio gets caught up in dark alleyway billionaire deals, a fierce rotating limo rivalry, budding love, and drug addiction, among many other weird scenarios. That's a yes.\n\nIf you're up for a laugh in the B-movie style, I highly recommend Roundabout.","December 28, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/303430/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","Roundabout is one of those concepts so out of the box, so unexpected, so quirky, that you can't go into it with a predetermined judgement on it or its genre, because quite frankly, there really isn't anything else like this out there, not in the way that this game works, sure - many games have been quirky, clever, funny, brilliant, and fun all at once, but not in this way. And this is why we're going along for this crazy ride.\n\n\n\n\nGameplay: 95/100 A\n\n"Roundabout is better with a controller! If you have one, be sure to plug it in and restart for the best experience possible." - The Devs\n\nYes, take that advice if you're a PC user like I am, playing this game on a keyboard is hell. Not that it is poorly ported, not at all, this game requires precise movements and you can't get that with most keyboards, not like with a thumbstick. Anyways, Roundabout is a fun game, if not frustrating at times as you try and learn the game. It doesn't necessarily drops you in the middle of the game as it shoots you out of a cannon and into a wall and told "Here you go - drive!" But that's all part of the game and the story. Once you get a handle on the mechanics of the car, the game becomes a clever and really enjoyable experience, making the rest of the elements, the sights and sounds, that much better. Going back to the controls, I wasn't able to test the game out with my gamepad as it has up and disappeared and had to play with a keyboard, that said, with some growing pains, the game eventually became tolerable and again, fun, but I agree with the devs, a controller is a must to get the most out of this wonderful game.\n\n\nAudio: 98/100 A+\n\nLet's get this over with - the music is fantastic. Nothing like 70's disco/funk to get you in the mood for silliness. Okay, now that the soundtrack stuff is out of the way, the sound design is pretty good as well. The voice capture from the FMVs are very well done, and the main character, Georgio, sounds amazing ;). The gameplay effects are well done as well, from the pedestrian screams of anguish and terror, to the explosions, and even the stereotypical 70s/80s video game effects from when you hit something.\n\n\nVisuals: 91/100 A-\n\nRoundabout looks good, having its own design and style with obvious influences from the decade it is set in. Colorful and playful. The graphics are simple, even abstract at times, and all work together very well. matted neon colors, mixed with blurring effects and that Sims style that appeals to a majority of people, gamers or not, and that could part of the reasoning. Either way, the game is great eye candy even if it isn't the most realistic thing around. Not everything needs realism.\n\n\nContent: 85/100 B\n\nThere's a fair amount of gameplay here and a bit more should you opt for the deluxe edition, as well a good amount of replayability, something many games like this seem to lack. There are also a good amount of visual changes you can make, like big head mode and whatnot, and customizing your ride, changing your special abilities and how you play the game in general, and you'll be left spending a lot of time just messing around with the different combinations you can make, especially in a free ride mode. Yet despite all of this, I feel like there needs to be more, more, more. Maybe I'm just being greedy and I want more reasons to play this game.\n\n\nStory: 75/100 C\n\nI don't really know what to say about the story. You play as a new limo driver who has a unique way of getting around town and you somehow managed to pass your driving test by sheer amazement. It's a goofy story that doesn't really add much, but it is fun to listen to, especially when the narrator comes in while playing or during the hilarious FMV sequences that are always welcomed and leave me smiling ear to ear. This is one of those cases where the story comes secondary to the game, but just like with Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario, did the story really matter in those games?\n\n\nDesign: 96/100 A+\n\nRoundabout is a very well thought out game from the ground up. Yes, it has flaws, but it's fun. Everything from the menu and themes to the city's design, obstacles and courses, mini challenges, hell even the costume designs on the people are all very well done and fit the bill of the period. The characters are all interesting and colorful. Even Georgio's expressions are full of life with each gaze and glare that she gives. Power ups and bonuses litter the roads, just like pedestrians and their bloody remains, and there are plenty of checkpoints as you play for when you crash and die and die you will...over and over again.\n\n\nPerformance: 95/100 A\n\nOverall, Roundabout ran smoothly on my pc with little to no issues in performance. I did notice that lower end specs did make certain things harder to read, but that happens to just about every game out there and even though the keyboard controls were a bit tough to get used to, the controls reacted reasonably and the way you expected them to. There are some clipping issues and collision detections here and there, but I expect those things to be patched as time goes on and that's ok.\n\n\nVerdict: 90/100 A-\n\nRoundabout is fun. I cannot emphasize that enough. Yes, the difficulty does ramp up fairly quickly, but not to the point that you don't want to keep going just to see what the next ridiculous things will happen next or who you will have to pick up as a passenger.","March 1, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me about 3hours (including the entire end credits section) to complete this game(at least the story), I still have a lot of collectibles to collect but I don't find that particulary interesting.\n\nOddly enough it requires quite a lot of power from the pc, I didn't have any issues, but windows suggested for me to use ''basic'' mode while I play it.\n\nBIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME: it does not support all resolutions(mine was 1440x900), I  had black borders all over the place and it didn't want to fit into one monitor in a dual monitor setup(basically the game decided that in the middle of the two monitors conjunction is a great place to play the game)\n\nThe game isn't that much of a challenge, rather a nice and casual experience, even relaxing in a way apart from the challenges which are definitely tricky and keep you on your toes.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice casual experience and definitely worth a playthrough,  but maybe not at full price (though maybe all the acting and work put into the game does deserve full price... if only it was a little bit longer.. if only..)\n\n","March 17, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With that said if your looking for a driving game, this doesn't really have driving, if you where to strip away the graphics you more or less guiding a rotating line through a maze not driving, there is no accelotator, no break, no turning left or right, its controls do not resemble driving at all so if your looking for a driving game realize the only reason this can be considered a driving game is purely the plot and graphics not mechanics.\n\nWith that said the FMV cutsceens are great, the puzzle mechanics are fun and the different powers you can unlock are interesting, I personally would say the cutsceens alone are worth the asking price, while the puzzles are enjoyable to play if the game didn't have the FMV I could see picking it up on a sale but not at $20, but with the FMV definitly adds something to the game to make it worth the price. And with that said I would definitly say the Deluxe edition is worth the $5 more even the soundtrack has a FMV in the back that is ammusing to watch.","September 25, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are tasked with driving the world's first revolving limo around town, doing things that limo drivers often do. You might also think that this concept will get old rather quickly. Fortunately, that is not the case. You see, Roundabout isn't a game that is substantiated by one single gimmick. No, this game has some pretty solid level design. In fact, it becomes a bit more of an action-puzzler as time goes on, where the game becomes more about, "How am I gonna get around this?" Fortunately,  you do have infinite lives, and you crash and explode after four impacts with whatever it is you've crashed into. The game does try its best to keep things in sync, but sometimes you may have to throw away a life or two just to get the game to get things back in sync.\n\nThe game has a very GTA-like feel to it (by design, I would assume), and by GTA I'm talking GTA 1 and 2. It's a top-down open world kind of environment with collectables for days, so if you're a completionist, you'll have a great time with this game. 100% completion is where a lot of the gameplay time for this game will come from, as this game will only take you two to three hours to beat all the main missions. My playtime accounts for two and a half hours of doing missions plus some goofing around with the challenges. This game has nine challenges on offer which are unlocked as the game progresses, and they're for the most part pretty fun (save #9, but that's just because it's really not meant to be that enjoyable; you'll see once you unlock it).\n\nApart from that, I really don't have many criticisms on the gameplay front for this game. It's a game that I can see myself coming back to every now and then, that's for sure. For a very solid combination of world and level design which make very interesting use of the rotational mechanic of the limo, I'll give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay.\n\nStory: The other big draw of this game is that this game makes liberal use of FMV. These are definitely some of the most enjoyable parts of the game, if you ask me. These cutscenes and the overarching story are written like an Airplane-esque satire of 70's movies and culture; absolutely chock full of references to various tropes, but knowledge of these references isn't necessary for enjoyment of the writing. While not necessarily being as great as Airplane (let's be honest; were we really expecting that?), it still offers up quite a lot of very funny moments. Overall, this game hits all the checkboxes for a 70's satire featuring many twists and turns... *is shot*  9/10.\n\nGraphcs: There's three big things here to talk about: the acting in the FMVs, the artstyle of the game, and the game's technical capabilities. I'll start with the acting. It really does take a lot of talent to act "badly", and they really did pick some good bad actors for this game. Of course, given the satirical nature of this game, "good" acting is out the window. So yeah, they definitely had a very solid cast for this game. As for the art style, it's pretty simplistic, but it gets the job done. Everything is brightly colored, and I never really had any difficulty picking out objects in the environment throughout my playthrough. Not too terribly memorable, but again; it's good enough to do its job. As for the technical side of this game, this game was built around Unity, so depending on how well your computer can run Unity based games, your mileage may vary. As for me with my GTX 760, I never really had any problems at all throughout this game. It does startup at 720p, which is annoying for people like me who think games should just have a one-time autodetect resolution function that activates at startup, but it's easy enough to go into the options and switch things around. There really isn't all that much that you can do with the graphical fidelity of this game, but since it's not the most graphically intensive game out there, there really isn't much point complaining about that aspect. As for how the game is optimized, it ran at about 55degC on my GPU. A bit warm, but nothing terrible. Overall, there's a lot of good stuff here on the visual front. 4/5.\n\nSound: Much like the physical acting, the voice acting is pretty "terrible." As a side note, I find it pretty funny that people were convinced that the villain's voice actor wasn't actually French, even though the voice actor (Psychedelic Eyeball) is French-Canadian. Anyways, the music is decidely disco-y and very slap bass heavy, much like the entirety of the mainstream 70's were. Definitely a soundtrack worth getting if you're into that sort of thing. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about here. I didn't hear any really awful audio glitches, and the content that was presented was really good. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/9/4/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnduringBeta/recommended/303430/","EnduringBeta","EnduringBeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnduringBeta/","209 products in account",""Delightfully charming" is how I remember Roundabout. The game can be divided into two parts: the gameplay and the full-motion video.\n\nThe gimmick of this game is that you are a limousine driver who is constantly rotating. Thankfully, in the town of Roundabout, all roads, cars, and other obstacles are laid out just perfectly for you to snake around to get people to their destinations. The game is as casual or as serious as you want it to be. There are lofty objectives and super-pro highscore boards, but if you explode in a fiery wreck, you'll start back up nearby in a jiffy. Additional mechanics and challenge are layered on slowly, and getting through the game I feel is pretty attainable.\n\nThe characters and video are the real delight of this game, though. Taking place in the 1970s, various employees of the developer's company don silly costumes and deliver so-bad-it's-good lines of dialog. Of note is that the player plays Georgio Manos, a silent protagonist whose primary role in the game is turning (with slight variation) from the steering wheel to see who hopped in her car. Yet she is still very compelling!\n\nHammy? Yep.\nSelf-aware? Oh yeah.\nHilarious? Georgio gets caught up in dark alleyway billionaire deals, a fierce rotating limo rivalry, budding love, and drug addiction, among many other weird scenarios. That's a yes.\n\nIf you're up for a laugh in the B-movie style, I highly recommend Roundabout.","December 28, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bad acting is really endearing, and the gameplay is smooth and polished.  Really, my only complaint about it is that it's short. I completed the main storyline in four hours, with the main menu reading 24.0% completion, so there are a lot of other things to be done (challenges, achievements, etc.)\n\nTL;DR Roundabout is a fun, short game with lovable characters and great gameplay.

Yes? Okay, then. :-)\nThis game brings a huge smile to my face, if not for the main mechanic then for the execution...\n\nThe main mechanic - you're constantly spinning - is very original (okay, not unique, but close enough) and executed well. Actually traversing through the open world requires constant attention and timing, but very satisfying when done right. Along the way you get a few updates that help but won't break things. Make no mistake: this is a parkour game (and even that is mostly because it doesn't fit anything else). Don't think you're buying a racer or a sandbox or anything. It may have these elements but it's all about making your way from point A to B.\n\nEven better is the briliant decision of the developers to not only dress the concept as a revolving limo in an open world but just balls out GO with the concept and include a great deal of hilariously badly acted cutscènes. Other devs should take note: never let a good idea be hampered by it not fitting in a certain world view. Instead, set the world around the mechanic.\n\nSo...a must buy. nonetheless, I have to note that the game isn't that long (though it has plenty of sidequests and hidden stuff) and barely varies from the main mechanic. So it won't occupy you for 10+ hours. But it'll entertain you in that time. :-)","November 17, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes yes the 70s  theme is very vell done and great, and same with the weird people living in the town, and it's hilarious that people getting bumpted install kill them and sound and look like a paint bucket spilling.\n\nBut it's very hard to manage the actual game is the first point. The actual game, which is a simple taxi/ isometric driving game, is confounded by the fact that someone decided to put an overcharged revolution drive onto your limo, making the roadway's biggst (non-truck) inconvinience and safety issue into a bigger one. Because of this, it does not turn into a driving game, and turning like normal is impossible, and in idle, you sweep the entire road. This turns it into a sort of platformer-strategy-stealth-driving game, which is a confusing concept. It's a platformer, because there are only a few patches of land in which you can safely stay on, and you must somehow find a way to get to another safe space.\nThe strategy part comes in that you have to figure out a way to get there, and taking into acount how your going to navagate any hazards along the way. And then the stealth part, you have to execute that plan perfectly with no slipups, diving into alleyways and avoiding damage and main roads. You have to do all of this while driving a quickly revolving limo. You get some powerups that help, but, prepare to die, and I feel bad for your passengers who much die and be reincarnated to die again over and over in what I assume is your rev motor exploding. I reccommend.\n\nOh, and the acting and Live Action Cutsceens are beautiful, the set design is actually very well done, and the acting/writing and everything falls in that sweetspot between "school film project" and "aware indie film"","November 19, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fairly generous with checkpoints except during the open world segments when traveling from mission to mission - I often found simply getting to my next passenger more challenging than the actual ride.\n\nIt's a good thing that the story and presentation is simply not to be missed - it helps ease much of the frustration in the gameplay. The cutscenes harken back to the days of bad FMV games that used to dominate early CD-based platforms like the Sega CD. This means bad acting and cheap production values, but this time it's on purpose and used properly to give breaks from the gameplay (rather than replacing gameplay). It will certainly provide a few laughs to anyone who enjoys campy, "so bad it's good" production styles.\n\nThe story itself will only provide two to three hours of gameplay, but there is a good bit of variety in the experience. There is also hours of content to explore and unlock in the game's open world - customizations, mission replay challenges, and so on. Completionists will have a field day.\n\nIf the cutscenes presented in the game's trailer seem amusing, it's worth a purchase to experience the lunancy that is the world of Roundabout. Beyond that, this one is really for fans of action-puzzle games and open-world games with lots of unlockables. Players like that will definitely want to give this one a spin.","June 29, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is high concept stuff: a top down taxi game but with a rotating limo and FMV thrown in to spice things up. Its core strengths are the concept itself and the cute silly FMV story.\n\nIts weakness is the game itself, it isn't bad by any means but I didn't find it quite strong enough to carry the game once the cutscenes are over. The main issue being that the car is fragile and routes narrow so it forces you to try and drive with a level of precision that to me never felt like it fitted with the themes or the polish of the game itself (particularly the hit detection). It demands a level of seriousness and respect for the game that it never earns.\n\nStill the FMV carries it through and it is well worth it for the 4 hours or so it takes to get through the story. What it lacks in length of play I'm quite certain it'll make up for in terms of how long it'll live in the memory so for all its faults it is still highly recommended.","March 6","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this is quite difficult to do at the start of the game, you will get the hang of it pretty quickly. You will have to start over a lot of times. However, the checkpoint system is fair and will never make you suffer through a hard part again if you've already conquered it.\n\nAt the same time, Roundabout mocks everything about B movies from the seventies. This is noticable in every aspect of the game. The seemingly amateuristic FMV cutscenes add tremendously to the humour of this game. Moreover, the soundtrack is a joy to listen to.\n\nI highly advise you to buy this game. It's worth every penny of its retail price.","January 17","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This solid gameplay enables the rest of the game to be as eccentric as possible, and this wholly original title asks players to navigate the world's first revolving limousine through a series of increasingly (open-world, birds-eye view) missions. Crazy Taxi has nothing on this, and even Grand Theft Auto pales in comparison to the cartoonish vehicular manslaughter committed in the sake of maintaing a combo multiplier.\n\nCasual gamers will feel welcomed and encouraged by the generous checkpoints, but an increasingly difficult series of bonus objectives for each mission will ensure that hardcore players don't have to take a comfortable backseat. Short of a few technical issues with the audio now and again, there's not a thing here that I wouldn't wholly recommend.\n\n[If you're interested in reading more, I've also written a lengthier review here: https://thatsoundscool.wordpress.com/2016/01/17/roundabout-is-straight-up-arcade-fun/]","January 17","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation is charming and silly, in a harmless, lo-fi, FMV, "were they all high while making this game?" sort of way. It takes the Kuru Kuru Kururin (google it) gameplay concept of guiding a rotating object (in this case a limousine) across an obstacle course within a time limit and gives this woefully underused old premise an open-world, FMV, funky, cartoonish twist.

You also learn how to jump! JUMP! The game world is pretty big and sprawling, with multiple unlockable areas, minigames, collectibles and bonuses. Unfortunately the main missions can be played through faster than you can spin your car ten times, but for HC spinning afficionados there are plenty of fun bonuses to unlock to make the most of your time there.
