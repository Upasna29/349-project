"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rutena/recommended/339210/","Rutena","Rutena the Braixen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rutena/","90 products in account","My first review! May contain inaccuracy. If there's anything I can do to improve it, please let me know!\n\nRescue 2: Everyday Heroes is an Emergency firefighting strategy game in the city of Belvitsia in which you control a large variety of different vehicles and personnel. This is the sequel to Rescue - Everyday Heroes.\n\nMajor new features- New fire types. You now have many different fire types posing different hazards and will definitely be more challenging.\n- Interactable map. You can view the whole city in 3D as well as your fire department, the location of the incident, and much more.\n- New art style. Changing from very realistic and highly detailed, while quite a risky move, actually changed to a slightly more cartoonish style, while in general still very realistic.\n- CARDS! Yep, the game now has Steam cards! This will definitely be helpful to make badges, trade with other people or get a bit of money on the market. However, with 15 cards to collect, this will be a difficult task. Are you up for it?\n- More vehicles. You can now take control of many more vehicles, including the ladder. Now you can access second or third floors quickly instead of taking the stairway.\n\nControlsThe controls are a little more difficult and may take a bit to get used to. There is a lot less "Click this, then click that". You click a lot more buttons on the HUD, compared to how minimal it was in the first game. It should not really take long to get used to, which will not be an issue as you start with really simple missions and you are bound to get good control as you get into the harder missions later on. Controls are really no big issue as well, since after all, it is a Point & Click game.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics are definitely much better compared to the first. It is so different, they even gave it a little extra cartoonish style, which definitely gets my interest. Shading and reflections are incredible and definitely beats the first game. The only problem is that on average computers, VSync, Bloom and Water reflection are large creators of lag. This drops the framerate down a bit, but if you are fine with just small amounts of jittering, this should be no issue.\n\nOptionsThere are many options you can choose from.\n- There are many quality options and you have the choice to choose between Full Screen and Windowed. You can even have Fullscreen with or without a border. You can also go advanced and choose to disable or enable VSync, Anti-Aliasing, Bloom and more.\n- You also get options to turn on or off the music, the SFX or the voice, or set your own volume for them. You also have many speaker modes, ranging from Raw to Stereo, even 5.0 to Prologic.\n- In general, you can adjust scroll speed and even disable the HUD if you want to. The best part is that you can even switch between over Six differerent languages!\n\nGameplay - ComparisonThe gameplay is of course the most important part. The gameplay differs completely to the first game, with a new way to dispatch, play missions and your station management. In the first game, you are able to customise your own fire station with props to make it look as you want it to be. In this game, thet feature was removed, but you are able to own 3 different fire departments. Dispatching units to missions is also different; In the first game, you can click a button to set yourself to alert phase and a mission will come up, whereas here, 2-3 random missions will appear on the map. Sending vehicles is quite the same, but sending personnel is different. In the first game, in the dispatch screen, you are able to choose which units go into which vehicles. In this sequel, you have to assign your units to a vehicle first inside a fire station before dispatching the vehicle itself. (More detail on dispatching units is explained further below)\n\nFire Station\nThe Fire Station is a lot less interactable as the feature to add furniture to decorate your station has been removed. However, there is more to do. From here, you can manage your team and their "Talents", which give them extra abilities to do in a mission, such as longer survivability, faster use of of tools and equipment (like hoses), etc.You can also purchase equipment to use and to place in your vehicles. There are also many more vehicles to use, and the most noticeable feature is the addition of a ladder truck. Another great thing is that you can paint your vehicles from a large variety of colours with no need to buy them. The one bonus feature that stood out the most for me is the addition of Female firefighters and paramedics!\n\nDispatch\nDispatching a unit have changed completely. As the game is now more in a "Freeplay" mode, random fires will generate, maybe even two at a time. You have a full 3 minutes to send all your units to the fire and to begin the mission. Before dispatching your units, you can manage them in your stations, which will pause the time. You also cannot do two missions at a time, so while you do one, the time is also paused. While you can send FOUR units at a time, you cannot dispatch them while managing the crew at the same time. You will have to first go to your station to assign personnel to the vehicle. This will be problematic for lazy gamers who prefer to get everything over and done with.\n\nMissions\nMissions will randomly generate all over Belvitsia, sometimes having to deal with two at a time. Over time, you may encounter "Story" missions which are important to be able to unlock more vehicles, equipment and more missions. For the first hour or two of the game, you may get bored of having to play the same missions repeatedly, which is unfortunately important if you wish to keep your reputation high. When you have no more reputation with the city, it will be GAME OVER. You will have to start the entire game all over again. As you complete these missions, you will gain higher reputation as well as quite a large sum of money. As you complete story missions, the repetitive side of things will eventually fade as you have a larger variety of missions to play. Though, there are only very few missions so as you start to progress towards the end, you will quickly get the feeling of repetition again. Story missions can only be completed once (Unconfirmed) and there are many interesting story missions, including a large fire on the top floor of an office and even a competition against a rival fire department against the clock.\n\nConclusion (tl;dr)Overall, there are very few problems with this game. This is a huge improvement from the first game. There are so many great new features and even when you finish the game, you just want more. You might feel like you want to come back and play the game again some more. Yes, it gets highly repetitive, but there are many different ways you can complete some missions.\n\nI give this game a 8/10. I find it very enjoyable and challenging, though quickly repetitive. Worth getting for a couple dozen hours of playing, though overpriced. (I bought this game when it was $25, but I would recommend $10, maybe $15 at the most)\nIf you feel there is something that has been overlooked or is missing from this review, please let me know!","June 3, 2015","true","19.4"," 54 of 77 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","54","77","3","5"

The graphics look realy nice and the map is very beautiful. The gameplay is also nice and the AI is not so stupid. There are some new, good things in comparison with the first game. The oxigen bottles and the unlimited fire extinguishers are nice. And you can have more than one HQ.\n\nAlthough I think they have missed a lot of greath things from the previous game (Rescue - Everyday Heroes (U.S. Edition) see: http://store.steampowered.com/app/253130/). For example the big ambulances (but that, indeed, is an American thing...) and the rescue vehicles for the road accidents. The customisation of the HQ has also dissapeared, which is a sad thing. The training classes and fitness also have dissapeared.\n\nIn general it is a good game, but they have left out a couple of greath things from the first game.","June 14, 2015","true","21.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Good things about this game is that the game play is fun, graphics are good. Ita mostly challenging and it takes you a long time to get all the stations and fire trucks, the game is infinate. Bad things about this game is that it still has a few bugs that the community has already spoken of and the developers are handling good. Sound is not the best. And some times it gets boring for brief moments because some levels are very repetitve and you get tired of the same level. he story is fun but it doesnt have much to it.

It's the same missions with only slight differences in equipment until you have the specialized vehicles which makes the missions trivial, which is boring.\nI enjoy this game, however it needs more content and it could really use procedural generation for missions to make no two alike, even if they use the same small selection of maps.\n\nDifficulty level was not challenging. Once you understand how to do a mission quickly, it becomes dull.\nWhen I saw the train derailment mission, I thought "wow this will be fun". Then I go there with my foam tender and spray one small fire and complete the mission in less time than it took for the mission to load. That is disappointing.  The game is much more fun if you let everything catch on fire for a while, let the injured people almost die, then start fighting the fires.\n\nI felt like I had cool equipment and vehicles, but really didn't feel like I was using them. Often, I could bust into a fire with 4 people using fire extinguishers and avoid all of the fun of setting up hoses.\n\nHowever, I am still recommending this game because it is suitably polished. It's good for about a day's worth of play and good for kids to play with parents.\n\nThis is an improvement over the previous Rescue. The game design and engine have enormous potential, but the content is currently (6/5/2015) mediocre.\n","June 4, 2015","true","13.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

The story is far from brilliant and it is also fairly short. The missions have a decent variety, but after a while you have played through all of them a few times, and it starts to feel like grinding. Good instructions through the tutorials, and the game makes new emergency vehicles available at a steady pace.\n\nDid not encounter many bugs, but the emergency vehicles some times struggled to find a free path on the mission site (usually they blocked the road for each other, and other times the ambulance "collided" with cars when it was trying to leave the mission area).\n\nOverall, I can say that I have enjoyed the game and I would give it a score of  65/100 . There is so much more they can do with the game, but for $20 I think it is an okay purchase. So if you are a fan of this type of games, consider buying it and also help support further development of the genre.","July 29, 2015","true","6.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Later in the story if you got Water Tender or even Foam/Pulver Tender the some of the missions are done in the matter of seconds once the truck arrives at the scene.

Bravo !\n\nI haven't played the game nearly long enough for a full review. But from what I have seen so far I think this is a serious contender to give other Titles of the same genre a run for their money.\n\nI am still not sure what I think of the more comic style approach on the graphics, however I love the depth that develops as you progress through the missions. A depth that other titles are sadly lacking. If you have seen my first review of Rescue 1 I pointed out that one of the most frustrating parts is that the water managment shows promise but they bglew it by making the supply hose ridicoulusly short.\n\nWell they changed that completly around, not only is the supply line nice and long, but you have  Static Drybowl and Underground hydrants and even floating pumps to draft directly from lakes .\n\nThat alone deserves an award in my book, now if we could only get direct drafting engine to engine.\n\nBut not enough there, you also got dry risers that allow you to get water at pump pressure to your attack line inside a building. I have to say BRAVO to the developer for taking this to the next level.\n\nAs I am progressing in the game I will further this review, but from what I have seen in almost ten hours playing it, I definite must for fans of the genre.\n\nEdit 7/7/2015\n\nMy initial verdict still stands, for fans of the genre a must have, however for the casual player i would suggest to look into titles like 911 First Responders or Emergency 5 as those games give you more bang for the buck since they are supporting mods which keeps the games fresh and interesting, this game unfortunately loses is "New Toy" shine after the first 50 Callouts or so.\n\nAs I said before, there is a ton of potential but it is unrealized for the most part.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2tNSAAlre8","June 4, 2015","true","25.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But it is ridden with many game breaking bugs.\n\nI haven't played that long (half an hour maybe) and already encountered two.\n\nIt started as I was setting up the sound ... and music and fx where gone for no reason ... and that was the foreboding shadow. (yeah, I know that is not game breaking ... but if you encounter bugs here you already get a bad feeling).\n\nA few missions in ...five or so and tutorials still running... I encountered a water source behind a locked door. I got close, let my firefighters exit the truck... and for no reason I got a no path error message... after that the door wasn't clickable anymore. I had to reload the thank god) existing autosave.\n\nThe best thing ... after that I got the tutorial for locked doors...\n\nA few mission later my paramedic refused to bring in the patient ... I had to dismiss the car (with the patient still on the stretcher in middle of street) and call it back in again.\n\nAnd all this in the short time I played.\n\nI don't really want to talk about the sluggish controls ... especially moving the map with mouse seem way to slow.\nKey bindings are hard coded ... are we in the 80th? ... and "wasd" has a hole different purpose than moving.\n\nTo play this game with mouse and keyboard you feel (as a right handed) one arm too short... since the map is scrolled with arrow keys...\nwhich wouldn't matter if you could zoom out enough....\n\nWith a few fixes and it could be at least okish ... until then it leaves a bitter aftertaste.\n\n--------------------------------\nUpdate: I played a little longer and while it can be fun it also revealed even more bugs to me ... as in awkward path finding* or disappearing cars** ...\n\n*= sometimes it doesn't go where you want it to on some tries, but later it does ... makes you loose precious seconds ... the path finding is so bad that you feel glad that it doesn't care about collisions ... cars and humans are simply passing through each other.\n**= in one mission I did think I don't need the ladder and send it home only to see a little later that the fire exit was blocked. So I called it back ... it came, it reacted like it was in place, but invisible and couldn't be used /climbed. which meant to me I also had to load the autosave.\n\nSome mission also don't give you all information ... in some are firemen needed but not displayed ... since I ended up starting that one while had my firetruck send to a different location ... I could only end it without helping them ... (but if I had ended the fire mission first I could have redirected the firetruck on way home, though)\n\nThat all would be acceptable if this game would be early access ... and still in development ... so we could get our hopes up that these issues will be fixed eventually.","June 7, 2015","false","19.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

Greatly underperformed =/ This is not even enjoyable. Wellh, lets see:\n\nCons:\n- Station is not customizable, just possible to get functional extras\n- Handling is worse. It is  a hard area even for Emergency series, but as competitor, Rescue had chance. Nope.\nI'm missing multiple selection for staff on mission to give out same command.\n- Staff XP/level is imbalanced, level up skills lacks bigger variety. Training aspects/paths would be a great breakthrough. Staff personal infos are very good - could have combined with skills!\n- There should be better mission information.\n(Spoiler coming!) Having a dive pump is mission critical on a mission with wood piles. Hardly any alternatives, with 3 light FE (avaiable so early as this mission coming) and very-very well instructed firemen maybe managable. But\nbudget-wise absolutely unacceptable.\n(Spoiler coming!) Art gallery fire incident with civilians. Start. Ah, on a high floor? You did not bring a ladder along? Fire has approx. 30 sec advantage now.\n\n\nPros:\n- It is great to see dispatching variety.\n- Vehicle items changeable\n- Tutorial missions are good timed/set before making available those eqipments/vehicles","November 28, 2015","false","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a great game for boosting tactical strategy skills. The only negative part of this game is the lack of missions. The amount of story missions (main missions) are too small.

Everything that is in the game works well, the units and equipment works intuitively, and I had no problems handling any of the missions. This is where the problems start though.\nAt no point did the game feel challenging. A dispatch gets logged, I have more than enough time to wait for each of my units to arrive at the scene before starting the mission. I couldn't see any reason to start missions when the first vehicle arrived rather then waiting for everyone to be there, the fire always started at the exact same point regardless. Once at the scene, some small fire would start and my crew would have all the time in the world to setup, grab any civilians and casually extinguish the fires. This only gets worse once you unlock access to the water/foam/powder tenders as they can mop up any outdoor fire all by themselves in seconds.\nIt may be harsh to judge the game based on this, as I supose it is a more accurate depiction of what actual firecrews face, more chip pan fires than multi-story infernos, however the story missions should have pushed the boat out brought in some terrifying scenarios but instead they all just felt a little limp.\nIt is a shame, I did want to like this game to be amazing, and it's shortcomings could perhaps be forgiven if this was a first attempt, but from what I read about the previous game, it seems a large number of interesting features and mechanics have actually been removed.
