Some of my criticisms may have been addressed by the time you are reading this.\n\nFirstly, I would like to state that I got this game 2 days ago, and I already have 16 hours. In my opinion, the game is the best tycoon game since Transport Tycoon Deluxe.\n\nHowever, there are a few negatives that I would like to address, and because of these few negatives, people are not enjoying the game, or buying it.\n\n- Dumb Name. Why didn't they call it Transport Fever!?! Would have made much more sense as the game is not only about building train lines.\n\n- Minimal Tutorial. Despite this game being a very complex game, the tutorial is almost laughable.  However, there are several community made tutorials to which aided me in learning the game, my favourite one being this one[dl.dropboxusercontent.com]\n\n- Rail Building could do some work. In order to build railway, you must do it in several chunks. This is as the game tries to average out the terrain, so that the rail will not go on a gradient - which can cost an absurd amount of money if the rail goes for too long.\n\n- No Airports, or Boats. The airports I can somewhat understand, however the boats I do not. Each map has a river along it. It is crazy to think that despite this, they didn't put in a chance to add boat lines! I do hope that they add these features into a future update, or even a DLC.\n\n- Only 4 Resources. I understand that with this, they were trying to go for the simplistic approach so that the learning curve isn't to big, however at least give me a chance in a settings menu to have more. The game does have excellent modding support though, and so I am sure that people will make mods in order to address this issue.\n\n\nOnce you look over these issues, it can be seen that the game is amazing. All up I am going to give this game an 8/10, and would still reccomend you to buy it, despite these issues. Also, if they do fix up these key issues, it could easily be a 10/10. Enjoy the game, and should you have any further questions regarding the game, feel free to add me and ask me some questions!\n\n(This is my first proper review, so could you leave me some feedback? Thanks guys!)","October 19, 2014","true","28.4"," 584 of 626 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","584","626","10","11"

Which is a silly thing to do for any new developer.  (I blame the amazing trailer)\n\n\nPro:- You can't build wildly inaccurate track as you can in most games, the track has to be quite straight and realistic causing most initial plans that you would try to reuse from other games like TT and RT to be thrown out almost instantly and real planning to come in.\n- It's quite easy to suddenly turn from profit to loss and loss to profit depending on how badly you have planned that upgrade.\n- The nice looks means you get that enjoyable feeling watching trains whiz past the camera at multiple angles.\n\nMiddle ground:- The micro management is nothing amazing compared to other titles and possibly a little bit simple, but when you consider that it's a début title and they are not asking for €60 it's not bad.\n- Simple, but long game.  The game is quite simplistic so don't expect it to be a challenging, it's more relaxing than challenging.  Once you've figured out the game there is very little to do other than just keep expanding and improving efficiency; It doesn't detract from the game-play, just don't expect things to change with every new game.\n\nCon:- The game is pretty simple, and easy to win once you figure out what it's people want.  As much as to be expected with a début title.\n- Town and resource placement is almost equidistant resulting in the same planning working for every map, and every town.  So after you have a working strategy it will never fail, which negates it's replay value.\n- No random events.  If you've put a line down that makes a profit, it will continue to do so unless you change something.\n- No AI companies.  It gets lonely with no competition.\n- The collision detection in this game is quite poor and lack of certain types of junction and crossroad make some types of planning impossible.\n\n\nConclusion:This may not be an amazing AAA game, but compared to what else is available it's okay.  The graphics certainly make up for the lack of content in the game, and if you are into modding, (which is rather easy by the way) you can add plenty of additional content.\nEven though this game is quite simple and doesn't contain much content, the developers continuously upgraded and improved the game around it's fans, and as such the features it does have are quite enjoyable.\n\nThere isn't much replay capability once you've found the most efficient engine, and built all the lines.  The map generator is rather simple, and although new maps are initially a challenge.  Once you've built a profitable company with a dozen lines, the rest of the map loses it's importance other than just to "connect everything".  An AI opponent would be all it would have needed to keep the momentum going.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone that liked games like Railroad Tycoon or Transport Tycoon, but never really got into the heavy micro management or accounting side of things.  If you just want to play with some trains, this is a good game for you.","September 3, 2015","true","329.6"," 236 of 250 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","236","250","9","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aslerudi/recommended/304730/","aslerudi","Divine Alexandra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aslerudi/","135 products in account","The transport tycoon genre isn't the most popular genre, and in the last years we've not seen many new ones pop out. There's been some, but most of them haven't cut it. The last still good transport tycoon is OpenTTD, which is well over 15 years old, so that says a lot. Is Train Fever the true next succedor or just another failed attempt to recreate the true glory of the classic transport tycoon?\n\nFirst of all, Train Fever looks gorgeous. It is by far the best looking transport tycoon that exists. Every part of the graphics is very well done, and the world looks beautiful (albeit a bit empty at times). Everything from the rail tracks to trains and buses to cities, they are all carefully crafted and you can truly enjoy the result. The game is almost hypnotizing, and I find myself spending a lot of time just following the small trains around, moving through the landscape and the result of my hard work as a rail entrepenour.\n\nNow, graphics is only one thing, more importantly is the gameplay. To coorelate to the graphic part, the game is very dynamic. Cities will over time grow and change visual appearance. Building style will change to fit the current era, and the pedestrians in the streets. Vehicles get new replacements, and the stations and bus stops change appearance as well. Cities will grow when you supply it with passenger services and goods, or simply create a local bus route in the city. When the city grows it's also an indicator of you most likely earning money as well. The cities grow dynamically, adjusting to the terrain, so no two cities grow in the same way, resulting in relatively diverse cities spreading across the map.\n\nA key thing in the game is that every person is a simulated entity, with a home, workplace and destination. Unlike older games, simply attaching a station to a city won't do anything in itself, you need to connect the cities people actually want to travel to. This means that a station with for example a 100 passengers, a train approaching won't necessarily take all of them despite having space. You can luckily easily see where they're heading by simply clicking the station, and it gives you an overview over what lines the passengers are waiting for. Of those 100 passengers, 50 of them could be for one train line, 40 for another, and 10 for the local bus.\n\nPassengers are despite this relatively easy to manage. It's recommended to start with internal bus/tram routes, then connect cities with buses. After time, the demand will be high enough for you to use trains, effectively being able to connect several cities in one route. Now, cargo is something else however. Cargo in Train Fever is very tricky to wrap your head around. It's heavily based around demand. If a city has demand for goods, the factories will produce exactly as much as is demanded, if they have the resources supplied for it. It never produces more. A single factory can have a production up to 400 (which is quite a lot), supplied with only one of each sub resource source (a steel mill for example requires iron ore and coal, but only one factory of each), as production scales with it. The most efficient way to deal with cargo is by using trucks, as they are frequent and cost efficient, easily allowing you to see if a route is profitable or not.\n\nNow, a key element in Train Fever is the upkeep. Unlike other transport tycoons, laying roads and tracks is cheap. Very cheap. Trucks and buses have moderate upkeep (it's pretty reasonable, and will usually end up in profit), while trains have HUGE upkeep. The upkeep scales over time, an old train has signficiantly higher upkeep, forcing you to replace engines often. This however is quite easy, as you can allocate automatic replacement of a line in your route planner.\nAs time passes, new, more powerful engines will be able, but they will also be more expensive. This approach forces you to have efficient and profitable train routes. A train route can either have million losses or million profits, depending on how well managed it is. I've found that a good approach is to have double track passenger lines with 3-5 stops, with two running trains. As long as you don't overextend your passenger trains, they will be fine (you don't need too many wagons or the fanciest engines).\nCargo trains are a whole different story, and something I struggle with heavily. If I start early on building one, I can get a line with 3 stops to profit, with roughly 150-200 cargo being transported. Establishing a new route in modern times turns out to be harder. If you can managge it right, it will give a decent profit, but in the end it just isn't worth the hazzle. With passenger trains you can easily set up a route with 5+ million in profit, and you can make several of them.\n\nAnother thing in Train Fever is transport time. A person or cargo will in total time spend no more than 20 in-game minutes, including walking to the station and switching lines. This means that long cargo lines have limited efficiency, and that passenger routes cannot be too long. Roughly 10 minutes for trains is decent, and a minute for buses. Trucks can go down to 10 seconds on busy routes. This system works hand in hand with the passenger entity system. If a route takes longer than 20 minutes in total, the person will use their car or simply not go (as far as I know).\n\nI believe that's most of the game's elements that's worth mentioning.\nThe game has a good modding community, and I recommend picking up some mods as it can extend the fun of the game heavily.\n\nVerdict!\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous looking\n- Realistic and satisfying simulation\n- Fun to play\n- Easy to manage with a good UI\n- Challenging\n- Easy to mod\n\nCons:\n- Cargo system is simply annoying\n- The economy isn't satisfactory for some\n- No planes or ships\n- Steep learning curve (this can be seen as both good and bad, but I feel many will feel it's on the bad side)\n- Can feel repetitive after a while\n\nTo conclude:\nTrain Fever is definitely worth playing if you like transport tycoons. It looks beautiful, and it feels a bit like managing a model railway. It's fun, and gives for many, many hours of gameplay. It takes time to learn, but as you eventually get to know your ways around it you'll feel a sense of achievement. It's challenging, but in a fun way. The stock selection is a bit sparse, but a few mods will change that. The cargo system is ridiculously hard to manage.\nIn overall, a very good game, but I'm usure as to whether people will accept it as a "true" succedor to previous installments. Personally I won't ever touch any of the old games again.\n\nScore: 8/10\n"like skyrim but with trains"","February 25, 2015","true","193.5"," 146 of 155 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","146","155","8","7"

Why use drag and drop when you could just click once to start and click another time to just finish a segment then accept it or move the ending point. Not to mention you have to build segment by segment, can't do multiple points. Really annoying when you're building complex paths.\n- Bridges and tunnels are a pain to build and they're way too high/low. Too much collision during building overall.\n- Rails can't cross eachothers. You can't control what you wanna bulldoze so you'll end up destroying the 2 segments of a crossing when you only want one.\n- No AI\n- To replace a vehicle, it needs to go to a depot and you have to change them manually one by one ... REALLY ? After 25 years, I had like 30 vehicles and couldn't bear having to micro manage this part. Stopped playing right away on my first game. Depot aren't really fun to manage, trains don't need to service.\n- The cargo chains are limited (but mods seems to fix that)\n- The first 50 years are boring to me, not a lot of vehicles available (6 engines maybe ?) and they're extremely slow.\n- Can't upgrade a station, have to pause the game, destroy it then build the new one. Stations limited to 5 platform. But since one line seems to use only one platform, you don't need more right now.\n- Simplistic : the economy, the train tracks, etc. Did I mention the economy ?\n- No map editor (yet)\n\nAnd I'm probably forgetting some stuff.\n\nMost of those points can be fixed but there are too many problems right now to make it really enjoyable.\n\nI'm optimistic and hope they will sort everything out cause it got good foundations.\nAnd hopefully, mods will make this game really complete.\n\nNow, I don't recommend it, it's not finished and can be really frustrating. We'll see how they patch that game up.","September 5, 2014","false","38.8"," 740 of 981 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","740","981","5","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banzaimonkey/recommended/304730/","banzaimonkey","banzaimonkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banzaimonkey/","391 products in account","I've played a lot of economy sims, from the Original Sim City (with 256 colors) through the reboot, as well as the original Railroad Tycoon, 2, and 3, Sid Meyer's Railroads, Transport Tycoon Deluxe and OpenTTD, A-Train, Locomotion, and others. I have a long history with the genre, so I've played the best games and maybe my standards are a bit high, but I was hoping that Train Fever would make a splash and bring something fresh to the genre. It sadly does not.\n\nLet's start with the good parts. The graphics are excellent as you can see from the screenshots (at least when you're zoomed in), and watching the trains run using the chase cam is pretty relaxing. The camera is very well done and the scenery is nice, from water to trees to lens flare. Not having played the $4000 Train Simulator I can't compare the graphics but I think there's probably a price differential to consider.\n\nSo, on to the rest of the game i.e. the economy, laying track, running trains (technically there are busses and trucks too) and such. This is where the game falls flat. Your economy is based on transporting people between towns and different types of businesses (think RCI from Sim City), or industrial goods. The industry component feels a bit like an afterthought and is way less detailed than, say, Transport Tycoon or even Railroads. I was hoping for something like Transport Tycoon's shipping tables, or OpenTTD's town growth ruleset.\n\nLaying track is tedious. The UI is clunky and track placement is frustrating. To place track you click and drag, and then click a checkbox or cancel button. They did this so they can hide an elevation button in the confirmation popup, but it's awkward. There are a combination of things that make track hard to place: Minimum turn radius, arbitrary collisions with things like terrain, rivers, rocks, roads, etc. It's sometimes impossible to build a bridge or an intersection so you get stuck. By comparison, placing track in Railroads was amazingly simple, and still built decent-looking lines most of the time. OpenTTD gives you way more feedback and control over how track gets placed. I think a sandbox mode might help with the track building parts.\n\nRunning trains is tedious. The first trains that you get are super slow. They take forever to get anywhere. Vehicles eventually cost too much to maintain and need to be replaced, which means selling them and setting up new ones from scratch. To unlock more trains later you have to wait 50 years of game time, which is several hours at max game speed. The content gating sucks. Also you need a positive bank balance after 50 years (which you can get by taking up to 10,000,000 in loans to cheese ahead). Repeat that process for 200 years or so. 1850-2050. Managing routes and trains and track and depots is a pain, mainly because placing track is so finicky, and the UI is not streamlined for things like upgrades and replacements.\n\nThe economy is weird. Running trains often seems to be barely profitable. The rail and trains are very expensive, and the trains run so slowly and the income they produce is tiny. It's very easy to run at a loss after spending a ton of time and money setting up a route. From this respect, I feel like the simulation difficulty is similar to Railroad Tycoon, but there's a lot less information provided to you about markets, supply, and other things you would need to make informed decions about your lines before you build them. I suppose the saving grace here is that you can dip into 10 million dollars in loans to figure things out.\n\nOnce you've actually built the route the UI is pretty good about telling you how frequently your transportation runs (e.g. bus every 8 minutes) and how much money each vehicle earns and costs you. I guess you can just bulldoze stuff that loses money. But after all that time invested in getting the track to actually connect, and setting up the routes, this just kinda knocks the wind out of my sails.\n\nThe final aspect that's missing is motivation. For me as a player there's really no reason to continue playing. There are no objectives to complete, no subsidies to chase after, no AI opponent to run out of business or perform a hostile takeover on. There's really no carrot to entice me to stick through some of the tedious game mechanics.\n\nIf the track placement and UI were more streamlined so I could focus on running a rail business, I might have the patience to figure out the nuances. But as it stands it's just frustrating to play. Once I get a route setup that makes money I don't want to touch it anymore.","September 7, 2014","false","5.7"," 357 of 493 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","357","493","0","7"

In its current state I would probably rate it about 5½ out of 10, just into the positive. Anyone who has played and enjoyed Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Sid Meier’s Railroads, or Railroad Tycoon III will probably enjoy playing Train Fever but there are quite a few things that need fixing about it.\n\nThe object of the game is simply to build a road and rail network then use trains, trams buses and trucks to transport people and goods at a profit. There are no competitors and no goal other than the satisfaction of making a success of your transport empire.\n\nThe quality of the graphics are a lot better than the games above however even on my PC, which is very high spec, Train fever suffers badly from spikes at the end of each game month and especially at the end of each game year as the in-game finances are calculated.\n\nThe road/rail construction takes a lot of getting used to and can be quite frustrating at first. You try to build a line and at the last moment there is an unexpected collision with something or the slope is too high. Bridge/tunnel building are particularly difficult as you have no idea how high or low you need to go and how much run-up is required either side. Get it wrong you either pay to demolish it or go back to your last save. TIP: Save before starting ANY construction in this game.\n\nThe world the game map is set in is a weird mixture. The vehicles and buildings are all quite clearly German. The town names are all from the UK rail map and the currency is dollars! There are industries you can connect up to each other and deliver goods to the towns to make them grow but there are only three industry chains:\n\nForest – Sawmill – Goods\nOil – Refinery – Goods\nCoal/Ore – Steel mill – Goods\n\nEven Transport Tycoon, which must be about 20 years old now, had a more complex industry set up than train fever and in TTD you could finance new industries yourself which you cannot in train fever.\nPassenger and goods for both road and rail require different stations although they can share road/rails.\n\nMy biggest gripe by far about Train Fever is the lack of a decent manual/tutorials. You really are dropped in the deep end with no help whatsoever on most of the complexities of the game. I’ve been playing now for over 130 hours and I still have not fully figured out things like the rail signal system and the behaviour of the people who populate the game and why the do/don’t use the available transport.\n\nA game take ages to play. Despite my 130 hours at it, I am yet to reach the end of the timeline, in fact I am not half way through. I seem to have spent most of the time re-loading/redoing constructions trying to get them to work, but even so, to do the full timeline without going back could take days if not weeks.\n\nTO THE DEVELOPERS\nPlease put an undo/wind back time function.\nMore complex industry chains required.\nEnable station enlargement without demolition\nFix the end of month/year spikes\nFix a bug where some passengers disappear between stations (perhaps the fall out?)\nPRODUCE A DECENT MANUAL!!!\n\nThis game is really a virtual train set and overall I have enjoyed playing Train Fever but it could be so much more!\n","December 16, 2014","true","522.2"," 82 of 95 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","82","95","4","1"

However, I've found out you can just easily borrow money (by $100,000 increments) and it looks like there is no limit to that.\nBasically, it is up to you to decide if you want to make this game challenging (by not borrowing money) or make it easy by spending carelessly and hitting the borrow money every 2 minutes.\n\n\nINITIAL REVIEW (04/09/2014):\n\nThis game is fun and works pretty well! I completely get the passenger side of things but I really don't get the cargo things and the tutorials are really basic (they don't even mention the cargo).\n\nI had a lot of fun playing this game so far.\nHowever, there are a few annoying things:\n- the mouse to edge of screen scroll doesn't work well at all so I just use my keyboard to move the camera. (This is definitely the most annoying thing of the game, I mean, edge of screen scroll is the base of any simulation/strategy/tycoon game)\n- upgrading train stations (making them longer or adding lanes) is really frustrating because you need to destroy the existing one and buy a new one instead. This becomes really hard when the city developed itself around your first station. You end up destroying all the buildings around.\n- line management for trains is a bit annoying sometimes and you can end up with 2 trains on the same lane for an unknown reason and the 2 trains end up waiting for each other without moving so you just lose a lot of money until you notice the issue and sort it out.\n\nI hope the devs will continue to work on the game and publish updates in due time to optimize the game.\n\nWhat I love:\n- Decent graphics with huge zoom into the towns\n- huge random maps\n- cities development - you can really see the impact of your transport business\n- building tool easy and efficient\n- line management is really easy and effective for buses\n- challenging - Banished effect there: everything goes well then everything goes to s**t very quickly due to bad planning\n- the soundtrack!!!\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who love Sim City or similar and want to focus specifically on transportation development instead of building the town yourself.\nHowever, the price is a bit high. I've got it with the 10% pre-order discount but I would recommend getting it on sales for $20-25 at the most.","September 5, 2014","true","34.8"," 97 of 121 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","97","121","0","4"

I want to like it, it's not a /bad/ game, it's just severely lacking in... everything.\n\n- There's no artificial intelligence, so don't expect competition.  You're on your own to play at your own pace; not a bad thing, but not very exciting either.\n- The game is excruciatingly slow.  Even on the x3 speed setting, you will mindlessly stare at your monitor, waiting for money to roll in, to continue your expansion.  Even when it does roll in, there's not much to spend it on, because...\n- There's no content.  Train Fever presents you with new vehicles, rarely, and when they arrive, it will always better than the last one.  You're never given multiple vehicles where "one might be better than the other depending on play style/situation."  No, the latest vehicle is always the best, both in capacity and speed.\n- There's a severe lack of content.  Yeah I said it about the vehicles, now I'll say it about the industry.  There's wood, iron, coal, oil... goods... uhm... people... oh that's it.\n- Upgrading vehicles is a chore.  The game, thankfully, gives you a replacement option when it reaches end-of-life to be replaced with the same or better vehicle.  However, if you want to manually upgrade your vehicles to a new one, you have to send it to a depot, wait for it to arrive, sell it, buy a new one and add the new one to the line.  Why can't we use the vehicle replacement option for "immediate" upgrades?  (Yes, you can choose 25% life to replace, but then you run the risk of replacing new vehicles that don't need it - a waste of money)\n- The game has severe balance issues, still, outside of early access.  You can make more money from a bus or tram route in a city than a rail.  The bus or tram route cost you ~$300-400k to start up or less.  The train will run you millions on track alone, only to turn around and have citizens rarely use the trains.  (Edit 03/03/2015: I later determined that rail, is in fact, a money maker - my apologies.  One superb strategy is to set up your inner-city transportation network with a large stop near your rail depot; citizens will "transfer," effectively netting you income from them twice.  So balance in this respect is no longer an issue.)\n- Don't bother, ever, trying to put road over rail.  Don't bother, ever, trying to put two rail near each other.  The build tools are so ****ed up that no matter how many hours you waste, you can never get things to work out.  Road too steep!  Rail obstruction!  Chaos!  The build tools puts a MAJOR hamper on the ability to construct your routes efficiently; prepare for headaches.\n- The game runs choppy as hell.  Optimization this, improvement that, it's all for naught.  I can't understand why a game with so little going on runs so poorly.\n\nAt the end of the day, I feel no sense of accomplishment and no motivation to keep playing.  It's just not *fun*.\n\nI would love to see new game mechanics to spice Train Fever up.  More resources, more vehicles, competition...","February 28, 2015","false","8.4"," 112 of 147 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","112","147","6","3"

And what's more: this game is still being updated and improved by the developers on an almost weekly basis. I'm not just talking about numerous performance updates, but also improvements on the game itself, many of which came from the Train Fever community.\n\nI think that you'll find the game much more playable and responsive than in September. By far most performance issues have been fixed and many smaller and larger additions to the game have made it so it's still fun to play even after 140 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an active mod community that has made it possible to add many dozens of cool new trains and train cars to the game for free and edit it in just about any other way you might want, such as a winter mode, new industries, an updated UI, cool new train stations, and much more. (Click here for a guide on installing mods in TF.)\n\nAnd finally: this month, a new USA-themed DLC will be released for Train Fever by the developers FOR FREE, which will include 50+ new trains and new American landscapes. I'm going to echo my comment from September here: Seriously, if you like transport sims, GET THIS GAME. You will not regret it.\n\nOriginal review below\n\n(I'm a beta tester. A few screenshots of the game are at the end of my review.) (Click here for a Beginner's Guide to Train Fever)\n\nIf you even remotely like sim games like Cities in Motion, Railroad Tycoon, Transport Tycoon, or even Sim City, you will absolutely love Train Fever. (And if you loved those games, Train Fever will probably ruin your social life... but that's a good thing, in this case.)\n\nIn this game, you get to build a transport empire with buses, trucks, and trains. The maps are huge (even the smallest map size will give you 20+ hours of gameplay) and the graphics are beautiful.\n\nYou can build rail lines, bus lines, and cargo lines at will and connect the many towns and industries to each other. If you do it right, the towns will grow into cities and the industries will up their production - which of course leads to more passengers and goods to transport.\n\nThere is always something going on; new vehicles are introduced regularly and the needs of towns, cities, and industries change and evolve as time progresses. You start your game in 1850, when only a few steam trains are available, but by 1950 you will have seen a huge selection of trains (including electric and diesel trains), as well as many different cargo trucks, cars, and buses. None of them will last forever, so make sure to replace them with a newer model when they get old!\n\nYou can also follow all trains, buses, trucks, and even individual passengers up close if you want, so if you feel like enjoying the scenery (and it is absolutely beautiful to watch), just ride along with your trains. Every person in the game has a set house, a set job, a place they like to shop and a place they work, and you can follow them around if you like. Whether they take your transportation or (from about 1900 on) their own car, depends completely on you.\n\nSeriously, if you like transport sims, GET THIS GAME. You will not regret it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=306690562\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305732972\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305733010\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=306601090","August 27, 2014","true","171.9"," 123 of 169 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","123","169","0","21"

The strongest influence on Train Fever is Transport Tycoon. The Train Fever website acknowledges this by including a small section devoted to the history of this genre. While Train Fever attempts to resurrect and bring rail and transport management back to modern gaming, it fails at standing out among other recent similar titles.\n\nTrain Fever tries to be the Jack of All Trades. It includes city public transport, inter-city travel, and cargo supply line management. By putting all these features into one title, not one of them feels fully fleshed out. It may gather a curious audience who has played a game that simulates one of those features well, but it will not hold their attention for long as gamers will find their favorite feature lacking.\n\nThe cities are not as large as cities presented in games like Cities in Motion, and the populations are very small. Most cities will start with a population under 200 in 1850. Unfortunately, by the year 2000, it will be a struggle to get their populations north of 1,000. The cities grow  dynamically, depdending on how far the residents can travel on your networks in the space of 20 minutes and how well supplied a city is with finished goods, but they never feel like a metropolis. Managing travel within a city may be done with 1 or 2 bus lines, easily getting 80% line usage from the population. The population is not divided by class, either, and every person feels the same, with random destinations (one building each) for home, work, shopping, and leisure. Which one a person picks to travel to seems random, and times passes so quickly (1 day per second), that there is no illusion this person is alive with a real schedule to keep. Cities are so small that many players have stated they do not bother with public transportating within the city limits and focus solely on intercity transportation.\n\nIntercity passenger transportation is a bit more interesting. Traveling from one city to another will be the first task undertaken that the passengers cannot fulfill themselves by just walking. Establishing a connection between two cities also jumpstarts the growth in both cities and you will see an immediate benefit in population growth. The newly created residents now have a chance to have one of their destination buildings be in a different city than their home. The player has a choice of using bus lines, tram lines, or rail lines to complete the connections. Rail is the fastest way to travel throughout the game, but it is the most expensive to build infrastructure, maintain it, and run it. The running costs of one train will dwarf the running costs of an entire bus fleet or tram fleet. Due to this, many players opt for focusing on road connections using trams and buses. Trains are the fastest vehicle, but due to their expense, most lines can only afford one or two trains, which makes  for long waiting times at train stations. Trams and buses are slower, but running an entire fleet will shorten the station waiting time dramatically. I actually got passengers farther using light rail trams compared with using trains. Late in the game, the costs for running trains increases dramatically, and passenger rail lines are very difficult to make profitable.\n\nWhen it comes to cargo transportation, the game feels weakest. There are only three production lines, and each line ends in the same generic cargo type "finished good." The lines are:\n\nIron Ore + Coal -> Steel Mill -> City\nTimber -> Lumber Mill -> City\nOil -> Refinery -> City\n\nPlayers have an option to ship cargo via trucks or by rail.  Trucks can only carry a few tons at a time. Rails need large amounts of cargo in order to be profitable, but it's easier to make a cargo line profitable via rail than it is a passenger line, keeping in mind that freight trains generally have much high running costs than passenger trains. Unlike passengers, cargo has no set destination and can be hauled to any facility that accepts deliveries. This seems like a step back for the genre. Even Simutrans, an open source project with low resolution sprites that look like they were regurgitated from old DOS games, has more production lines with business contracts that provide destinations for all cargo. The one interesting idea that Train Fever presents is that producers will not manufacture without demand. Unless the entire production line is hooked up, nothing will produce. The only way to make a facility produce more is to increase the demand, and that starts at the end of the chain by providing more outlets for the finish goods and working your way up to transporting more raw materials. Unfortunately, the execution of this idea seems lacking. On a small game map, it is possible to supply every city from one cargo line. It does not matter which line you choose, as they all end in the same type of finished goods. Any delay on your line will kill productivity. Train is old and needs to be replaced? You had better put the new train on the track first before getting rid of the old fella as production immediately starts dropping when the line is not serviced. If you want a supply line challenge, try Railroad Tycoon III. Even Railroads! has a better transportation model, as each city will have a variety of needs to be filled.\n\nRouting in Train Fever is the best part of the game, but it can be frustrating. The auto-recalculations of routes at various points in the game sometimes make the game stutter. Routes can also change based on traffic density, turning your nice straight bus route into a twisted death pretzel over time. Rails present some fun puzzles as you try to figure out how to extend your lines without causing train collisions. You can use signals to help with this, but you are limited to simple switches, tunnels, and overpasses on your rail lines. No double-crossovers or four-way diamonds allowed. Designing the throat to a high-traffic station is a pain as you map out where each simple switch enters and exits the throat, and you end up extending the station throat almost halfway to the next town in order to accomodate each one. Station planning is important as you cannot upgrade your station once it is placed. Need a longer platform? Stop all your trains, tear down the old infrastructure, and build an entirely new station. Need more platforms? Same thing. Unless you already have five, then you're at your limit and need to build an entirely new station elsewhere near the city. While train routing is realistic (no trains passing through other trains on the same track), the actual track constructs are limited in scope. Railways X provides a more satisfying layout modeler with far more tools to build interesting crossings and signal systems.\n\nTrain Fever has a laundry list of features that made me want to play the game. Unfortunately, each one of these features on its own is handled better by other (and often older) titles. By trying to do so much, Train Fever feels like it glosses over what makes transportation and rail management games fun to play.","November 15, 2014","false","274.8"," 206 of 300 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","206","300","4","4"

(Railroad Tycoon, 2, and 3, Sid Meyer's Railroads, Transport Tycoon Deluxe and OpenTTD) I was really looking forward playing train fever and i'm pleased with the game so far. The primary focus of the game is it's realism trough time and i really like the gameplay that comes with it.\n\nGraphics: Amazing ( i'm running the game all maxed out and it's very smooth) the vehicle details are amazing, they look and sounds as they do/did.\n\nGameplay: very good and easy to learn.\n\nMy first game (easy/flat and small map) was really to learn and understand the game. My game lasted from 1850 to 2050 in over 10 hours of play ( i don't know how other people can rate this game with so few hours of play).\n\nThe 1850 to 1900 period: everything is quite cheap and you need quantity to make up for the  slow speeds. creating your network is very easy.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1950 i upgraded my trains, downsized my fleet and had to close down a few branch lines to keep my finances in\nthe green. ( Ihad build way to much lines and my frequency way way too high, beginners mistakes) the quantity of road vehicles decreased even further. At start i thought upgrading vehicles was time consuming, but in the 3rd upgrade round it took me less then 5 minutes for over 60 lines with a total of 250 vehicles at start. Trains are also easy to replace if you build a depot that is always reachable or build a depot at the start and the end of the game.\n\n1950 to 2000: Wonderful era of fast loco's and powerfull loco's but not really eco fiendly. their upkeep is amazing so only usefull on main routes. The game offers some other loco's wich are not that fast but are fast accelerating, so perfect for branch lines.\n\n2000 to 2050: if you make it this far money should not be an issue anymore, towns have grown so much that there are enough passengers for all of your lines to make a profit.\n\nTip: if you have trouble keeping in the green make sure you start early with factory's to upgrade. this will generate a lot of money. to do so supply the factory's with raw materials. (raw material sit grow with the factory, so one site/source of raw material is enough to supply one factory (keep this in mind opentdd players, i made this mistake too) to make sure the factory grows fast  you need to provide a conection between the factory and some towns around it ( click on town names to see how much cargo they want). by doing so the factory wants to produce a lot of goods. My steel mill had 2 incoming lines each good for 2 milion a year. and 4 outgoing lines suplying city's, all for 1 million a line. this means a total income of 8 million a year!\n\nTip 2: Planning, for passaenger service to be profitable you need a steady network with good coverage,plan this from the start. not all lines can be main lines this will be way too expensive later on in game. a early planning of what will become your main line and wich lines will become branch lines saves a lot of money later in game.\n\nTip3: Group stations, click on the station icon above a station, a popup window will appear. click on group and then click the station icon of a other station next to it.\n\nMy second game was way more organised and even better to play even on medium dificulty, at the moment i'm playing a Hard game and untill now i am still in the green.\n\nConclusion: I played almost 70 hours so far, the game is definitly worth the €25,- If you like this genre learn to play this game and be suprised with it. It will take you some time to learn but it is worth it. Updates can only make this game better and diversity in vehicles will only make this game even more fun to play.\n","September 9, 2014","true","157.4"," 88 of 116 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","88","116","0","0"

The developer released a new update addressing performance issues regarding stuttering. They improved the game engine to utilise the processing capacity better by improving multithreading of calculations. Therefore the game perfomance increased and plays overall much better. This is a great improvement and ensure the game is stable for the long run.\n\nUpdate 27/11/2014:\nToday the game is been patched again, featuring animated road and rail crossing where vehicles stops for the train. There is also a new wagon to carry wood. Therefore I can say the developer really trying to improve the game constantly and they working hard to get the game to work on everyones computer. There is some fixes for the new Intel HD4xxx, but make double sure you laptop support the game's hardware prerequisite.\n\nUpdate 12/11/2014:\nThe developers constantly patching the game and today I've receive waypoints. This greatly enhanced the gameplay and options available. Before waypoints was there, it was a struggle to specify which line the train must use and which line not. Now I can assign a train to stop at a specific platform, drive on a given track and much more. I highly recommend the game now after all the effort being put into the game by the developers. I'll give this now a 7/10 and after the mods, 9/10!\n\nOriginal review:\nThis is a pretty game, nice to look at, decent graphics and lots of details. But this game is pure basics, you cannot compare this with other game like OpenTTD or Transport Tycoon, nor Railroad Tycoon or other transport related games out there. This game is unique in its own way.\n\nTo list the good things:\nNice graphics\nBasic gameplay\nExcellent modding support at train-fever.net\nFreedom to build rails everywhere :) Train Fever!!!\nThe downside:\nNot exacly a clone of Transport Tycoon, lots of things change, actually simplified\nLack of variety of freight types to transport, there is only 4 different types: coal, iron ore, oil and goods\nThe game is still in its early stages, I wouldn't say its suppose to be early access, because the game working stable on my computer and the base game is there as it is supposed to be, but lack additional content which was expected, like water transportation, more variety of locomotives and carriages, ect.\nThis is more of a surveying simulator, lots of collisions and bridge pillar limits. A steep learning curve to know what can be done and what not, when building rails or roads.\nI'll give this a 5/10, but with the mods available and awesome modding community, 7/10 will suffice. Make sure to get the mods. Its like Skyrim was, good game, but 10 times better with mods!\n\nMany people have trouble to run this game, usually the same people moaning over and over. Therefore, make SURE you have the right hardware as listed above. Don't even think this game will work with Intel graphics, many players complained about this. And also look out if you graphics card support OpenGL 3.2.

But it is absolutely not worth £19.99.\n\nThe game seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. It's certainly not indepth enough to be a Tycoon game but what little financial aspects there are get in the way of it being train set. It's almost pretty enough to be a nice looking simulator but it still looks too much like a basic business simulator to represent any form of reality. It's almost decent enough for railway enthusiasts but what it has is often so poorly represented that any enthusiast would find it more frustrating than entertaining.\n\nThe game just doesn't know what it is. I have a very high Spec PC, so it runs fine on high-detail for me, but loading times and end of month freezes are still just a part of the game's threshold.\n\nThere's not very many locomotives and what it does have isn't always the finest choice for operation. The game feels unbalanced and often stupidly easy - because issues aren't raised on a scale of micromanagement. Unlike older, superior games such as Transport Tycoon, you don't get told if something's not turning a profit. It can just continue for years onwards. In direct contrast, the track restrictions and what you can and can't do in the game makes for a ridiculous catalogue of somewhat bizarre discrepancies. Engines won't use a two line terminus, meaning that no matter what you might try, terminii will become clogged. At junctions, engines can't use diamond crossings - the developers have added diamond crossOVERS but nothing else - and the game's attempts at being 'realistic' end up stopping any 'proper' set ups from being built. This means that trains are pretty much stuck to their own personal road. Shockingly, this isn't how railways work. Roads, not even as bridges, cannot be built over rail, and the track can only curve so far. Fair enough, it's realistic in terms of speed and groundwork, but it can't actually FUNCTION like a real, working railway - when so little of the game's surrounding content could in any way be a decent representation of a 'Transport' game, does it have any purpose? Track building is the game's only challenge.\n\nIt's bizarre that the game tries to enforce realism while kicking it for six in so many other departments.\n\nThe game is by no means a terrible one, it just seems very, very confused as to what it wants to be. I still play it, but I purchased my code for well below the £19.99 RRP here and if I spent so much on it I'd probably feel robbed. It simply isn't a tycoon game, simulator or train set - it's a pretty, if somewhat bare little diversion.\n\nI'm sure the devs worked hard, but their communication seems pretty damned poor, the DLCs completely lacking, mods only available in German, updates rare and they intend to just kick off another game instead of improving this one or giving it the support it needs.\n\nIt's not a good replacement for 'Tycoon' games of yore. It's not a train set. It's a train... thing that doesn't quite understand its own aims. And while it's great for like, £10 or £15, it's simply not good value. There's greater playability and diversity in Railroad Tycoon 3 for just over a third of the price - and that was released so long ago it could be in poundland by now!","September 9, 2015","false","14.7"," 99 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","99","135","4","2"

After spending some time in the game I have to say that it's not perfect but I love it.\n-This is more of a transportation simulation game than just a game solely about trains which is fine because every mode of transport can help make your trains more profitable. Well served cities will grow and provide more revenue for the systems you set up. The times change and transport demands change with it, the train route that made alot of money in 1900 might not do so well when people start getting cars but with a few route tweaks it might make even more money.\n-This game is not easy and the only guides seem to come from the community but there is a lot of help out there. Certain building aspects continue to be frustrating, like terrain collisions and  "not enough space" when clearly there is space but there always seems to be another way to make it work. Sometimes you just have to plan ahead and expect that city growth will mess you up so lay out things early. I also can't earn trophies due to the game claiming i'm using mods when I haven't used or have any.\n-The game is menu heavy. It seems that everything you do causes yet another menu and view to come up some of which seem un-needed and even though my computer is above the min. requirements, if too many views or menus are open it will crash especially later when I have a lot of vehicles moving in all directions.\nWhile the game is not perfect it is very rewarding when all of the transportation lines are moving well and making good money, this is when its fun to just watch. For people that have enjoyed the tycoon type games, this is like that but without having to negociate various contracts.

When I've paid off my initial loan and have millions to spend, I just can't be bothered to spend it on anything. In Transport Tycoon I could spend hours perfecting a train line, just to make it better and more efficient. In Train Fever I just don't care. Why? For one because building rail or roads is just too tedious and clunky. Mainly however because the game just isn't very fun.  Almost everything is clunky: the menus, the interface, building things.\n\nOne thing that I like though, the very thing that made me buy the game: the graphics. The vehicles in particular look amazing. The towns and landscapes look okay, but are lacking in variation.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and I've tried several times, but I just can't. If I knew then what I know now, I would never have bought this game.","May 25, 2015","false","5.8"," 152 of 225 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","152","225","8","7"

The negative reviews the people claimed they "would change if it got better" are now just a reminder of the harsh release Train Fever faced (or a deterrant to buy the game toward uninformed people).\nNow Train Fever is a must-have extension to the tycoon genre that is just as enjoyable as any other Transport Tycoon.

Even then it's a reserved reccomendation.\n\nI bought TF on sale, and am enjoying it somewhat. It reminds me quite a bit of Cities In Motion, in that it's using the same game engine, except you can't set prices and there are no victory conditions. Also there is no failure state that I've seen, so TF is technically a simulation and not a game at all.\n\nI have played 175 hours in Sid Meier's Railroads, and loved it. That game has lots of strategy, and it's more about connecting the various types of cargo randomly scattered across the map for a huge profit. Great challenge to see how many points I could crank out in an hour of gameplay. But the track laying was pretty boring.\n\nNow I'm looking at this game's cargo routes and scratching my head. Why the heck is it called Train Fever if the cargo routes are right next to eachother? Why do most of the mines not produce anything? Why can't I make a profit running rail cargo at all? Why is most of my time--and profit--all in road traffic, in this game about trains?\n\nI can only reccomend this game to diehard train fanatics and railroad sim lovers, but even then it's lacking. So, buy on sale. Don't expect things in the game to work properly, like laying track over roads! OMG!

For $35.00 (the retail price as of 10/13/14), I expected some of the above complaints to be addressed by the game’s launch in September, 2014.  Unfortunately, a lot of them weren’t.  I really enjoy plopping down lines and watching my vehicles swarm around the city but am often painfully reminded that keeping up with it all will require more work than it should.  The game has the potential to be something really outstanding once the above issues are addressed.  Until then, it’ll remain as simply an “okay” simulator that could have been so much more."\n\nFull Review:  http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/train-fever/\n\n\n---\n\nBeta First Impressions:\n\nI'm admittedly a big fan of both the "Railroad Tycoon" series and "Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon", so it shouldn't be surprising to learn that I was really excited when I received my press key. My experiences thus far are positive overall. It's fairly simple to get into, despite the game not having an in-game tutorial or campaign levels with which to get you acclimated. At the time of writing (three weeks from launch in September), all that is available is a sandbox mode that lets you choose the seed, map size, and difficulty. That alone, I feel, offers a lot in terms of replay value.\n\nThe biggest obstacle I faced was laying railroad track as it didn't seem to snap to the landscape. Rather, you can tell the track to go up or down. This resulted in some very ugly valleys and hills being created, though this is a minor complaint. I spent most of my time simply watching the vehicles (yes, you can build wagons and road depots) deliver goods based on the lines I set for them.  There are no AI competitors, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on what kind of experience you want.  I also didn't seem to be able to specify cargo pickup/drop-off ques like I could in "Sid Meier's Railroads"...that is, pick up raw goods at point A and hold them until they got to point C.  I simply had to hope that the game knew what I wanted it to do when creating lines with more than two stops.\n\n"Train Fever" is a little pricey compared to some of the other indie games out on the market, but it scratches that "Railroad Tycoon" itch nicely.  Some more gameplay options and more versatility when laying track and creating lines, I feel, would add to the game's current value.  As it stands, I think the game could be reduced in price based on the content it offers...though I reserve the right to hold judgement on any of the above until the game gets out of the development stage and officially launches.  If forced to simply say "yay" or "nay", I'd lean more toward picking it up as opposed to letting it pass by.  If money is tight at the moment, I'd recommend waiting for a sale and then picking it up.\n\n---\n\nBeta Gameplay Videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D73Fa6VFiME\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_hrYLTlz2Q\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ130w26NYY","August 17, 2014","true","49.9"," 65 of 91 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","65","91","0","5"

It had potential. There were bugs, but the graphics were good and the trains were enjoyable.\n\nToday however, I realized how broken some of the parts of the game are. In late game, you get trucks that can carry as much as 18 cargo. This can be oil, coal, "goods" (completed product, doesn't matter what goes in it to make it), wood, or iron. The problem is that the cargo from the production buildings have to be loaded into depots for the trucks to pick them up. The small depot can hold 18 cargo for each of two lines, and the large depot can hold 16 for 5 lines. In a nutshell, your trucks usually leave unfilled or the depot overflows and production (and money) is wasted.\n\nMy second issue is train AI. Unless you take the time to measure out at what times your multi-track station has a train in it and stick waypoints and signals to signal to your train to go into specific lanes, you are hoping that they don't get stuck on the same track, one trying to leave and the other trying to enter.\n\nMy last issue is with the developers. It turns out that the next patch, to be released in early 2016, will be the last. It turns out a big portion of the patch is actually modded content from the community too. Turns out they were working on this new game in secret too because it'll be released around the same time as the patch! I guess that's the age we live in: it's more profitable to abandon what should be considered an early access game (beta game) and release a new one then it is to finish the game you have.\n\nThe game itself had potential, but because the developers are going to abandon it with so many unfinished pieces of the game to fix, I no longer can recommend it. I guess get it on sale if it's less then $6.00, but it isn't worth more then that. Hey,  I guess at least the devs had the courtesy to tell us they were going to abandon development for this game and work on a new one.","December 24, 2015","false","73.2"," 75 of 108 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","75","108","3","4"

I love this genre. I wasn’t bothered with Railroad Tycoon, I could never enjoy it as much. It was less about building an efficient infrastructure that you could tweak and improve to much about finances and a false sense of achievement. This game is certainly in the Transport Tycoon league.\n\nThe game is in no way flawed, early access or broken as many like to point to. The game is as finished as when Transport Tycoon under Micro Prose was released. Only today too many people online, many of them new (lvl1) due to more people gaining access to the internet / switching from console to PC expect all games to be as refined and polished as the big boys do when they release (a clone) a game. If this is not so, like then Train Fever people will do nothing but slate it, rather than use (play) it!\n\nReview!\nThe game offers a good sense of achievement, to have your first passenger line develop into a mixed traffic line with signals keeping trains flowing well is extremely satisfying. You then find yourself extending the line, linking more towns and industry. Increasing profit. Working your factories at maximum production. Just the constant feeling of wanting to start a new project on your map, to develop your game.\n\nOnce you get your system working efficiently for that time period you will then start to earn good money. Money to ♥♥♥♥ about with, to build that mountain pass to reach that pointless town. Or flat, straight stretch to hit 300kmph despite it not making any economic sense.\n\nThe maps are better than I had expected. Big (if you wish) randomly generated maps, each with realistic placing of major towns as in not in a stupid place. It offers a good level of detail as you can see. Most importantly a long route is a long route, and worthwhile.\n\nThe game is actively being updated with real worthwhile updates and so far good communication from the tiny development team. The game doesn’t revolve around Steam, Steam is just the distribution. They and a good community revolve around the Train Fever forums. Very active, very interested in the game and very interested in our discussions.\n\nIts not expensive, its worth the money.\n\nI look forward to the future updates with more features being added. Waypoints being my number one.\n\nSo!\nIf you love Transport Tycoon and would happily play it for weeks, buy this game! Buy it and enjoy it.\n\nIf you didn’t mind/wasn’t bothered about Transport Tycoon, and could consider buying this then buy it. But do not blame the game, blame yourself for buying a game you don’t need/want. I haven’t brought Farming Sim because I don’t give a ♥♥♥♥ about farming, but can’t see why I would need to review it?!?!\n\nMaybe the developers should have emphasised more on the game being a more realistic Transport Tycoon. Not an updated version. I like it…","October 18, 2014","true","296.1"," 49 of 66 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","49","66","0","0"

Turning down the settings does nothing to counteract this issue.\n\nThe second is the building of roads over railways, which is impossible for some stupid reason - you must build the road before the track. Even doing so doesn't guarantee that the game will actually allow you to place the track afterwards. The same goes for building bridges across railway lines and vice versa. It becomes complete headache whenever you need to modify track routes that have roads crossing them.\n\nAnother issue is freight and how industries that start with 0-2 production never seem to increase production. They continue to switch between using your line and not using it, making it impossible to profit from the lines you create. On the other hand, industries producing (usually) 10 items seem to work correctly, increasing based on consumer demand.\n\nThere’s a few other minor limitations which I really hope they patch in the future, such as vehicle listings, track layouts and city growth which are hard to explain but make the game difficult to play.","December 21, 2014","true","202.5"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","0"

Every "bug" that people post here or on forums are usually built-in game mechanics (like slope errors, collision errors, train signals) that people just don't know how to fix because they are so used to sims being a plop and play kind of game with no real thinking involved.

I'm still not going to recommend it in general. But if you've read even this far, then read on and decide for yourself whether you should give this game a try.\n\nAt this time (9/15) the game hasn't had any improvements aside from a few crash hotfixes. It still feels like an early release game, yet it is purported to be gold. There is talk on the forums - none from official sources - that this game will be improved over time.\n\nSo let's keep that in mind - this game was rushed to release, is missing a lot of common features, has awful UI. Many things are non-intuitive.\nFor a "business simulator" a lot of important business data is not available - prices of any sort, cost of maintenance for rails/stations/etc, capacity of same, plenty of other data is nowhere to be found.\nSchedules cannot be set for any vehicle, and only the most rudimentary of waiting orders that are used at your own risk. For a game about logistics, you have little control over the logistics of your vehicles.\nTracklaying is complex and has no undo button or planning mode. This can be very expensive, especially with your first few trains.\nReplacing/upgrading vehicles is very tedious and can throw off the productivity of an entire line. It can take more than an hour with an extensive network of vehicles when upgrading to a new model.\nThis game has very little in common with OTTD, RRT, or even SMR. If you're a long-time transport/rail game fan you'll need to forget all the strategies of the past - Train Fever needs you to play its way.\n\nSo if you want to play this game, you'll have to learn how to work around all those things. Once you do that, you'll still notice the problems, but you'll find a surprisingly complex game underneath. Lots of interesting transport planning to do, with interactive routes. Growing your towns is really fun. A lot of this game is really fun. And, for me anyway, super addictive. I can't think of a game that hooked me so bad.\n\nSo if you're willing to put in 20 hours or so studying and failing and getting frustrated, and then another 80 thinking you know what you're doing when you really don't, you'll probably enjoy this game. I'm sure I'll need to put in another couple of hundred hours before I really feel like I've got this down. It's just a shame it will be this clunky should-be-alpha-early-release version instead of the $35-value-gold-release I was lead to expect.\n\nHere's my original review verbatim from 9/4 when I first bought it. My complaints from this original review are still valid, by the way!\n\nI'm a long time Transport Tycoon/RRT/etc fan - I love trains and business simulations. The business simulation in this is very shallow so far. The limited industries (4 chains) are inconsistent and unpredictable. The limitations of "full load/any load" are pretty annoying, it's difficult and non-intuitive to set up lines where trucks/trains wait until full but also don't clump up.\n\nLaying track is a mix of awesome and annoying. I love that you can adjust the way it sticks to the ground - grading and curves really make a difference. Because of that it would really be nice if you could plan out more than one segment of track at a time. Not being able to upgrade/replace stations easily is frustrating - not only when moving to multiple tracks but also to just adjust an original placement. Again, a planning mode would really help.\n\nTo be fair this is my early impressions, I've only played for a few hours, but honestly playing this pretty much just makes me want to play open TTD. I can't imagine any of the complex logistic chains from OTTD in this game - not only would laying/routing all that track be a nightmare, there's just not the supply/demand available in Train Fever.\n\nIt's a shame too because I was pretty excited for this one for the last year.","September 4, 2014","false","140.8"," 123 of 200 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","123","200","0","11"

This game enables the player to create a transport network with trains, trucks, buses and trams on maps up to 256 square kilometers. You have the full control over your transport empire by building tracks and streets, buying and placing vehicles and managing the lines. Besides passengers, multiple goods can be transported. The developers deliver three mods with the game, one including a sandbox mode where you don't have to worry about money at all and can build your own "model railroad layout".\n\nIn order to get the full potential out of this game, players definitely have to make use of the great amount of mods that are out there waiting for you to explore them. Vehicles from all over the world, stations, industries, assets, texture replacement, total conversions... you name it. The game greatly benefits from this variety - without it, it would not be half as good as it is now. Therefore to all new players or interested individuals out there: Please check out the great library of mods available at the community websites.\n\nTo be honest, right after release, this games was not much more than an open beta. Over time however, the developers fixed a large amount of bugs, added features, improved gameplay and performance and also delivered new and free content in form of the USA DLC. The biggest plus of this game however is without doubt the great modding community that added a huge amount of modifications to the game.\nThe quality of this game might not be able to compete with AAA title. however, given the price you definitely get your moneys worth when buying this game as long as you are interested in transport simulations. Given the sandbox type of games of this genre, the amount of time spend with this game can easy break through hundreds or even thousands of hours for just a few bucks.\n\nMy rating: Vanilla game: 6/10, game with modding 8/10, time for money 10/10\nMy recommendation: buy it and have fun with the mods","February 25","true","406.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Rewarding and addicting gameplay, beautiful visuals, lots of world options. Can build while paused. Post-release updates.\n\nCons: The vehicle choices are very front-loaded, by the year 2000 there's only a few train engines and railcars that are at all useful and only one road vehicle each for passenger and cargo. I expect this to improve with mods or DLCs but I don't see Steam Workshop support coming soon so modding will still require some technical knowledge and tinkering in the game files for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile the graphics are great, I get better performance in much more detailed games, which leads me to believe that there's still plenty of optimization to be done. I've been playing it mainly on Linux but I remember it suffering unnecessarily on Windows as well. It also stutters occasionally on Linux.\n\nThe interface is clunky, sometimes buggy, and lacks inspiration, though some recent updates have improved the first two complaints somewhat. However, I expect to see GUI improvement mods become very popular.\n\nThere's not much variance in the geography, it's basically a green grass field deformed by a randomized heightmap. I'd like to see more variance in biomes and maybe seasons if possible. I expect this to appear in mods or DLCs, though I'd prefer to have seen it in the base game or at least a free update.\n\nBased on recent communications, the devs seem to be relying on the modding community to do a lot of their work for them. I hope they keep in mind that a modding community isn't going to flourish without a great game to build on. This has all the makings of a great game, but it's still got some things to iron out. I hope they keep their priorities in line.\n\nTL;DR: It's fun now, but a cautious buyer might want to hold off and see how the game develops, because it still needs quite a bit of work.","December 25, 2014","true","38.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"

I loved Railroad Tycoon so I was really exicted when I saw this in the Steam-Lottery and even won the game. In short: I can't say I wasted my money (partly due to me not spending any money).\n\nThe game is easy to get into, given you know how these kinds of games play out. If you ever played Railroad Tycoon or Sid Meier's: Railroads you'll know what to do from the start. All the others currently have to rely on Steam guides or trial-and-error to get the basics down. Given the lack of interesting industries (without mods) it's not a difficult game, though I don't think it is supposed to be since most of the fun comes from watching your little trains make their rounds and queue up at busy stations. It's a great game for everyone who ever wanted some miniature model trains but either doesn't have the space, the money, or loving parents who'd buy it for them during their childhood.\n\nDuring my playtime I didn't encounter a single bug.\n\nAs it is right now, the game's performance isn't all that great. I often get lags and freezes at the end of an ingame month and a general decrease in FPS as the game progresses, it always stays at a playable rate (lowest I got was 26 FPS). I think that might be fixed in the future though! There also seem to be a lot of updates, so I'd bet my money on that.\n\nThe game also offers a modding community, which sadly isn't that big. This can and, hopefully, will change as well in the future though.\n\nOverall I see a lot of potential in this game, but I wouldn't spend the full price buying it.\n\nPro:\nNice if you like watching trains do their rounds\nDecent graphics\nMod support\nActive devs\n\nCon:\nPerformance\nLong-term motivation (lack of industries)\n","December 21, 2014","true","89.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","20","25","3","0"

Basicly what im most cross about, is the fact that as an example the later road vehicles has a listed speed of 100 km/h, BUT even with the best roads of the time of the vehicle you cant drive more then 70... thats just not very user friendly. Stuff like that is in the game in many places still.\n\nThat being said i thoroughly enjoyed myself, more so then with any other tycoon since railroad tycoon 2.\n\nBut one other very serious issue in the game to my mind, the AI behind the movement of passenger travel. If i make a train "with no stops" to a city 6 minutes away, and the wait time then becomes 12 minutes, i can get the same passenger transfer with trams, but with only 30 secs wait time and 12 minutes transfer time. That will mean that the passenger will take the tram almost every time. Thats not very logical in my opinion. The real issue with this, is the fact that you can more passengers with the trams for less money, both in terms of /year, and initial investment. Thus trains are not viable economicly in the game unless you play on the biggest map, which even a intel i5-3570 cant handle reliably, if you try to setup lines for all cities. (and only if you use a lot of trains on that perticular line). One of the main ways to remedy would be if the developers fixed passenger embarkment onto trains. It makes no sense that a passenger in 1850 takes as long to enter a train as he does in 2020. Not does it make sense that they seemingly only uses one entrypoint, instead of one per traincar. ex, if you have a train with 15 cars, with 20 passengers capacity each, it simply should take the same time to get onto said train as the same train with 1 car, with space for 20 passengers. At least very close to that.\n\nOne thing id like to see in the future, is something like "station upkeep" being a togglebar, that could help on station turnaround times/passenger embarkment. And something like dining cars and the like.\n\nBut again i cannot stress enough, it really is a good game, with a lot of potential.","October 9, 2014","true","176.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

It has neat animations to show how the different resources and people are transported when not transported on your network, making it so that not everyone is solely dependant on your transportation even if that helps. The town grows at a good speed throughout the game making your transportation efforts visible on the map.\n\nThe build tool is a bit quirky but does what it is supposed to do and you mostly get used to it after a while.

You also have trucks, trams, buses and trucks, but those are mostly used to set up local networks that enables wider access to your trains,\n\nTrain simulation is pretty complex, with lots of factors coming into play: Track curvature, slope steepness, engine power output, tractive power, and weight of the wagons, so a lot of the gameplay is about designing efficient tracks, that allow your trains to navigate through the (fully 3d) terrain in the most efficient way possible; then populating the trains with suitable engines and wagons.\n\nHere I should add that this is unfortunately also the game's weakest point (although it's not such a big deal): laying tracks and modifying terrain is often very quirky. It often takes several tries (and a lot of bulldozing, which also costs you in-game money) to get a track, or junctions, just the way you like it. Crossing rivers and roads is even more complicated, which put me off a bit. All in all, however, while I do think they could have polished this aspect some more, I understand that the complexity of laying tracks is part of the charm of the game, and that how good you are at balancing between length, steepness, curvature and train power will determine how efficient your network will be.\n\nThe economic simulation is surprisingly complex, and engaging. Towns will react to your lines by increasing in size and height (sometimes massively). Despite its complexity, it's easy to pick up after reading a couple guidelines given to you at the beginning of the game. I don't think you'd have any trouble with it if you ever played TTD before.\n\nGraphically it is stellar, and once I got my game going, I often found myself just watching how my trains navigate the network I laid out.\n\nFinally, I'll also add that I've owned this game for a few months before reviewing it, and that the devs have adressed many of the issues that the game used to have, and delivered a lot more content with the free USA DLC. In short, if you like trains and tycoon games, this is a good buy.","March 10, 2015","true","89.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game seems to suffer with load times - loading any save game (which are >= 250MB each...) takes around three minutes; after loading in, there's some slight lag while the game builds up the environment.\n\nGameplay was surprisingly enjoyable. You have control of buses, trams and railways and need to connect up two or more towns and build a successful business. It can be hard at first, but once you've swept past the learning curve it all falls into place. Furthermore, the random terrain generation (seeds) makes each replay a unique experience in its own right.\n\nIt does have some other shortcomings, though. Terrain is annoying; if you make a mistake, you can't rectify it with the terrain tools if it's too close to a structure or river. I was left with two sheer cliffs after demolishing my railway bridge - I could not remove them.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this game a hearty 8.5/10 - it's still got potential, but enough content to keep me interested until the next patches/DLC.","September 5, 2014","true","20.4"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/recommended/304730/","welcomeaboardmate","BlackEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/","501 products in account","A spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon, this game will be very easy to pick up for any fans of the original. It has a very similar feel, though it incorporates some of the better aspects of games such as Cities in Motion and Railroad Tycoon - this includes from Railroad Tycoon the automatic goods transportation at a slow, but nevertheless present rate, meaning they aren't entirely reliant on your company to transport things - as well as the detailed city sector, supply and demand and "line" system from Cities in Motion.\n\nThis means, for example, at a passenger station for trains, you might want to bring in more people from around town via buses and trams that otherwise would not be at the station, and then unlike transport tycoon, it doesn't have a system where "everything at the station boards the first train arriving and then travels to the first stop that train goes to and all unloads". Rather, the game individually simulates everyone in cities, meaning they could have a job in another town, or want to go shop, or leisure purposes - whatever. As a result, they have a specific "line" they want to board, and a specific stop they want to get off at should the line have more than 1 stop. You won't have situations where everyone boards whatever train and travels to wherever as a result, and you will find that new lines that expand to new cities will result in any lines it connects to seeing a boost in passenger usage as some will get off the train and immedietly wait for another line to get to their destination - hence, more money as they pay twice to get there.\n\nThis also presents a challenge as time goes on, because starting in the early 1900s, people begin to get cars to drive about. This means fewer people will want to use mass transit systems you've set up, and you'll have to make your systems faster and more efficient to make it preferable to driving as cars become more widespread. It also presents traffic issues for your buses, trucks, and trams, as they now have to deal with traffic on the road which more often than not is slower than they are.\n\nThese concepts do not apply only to passengers, however. Cargo runs on a similar system - you can't just hook up, say, any coal mine to any steel mill and expect instant cargo. Raw material producing plants have a specific location they want their goods transported to, possibly more than one depending on the size of the industry. Then, that cargo place where the raw materials are delivered has a specific place IT wants to go - usually. I've found that goods are a bit more lenient in this sense, and will allow you to go a bit further away to a neighboring city or something. This also presents a difficult issue because one of the easiest ways to set yourself up for the remainder of the game and never worry about bankrupcy in transport tycoon was to immedietly make a massive freight line that covered a large distance, giving you a lot of money for the distance and speed delivered with every train. You cannot do that in this game. That makes freight LESS profitable than passengers, and means you have to rely on the heavily variating levels of passengers on trains to provide the most money. Even then, trains get progressively more and more expensive to maintain - they are FAR more expensive to keep running than they were in transport tycoon, especially in later stages. To make it more difficult, every item in the game comes in much shorter supply than it would have been in transport tycoon - you won't find hundreds of passengers or freight lining up at a station within a couple years of service. In fact, you won't find hundreds of items lining up for likely a hundred years or more, if ever.\n\nI have to mention the music of course. It's quite catchy. Comparitavely with the other 2 transport tycoon games, it's actually quite good and does a good job of being background music that isn't too flashy or disturbing to the gameplay while at the same time, not too drab to feel boring or something - and it's coupled with a FANTASTIC tribute song to the original transport tycoon theme.\n\nNow, the downsides. The game is currently littered with things that plainly are bugs or things that I'm not sure if they ARE bugs. An example of a bug is passengers and cargo will disappear off things they are being transported on during longer trips, or that while you can make a railroad cross over a road, you cannot make a road cross a rail...which is frustrating. An example of something that COULD be a bug is the lack of ability to make twin crossover tracks, or any crossover tracks at all. 2 tracks can NEVER cross each other for any purpose, which means to do something as basic as a crossover between 2 rails, you have to do 2 sets of alternating switches next to each other, which causes pathfinding issues likely as another bug, and to have rails cross for a different route or something, you need to have one route switch onto the other, then back off again. It could be a bug, but if not, I find it very irritating regardless.\n\nAnother curious thing wrong with the game is it's lack of basic options such as keyboard rebinding, switching units from metric to imperial, or zoom/snap to an object you have selected (making you have to find it yourself using the PIP screen). It also lacks multiplayer or any form of AI opponents - I myself am more a fan of multiplayer in these games than AI, but I know there are people who wish for them or just both in general. The "expansive 256 km squared" maps really aren't that expansive - on large, the maps are 4-6 cities in length...being only 16x16 km in size for the large map. This could explain the lack of multiplayer or AI, because the map would fill up FAR too quickly with other companies.\n\nOverall, I love this game. I have always wanted to see what a transport tycoon game might look like in 3D, and what do you know - here it is. They got the scale and realism right, making it great to look at, and for a team of 3 people I am VERY impressed with their graphics engine they created. This is a difficult game making it hard to recommend to anyone who hasn't played a transportation sim before, but considering the majority of the world has played one, I would HIGHLY recommend it to you fans out there.

Unfortunately, there is a lot more to it than that. I have (currently) spent fifteen hours micro-managing trams, busses and eventually trains. Just when I am getting to have some fun with the trains, all of the busses in one of the towns become end of life and need replacing. There goes an hour sorting that out, back to the trains. Half an hour later, you guessed it, replace more busses. At the moment I am concentrating on moving people around and haven’t even looked at the raw materials and goods aspect of the game. I just want to play with trains and have to mess about with the other stuff to get the required money.\n\nSetting up the busses and trams is fairly straightforward, or so I thought. Apparently there is a twenty minute rule, if a journey takes longer than twenty minutes then the route will not be used, the passenger disappears or the goods never move. This compounds the micro-management by increasing the number of routes required in order to keep them short enough to not fall foul of the rule.\n\nBuilding a train line can be a bit of hard work, especially for your hard drive. The golden rule is if the land you are looking to build on deviates from flat by a jot, SAVE. There is little to assist in surveying and planning a route, mistakes are costly as there is no undo button. You either revert to a previous save or pay to demolish your mistake. Save files for the “large” game are over 70MB.  Placing track is far from intuitive.\n\nThings I would like to see; instead of telling me something is too old and needs replacing give me the option to replace it there and then, three digit vehicle numbers with leading zeros, better surveying tools, warnings when a route is too long, AN UNDO BUTTON.\n\nAm I having fun? Just about. Do I recommend this game? Just about. If you like Transport Tycoon type games I think you will enjoy this. If you just want to play trains maybe suffering the learning curve of the Trainz Surveyor maybe more suited.","October 19, 2014","true","28.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Because I believe it really depends on that.\n\nBasically, if you love to play with trains, trams, trucks and busses and to throw in some tycoon-like gameplay, this will probably be a game for you.\n\nIf on the other hand you are looking for a strategy game, a business simulator or an advanced train simulator, this could disappoint you.\n\nTrain Fever is a middle-of-the-road game when it comes to the balance between an eye-candy, fun transportation game and a hard-core ressource management game.\n\nTrain Fever does have its addicting side though.

First, I think this game is awesome.  So naturally my review is biased, but so is everyone else's.  In order to follow the established trend here is my bullet point list of good and bad traits.\n\nGood:\n-modern graphics engine\n-realistic train physics:\n-speed is adjusted based on angle of curve, incline/decline, weight, and power to name a few of the ones I've noticed\n-tracks must follow the same rules as real world train tracks (eg.  no steep hills, no sharp turns, 90 degree road crossings)\n-train signals are realistic and easy to manage\n-play your way (eg. city management, train empire, trading mogul)\n-easy to use menu and interface\n-dragable windows with real time feedback on anything and everything\n-your actions affect the size of your cities in real time\n-procedually generated so always something new\n-did I mention how fun it is?\n\nBad:\n-no manual / poor tutorial\n-repetative\n-steep learning curve (bad?)\n\nHere's where I defend my review and tell you why all the negative reviews are wrong.  First, the complaint I read the most is that there are too many rules regarding track building.  That is the "simulation" part of the game, trains have a very low tollerance for sharp curves, steep hills, and road crossings.  Get over it!  The other main complaing is the lack of manual, well here you go:\n\nTrain Fever Interactive Gude:  (Link Removed...just search train fever website forums for great interacive guide)\n\nYour welcome!\n\nThe most useful advice I learned is that the maximum travel time for people or goods is 20 mins, and the npc's will pick the quickest route regardless of cost.","September 8, 2014","true","41.1"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

The graphics are clearly great in details and the map builder engine allows each map to be always different.\n\nThe cons:\n- The user interface is TERRIBLE, sometimes I feel I am in some sort of tool like Photoshop with lots of mini Windows instead than having a clear UI designed and themed as a game.\n- The graphics are good, but on auto-generating it you can feel it's not that beautiful. I prefer to play real life maps like England or France and feel like the tycoons of its day building the railroad and connecting historical cities.\n- The options to set up the trains are very limited, even the buses, you can play a few hours but there isn't much to it, not much strategy or required set up to adapt to changes as there aren't that many changes or doesn't seem to.\n- The building tracks engine is terrible. It generates unnecessary climbs or tunnels and requires to invest massive fortunes just to connect to pieces that aren't that unlevelled and in other games are much easier to connect. Ok I know RailroadTyccon is quite unrealistic with certain train tracks but in the end you can connect the pieces without so much hassle and play, which is the point after all, having fun, not realism.\n- Didn't play enough as to know this, but doesn't seem to allow me to build factories or any other sort of business like hotels or pubs which usually increases the game possibilities as you are running a company and not necessarily want to stick to trains only, giving you full control of goods transport and production. Though in compensation you have the buses and roads.\n\nI still haven't played it that much as to completely value it and I'm certain there is more to it than what I've seen, will update this review if I see more pros or I change my mind on certain cons, but so far this is what I saw.\n\nPersonally, having Railroad Tycoon 2 and 3, any of those is more fun from minute 1 and makes me evade from this world consuming hours of my life without realizing, which probes how good they are as games, this game instead made me check the clock several times as I was getting bored and stressed.

This game (at the time of my writing this) has many problems. But I think what the game does do well makes up for its problems. It might help if you go into the game with little to no expectations so that you are less dismayed by its faults. I will list some of the biggest problems I have with the game and then some of the main things I think make the game worth playing.\n\nProblems:\n\n1. Replacing older vehicles is a real chore. The need to keep up frequency on your lines really compounds this problem. Also there is no way to disable the annoying messages that fill the bottom of the screen notifying of a vehicle that has reached its life span.\n\n2. I find the balancing of the stats on the vehicles along with when they come out and are made obsolete to be very poorly done. As one example the running costs of a locomotive is easily 10-20 times that of a road vehicle making the construction of train lines very risky if you don't know just the right circumstances to make a profitable line. And even if you can manage a profitable train line you are almost guarenteed to be able to make a much more profitable bus/tram or truck line in place of the train.\n\n3. Collision issues while doing road and rail construction is very inflexible. It seems the majority of construction atempts are going to give you a collision message meaning it won't allow it. Often times you either have to make significant compromises to your plans, forget your plans altogether, or invest a lot of money and work into making it work. Such as spending millions of dollars bulldozing buildings along a road just so you can upgrade the road or connect another road to the road, even if there was a large open spot where no buildings were in the way.\n\nGood things:\n\n1. The sounds and visuals of the game are very appealing in my opinion. I spend much of my time just following vehicles around or watching people go whereever they are going. I think the next closest game of this type would be Cities in Motion but sunnier.\n\n2. The randomly generated maps and cities are very impressive. Granted there isn't a lot of variety in the generation catogories for the maps, but even so, the type of landscape it does generate is very well done. As far as I know there is no other game of this type that has comparable map and city generation. Also the way the cities gradually develope is well done and satisfying. The speed at which they grow is largely based on how well connected the town is with itself and with other towns as well as how fully it is being supplied with goods.\n\n3. The realistic supply and demand of the passengers in the game is really nice and gives a lot of incentive to connect to every town you can. Every person has 4 locations they are assigned. A home, a place of work, a place to shop and a place for leisure. They will often re-assign locations based on what new options are available. They have a 20 minute deadline on any travel plans they make. So the faster your transportation becomes the further they can travel within the time limit and so the more opertunities exist for you to make money in transporting them.\n\nThese are just some of the more prominant issues, both good and bad, that exist in the game. But it hopefully gives a sense of whether you might enjoy the game or not. The balancing problem I mention can relatively easily be dealt with through mods. Finding the right one for your tastes and installing them is a bit of a hassle though when ideally the game could have just been better balanced by the developers themselves.\n\nI personnally think it is a great game and have had a lot of enjoyment with it. But the lost potential of what this game could be is admittedly frustrating and I can certainly understand why some people might be too put off to continue playing it.","December 12, 2014","true","167.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

It's built in Unity and is a lot of fun to build train routes with.\n\nThere are however a host of problems that need to be addressed before it's really a "final" game. The UI is cheap. Cities do not scale properly based on the decade you start in (1850 / 1900 / 1950) which can create monetary issues ias it lacks balance. Vehicles do not use stations in a smart way (a route will only use the same track, always.) and while pedestrians are very smart with their travel, the game doesn't seem to produce a lot of demand as you'd expect. The industries are not profitable with trains (because of their high operating costs)\n\nThe game is also very laggy and processor-intensive because it's using Unity.\n\nLastly a lot of things that should be easy (scheduling to prevent bunching up trains, upgrading trains and engines over time, etc.) that are in much better-developed, free games like OpenTTD are completely lacking in Train Fever.\n\nThe developers really should have invested more into the game in terms of development.

Train Fever is not a perfect game. There are some performance issues on larger maps, some aspects of micromanaging are tedious, and I question the balance between train and truck income.\n\nThat said, it's still a pretty decent game in a genre that doesn't get alot of love. And if you enjoy building train lines and roads and such, there's a good chance you'll find something to like in Train Fever.\n\nI really like the UI, which is really important in this kind of game. It's simple, unintrusive, and fully customizable. You can follow any number of vehicles, lines, charts, etc. I also like how when you have a window open, like of a vehicle, you can zoom within the window, click on a building within the window, and that will open a new window.\n\nThe building and terraforming tools are quite good once you have them fully figured out. Graphics could be better, but they don't distract from the experience. Good music.\n\nEven with its flaws, I can still recommend this game. If you have any fond memories of the transport sims of yesteryear, Train Fever is worth a play.\n\n","October 1, 2014","true","123.9"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

While I have been having some fun with it, it also has some very irritating bugs and shortcomings. It's not always easy to get tracks right, you have to build it in short sections, and there is no way to design a track without actually paying for it. I've lost millions of in-game money by placing a track, only to find out at the last moment that something is unable to align.\n\nI finally did manage to get a map working and see some nice action, only to notice the game performance collapsing in on itself. We've been discussing this issue a lot on the official forums, but until the developers fix it, i can't really give this game a recommendation to anyone else. When you got a lot of track on a big map and a lot of vehicles, the frame rate simply tumbles and at the end of every in-game month, while the game does some calculations, it will simply freeze for up to 30s. Enjoyable for shorter sessions, but in the long run the issues take the fun out of it.","January 4, 2015","false","303.8"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

Its fine as vanilla, and even better with mods. It's like having your own living model railroad, without spending a fortune. As the game goes on, the towns grow toward your stations, buildings, cars, and even the pedestrian's clothing styles change. You can spend hours just getting your lines set perfectly; the learning curve is not too steep, yet the gameplay is pretty complex, with each individual citizen having their own schedule, home, and workplace.\n\nAll that complexity has a bit of a price though; I don't recommend playing a map size larger than "small" if you have a 32 bit system. Even with 64 bits, the game will start to lag toward endgame (there are now mods to help with that though.)\n\nThe graphics are a bit cartoonish, which I think was the point, its like a model railroad, not intended for hardcore realism. The sounds are fine, but the music soundtrack leaves a bit to be desired IMO, it doesn't fit the mood of the game at all.\n\nOverall, I HIGHLY recommend this game if you are interested in trains, model railroads, or transit systems at all.","January 17, 2015","true","283.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

However, it's all about transportation and getting money for it. So there is not much more you have to use, except your human logic.\n\nSo your transportation lines have to make sense. At first you have to check WHAT should be transported. For beginners, use trains and check out two companies that are close to each other.\n\nCompany 1: Produces oil and sells it on the market\nCompany 2: Needs oil in order to produce goods\n\nSo, as you can imagine, in real life Company 1 would love to sell it's oil to Company 2 who absolutely needs it. BID AND ASK. All right, so just build two railway stations next to these companies, connect them. Create a new line in between these two railway stations, buy a train, tell it to drive according to the line you just created and thats it.\n\nThe companies will notice AUTOMATICALLY that there NOW is a possibility to sell/buy oil from each other. The AI in this came is intelligent enough to notice this advantage. So Company 1 now notices, that there is a way to transport and sell it's oil to Company 2 using your railway station. What does Company 1 do now? It starts stacking up the produced oil barrels on your railway station. Your train will arrive, pick up the barrels, drive to Company 2 who automatically buys it. After arriving at Company 2 you instantly get the money. That's pretty simple.\n\nNow, for example, Company 2 takes Oil and produces GOODS. Villages and people living there need the goods. So what you can create a second transportation line between a nearby village and Company 2, in order to transport the produces goods to the village. Similar as in the example above, the companies/villages will notice this advantage and start ordering goods from Company 2 using your second line. Again you're earning money.\n\nNow, as the village gets goods to develop, you can also start building a THIRD line. On the lower right side of the user interface you can open a menu. One of the points allows you to show the houses of villages in colored codes. After enabling this option, you will see blue, yellow and green houses.\n\nGreen houses = Houses where people live in\nYellow houses = Stores and places for people to have fun (e.g. after work)\nBlue houses = Offices/workplaces for the people that work\n\nIf you zoom in you can see that people have to walk a LOT from their homes in order to go to work every morning. So what you can do is simply creating a THIRD line to allow the people to travel from home to work by bus. Again the AI is intelligent enough to notice this advantage, so they will immediately start using your busses and pay money for tickets.\n\nThen, after more and more people work, your city gets more efficient. Companies grow and develop thanks to your lines transportating the workers, so after growing even MORE people can work there. Also the houses where families life in. The better the lines are set up, the more attractive the area in your city gets, leading to a rising population in your city. You really can see the city growing over time.\n\nSo a last example, after work the people may be exhausted, so they need to relax, maybe going to yellow houses and playgrounds in the city. so why don't create a fourth line that transports the people in between work/stores/their home? They will use it then again.\n\nAll you have to do in this game is thinking logically. The world is amazingly intelligent, it is fun to watch the city growing. Even companies grow if they notice that they can't produce enough products anymore in order to supply other companies. Every single move and line you create, every single bus stop, can change the peoples behavior and influence the way your city grows. This is fantastic.","September 5, 2014","true","22.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

The developers listen to the community and already implemented a lot of wishes. If you played OTTD you should know, that this game is different in some aspects:\n\n- The industry chains are smaller but production does not increase/decrease at random and it matters where you deliver the goods because cities will only accept a certain amount.\n- The scale of the game is different, you won't have a station with 10 tracks in each town in this game unless you are crazy.  It is not like OTTD where you build 20 trains for one line, it focusses more on longer lines between cities. That said, you will most likely have less networks and less complex setups for station entrances and rail crossings because it is not so easy to build such things.\n- The terrain in this game really matters. In OTTD you can just terraform everything at some point and tracks can just go up the hill anywhere. Here it matters where you lay your tracks and you have to plan according to the contour lines.\n\nIf you can live with that, you get a really good game with:\n\n- Great graphics\n- Already great mods (see trainfever.net)\n- Simulated people and goods\n- Simulated town growth\n- Great maps\n\nSo what issues do I have with the game:\n- If you build a lot of stuff, it takes time to autosave and sometimes the simulation slows down\n- Balancing of some trains and cars needs some work, TFV for example won't reach 300 km/h on most tracks because of weak acceleration (they changed the TFV but I couldn't test it since the changes)\n- Trains sometimes drive one after another because of long boarding times. This affects profit and line frequency (this has now been fixed)\n\n-------------------------\n\nAddition now that the US DLC is out:\n\nSome of my concerns have been adressed:\n- Performance of the game is better, still a slight slowdown when autosave (but you can now choose how often the autosave is done)\n- Balancing is still not perfect but TFV is fixed\n- Boarding times are less of an issue\n\n\nThe US DLC works fine, I didn't see all the models yet. But there even seem to be options to enable all vehicles (Europe and US) and just play on a Europe or US map, which is great. I don't know if the balancing of the US vehicles is good because I am still in 1870.\nThere are still some old bugs in the game but nothing game-breaking, mostly visual little annoying things like missing tunnel portals.\n\nI tested some mods and there are awesome vehicles available. Unfortunately the old mods are broken but there is already a solution out (the community has a mod manager which will do all the work for you). If you do some research it is easy to find new vehicles or balance mods and add them to the game. With the new ingame tools you should then be able to really customize your experience, which is great!","December 6, 2014","true","151.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

With Train Fever today we finaly do have a worthy successor!\n\nI had the fortunate opportunity to be one of the beta testers of Train Fever,so I may have seen a big portion of the progress this game took from the first more or less playable version up until the release. I am happy that all important points and rough edges that I pointed out during the beta were OK in the end when the game was released. But the guys from Urban Games did not stop there, they did from release and still keep continuing development to make the game even better. Until this very day there have been maybe 5 to 10 patches after the release, each adding much sought after updates to the game engine, added features, new rolling stock, and improved usability.\n\nThis leads me to say that the game is now in a very polished, playable and truly enjoyable state.Honestly, I would not have said so at the release, I think the game was released a bit too early for its state. But now, after all those fixes, There is not a single point left of those that kept me frustrating in the beginning. From my personal experience, I think it's very rare to see such a progress, as today most games are released and then abandoned by the studio, as they are mostly working on the next game already. But Urban games did not go this shady path.\n\nThe fact that Train Fever was designed with deep mod support in mindfrom the first day of development makes the game even more exciting for me. There are a couple of mods that I really enjoy playing with. Most of them are additions to rolling stock, but for example there is also one that installs a much more complicated and challenging industry chain. In case you are german speaking, don't forget to look at one of the largest community portals of the game: http://www.train-fever.net/\n\nAll this together with the quite low price they are selling Train Fever on Steamlead to my final conclusion: It really is a game worth playing. If you're into the genre I think it's an absolute must to own it! But even if you're new to the field or not so much into trains, trucks and transportation, I still think the beauty and realism with which Train Fever presents itself is worth to give it a try.","December 23, 2014","true","207.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I followed this game for a while before release and Urban Games seems pretty committed to making this a good game so I have confidence in them.\n\nSo let's get the basics out of the way. On the one hand it's a pretty straight forward game. If you've played Cities in Motion or Tranportation Tycoon you won't be lost. The game looks pretty good even on my old computer and considering I'm using Vista it runs pretty smoothly.\n\nOne of the first problems and it may seem like a small one is that you can't make tracks that crossover each other. You can make switches or bridges, but if I have two tracks (an up and down line) and I want it to cross over and merge with another set of tracks I can't do that. I have to make an additional set of switches. I imagine that will be implimented eventually but it really annoys me because from how I play in games like OpenTTD I usually have one or two main lines with branch lines feeding it.\n\nAnother small thing that gets really annoying fast is that you can't build roads over track (unless you build a bridge). Again this will be a quick fix, but it will really started to make me mad when I was trying to upgrade my old lines to high speed tracks.\n\nOne thing is that trains are supposed to dynamically spread themselves out they don't stack up on each other, but it seems it has somes bugs. At first it worked fine, but as I got into the late game the system seems to break down so I'd always have three or more trains at one end of a three station line and the other had nothing. I actually watched this for a little bit to figure out why and I think what happens is that when you get into the late game and have trains with a 100+ passengers that it creates  bottleneck with all those people loading and unloading.\n\nI'm not convinced that cargo is really flushed out. I struggle to make cargo lines to make any kind of profit and really by the 20th century it's better to use trucks.\n\nI think the building of roads and tracks needs work. Sometimes it's a crapshoot on what will work and what doesn't.\n\nStill these all strike me as problems that are easy to fix and probably the devs are on it already. Train Fever seems like a pretty solid base to expand upon and Urban Games seems to have big plans and if an active modding community can get off the ground I see great things for the game. This game is really for people who really love transport tycoon games.","September 13, 2014","true","57.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

And it's just not that.   Want to electrify all your rails?   Click every individual section,  miss one and your train wont run.  Don't know what section you missed?  Good luck finding it.\n\nWant to built a road across your rails?  Too bad.  Demolish the rails and build the road first,  then you can fiddle around.\n\nThe building system is beyond fickle,  though in honesty,  it has been improving.   It's still awful.   You will spend more time cursing it out and trying to get a simple little bit just to work.  It needs a lot of work\n\nNatrually,  there is no true build mode,   so any minor change that doesn't work will be bulldozed out of your own poked, paid to be laid again, and bulldozed when that doesn't work.  Early on, if you make even a slight error building your track,  you can break the bank.\n\nLikewise,  making a profit is not very difficult...but it's also not very intuitive.\n\nIndustry chains are short and pathetic.  They are rarely profitable, unless you manage to hook up differnt industries on one line,  and you're better off using Trucks most the time.\n\nOddly enough, Intercity busses are perferred later in game over trains as well.   With roads being much easier to manipulate and control,  trains really just become a novelty.\n\nThere is water in game,  however it serves no purpose other than to build bridges that don't like being built.   It's a shame because the water actually looks lovely,  and forms into huge lakes, rivers and streams.   It just begs for water transit.  The starting year is 1850,  Paddle driven ships were in full swing,  and hadn't fully replaced sail yet.\n\nMaps are more than large enough. So yes, this is a positive.  They can be downrigt massive.  Archipeligo, and more water based maps would be completely doable.  Along the lines of huge maps,  unlike in Transit Tycoon, or Locomotion,  these are actually big enoug that airplanes would really make sense.    Unfortunatly, there are no airplanes.\n\nOptimization is ok.  It chugs later on as cities grow.  But this too has been improving.  It also still needs work,\n\nVariation is low.      It's a solid start of mechanics...but there needs to be a lot of refinement,  a lot of additional content,  and ♥♥♥, I dont' even care if ships, aircraft, are additional cost DLC,  that's fine. I understand these people need money to make their game,  but 40 USD is simply too much for such an incomplete game.\n\nEDIT\nYou will have fun with this game.  It is pretty,  trains do run once you -eventually- get the tracks down.  Profits can be had, the whole 9 yards.  You won't,  however,  have 40 dollars worth of fun with it.   It seems that not hours after this review went up,  the devs announced a North American DLC.   So,  variation in theory should be helped,  but the flaws of construction,  limited industry,  water transit, and aircraft still remain.\nEND EDIT\n\nEDIT 2 - USA DLC released-\nOkay so we now have the American DLC.   It was free so if you haven't bought this game yet,   well, still don't buy it.   It doesn't really "Fix" any of the issues. If anything it makes the game much harder in the early era due to how the US stuff is balanced.  You still can't do basic things like buiding a rail road crossing with a road. (you have to built it with a rails overtop of roads),   building tunnels or bridges in a tight space is still a pain,  industry chains are the same,  etc, Nothing was fixed,  just content.  Vehicle content.\n\nI hate being so negative about it,  but come on!  If there's one good thing to say about this,  it's that the DLC was made with help from the modding community.  That in it's own right is a seed of hope.  Hope that they get more and more help from modders and actually fix/add all the things this game needs to be good.\n\nIf you see it on sale for cheap,  I'd say pick it up now, but it's still not worth the full price they're charging, so overall recommendation is "no"\n-END EDIT 2-\n\nA final note, The modding community is quite nice,  but unless you know german or russian.....well...hard to read.   The potential is there,  but  it needs a bit more realization on the dev's end before getting there.","December 25, 2014","false","365.8"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","1"

If it works the way it should, it's totally hard to handle and not a useful tool. Given the fact, the devs advertised the game by pointing out the building tool, this is even more annoying.\n\nSee, the trains ingame can't climb or decend steep slopes, which is perfectly allright, since this is the same in RL. This is why tracks often are build on a dam or an expensive tunnel is build. The thing ingame is that the building AI doesnt always build cost effective or with common sense. So you start building in small parts of the track just to find out, when coming to the end of the planned track (e.g. another station) you cannot connect it. Sometimes it's not even because of the terrain but because of nonsense like can't build a bridge, cant put a switch here and so on. It's so frustrating.\n\nThere are various other reasons why the game is no fun, such as a very simple and monotone economy but the track building tool, which was highly advertised by the devs is the worst.\n\nI feel i'm playing an early access game. Other studios certainly wouldn't have sold that as a final.\n\nHope this helped, deleting the game from my lib now.","October 13, 2014","false","55.4"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","43","77","0","6"

The simulation is very solid. Every inhabitant has a persistent home, work, a recreational area and a preferred shop where he or she likes to go. Cities grow when they are connected to other cities via your transportation network or get goods delivered.\n\nThe optical presentation is nice which makes it very satisfying to watch the networks come to life. The cities are very lovely done, except sometimes the surrounding lands feels a little bit monotonous. There aren't any premade maps, instead they are procedural generated.\n\nThere are some rough edges at the moment, some are mentioning a bad performance. I had this problem at first, too. But simply lowering the graphic settings helped a lot.\n\nThe biggest oversight in my opinion is that the developers somehow missed to provide a user guide and the tutorial is lacking. It doesn't explain all important things. Some people are simply lost and rely on user generated guides or youtube videos at the moment, which understandably frustrates them. So if you plan to play Train Fever I like to advise you to look at some guides and videos first. (Here is a very good interactive guide.[trainfeverguide.26miledrive.com])\n\nFor instance there are things that work differently than in other transportation simulations or aren't very obvious: Stops don't have a coverage area, instead people are trying to reach their destination in under 20 minutes. For instance this can mean they are willing to walk 17 minutes to a bus stop, use the bus for 2 minutes and walk another minute (of course it's better the closer stops are). They won't use a transportation network if travel times are longer than 20 minutes or if they can reach it on their own faster (by foot or car).\nWith freight it's similar. It's not possible to order freight, own can only provide lines and the  "business owner" decides whether to use your trains and trucks, to deliver freight on his own or to not produce at all. It needs to be delivered in under 20 minutes and the frequency and capacity of your vehicles determines how much will be delivered using your transportation network.\n\n\nWhat really stands out is the ability to mod the game, which will contribute immensely to the longevity of it. There are already mods available that add more vehicles or more industries and goods.","September 5, 2014","true","14.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

The 3D aspect of it makes you have to carefully choose where to put the lines, it also makes track and road laying realistic, including gradients.\n\nContour lines makes it easier to dictate slope steepness and greatly assist in designing a railway.\n\nThe procedural towns and cities are a welcome sight as it makes them fully dynamic\n\nThere are a couple of bad points that I'd like to mention though:\n\nThe game needs a great deal of polishing and optimisation as it runs poorly on my PC\n\nConstructing railways I find, is difficult, you can't exactly plan the entire line in one go.\n\nFor example: I'd like a feature where you can place and move multiple "sections" of track by moving their nodes, then placing stations and depots.\n\nThe design of stations are limited, what I was thinking was having something like Terminal platforms.\n\nAlso, I'd like to be able to choose where the building goes as the building dictates where the road joins onto it, then choose the location of the platforms seperately from it, possibly include bus station / stop facilities which are connected to the station instead of having it as an afterthought.\n\nWhat about the platforms themselves? The platforms don't have to be built straight, they aren't modular either, they also aren't built to a specific length.\n\nThere's also no mention on how stations are upgraded if the trains get too long.\n\nOther then that...?\n\nWell, there is the lack of vehicle spacing in the game.\n\nThere's the odd "feature" in the game, where you can load both cargo slots in a wagon, effectively making the said wagon carry twice as much compared to making it carry a single cargo (for example: an open wagon can carry 4 items of coal, as well as another 4 items of iron ore, together the wagon carries 8 items, where if you're hauling a single type of cargo, you carry a maximum of 4 items).\n\nI'd like to see this gone, you can only haul a total amount of cargo instead of a maximum for that particular type of cargo.\n\nWhy are the loads measured in items? How do you define an "item" of cargo?\n\nFor example: Goods, How do you define an item of goods? Size of the item? Weight of the item?\n\nOr perhaps a lump of coal? in which case, an open wagon carries 4 lumps of coal.\n\nOr perhaps more lucrative would be items of oil? a wagon can carry 10 items of oil?\n\nIt doesn't really make much sense in those terms.\n\nI'd prefer terms we can relate to, such as the Cubic metre to define capacity of anything or metric tonne to define weight.\n\nOr perhaps represent it as a percentage rather then items... After all a percentage does make a lot more sense then that since it is expressed as a ratio compared to a figure.\n\nIt would be nice to have a more in-depth tutorial about how to make services between cities and industries compared to how to make the said link between them.\n\nThe "cargo display" doesn't really help all that much, it should show links between industries as either a straight line or a line along the roads compared to icons.\n\nI also find the cargo icons confusing as I can't distinguish what industries have the appropriate icon.\n\nYou also can't connect just any two industries together, the industries "pair" themselves up with another industry which the link isn't easy to change, this problem is a type of game breaker for me.\n\nThere also isn't that much pressure forcing you to actually have trains in the first place as it's perfectly fine having roads deliver loads along with trains, You could make an entire network formed up of trucks and buses if you wanted to and still come out with a profit, completely defeating the name of the game altogether.\n\nIt's not the best transportation game out there (I still prefer the Transport Tycoon game play over train fever's), but it's a good to play every now and again.","September 9, 2014","true","7.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

And you know what, I'm pretty glad I did.\n\nI'm not going to deny that it has its problems; the interface is a little awkward and clunky, the economy side of things can be pretty brutal sometimes and it will take a fair few hours to get your head around both of those issues before you really start to see the game shine, but when you do and it does, you'll find yourself up 'till 3am modifying your lines, checking their profits and hankering for that next locomotive upgrade.\n\nI would probably agree that it's not worth £20, but what is essentially a virtual train set with an economy that drives the incentive to make it bigger, it's definitely worth persevering with.","February 6","true","11.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I wanted to give it a good play before reviewing.  Let's just say I've had a lot of fun with this, to a disturbingly addictive level.\n\nStuff I like:\n\n+ Nice big maps.  Bright colours but it adds to the charm\n+ Cities Grow\n+ You can watch a single person go to work and back on your network.\n+ Once you pull off a complicated track arrangement it is incredibly satisfying.\n+ The way cargo works makes sense to me.  You can't just deliver coal to a factory and presume you'll make money.  The factory has to have it's goods going somewhere too.\n+ You find all kinds or nice looking views and moments when touring your network, a track wrapping around a hill, or a large train emptying dozens of people at a station where a bus is waiting.\n\nThere is a somewhat steep learning curve at the beginning, mainly because there is barely any manual and only a brief tutorial.  There are plenty of steam guides though so make sure you read them before playing.  A little tip for those just starting: Build your railway lines in smaller chunks, and avoid going directly up a hill.\n\nThere are a bunch of weird little bugs, for example, you can build tracks over roads but not roads over tracks, which you have to work around, but it seems the developer is still working on things, and there are bug fixes on the way apparently.\n\nIf you are coming from Transport Tycoon to this, be aware it doesn't do everything the same, in particular, trains only use one assigned platform at a station (devs also working on this).\n\nIf you are thinking of buying this, don't be fooled into thinking this is not an intensive game on your system.  Double check your system specs before buying.\n\nAlso, this game is mod friendly and there are already fan made mods available, including a largely expanded cargo network.","September 10, 2014","true","111.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Well I bought it today (Sunday 21 Sep 14) and it installed and worked perfectly. In case anyone missed it, this title requires that permissions be granted via the System Prefs. On Mavericks go to Security & Privacy and then choose Accessability. Click the padlock in the lower left corner of the window and type in your admin password. That should case the options to becaome available. Scroll the list of apps down until you find Steam and activate the check box next to it. Close the window and restart Steam. You should now be able to get Train Fever to work. It does also appear to be a 64bit app if that makes any difference to anyone with issues around getting it to work.\n\nThe game itself is pretty good. Ifound the thing a bit jumpy when zooming the map out until I adjusted the Shadows option to low. Having said that I also noted that it was a function of detail that cased the stuttering and that all the time you work at realtively close quarters to the ground you can actually have everything set to high including the Shadows option.\n\nIt seems fairly straightforward to operate and I recognised a lot of how it worked from having played Railway Tycoon in my shady past. Would I reccomend it? Yes I think I would.\n\nI can see that anyone looking for a  detailed rail sim with mega amounts of choices on a Mac would probably be happier with Trains, but having said that I still think you would probably find this plenty enjoyable too. All in all a good buy.\n\nHope this helps some of you having troubles with this title out there in Steam land.","September 21, 2014","true","0.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I liked how the game started in 1850 as comparable games such as Transport Tycoon, and Cities in Motion start way later, which certainly changes your stradegy in the early game. The simulation is easy to understand yet difficult to master. The Graphics are quite pleasing to the eye, and the soundtrack is pretty catchy compared to other sim games I have played. The game is challenging and there are many stradegies to try to make a profit. The Randomly generated maps are a great addition that diffinatly add replay value. ISometimes it is simply great to watch your trains race around the landscape. Basically this game is what Transport Tycoon could have been if it was made today in 3D.\n\nHowever the game does have some issues. Track laying is very difficult. Rather than clinging to the landscape like you would expect it to, it is completely independant of it, meaning you will have a lot tracks raised and lowered around the ground. It is also finickey and will often give errors when it is clear there should not be one. The UI is not exactly Intuitive either. However it seems the devoloper is apt to fix these problems.\n\nOverall I would recomend this game to any fan of Railroad Tycoon, Cities in Motion and especially Transport Tycoon, as it is a complex quality expierence.\n\n","September 20, 2014","true","43.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

So far my playtime with this game has been amazing, and I can't sum it up any better then that! But I will!\n\nThe game excels greatly in being a fun loving Train focus Tycoon Business game. The mechanics are fun and simple to get the hang of once given the game time and to grow (in-game), so you see how things work. I have not played OpenTTD, which many that play Train Fever, are coming from / fans of. But I have played Banished, and Railroad Tycoon. Which are both what I would say Train Fever is if they had a baby IMHO! (Add oTTD, but I never played it :D so).\n\nGraphics and Sounds are amazing for the games custom built Engine. The details once zoomed in and watching your trains go, will look amazing to you! The sounds are also perfect and immerse right with the graphic detail. The music on the other hand. Its a huge hit & miss, you like it or don't. It's got some "special songs" that pay tribute to past games though ;)\n\nNow the flaws, as every great thing has one. It's still a tad fustrating at times for some things. Not as much for me, but more so from what I am reading closely from fans of OpenTTD. The things that work there for them, sometimes don't work here. For me, its a new experience, so I am learning and enjoying. The game offers few glitches and complications when comes to hilly terrain for track placement. Line Management is not solid completely for picking station platforms. Upgrading existing vehicles can be a pain if its not all at once (this is apparently fixed soon), along with Stations are not upgradable (being added shortly).\n\nBottom line, a fantastic game that will grow strong with a already strong community!\nOh did I mention Modding?

Each and every passenger and goods in the game have their own choice regarding their destination. Their choice is not fixed but depends upon your transport  network. Better a route, more chances of people travelling in that route.  They also may change vehicles in between their destinations.\n\nIts basically a Sandbox game and you are free to chose how you transport people (or goods). For example you might want to create 2 railway station in 2 cities to transport people. Alternatively you can build a railway station on outskirts and then transport people from various part of the city to the railway station from which they will be travel by train to another train station. Its all up to you. This freeform of gameplay is really addictive.\nGraphically the game looks awesome. Animations are superb and sound is quite nice. Specially the train sounds.\nThe game also supports MODS, which means lots of user made suff is available\n\nSINCE ITS RELEASE THE GAME HAS IMPROVED in terms of performance and user interface.\n\nHowever the downside of this games are:\nIt still has performance issues specially on large maps\nUser interface has issues\nThere are very few industries in the game. However few mods are already availabe that increase varaiety.","September 5, 2014","true","508.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

I love it! The small development team has put a lot of work and love into details and created an impressing simulation that is also beautiful (except the user interface).\n\n- Procedural generation of large landscapes and growth of cities is stunningly implemented and very intelligent - this helps to creates unique cities and worlds with different challenges.\n- Track-laying is very realistic (wow, really what I was dreaming for in RRT 3 etc with costs depending on degree of terrain modification).\n- Beautiful graphics of engines (buses) and towns.\n- Challenging simulation - neat combination of in-city and intra-city transportation of passengers.\n- Nice timeline with great European locomotives.\n\nThe focus is really on moving people around which is really enjoyable and the fun challenge to keep the economy running - I wish developers would not have listened to the community and rather would have entirely omitted the freight side of the game (to sell this feature separately later as a DLC!).\n\nI also find that the game's procedural world could have benefited from more variation, both geographically and temporally - there are no seasonal effects, and independent on height, the terrain texture is boring green lawn. I think they could have done much by simply changing textures with height (from green pastures to alpine rock desert) and over the course of a year (vegetation and texture change) - just to make epic playing over hours more immersive and entertaining.\n\nOverall I recommend this game - finally an intelligent, modern implementation of the classic genre after all the Sim City disasters (Cities in Motion being an exception).","September 30, 2014","true","41.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orffen/recommended/304730/","orffen","Orffen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orffen/","1256 products in account","Train Fever is rough around the edges but there’s a solid foundation there that just needs a bit of refinement. This is a game that could have benefited from an Early Access period though not necessarily a very long one.\n\nThe foundation of any transport game is the cargo modelling. If you’ve played Transport Tycoon there’ll be an adjustment period as in Train Fever industries “order” goods rather than accept them. In Transport Tycoon you can happily take iron ore to a steel mill all day long and make a tidy profit. In Train Fever that iron ore will only appear if there is a demand for it – the steel mill has to see demand for its end product in order to want to pay for iron ore and coal. No demand means no cargo to transport. Instead of setting up a transport route, you have to set up the entire chain. It’s an interesting mechanic but unfortunately it’s a bit finicky and it can be hard to figure out why an industry is not producing anything after the millions you have invested in a shiny transport network.\n\nPassenger transportation works differently too, as individual people and their journeys are simulated. People will walk from their residences to their destination if no transport route exists. If your service comes to their stop often enough (represented as Frequency in the game) then they may choose to ride your buses and trains. Conversely, if they can get there quicker by walking then they’ll do that. That means that whenever you set up a new route there is a higher expense because you have to supply enough vehicles so that the Frequency on the route is low enough for people to take it – another adjustment for those of us used to building a line with a single train set to full load and then letting it do its thing.\n\nConstruction is seamless and mostly intuitive, which is lucky because the tutorial in the game isn’t particularly fleshed out. You can drag out new sections of road or rail, and rail will show you the maximum speed trains will be able to reach on the new section (based on gradient and the radius of the curve). You can tweak the height of the endpoint and drag it around to a new location until you’re happy and then confirm the construction. Unfortunately tracks can only cross each other without a bridge, which makes diverging routes harder to build than they should be once you have double track covering the map. The game will give you a message if you can’t build track in the way you want, but on occasion there’ll be no explanation, just no “confirm” box. This tends to be only a small annoyance, and most of the time building new tracks is enjoyable.\n\nOutside of the construction interface the user interface has a clean look. The highlight is the line manager where you can also manage your vehicles, easily sending all vehicles assigned to a line to their nearest depot and even having them automatically sold when it’s time to replace them. It can get a little unwieldy as you start managing more lines but the devs have thought of this with a “visible only” feature which filters out lines not currently on the screen. Depots make it very easy to buy vehicles and then add them all to the same line. There doesn’t appear to be a way to resize windows and the font can be hard to read sometimes – a UI scaling feature would be nice. A word of warning: the game seemingly has no keyboard shortcuts at all and so relies entirely on the mouse which can be fatiguing.\n\nLine management is intuitive as well – create a line, hit “add station” and click away on the stations in order. The game will calculate a path for vehicles to take, and vehicles will automatically space themselves out along the route. The more vehicles (or the faster the vehicles), the higher the frequency. Pathing works very well for road vehicles, but with trains it’s another matter. Currently train lines choose a specific platform to use at a station, and trains will usually wait until that platform is free before pulling in, even if your station has other empty platforms they could use. I’ve even had a train sit waiting for the specific platform so long that the next train on the line was queued behind it; the second train picked the empty platform instead with seemingly no rhyme or reason. I’ve started building platforms based on the number of lines that will be serving the station as opposed to the number of trains I expect to service the line, which is annoying.\n\nThe game’s graphics are great as can be seen in the screenshots and videos and sounds are good throughout. Admiral James T. has done an incredible job with the soundtrack, with tracks which sound like tributes to themes from Transport Tycoon and even one which may be a nod to Theme Hospital. After about 9 hours of play I’m still enjoying the music and smiling when I recognise one of the tribute songs.\n\nEven with the rough edges however I’d recommend this game to anyone who enjoys transport simulations or trains. You’ll have to take some time to figure out the new mechanics and on occasion you will be frustrated by the mostly minor issues. If you can move on from those there is an enjoyable game here.\n\nThis review was written after playing Build 4221.","September 5, 2014","true","18.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

If you've never played Transport Tycoon, then this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe good part about this game is - it's Transport Tycoon! You get to build road and rail, and buses, trains and whatnot. You start in the horse-and-carriage era and work your way up. Map and towns are generated and driven by supply and demand and it is up to you to decide what that means! For anyone who played the original TT, this is a blast. The depots, the newspapers, the lines! The game even includes our beloved train signals, which means that you can also compete with yourself in getting as close as you can 100% track utilization!\n\nThe bad part about this game is - it's Transport Tycoon. Transport Tycoon was relased in '95 and that means that we have gotten quite far since. When playing this game, it really hits you how things have changed. The general UI design is: 1) Open a window for everything, and 2) Provide very few hints. Want to know the coverage area of a bus stop? Well, you can't. Want to replace your fleet of 100+ vehicles with an identical replacement once they reach a certain age? Well, you can't. Want to understand why the iron ore mine that has a production capacity of 25 only outputs 1 item a year? Well, too bad, but you can't.\n\nFurthermore, the game is a sandbox, offering no AI enemies and no multiplayer. While everything is freshly generated every time you start a new game, I'd probably say it's repeatable rather than replayable.\n\nThe steam community is right in giving this a 'Mixed' grade right now.

All the beta tester reviews were positive but this game still needs a lot of work. As far as I'm concerned its still in beta.\n\n*edit* The above is still somewhat true and let me add that I get the vibe that the game developers are relying too much on user created/mods to make the game complete.\n\n\nMy biggest gripes with the game:\n\n1. Cargo trains don't make any money but cargo trucks do.\n*edit* Making money with cargo trains takes time but can be lucrative.\n\n2. Track laying can sometimes be a pain in the neck.\n*edit* This was understated; it really is a pain!\n\n3. The game needs some sort of manual to better explain things. Most of the help and guides I have seen are done by people whose first language wasn't English.\n4. Don't get me started on signals. I still do not fully understand how they really work so I haven't been using them, hence the need for a manual.\n*edit* Okay, I understand signals now but I still think the game needs a manual.\n\n5. The biggest gripe I have is that McAfee detects one of the Train Fever files as a virus and quarrantines it. Eveytime I want to play I have disable real time scanning and have Steam re-verify the file. I don't like the idea of having my computer vulnerable but I'm willing to risk it. When I'm done playing I'll turn real time scanning back on and once again it will detect the file as a virus and remove it. then I have to go through all the above steps again.\n*edit* This was fixed a while ago so no longer applies.\n\nI mean the game is fun, but you have patience and stick with it.  I don't want to not recommend the game but it doesn't seem right to recommend it (at this time) either.\n\n*edit* I hear a lot of people comparing this to OTTD. I never played that or the original but I have played RRT2, Sid Meier's Railroads, and Locomotion. This game can be better than all of them but still hasn't lived up to its potential.","September 26, 2014","true","774.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

If you're like me and still play openttd / RT3 etc. occasionally, this is pretty cool. I like the vehicles, it's quite nice work on those. It is not a console like 'detailed but cheesy' kind of Gfx, it is not the genre that requires that imo, it just has enough detail where it's needed, like vehicles and cities.\n- Interesting economic model. Once you get to understand it the demand based economy is quite simple. I like to follow people to see where they go sometimes, it helped me understand how things work. It's a good challenge to make cities grow, although this means you'll end up with some local lines going into loss, which is pretty realistic I guess.\n- For me it's a big plus that it works on Linux. I have been experimenting with living with a desktop Linux for the past few months and it helped a lot to get some nice games on it once in a while. :)\n- The modding possibilities look like it will help with replay value. I didn't try mods yet, didn't quite "finish" with the stock game yet but I am sure I will at some point. The challenge will just be to find the more finished, 'professional' mods.\n- The cargo moving model can be a bit confusing at first, but it's a nice all around model with the lines, frequencies, the rule that passengers look to find routes that are within 20 minutes of travel time. It challenges you to build more efficient networks so people can get far by combining the use of different vehicles.\n- Dev team seems pretty responsive. In a couple of weeks they released 2 patches that deal with stability issues and help those that have problems running the game in the first place. Although for me it worked out of the box in both Win7 and Ubuntu.\n\nThe problems I have:\n- Building railroad tracks is very challenging at first, although it does get easier as you get used to it. A lot of 'collision' messages, sometimes feels a bit too restrictive but most of the time you can work them out.\n- Bridges - I did have a little problem building overpasses at first, you just have to learn that the game doesn't allow too steep slopes. Prepare to have enough room to raise a track so you can cross another, or a wide road.\n- Roads crossing railroad lines - at irst this was impossible until I learned that using M and N shortcuts you can raise or lower the middle of the road section you're building. This way I have succesfully built many roads over tracks which was helpful in extending cities around the railroad stations.\n- Terrain tool - it provides little information and I hate it, can't use it efficiently.\n- There are optimizations required, towards the year 2000 game becomes quite slow. Perhaps it is because so many people walk around and at that point they start using their cars to go around. Although dev team promised to look into it, it will probably require a few weeks to get the first patch or two that deals with these things.\n- For a game called Train Fever trains are very expensive to build and maintain so it always requires careful consideration.\n- Traffic jam issues late game. Here it helps to plan ahead and use trains for passanger traffic between cities but it's financially non trivial which was difficult at first and I sort of like it now that you need to think and plan a bit ahead so you don't commit financial suicide.\n\nOverall I think it's a nice game. I am glad someone released a game in the genre, always been a fan of these games. TF is good to go from the start, but a few patches will be welcome to iron out some issues. Mind you it's a very small company with a very low budget - raised 250k euros last year for the game, when you think of it some studios spend hundreds of millions. I think it's good to have these independent companies, with all the hit and miss, they sometimes bring a fresh perspective.\n\nps. Some people seem to have issues with replacing vehicles - it's one of those tings I never had problems with, you can send and sell all vehicles from a line to depots with 1 button, and normally you do it once every 20-30 years, you buy new vehicles in the depot and then assign them to the line once for the whole batch. It's only a pain with trains which I don't use a lot since they're expensive to maintain.","September 22, 2014","true","108.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The devs have (and still are) releasing updates that have fixed many issues within the game. Like the one that made you have to send a train to the depot just to replace them has been changed because people disliked the system. They also said that they have optimized the game better so it will run smoother. So, the game has definitely improved a lot since release. They're also planning on releasing at least one free DLC that they said will be coming out later in Febuary.

The industry is really limited and seems to dislike trains for cargo, as i placed many times tracks + freight station next to a industry which will then refuse to use the station and line, and even when it uses it, it just does not want to increase in production nor upgrade to match the capacity of your trains on its side. that said, it will interact propperly with trucks(tried on mutlible time era's (1850's, 1900's, 1950's and ++)).\nthat said in overall i would say the game can be very fun if your a true fan of the series like Cities in motion, Indrustry Giant, Transport Tycoon -etc. so far even before the patch the game ran really stable on my system and never resulted in crashed. big maps can take a while to load but are worth the wait in the end. the start no matter how you start(easy, medium or hard). is a challange, setting up wrong will make you fail and quickly run in debt which then leads to a restart of the game. The one thing that was quite annoying is to see that your passengers will just dissapear from the train/bus they sit in as it moves(had a train with 120passengers leaving the station, to arrive at its destination with just 105passengers).\n\nPro's:\n- Big maps.\n- good city devolopment.\n- Infrastructure build option.\n- Line system.\n- loads of options in difficulties and optimizations of the lines/tracks/roads.\n- Easy interface.(though feels a bit empty).\n- Easy train/bus/truck build mode.\n- 3-D\n- Music\n\nCon's:\n- Industry dis-likes trains.\n- Very limited Industry options.\n- The build system although good working seems to have troubles adjusting to slightly lower tracks then railroads, making it hard to build tunnels and overpasses easy.(eg. it wont suggest to make a tunnel or bridge if it cant make a on level overpass. but just keeps saying "Collision" when you then raise the terain for say a bridge overpass the road will collide with the raised height for the bridge)\n- Passengers will just vannish from your trains as they ride.\n- Trains/Busses dissapear as purchace options after a X amount of time, sometimes forcing you to buy a to expencive train to keep a line open.\n- City's seem to expand away from your station(at least in my games Xd).\n- Not easy to upgrade a train/bus/truck. said item needs to first go depot, trucks and busses need to be sold(very easy botton for that though), but upgrading a train, means sending it to station, open the train window + Depot window + Buy train window, Buy a train, remove the locomotive of the said train(sell or move). then place the new locomotive on the excisting train. re-assign its route and send it out again). It in overall is not a dissaster, just time and engery consuming if you get a big network with 50/60 locomotives that need to be replaced since they ran over their livetime span.\n\nIn overall though despite the "flaws" that i have encountered i still love this game and will continue playing it with pleasure, some of my con's might just be from still getting used to the building of. for instance, though seeing somethings added(maybe as optional options(like TDD). where you can keep the old steam locomotives/carriages/trucks/busses -etc would be nice to see, as well as more industry, and no Anti-train mentenality on industry would be very nice as well.\nall in all i would still rate this gate with 8/10 cause i just love these games, and this games somewhat cleances my thrists after TDD :D","September 12, 2014","true","72.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

However, if you look past all that and give yourself time to learn how it works, you'll find it to be a solid game at its core with an awesome 3D world to build a transport empire on, without being constrained to a grid.

Guess I need to start on easy mode on flat terrain but I found setting up a simple single track rail line between two towns used up pretty much all my starting capital. Very hard to get the track to match in some locations without a "too steep" or similar message. There's no "undo" button so demolishing track and starting over actually costs you money. Then there's only one train type to choose from (with horse and cart for road transport), the downside of having the game start in 1850 rather than (say) 1880.\n\nAlso missing is any feature to "ride" or attach to your vehicles and follow them through the network.\n\nWill persevere but I don't think - at least on initial experience - that it's as good as TTDLX or its clones, or Railroad Tycoon (2 & 3). Will probably appeal to those who found A-Train 8 a bit too complex but overall at this stage I would rate it 6/10.","September 7, 2014","true","0.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

To start with it is set in the 1850's, but as you play you unlock more vehicles and as you go through the ages you will be able to start in the more modern era's for future games.\n\nThe maps are a fantastic size, although I tend to play on Medium size at the moment with flat terrain, still getting used to the game personally. But setting up routes and laying tracks and roads is very simply.\n\nOne thing the game lacks is time tables to allow you to set times for trains to use tracks in certain directions which would make building lines cheaper and a little more realistic with the real world, but it would also add more complexity which is why the developers may have left it out and this makes the game very simplistic to play for everyone.\n\nYou can check out my You Tube series which I am starting at:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VtYD7C_Qrc20H7R1uojceCgQEoDY6d2","September 25, 2014","true","256.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

I tried a lot of games, i played a lot of games, and this game feels fresh and accesable to everyone from beginner to veteran.\n\nAt this point, the game is very well playable and even after you know the drill of how to run your company, every game you start, feels different and gives you different options.\n\nIn my Opinion this game is, atleast for the late game part, for people who got no problem with putting a lot of time into it to get that perect train connection, that perfect busline and so on.\n\nOf course, as it is with new games, it has some trouble to get through.\nFor me, the most remarkable problem is the late game lag. I dont know if its just for me and my computer, but the Lag in the Late Game ( eg. Big Cities, lots of stuff going on ) gets annoying at time. There are some Bugs, but its nothing that would destroy your gaming experience, for example dont let you do certain things.\n\nI just want to note here, that the modding community does fantastic work and the devs are, at this point, working closely with the community and let them create stuff for the game, that they can then release in future updates and gives the devs more time, for vrious other improved.\n\nSo, to sum it up, if you like a solid Tycoon game, that does nothing special, but what it does pretty decent, you like trains etc., you wont regret this game.","February 4, 2015","true","203.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's fun seeing your trains come in and out of your stations, seeing them make a profit, seeing your towns grow and expanding your network. If you enjoy sim games, you'll enjoy this one.\n\nBUT, and it's a big one, it's not an easy game! Have this clear as you make your first map (maybe even the second map), you will fail. The tutorial is mediocre at best. Go online and find tutorials to help you figure things out. Building bridges and tunels is frustrating. Almost makes you feel like you actually need an engineering degree for it. However, once you get the game's logic and figure things out, it will become easier and less infurating. More over, it will bring tons of satisfaction as you (finally) figured out how to build bridges and passes and see them allow your trains continue their routes and bring in profit.\n\nSeriously, once you get things working, you'll have so much fun, a few hours will just banish and you won't even notice. I already have 65 Hrs on this game in just a couple of weeks.\n\nAgain, give it a chance. If it becomes too frustating or difficult to play, just look up tutorial online.

To be honest, I only bought the game because it was on sale, and thought, well it's cheaper than usual so why not give it a shot. I can only speak for the USA DLC, because naturally I live in the US and would like to see the trains and other options that are more localized for me. However, with that being said, I have genuinely found this game to be enjoyable, and would recommend it to train enthusiasts or management tycoon players alike. If you are a mixture of both, then you get even more out of it. The only rough side in my opinion is that I found myself on my phone for extended periods of time when I was waiting for new trains or unlocks, and due to that, the cash just flowed in - now I doubt money will even be a problem and I am only in 1910. With that said, I still continue to be excited for the next technological advancement and am pleased with my purchase.

There have been some pretty major bugs that have plagued the development of this game and the fledgling developer has done a respectable job at addressing these. At it's core, this is a deep game with a super-steep learning curve and some frustrating interface/gameplay issues. So why is this getting a thumbs up from me? Because despite this, there is still a game that has absorbed me and has given me 80 hours of gameplay.\n\nIt's totally sandbox; you're on your own and just poking around with the game doing whatever you want with little other than profit and loss to guide you. But sometimes that's what you want, to just fiddle around and not have some corny derivitive quest thrown at you, or feel as though the goals set by the game are railroading you (pun intended) into playing a type of way you don't want to play.\n\nBig tip: always start with bus routes, get several towns running, then you can start playing around with trams or connecting up compatible industries, expanding until you have enough to start laying track. It's about feeling when you're ready to expand into the next big step, being cautious and backing off if something isn't working.\n\nBut, this game would benefit from so much that would take the guesswork out of all this. The developers have obviously tried to go for a more intuitive feel to how you play a transport game, moving away from things like catchment zones when placing stops and the like, which should translate as more realistic: people in real life will travel as far as they need to for public transport, it isn't a binary 'I'm 100 metres away, I'm good to go. I'm 101 metres away, I'm not going that far,' but this does mean that you have no real sense for how far apart stops should be, whether you're bogging your system down with too many stops or missing out chunks of possible passengers because it's quicker to walk. But, in the end, as long as you're making money, who really cares about digital people having to walk a mile to work?\n\nThe simulation is broad and develops impressively over time, but again has some issues. Watching towns grow and develop over time is fascinating, although growth tends to often be counter-intuitive, with roads appearing almost randomly. Although you can place roads and have some control over the development of settlements, the lack of accompanying features and relatively minimal feedback into the transport part of the game, besides the ability to add a shortcut to complete a route or upgrade roads to improve speed, means there isn't much reward for getting into this too much.\n\nAll in all, the game is playable, albeit with its own little eccentricities. The game is more of a relaxing pass-the-time style than quest-driven adventure through the decades. But, as I've said, it works of you like that kind of game.\n\nThe developers are starting fresh with a new game rather than patching and updating this one, which tells me several things. Firstly, they've learnt a lot from this game and have listened to feedback and know that to try and put in all the stuff people want and correct the mistakes that the game has grown up with would be huge and likely game-breaking. But, it also tells me that they are still passionate about this game: they could have done what some many other developers have done, gotten as far as they could with their first attempt and then gone in a different direction. But they haven't. They are building on what they've learnt and starting fresh and in the world of game development, taking years to develop your first game, which is good but bogged down with virtually insurmountable problems, is the easy way to bankruptcy. So, I'm still happy I paid for this game, supported whoever is behind Urban Games, and I'll be there to support their passion for making the right game that they've always imagined when Transport Fever is released.\n\n","May 18","true","81.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Firstly the time cycles are outrageously swift - it can take days, weeks, decades and months for vehicles to move around the map, and eons to increase product demand of the various services. But what has really broken the camel's back is the road and rail building mechanics.\n\nI've played many similar games, as I'm sure most people interested in the genre have, but laying a roads, rail and especially bridges or tunnels is way too fussy and time consuming. Add that to how quickly the time elapses, many years will have passed whilst you try to understand why portions of a bridge turn red when there's nothing noticeably obstructing it.  Finally, the costs to demolish buildings and road to make way for redevelopment are ridiculously priced. Hundreds of thousands to remove a small building is unrealistic and punishing if you're struggle to make money. All in all, the transport/city building genre is making serious comeback - Paradox seem to be leading the way with the likes of Cities In Motion, and I cannot wait to play their new title Cities: Skylines.\n\nHaving watch footage of the latter, when it comes to the simplicity of building and redeveloping, it should be the least tasking portion of a game, and I'm afraid Train Fever has really understood this. I was really looking for to the game and the replayability factor. Since it's been a couple of months since I last tried TF, I had hoped my concerns would have been noticed and perhaps updates to improve the building mechanics - unfortunately the issues remain. I do hope this can be improved upon after this published my review.

If it would be cheaper and in clear early access sale then it would be a great thing to go for. Unfortunately it is sold as a finished product and most of the time on full price.\n\nGame can offer you a decent amount of interest and even some challenge, but so many annoying features and even more so, missin features, are driving you nuts in the later game. Performance gets killed at later game and you may have to wait 10-15 seconds for the calculations to be completed at the end of each month. And since the month is less than a minute long, you get the idea what it is like... And during the month performance isn't that great either.\n\nLot of graphical bugs, onlogically working build tool, not enough information, no X junctions on railways, no road over rail build etc. are seriously limiting the great fun factor. Selection of vehicles is poor in the main game and only with mods it will get interesting. Also the latest update introduced a feature which doesn't allow player to delete certain roads which game classifies as a main connection. So you can't fully do what you want to do, which is how this game actually was sold at the beginning... So, if you are looking for fun and Transport Tycoon or Railroad Tycoon kind of experience, keep on looking. If you want to be a part of the beta team and get constantly frustrated then join us unfortunates, who went and bought this game at its alpha stage.\n\nEdit 13.01.2015:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365263326 Bridge not possible.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374286491 Excellent AI road…\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374286758 Tunnel build 1\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374286890 Tunnel build 2, buggy as hell.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374287049 Road you can delete\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374287200 Need bypass\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374287539 Tunnel bug\n\nIt’s quite clear with all this kind of issues at the game that It’s far from well thought well polished game. Devs should step up and admit that it’s still an alpha at it’s best and should not have been released for at least another year. And that they didn’t plan what they set out to do well enough. Harsh, but true. I really really would like to like this game, but more you play, more you get frustrated with its shortcomings.","January 6, 2015","false","507.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

There are a few things I would like to see improved such as more diverse freight loads, more trains and vehicles and better track tools. As it stands I can't make a double crossover which means to make large station crossovers takes a huge amount of space to achieve. The patches have made a big difference and the new US DLC which is free has added more to the game. The game would also benefit from the Steam Workshop if it was intergrated as there are already a large amount of mods available for this game.\n\nThere are other transport builders out there but I think Train Fever is still a good buy if its on sale.

There's never really a choice to make - there is usually only one tram, one train, one truck or one train to choose (at some points trains give you maybe another option).  It would be great to have more vehicles without mods.\n- It's sometimes difficult to bridge or tunnel over or under tracks - it needs to be simpler.\n- This is temporary only maybe, but the issue that others reported where the game freezes on the 1st of each month started plaguing me since the update on 30 January.  That's made it almost unplayable for me.\n- More in-game tutorials or help is needed or just some easy to understand documentation.  I thought trains were useless until I did some extensive reading and watching loads of Youtube videos to fully understand how industry works.  At least all my trains are profitable now!\n- There should be something else to play for - I've pretty much got most of the achievements now - so not too much incentive to play a game.  Missions maybe or scenarios?\n\nOverall though, this game has kept me entertained far longer than most.","February 1, 2015","true","176.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I have never played the original Transport Tycoon but I have played my share of OpenTTD as well as games like Cities In Motion. If you like those games, you'll like this. It's as simple as that. Imagine a game like OpenTTD with graphics better than Cities In Motion. I think the overall reviews give the wrong impression. The game needs more development but as it stands now you'll get hours of enjoyment from it if this is your kind of thing.\n\nIf you've never played Transport Tycoon type games well then that's another matter. There isn't a lot of hand holding here. If you don't understand something you're going to have to look it up in the wiki. The price is going to be a deterrent to a lot of people as well. As the game stands now I think it's priced a little high and I wouldn't own it if it wasn't for the auction. It needs more content like more industry, planes and boats. Especially boats. But the devs have promised more content is coming and a free DLC was just announced.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game and you haven't played Transport Tycoon, I suggest downloading OpenTTD and see how you like that first.

It's got trains in it so that's nice, but it has too many problems to be really great. Many people before me have mentioned how the terrain always screws you over while track building. Connecting rails in hilly areas is a chore, and the lack of an "Undo" button doesn't help. Building level crossings is a crapshoot, and building overpasses is even worse. It hardly ever works. The UI is a mess, with pop-up windows behind menu buttons, too many pop-up windows that open other pop-up windows that open other pop-up windows. Some drag'n'drop features here and some double clicks there could make a lot of stuff way more easy.\n\nThat being said, it's got trains in it and that's nice.

Linked them via my stage coach line so people pay me to go to the station. Built another stage line in the next town to funnel passengers between the stations.\n\nWorking better than it did in Quill18's youtube play through last year. I like the cancel option when laying track and roads. Would like a warning symbol to indicate a tunnel will be built. Love that the track shows the speed limit as you lay track.","February 28, 2015","true","17.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And there are simulations (name withheld), that perhaps do a better job of 'simulating'.  But hey!   When you get one of those 1950 era electric locos pulling 5 carriages into a station.... oh sigh.... the graphics make up for it.  For the most part I don't mind the way you can/can't change terrain etc. it still looks good to me and works well 9 times out of 10.    I won't go into the 'little' details as enough has been said on those.  What I want to get across to people is it is a 'fun' game with really nice train 'pixels', yes I am using old terminology here but run with it.... I'm old - seriously do young people even 'get' trains? LOL.  And yes I know... using too many quotation marks.\n\nNever played OpenTTD, suspect I'd probably quite enjoy it.   BUT, from the sound of things it is outdated graphics wise, which is why I am happy with  TF.  I like to just sit back and watch the loco pull the cargo up the hill towards the destination.    If there was one thing I'd really like to be implemented, it would be a loco POV.    Other than that, I'm really happy with the game - and yes, as many people have pointed out.... steep learning curve, but well worth it my friends.  AND.... if you are not happy with the vanilla... there are PLENTY of mods that can help with that.\n\nMy first 'review'.  But in all honesty this game is a keeper.  I live in Oz, so I pay more for Steam games, and I'm still happy with the price tag.  If I were a Kiwi, I'd be whinging though; because it costs them twice as much in sheep  :-p","March 15","true","47.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is a bad joke, unfortunately.\n\nFirst the name: the game is about road and railroad transportation, unlike its name implies. I wish I had no other problems...\nOversimplified economy and simulation. The paradigm of keep it stupid simple created a Railroad Tycoon in full HD – but the complexity of economy, traffic and simulation has not really been improved from the game title from the early 90s.\nBoring gameplay. No challenges other than repeatedly creating bus lines between towns. For me, no local routes could reach any profit, the only thing making sense in the game is to connect different towns.\nBoring graphics. No more than a couple of variations of each types of buildings and 3 or 4 differently looking sims made the game tedious in two hours.\nUndetailed graphics: A horse wagon with horses but without carman? In 2015? Buses and trains stopping, but no doors opening and noone taking the vehicle or getting off? Joke.\nAdding several vehicles to a route will cause them to start at the same minute. Why the hell developers thought I will want to wait with my fingers crossed until my first vehicle reaches 25% progress in its total distance just to manually release the second of the four vehicles on the route and so on?\nWeird time simulation: Having build the 6th line with no pause between building lines, and the game reported vehicles on the first line reached their maximum age of 15 years. What?\nUnfortunatelly, after a couple of hours of gameplay I could add a dozen more items to this list, but I do not want to waste more time with this game.\n\nIf you ever wanted a nice state-of-the-art city builder or transport simulator, and you passed age 6, you do not want to try this game.

Graphic and models are nice, but build anything is really pain in the a**. It really ruins the game, because after several dozens of minutes you will end up in deep depression, because you find out that nice track you built is screwed up and you can't fix it, because game won't let you or don't undestand what you want to do. This bad design feature is even more screwed up by missing UNDO function, which means everything you make bad (rule here is 10 times bad, after that you maybe find the right combination) costs you in game money.\n\nFor example, I wanted to replace track junction with single track (detach the branch). I couldn't remove only branch, I needed to remove whole junction and place new short track instead of that deleted junction. But what happened? Game says, I can't place track there because of bad terrain. How it is possible? There was juntion few seconds ago! But what that means for me? I can destroy whole track layout around the junction because I can't fix that missing piece of track. It really pi***d me off and I turned of the game!\n\nIt's absolutely unbelievable, that train game is unable to make track crossing, bridge above the another track, or underpass under track. If you want to cross over another line, you need to join them with junction and than make another junction in another opposite direction. this means, it is impossible to cross two perpendicular tracks, because of limited curvature you need lot of space to make those tracks parallel and then turn it again to original direction.\n\nOn top of this, bad optimization of this graphicly simple game causes stuttering and big FPS drops even on machine, which is able to run new titles on Ultra. And I can get 60 FPS only from top view. When I move angle to see far, it drops below 20 fps. I really don't get what calculation this game can do on background.\n\nReally, this game should be Early access and there is a lot of work to do. But it seems, devs are not interested to much polishing. But I think they rather work on Train Fever 2, that turning Train Fever into useable game.\n\nSo to make a decision - this game has very big potencial, if will be continuously improved in future. But I am afraid, it will not. For now, you will be much more satisfied, if you will play OpenTTD for strategy, or Train Simulator for graphic.","April 2, 2015","false","17.0"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","11"

There is so much potential here to be a top of the line logistics/transport simulator. Yet I find myself crushed under the weight of the poor interface.\n\nI can put up with the fact that it takes many, many, many clicks just to place a short peice of road. Or the fact that laying track is the worst experience of my life.\n\nBut what really grinds my gears is when I get a popup notification letting me know that my vehicle has reached it's life expectancy and should be replaced, and then when I click the notification, there is no option to replace it from the vehicle menu. Only to send it back to the depot where I have only one option, to sell it. Not a damned thing about replacing it. So now I have to sell it, and buy a new bus, and then select the line I want that bus to run. Instead of simply clicking "replace vehicle with".   Needless to say, managing more than 5-10 vehicles quickly becomes a nightmare.\n\nAnd there are not even simple features that add depth and personalization to the game such as naming your own company, or picking a logo, or at the very least a color!   Nope, your just some business without a name, connecting the world because you can.\n\nAlso, I love it when sometimes the WASD keys, and somtimes the arrow keys stop working when I want to move around the map. Forcing me to mouse zoom in and out a couple times to "jog" the games memory a bit and let me use the keys again.\n\nI bought this on sale, and I'll remain hopeful that it improves.

Also, I'll add some minor tips/spoilers at the bottom for new players.\n\nThe game is fun and initially very challenging. The lack of tutorial information or quality "let's play" guides and videos left the learning/discovery pretty much to trial and error. But the process was fun and because it was challenging it caused me to want to do it more. One initial trial game on small/flat/easy allowed most of the advanced features to be figured out. And FYI to all new players the videos and forum posts on creating bus routes and cargo lines was all based on the AI prior to recent patches. My experience did not show those tutorials as being accurate and was a bigger source of frustration than anything in the game itself.\n\nThe game is more difficult initially than most maybe, but as long as you like the city/world management types of games but on a transportation level you can spend some enjoyable hours on it.  The graphics are good and it is neat to follow your trains/vehicles around, especially across that bohemoth bridge you built just for the sake of doing it.\n\nSpoilers/Noob Tips:\n• Build rails in small steps to avoid heavy $$ costs.\n• Local bus routes are keys to developing a prosperous city, and may not be lucrative themselves.\n• Big picture perspective is needed to get you through the long game.\n• Not all resources are to be connected to a town or factory\n• Most resources should NOT be connected via rail, early on anyway.\n• Signals and waypoints are your friends, use them","December 29, 2014","true","67.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I did not find it as irritating as I thought that there are not many commodities, given that you have to configure your consist with the right rolling stock.  Requiring different stations for goods and people seems realistic to me, and adds limits to work around that make the game more interesting, with more need for crossovers and track/signal management.  Proper signaling is a fun puzzle to solve, and now that you can use a signal or waypoint in a route, you have fine control over which track is used.  Once I figured out the right way to lay track, it became highly enjoyable, determining the best way to navigate a slope.  And it's a gorgeous game.

I've played for just over 10 hours so I'm going to update this review over course of the next few weeks. Please note that I genuinely want to love this game and will probably spend at least 100 hours playing it. For the record I bought the game on sale for about £6.\n\n10 HoursSo far I've found the game confusing and fragmented. the tutorial is a little brief and fundamentally the game isn't very intuitive. I have played several games, often realizing my errors and starting again as a recursive learning process. The game focuses on road and rail transport; so far I've found that creating a rail link between two cities is very profitable but introducing a third city creates a lot of problems due to difficulties managing which trains manage which lines.\n\nI haven't been able to make a profit on inter-city bus lines as people simply won't use the bus service despite using conventional wisdom when plotting the bus route between the various city regions.\n\nNatural resources seem to move at random between starting games. Sometimes lots of natural resources are produced and can be moved between locations and you can make a mint, and sometimes absolutely nothing is produced meaning there is no reason to even bother with them.\n\nTrain lines are confusing and creating more complex train routes is convoluted to the point of not being fun. Creating simple A-to-B routes is more profitable and is easier to manage.\n\nConclusionSo far I've enjoyed the game, in principle, but still feel like there's a huge amount of room for improvement. The basics are there but a lot of time needs to be spent on balancing and tweaking how the game works.","May 28, 2015","true","30.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not worth 24,99€, all and all 4,99€ is about right.\nHow would I describe this? If EA would make a tycoon game this would be it. Details are lovely but the cost...\nI would say the game is trying too hard even - yes you can check every single pedestrian who has an ID on him, know his job, home, relaxation and shopping habits. So you know where to transport him/her. You can also find the details of the locomotives, carriages, trams and buses are lovely and not just that the cities and cars too. Also the game never crashed on me (running windows 10 64 bit - respect!) Those would be pros.\nSo what are the cons?\nNo ships, aircraft, monorails, maglevs, subways, city management, AI, multiplayer. The construction of railways can be a real pain in the butt, endless collisions with terrain, improper angle for road crossings and no matter how much money I invested to a straight line across the map I could never get 300 km/h from the fastest train. And the game feels kind of limited in a sense. Why for example can´t I combine a tram and a train station into one ?\nOverall I realize that this game is from a new developer therfore I am not as critical, I believe (rather hope) new features will appear eventually. The game is fun for quite a while if you learn the basics and have a big enough map (reminds me can we have a map editor pretty please?). So if you want to support an indie game wait for a sale(!) and go for it.

The game actually is more complex.  Laying of tracks and setting up trains requires more work than Railroads.\n\nIn Railroads you simply lay your track then pick your train and train cars for that section of track.  In Train Fever you must do more, like create a train depot which MUST be connected to the track you want to train to be on.  I could not figure out how to delete a train nor have I figured out yet how to properly connect resources.  BTW, every station MUST be connected to a road which makes placing your tracks even harder.\n\nOn top of creating train routes, you also need to create bus routes to move people around each city to your train station.\n\nUnlike Railroads though, there doesn't appear to be any computer players to compete against.  For some people like myself, this can result in a not as fun game but if you are a huge fan of sim city type games where there is no one to compete against then you should enjoy this game.","May 31, 2015","true","287.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It is in my opinion the best train tycoonish game around at the moment and judging from past updates, it should get better with time.\n\nPros: It's fun! Nice graphics (maps, trains, other vehicules), good audio design, unique music, easy to use building tool.\nCons: Building tool needs more advanced options for more complex networks, performance gets bellow average on large maps in the late game, yearly savegame process is horrid.\n\nTF features a sandbox setup and very good looking proceduraly generated maps. It is really just that though a sandbox and it doesnt feature any tycoon options like campaigns and/or competition. Instead here you are fighting the elements such as hills, rivers, main roads, vehicules decay, etc. The maps look good and not two games are the same since they are generated. If however you are looking for real world maps, you won't find it here.\n\nSo what do you actually do when playing TF? You build train, tram, bus and otherwise truck lines to move either passengers and/or cargo around while trying to make enough money to survive another year.\n\nSo how is the building tool since it's most of what we do in this game? It's okay but not great.\n\nBuilding basic rails/roads is easy enough once you learn how the tool reacts to roads and rivers for example. It always try to save you money by proposing the most economical option (bridge, tunnel?, going over?). It also tries to make the best curves and slopes possible automaticaly. Setting up two lines next to each other is also a charm since the tool acts like a magnet and nicely sticks that 2nd line next to the 1st one. For all the basic stuff, it's great.\n\nThe building tool really lacks more robust features though, features such as seen in other titles like Cities Skylines. In short, you can't easily cross any other line that already exists. The tool isn't letting the player decide on elevation (page up/down in Cities: Skylines) and there's no way to build X or + connections between two lines. Sure there are tricks around this but it isn't friendly and it makes a mess. As long as you focus on building railroads for EITHER passengers OR cargo, it's fun enough. But as soon as you try to setup multiple lines for BOTH passengers AND cargo, the building tool just falls short. You see, passengers and cargo require different kinds of stations. But since there is no way for a line to go over or under an existing line, it's just not fun to try and build large rail networks for both passengers and cargo. You end up with a spaghetti of parallel lines preventing you from building additional ones.\n\nAs a result cargo trains are being left out for the most part and focus is more on passengers ones. It feels like a whole portion of the game is not accessible because the construction tool isn't robust enough and that is my main issue with this one.\n\nSure experiencing better performance on large maps, being able to buy industries, maybe have credit quotations for loans and see more tycoon features being added would be nice. But first, fix the building tool.\n\nI recommend this game because despite it's obvious flaws, it's fun in it's current state and there are indications it should get even better.\n\nThumbs up!\n\n\n","June 23, 2015","true","146.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Urquhart-/recommended/304730/","Urquhart-","Sarumancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Urquhart-/","188 products in account","Train Fever is a delightfully enthralling management game that you can plunge hours into. I found myself staying up all night in a 'Just One More Turn' sort of way, either because I was desperately trying to keep my fledgling Rail company above water or because I wanted to see if new technology's or expanding profits would allow me to splash out on a new project or to reinvigorate an old one. In terms of management, I've found that learning the basics isn't overly hard, but mastering it is the real challenge. In other management games, I have often found that once you plug the main problem, you have nothing more to do; it's too easy to find the perfect equilibrium and once you've played it once there's little reason to go back and play it again and you rarely had to restart for lack of skill in the first place. In Train Fever, you'll solve a short term problem only to later discover that there's a much bigger long term problem built upon more short term problems. There's lots to manage and lots to do (although not so much as to overwhelm you), and as technology advances new avenues for profit and loss will open up and you'll have to adapt to changing circumstances. Things that are in 1850 unprofitable and infeasible may in 1900 be profitable and very doable.\n\nIn short, Train Fever is a game of adaption, of chasing profits and avoiding losses, which can be tough, but very rewarding. You may have to play a failed game or two before you learn all of it's secrets, but a management game in which you instantly have the cure to any ailment is a short lived and unrewarding one.\n\n7/10","May 31, 2015","true","30.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I had 1 route designed like this: pickup cargo, drop off at station 1, pickup cargo again, drop off at station 2. Turns out.. the demand for goods in station 1 is low, so the goods stream in slowly, so the train keeps waiting to fill it up - and never getting to station 2 which is building up. The easy solution: create 2 separate lines and all is good.\n\nSo after learning how to lay bus tracks efficiently, place signals effectively, build bridges, ... you end up with a game that's a bit like it suggests in title.. first a fever to overcome it, then a fever because it will suck you back in. Because you can borrow enough money and making it profitable at easy level isn't all that hard, it's more a game about making a beautiful operating railroad than a tough challenge. And that's fine to me.\n\nIt's the best game in laying out an efficient routed railway - in any game. I really can't remember that that part was executed that well, and looked this good. I personally love setting the landscape to hilly and create a great flowing double track railroad running through with tight blocks so accommodate all the goods & passenger traffic.\n\nThe game runs very well on my GTX 970 at 2560x1024 with everything maxed out.\n\nThere are some quirks which I'll hope they fix soon, and I do want to mention that it's good to see the devs have just released another update and support the product:\n\n(1) Keys only work after clicking on the landscape\n(2) No mention when trains get stuck (especially after breaking up a section to expand)\n(3) The 'two steps'  required is tedious and doesn't belong in games.. figure it out guys\n(4) Upgrade a street won't fit while staying a 2 lane road.. really?\n(5) Bigger stations please\n(6) Allow alternative platforms through alternative waypoints\n\nSo all in all it's a very enjoyable game, if you can deal with it's learning curve - and especially when on offer for a special price, it's great value. If you liked transport tycoon, or similar games from Chris Sawyer or Sid Meier ... you'll enjoy this one. I think it's beaten their latest efforts for sure.\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","221.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You can not build a basic X with railroads. This makes much setups unbuildable\n- You can not build bridges over railroads (or at least I couldn't figure out how)\n- The game is a lagfest. R9 290X, 6 core AMD CPU and I get 20 FPS and amssive frame drops on medium quality\n- Sometimes the game tells you things like "Not possible - please build in two steps" or "switch construction failed" and you have to remove and rearrange parts of the track. This is so annoying.\n- There is no way of building multi-track-trainstations. The train chooses one fixed track and sticks to it. If I have a trainstation with two tracks and 3 lines using it, it might occur that one track is free but both lines are assigned to the occupied track so the incoming train is waiting, even if there would be a free track.\n- It is not possible to delete parts of tracks, only the whole track\n- Sometimes, for odd reasons building tracks is not possible, and you will have to split it up in parts, or remove/rebuild parts.\n\nThis game is unfinished. Or at least it feels like it. It feels like really-early-access and I am not sure if they are still working on this and listening to the community. I hate paying money for unfinished games. This has sadly become a trend recently and I hate it.\n\nFix this game, give it one more year of development and it might actually be playable.\n","February 22, 2015","false","7.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","3"

Despite building a *parallel* paved road I cannot delete the "main connection" dirt track. Seriously. I setup a route and the wagon uses the *dirt* road - not my brand new flash-harry paved track.\n\nNow this is apparently a recent "ïnnovation" because some idiot knee-jerker thinks SINGLE PLAYER games shouldn't be able to be exploited.

I'm fine with that but I'm UPGRADING the *road* - the very same thing I'm trying to delete - the dirt version.\n\nThe music is no better than some mad science experiment about feeling "good".

In my opinion this blows OpenTTD out of the water. First of all there's no grid system, so your roads and rail lines are more natural and fluid. Along with that, stations don't have an area of influence. The AI is smart enough to know that, if a station is close enough, it will take supplies and passengers there. The graphics are very good too. It looks great and I run the game on a laptop. I did have issues starting it up because it wasn't choosing the right graphics card, but it's fixed now. The audio is also great, both the sound effects and the music. The music is freaking awesome!\n\nAs far as game play goes, if you've played games like this, it's pretty easy to understand.\n\nNow there are a few detractors. It isn't very well optomized for lower end machines, but that's minor as in this game skipping is only an annoyance. There also no in game tutorials, but I see that getting fixed in the future. The biggest draw back of this game is it's price. $35 for a game like this is pretty steep.

So far I've played it with little lag. That's due to my rig, it's powerful but dated. For the most part everything I've seen is great. The track laying works well, trains make money. Some things I haven't figured out yet but with time I will. My main complaints are the same as others that I believe the devs will fix. The save file issue and the lack of ability to turn off auto saves bothers me. Not enough to give this game a negative review. Also some of the passengers on the longer distance trains dissapear. Can't easily replace vehicles. Can't easily upgrade stations. But overall I love this game. I've been watching it for quite some time now and even watched most of the Beta Testers play it. No game these days is released without bugs. I expected that. Now I'm waiting for the devs to hopefully fix it soon and I believe they will. This game has, I believe, a bright future ahead of it. Some people want to stick to the old games that they know will work and that's fine to me. I on the other hand have been waiting for a game with the feel of Locomotion but more modern graphics to come out. For years no one has taken on this genre and taken it seriously. Sid Miers Railroads was dumbed down too much for my taste. RRT3 lacks the ability to build a detailed rail network. And the graphics for Transport Tycoon hurt my eyes. I'm going to stand by this game. The cities are fun to watch grow. The industries react to supply and demand which is cool to me. You don't just move cargo there has to be a need for it, just like in reality. I'm going to continue to play this game and delete however many auto saved files I have too lol. I hope people wont shun this game for first impressions with some bugs. It's just a small group of people working on this and I personally say thank you to them for this game.

Even on flat ground it takes skill to get track laid without excessive filling or cutting. Then you have to think about linking up stations and bridges, and also linking up your trains to your town road systems. I have played a few of these games before and this one is really nice. The trains take a while to fill up with people, there is loads of steam and smoke when they stop, the graphics look lovely expcially in the towns with the horse pulled carriages, and there is quite a bit to think about.\n\nIf you want a fast game where you can layout massive circuits in a few minutes this game isnt for you. You really need to conctrate on what you are doing and plan ahead in this game.\n\nI is rather basic at the moment in terms of varied gameplay though. There arent any challenges other than not going bankrupt, and it all revolves around configuring your transport links and routes. But I am sure thios game will continue to grow into a really nice game. So I would say its a great start, the beginning of a potentially great game.

So you'll end up with trains using what track they feel like or sitting at lights for no reason at all. --\nNo significant tutorial, coupled with a entirely opaque UI, be prepared to spend time on goggle learning how to play. -\nTrack laying is both powerful and at the same time utterly dreadful, it forces you towards level tracks, generally good, but it will give you bridges for some drops, tunnels for gentle hills.  You can get around this, but you have to very carefully lay small segments of track, obviously you start to lose sight of the other station. -\nMaking money is very hard, at least at the begining the maintence costs are simply punishing, trains are a giant money sink, road transport makes money, rail transport costs money, -\nIndustry model seems broken to me, like the above, I am sure there was a reason my carts were sat waiting for coal, but the game wasn't about to tell me. -\n\nThis really isn't ready for prime time, i could have added more issues, but it seems unfair, the framework for a good, possibly great sim is here, but this really isn't it.\n\nI would wait for patches and/or mods before purchasing.","September 4, 2014","true","6.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

It has its limitations though, such as cargo will vanish if the player removes the associated route.  Therefore route planning is essential.\n\n3. Station mechanism has a bit of problem.  Train stations have to be physically connected in order to exchange cargo.

Frustrating. Non-existent tutorial makes this a tough game to jump into straight away. After spending an evening watching YouTube videos, I was finally able to get a business up and running and breaking even. Raw materials are scattered across the map, as expected, but the factories are also stuck out in the middle of nowhere, instead of congregating in the industrial sectors of your towns. Not having the ability to build new factories, where you really need them, is also extremely irritating.\n2. Fun. Not nearly as playable as Sid Meiers' Railroads and with no real goals or opponents it boils down to a straight builder. If you like SimCity or Banished, this is for you.\n3. UI. Horrible. To track performance and profitibility you need to have several windows open which cover most of the play area. With no ability to push these windows over to a second monitor you have to pause often to review your status. When new trains become available there is no accompanying information to let you know if they are passenger or freight trains.\n\nI really was expecting more.

The mixed reviews made me cautious, but experience has told me that some of the worst rated games have been the most enjoying to me personally, so I've learned to ignore them (for the most part). I bring to you now a cautionary tale of my journey.\n\nDay 1: I took the plunge and bought the game. Being a conductor for Union Pacific, I have a good idea of how railroads work. This game caught me by surprise. Everything in the game world is modeled realistically. Everything from the trains, industries, supply/demand, and even the individual people who walk on the street have a home, a work place, and a leisurely activity location.\n\nDay 2: I made a large map with some hills using the USA DLC. I built a passenger line from San Diego to Temecula, the year is 1850. I enjoy the little steam engines and the simpler way of life. Horses moved my little village people to and fro. And I was satisfied.\n\nDay 3: I've been up all night trying to establish a profitable passenger connection to Modesto and refine and upgrade my rail network to incorporate and support newer rolling stock and locomotives. My wife says I've been on the computer too much.\n\nDay 7: My wife is worried, she says I haven't spoken to her in days. In more important matters, I've recently connected the San Diego oil fields with an oil production site. I've linked it's distribution to San Diego, Temecula, and Minniapolis - effectively shutting down and putting the local lumber company out of business. I feel invincible.\n\nDay 12: I've lost my real life job. I've found that my virtual empire needs me more. The year is now 1950 and my rail empire now spans over a dozen cities with a conglamoration of rolling stock with newer as well as vintage locomotives plying the lines. I've established a second oil field in the town of Houston, which now distributes to over 7 outlying cities.\n\nDay 21: My wife has left me and taken my 2 year old son. Now that I have some peace and quiet, I can continue my domination of the digital world. My diet now consists of purple coolaid and stockpiled beef jerky that I kept getting for christmas.\n\nDay 30: My body is weak, I smell, I'm hungry, and the sunlight coming through the window hurts my eyes. But in other news, the year is now 2025 and there are but 2 cities left to conquer. They have remained untouched due to their inaccessible locations at high elevations. I plan to conquer them with trucks and busses and then tie them into the rail network.\n\nDay 42: I have achieved perfection. Every road and rail network is upgraded. Every line is profitable. Every train is properly balanced.\n\nDay 43: I've ventured out into the real world again. My body resembles that of a holocaust victim. I decided to go to Subway for a bite to eat. Standing in line, gazing at the menu, I decided to order a foot-long steak and cheese sandwich. As I sat down, I could hardly wait to bite into the sandwich. As my teeth sank into it's toasted, warm, and soft outer buns, a tear rolled down my cheek - not because I had forgotten how good real food tasted, but because I had remembered that I had forgotten to upgrade the old railroad crossing in San Diego.\n\n11/10 I would buy this again.","September 14, 2015","true","76.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","0"

I can absolutely recommend this transport-(mamagement-) simulator!\n\nShort description: Quite like Transport Tycoon, but better graphics and better gameplay. For guys who know Simutrans, Train Fever is the a little less complicated, but easier and graphically more enjoyable alternative.\nIt's basically a complex 3D transport simulation game, where you can build and expand (reinvesting your revenue) your own transport network across about 100 Years in a random generated map.\n\nPositive:\n+ Easy to learn, so it's also easy to build your own transport-worlds full of marvelous train lines, for goods or passengers.\n+ Best graphics for a Transport Tycoon I've seen so far.. Really great for rail-fans, thanks!\n+ Enjoyable from the 1 hour to the 200 hour of gameplay (and further, if the developers continue imporving the game).\n+ You can and have to really build everything along the railway line, so stations, slopes, bridges, tunnels, everything has to be done by you. You can build everything exactly as you want it (if you earned the money). Still (especially compared to other such simulations) it's easy to learn and sooo much fun!\n+ The train and tram models (mostly swiss) you can choose from are gorgeous!\n\nNegative:\n- Some bugs are still in the game (eg. occasionally building tools do weird stuff), but most of the severe bugs have been repaired quickly. The developers are quite active.\n- The user interface is not very nicely designed, but you'll get used to that after 10 mins.\n- Only trains, trams and buses so far (no ships, planes, underground trains, cable cars)..\n- Not many train models to choose from yet, but the ones they have are very well modeled!\n- No DLCs yet, but the still small community is quite alive.\n- You can not drive the trains in your world. But the graphics from looking at them should already warm the heart of any train-fan.\n- Passenger behaviour is not yet as complex as in Simutrans Experimental, so sometimes it's not 100% realistic... But for most purposes it works even better than most other transport simulations.\n- Only stations with up to 5 tracks and no underground stations or big city infrastructures available yet. So in its current form it's more like a transport simulator for rural railway networks, not megacities yet.\n\nConclusion: It's great fun for railway fans! With Train Fever I can finally my own beautiful alpine railway landscapes - and gampeplay is really fun... I love it. Buy it..","January 2, 2015","true","100.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

And look at the differences between OTTD and the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe. These things come over time. These guys know that community development is key, and mod support strengthens the game immensely.\n\n\nWhilst not perfect, the game fares really well overall and is the first game to do free (non-tiled) track building really nicely. And it's quite hard to master, even for a TTD-veteran. There's some more room for features and content, but that's always good, and they're continously working on the game, still. Also the music's spot-on, and really nicely following the TTD/Locomotion/RRT-style of smokey and jazzy bluegrass-esque mixtures.\n\nIf you're into trains, or at least into transport sims, you're not gonna regret this. There's a nice community behind it, and there's tons of mods already around. But the vanilla game - plus the free DLC, not to forget - are good enough to have a great deal of fun with.

In fact you don't even have to run any trains if you don't want to.\nYou can run a Stage Line instead and still make millions of dollars.  Of course you can run both trains and coaches.\n\nThe trains are hard to operate unless your simply running pont to point.  The signaling system is too simple to be of much good if you try running multiple trains on one track.  There is only one size Train Station, BIG.  There is no small Train Station that you can place at a distant Industry. There are three different sizes of train stations but even the smallest takes up space equal to 3 city blocks. They look silly sitting next to a dinky logging camp.\n\nThe industries are spread haphazardly about the map.  You might find an Oil Well but the Refinery could be halfway across the map.  It isn't cost effective to service since comodities bring very little cash compared to Passengers.  You can of course but it will take years to get a return on your investment.\n\nCargo hauling by Horsedrawn wagons or Freight Trucks is more cost effective than trains but unlike trains they can't haul freight to an industry and then pick up the goods produced. For example a Truck delivering lumber won't automatically change and take a load of goods made from the lumber.  You have to buy a seperate truck for goods, Not very realistic.\n\nGraphics are pretty bad,  Inside towns or cities it's not bad but out on the highways and tracks it's bad.  The land is bare and boring with an occasional tree or two.  Even shades of green would be better than dirt and sand.\n\nIf you use a Trackball or a wheel less mouse you will have problems scrolling some popup windows once you exceed 9 Lines.  Scrolling these windows requires a Mouse wheel.  Poor design.\n\nNow you might be wondering why I recommend this game.\n\nI'm enjoying running Stagecoaches and fine tuning the profit making.\nI like being able to zoom in and see my coaches moving along and looking at all the people inside towns.\nCute things like watching a coach stop to let pedestrians cross the street.\n\nI'm sure to discover new things as I play along.  I'll add them here if I do.\nI'm having fun,  so yes I recommend it.","September 28, 2015","true","228.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It might be worth watching a tutorial or two, but once you know how to not go bankrupt, you'll be well on your way to having a pointlessly large fleet of A4's steaming around doing ol' Nigel proud.","January 3","true","254.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And because of that it makes you wanna play more and more. The trains are very detailed, the wagons, the sounds. But don't bother getting it. Another unfinished game on Steam.\n\n\n- The game lags absurdly. My machine can run GTA V at full specs no lag. But cant run this game on a medium sized map with 20 trains running without lagging every scroll of the map. The devs already released 5 patchs to improve performance, still same thing. It will never improve. The engne is broken.\n\n- The cargo system is broken. No mods are able to fix that. The industries only produce goods if the entire industry chain is linked. That causes 2 main problems: industry chain in the game is ridiculously simple. The most complex industry you have is: Coal + Iron = Steel = Goods. That's all. Second problem is that if you want to make any changes in your line (put a more modern train, remake a connection) all the industries affected by that line will drop production to zero. Because they cant wait a second more than 20 minutes to receive goods. And to increase production back it take years. That means you lose a profit of millions for years and go bankrupt, game over.\n\n- Game balance is horrible. Put trains, trucks, buses and trams in one game was a huge mistake. A bus makes profit driving a feel blocks, to simulate a town. So if you want to get filfy rich you make a bus drive between two cities and you get more money than a train. Cities are too small, train stations are extremelly huge considering the map size.\n\n- There are way too many industries in the map. You can make the entire thing on trucks and buses, no need for trains. Of course, neither way is possible because after you buy your 10th truck or 10th train the game will lag till you want to punch the screen.\n\n- The game has nothing but connect point A to point B and look at pretty graphics. RRT2 from 1998 has 10x more features (a decent financial report, stock market, buy and sell companies, competition, etc). Well it has less features than Locomotion (a game that Chris Sawyer made while sleeping). Focus too much on graphics all the rest is left aside.\n\n\nIt took me years to write this review, but I cannot avoid this conclusion. The devs are dedicated but unfortunately they made a big mistake on development. I don't know why small devs make their own engine. Use Unity or other. CO made the same mistake with Cities in Motion 1. Very nice graphics, thats all. Lag as hell. If its a small team use your resources to finish the game, not start from scrach.\n\nNot wroth it.","September 13, 2015","false","175.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

However, because of a lot of negative reviews at the time and the fairly high price, I was a bit put off for a while. When I found it in a store for a third of the price, I instabought it. I can now say that its definatly worth the full price and is an extremely good game.\n\nPros:\n- Very nice looking, I could watch my trains for hours.\n- Large modding community to expand on the base game.\n- Runs very well, has been updated a lot since release.\n- Free "USA DLC" which adds even more\n- Good achievements which are fun to collect.\n- Building is decent, not perfect but does the job fairly well.\n- Is quite simple if you want it on the easy difficulty but still provides a pretty big challenge on hard.\n\nCons:\n- Lacks Ships and Planes\n- Lacks multiplayer\n- Doesn't have enough industries in my opinion.\n\nApart from those few cons Train Fever is very enjoyable and I believe is well worth the full price but pick it up on sale if you still believe its too pricy.","January 18, 2015","true","50.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact you don't even have to run any trains if you don't want to.\nYou can run a Stage Line instead and still make millions of dollars.  Of course you can run both trains and coaches.\n\nThe trains are hard to operate unless your simply running pont to point.  The signaling system is too simple to be of much good if you try running multiple trains on one track.  There is only one size Train Station, BIG.  There is no small Train Station that you can place at a distant Industry. There are three different sizes of train stations but even the smallest takes up space equal to 3 city blocks. They look silly sitting next to a dinky logging camp.\n\nThe industries are spread haphazardly about the map.  You might find an Oil Well but the Refinery could be halfway across the map.  It isn't cost effective to service since comodities bring very little cash compared to Passengers.  You can of course but it will take years to get a return on your investment.\n\nCargo hauling by Horsedrawn wagons or Freight Trucks is more cost effective than trains but unlike trains they can't haul freight to an industry and then pick up the goods produced. For example a Truck delivering lumber won't automatically change and take a load of goods made from the lumber.  You have to buy a seperate truck for goods, Not very realistic.\n\nGraphics are pretty bad,  Inside towns or cities it's not bad but out on the highways and tracks it's bad.  The land is bare and boring with an occasional tree or two.  Even shades of green would be better than dirt and sand.\n\nIf you use a Trackball or a wheel less mouse you will have problems scrolling some popup windows once you exceed 9 Lines.  Scrolling these windows requires a Mouse wheel.  Poor design.\n\nNow you might be wondering why I recommend this game.\n\nI'm enjoying running Stagecoaches and fine tuning the profit making.\nI like being able to zoom in and see my coaches moving along and looking at all the people inside towns.\nCute things like watching a coach stop to let pedestrians cross the street.\n\nI'm sure to discover new things as I play along.  I'll add them here if I do.\nI'm having fun,  so yes I recommend it.","September 28, 2015","true","228.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

This is sort-of that game. I probably would not have bought this at full price; as many other reviewers have noted, it feels incomplete. Track-building needs to be refined, more industry chains need to be added with more variation between them. There's no texture for transitions between the two main road types, which has no consequence on gameplay but agitates me to no end. The random maps all feel the same, and the game badly needs a map editor and Workshop support.\n\nThe UI is surprisingly good, with a couple exceptions. The developers clearly have learned from OpenTTD and tried to minimize needless clicking as much as possible. The graphics are technically great but artistically just OK, though the smoke from steam trains always looks beautiful. Most importantly, it scratches the itch for a modern 3D transportation game, and at sale prices, it's worth the cost for me.\n\nPeople who are into transportation games to make rediculously complex networks *might* not find this worth it. Players who aren't familiar with the genre will probably end up bored or find it takes too long to learn. People who like transportation games because YAY TRAINS!!! should probably get this, just don't set your expectations too high.\n\nI get the feeling the developers have the design part down pretty well, and hopefully their next game will give them more resources to execute that vision. I look forward to it.","August 24, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I thought I'd do the right thing and give it 12 months to see if it got better and from what I can see it didn't. As someone who was a massive fan of TTD almost 20 years ago and in the last few an even bigger fan of OpenTTD, I was hoping this could be something similar with improved graphics.\n\nI will give it some credit, the graphics are great. Beautiful models and nice, if not largely empty, maps but it goes downhill from there. I found the total lack of a tutorial map a massive turn off and found it insulting that the developers had the shear audacity to link to player made guides when I needed in depth help. There was a simple help tutorial which was vague, just lines on message box and no pictures to illustrate if you weren't sure. I found trying create lines difficult and not always obvious as to why it worked sometimes and not other times and that when I was trying to added new stations to a line it would just select the station instead of adding it.\n\nUltimately this game is definitely not worth $30, and honestly I would still feel like I got ripped off at $10. I'm going to put this in the "Got burnt hoping this game would be like something else" pile. What saddens me most is that I'm a huge fan of the Business Simulator genre that has fallen into obscurity in the last 10 years but it's games like this that give the genre a bad reputation and stop other, better games from being developed.","October 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","17","34","0","1"

However i still think vehicle running costs could be balanced a little better.\nBuilding train tracks(double+) is also a little frustrating sometimes when you can see no logic reason why the terrain can't be aligned and will drive you nearly nuts when trying to connect two stations through a tunnel or when the station istelf has to be in hilly terrain.However after some time practicing one is able to mostly avoid such situations.\n\nWell considering only Gameplay/Design i would give the game a 8/10\n\nBUT\n\nThere is the technical side that is pretty much a gamebreaker. In the Endgame or roughly after 1950 when the Cities start expanding the frame rate Drops significantly (for me from 60FPS frame cap to 8-15 FPS depending on camera view)\nand the autosave at the end of the year tends to stop the game for several seconds) Having the line overview open or a train window (the one where the train is viewed in the frame of the window) will drop the frames even more.\nAll in all it can be called a slideshow.\nAll you can do against it is play on small maps then the performance drops are kept at bay, but with a middle to large map (which are much more fun) you are pretty much doomed.\nThe perfomance issues seem to be caused by poor programming since cpu Utilization never rises above 20-25% and the graphic card is only utilized to a third of its potential.So even having a pretty high end system won't help much, since only 1or 2 Threads seem to be used by the game.\nIn my case its an FX8320(overclocked to 4.5ghz) paired with gtx 980 ti.\n\nmy final Rating would be a 2/10 considering perfomance drops in the endgame nullify the fun of the work you invested in the Previous 100-150 simulated years.\nThis Review was made with the latest patched version.","August 6, 2015","false","45.9"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

When I discovered Train Fever and decided to buy it, I really hoped it would be a worthy successor, as Sid Meier's Railroads is pretty much an antique by today's standards. I've been editing this review quite a few times as I've been playing and learning the game, and after playing for around 25 hours, I believe I finally have a good enough perspective to give a thorough and fair review.\n\nThe positive points:\n1) The game is, or at least *should be*, fun to play, if and when it works properly. Needless to say, I wouldn't have wasted 25 hours playing a game I didn't enjoy playing, so that fact speaks for itself.\n2) The vehicles look good, graphically. I can't judge for myself how accurate and realistic they look, but by reading other reviews and comments, I got the impression the developers did quite a good job about that.\n3) The soundtrack is nice and fun to listen to while playing.\n\n\nThe negative points:\n1) The performance is *really* bad. I have a decent PC. Nothing too fancy or cutting-edge, but enough to run most modern games smoothly on medium-high settings (Cities: Skylines, for one). Train Fever, on the other hand, barely works. It starts out okay, but as soon as the cities get a little larger than their starting size and there are over 30-40 vehicles moving, the game stutters constantly. I read somewhere that the main reason for that is that the game only uses one CPU core, as it doesn't support multi-core. All in all, the game seems not to use the hardware resources it has, which implies poor programming.\n\n2) The interface is very uncomfortable, there are no tutorials or in-game beginner-friendly guides to help understand how the game works. The information screens are vague and confusing. You pretty much need to learn the basics by trial and error, which is quite frustrating, considering you also have to struggle with the lousy performance while at it. I work as an accountant and I deal with companies' financial reports on a daily basis, but even I have been having troubles figuring out the financial data the game gives me about my company. Totally counter-intuitive. Needless to say, I know practically nothing about engineering or anything related to trains, which seems like a serious disadvantage when playing such a game. I've managed to improve a bit in my track building skills, but I'm still pretty clueless about how the cargo industries work, and the little I do know - I had to learn from a guide I read online. The little information the game gives about that is so cryptic, that it made me wonder what the developers had in mind when they released the game in such a state.\n\n3) Not enough content. There are no AI competitors, no random events, no side-quests, missions or anything else to make the game more interesting. While the game could be interesting enough without all those things (if it worked properly), they would sure be an important addition.\n\nAll in all, I only recommend this game to hard-core fans of the genre, and even then - I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale. For anyone else, I'd suggest to pass on this game. Not worth it.","August 11, 2015","false","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Train Fever can be a fun, charming game at times. It's beautiful to look at. Watching your train go across the countryside or following a tram through your city is just beautiful. It's relaxing (when it works). It's charming and I really gravitate to that. I like the ability to create my own transportation networks, plan routes and create my own little empire.\n\nBut it's fundamentally broken.\n\n1. Performance is exceptionally poor. By the time you get to 1950, expect your computer to stutter badly even on small maps. This has been only somewhat fixed in subsequent patches.\n\n2. Game mechanics either don't work correctly or are so poorly explained as to be frustratingly obtuse. Some things - like resource production or auto-replacing vehicles - only work sporadically. Others like city growth and even how to set up signals are so obtuse they're not fun. They could have done a much better job of either providing more information on screen or perhaps a better tutorial. But there are some quite un-fun mechanics in here.\n\n3. Gameplay is fairly limited. There are precious few industries, a static map (there's never a new resource node or challenge you have to react to), limited supply chains, etc. All of thise makes for a less-than-ideal experience. Transport Tycoon this isn't, even if it says it would like to be. There are no ships, no planes either. In short, nothing dynamic happens even though the time period encompasses the Industrial Revolution, 2 World Wars, etc. That's a major flaw.\n\n4. Probably the biggest killer is a lack of feedback to the player. There is very limited information. Want to know how many people use a bus stop? Sorry. Want to know why someone decided to walk or drive to work? Sorry. Want to know where that passenger is headed? Sorry. Your information is exceptionally limited and it makes problem solving pure guesswork.\n\nThis was so close to being good. But I think what may have happened is that they ran into such a roadblock with performance issues they never got around to really polishing the gameplay. It's quite a shame.","January 20, 2015","false","38.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The construction process is undoubtedly the worst and most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ever devised. The only thing you can do if you want to avoid mind boggling snafus is to lay a few single tracks and watch the trains as they roll.\n\nThis game is a crossbreed between  Locomotion and Cities in Motion and tries to accomplish everything but fails miserably in every aspect. Track layout is like in Locomotion except you have more chances to win the Nobel prize than to build a tunnel. Junctions can only be very far apart so you'll have a difficult time building a non-trivial rail network on the very limited space and uneven terrain. Train routes are like the subway lines in Cities in motion so all trains on a route will use the same line in a station regardless of how many there are. Every time you alter a route with so much as a signal it will be reset and the passengers will disappear. They also disappear from the trains while they are transported. You can't build roads over rails, you first have to demolish rails, place the road and then build the rails again. You can't demolish reasonable rail segments the game arbitrarily chooses large chunks and even both rails if they go over a road or there is a junction. Terraforming is horrible as you level terrain, you can only raise, lower or 'smooth' it and only in three circular brushes although all buildings and tracks are rectangular. You can build while the game is paused but this will still erase the passengers waiting at stations and confuse the trains.\n\nThere are only few vehicles and their running costs are excessively high, especially for trains. Mines and oil wells produce too little and have to be 'persuaded' to transport their cargo with your vehicles which takes a few years during which you'll only register big losses. You can't set the price for the\n\nThe ui is ghastly and cumbersome. The game freezes for many seconds at times and this gets worse as the game progresses.\nDocumentation/help is missing in action. Not even a few lousy tooltips like transport tycoon had 20 years ago.\n\n\nIt's such a pity there are so many serious flaws with a game which looks so good and has such detailed models and nice sounds and lighting. I really enjoy watching the vehicles move around and use the follow camera but whenever I have to build something it makes me so mad that i want to crash a few trains (which you can't do in this game by the way).\n\n\n","December 28, 2015","false","89.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

However, there are also some very weird, random, and obvious shortcomings (some are really really annoying) in this game, such as:\n\n- No real tutorial available, while the game has a steep learning curve.\n- No background sounds available, which is a big shortcoming!\n- No clear way to tell where people want to go to/work/leasure, which requires a lot of expensive trial and error. Use the Traffic Giant method by showing through colors where people work. Now only a 'Land Use' map is available, but it doesn't mean people actually work next door (why have a transportation simulator otherwise).\n- No minimap in the game, a big shortcoming with the huge maps.\n- When you have many lines, it becomes very hard to distinguish where lines are headed on different tracks, especially when you are colorblind. Would be better if you could highlight certain lines more clearly.\n- Very few vehicles available in the game, although modders are working to change that\n- You can construct railway crossings over roads, but not the other way around, which is SUPER ANNOYING\n- Only straight railway stations? Really??\n- Upgrading railway stations is incredibly annoying\n- Depots are one way only, which is terrible in case you have to replace a train in late game. Drive through depots are more realistic, and much better.\n- For some weird reasons,you cannot construct "X" crossovers for rails, only Y mergers, which is very annoying when you merge a lot of rails. "X" crossovers are part of elemental train track design, and leaving it out is completely random and not well thought out.\n- They should have made it easier to make flyovers. Making realistic flyovers is very hard due to the way the bridge pillars are implemented. Tunnels should be easier to make, too.\n- No way to customize the paint schemes of the trains. Devs say this is for reaslisms sake (while oddly not incorporating any realistic logos), however in real life, trains have been in different color schemes all the time in different decades (e.g. german trains) or special schemes. The trains are also a random collection of german/swiss/austrian trains, which makes the lack of paint schemes even more weird and unrealistic.\n\nIt just seems to me that the devs didn't really think it through that much. However, despite these shortcomings, it is still a great game to play. Lets hope that the mods or devs will alleviate these weird shortcomings soon. Some pros:\n\n- It looks great\n- Trains are nice (especially steam trains!)\n- Runs smoothly for me so far (Retina Macbook Pro, with nVidia card, with Bootcamp), no crashes or bugs to speak of\n- Give it a few weeks/months when some mods have arrived, and it will be even more awesome.","September 5, 2014","true","42.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A nice idea getting better at every update. But now that urban games announced they will direct their efforts at a new game, I got a little frustrated. The game starts as a horse carriage simulation at the beginning, because trains in early game are pretty expensive and not cost effective. In the mid game trains become an interesting choice, but the performance drops dramatically. Also the cargo system doesn't make much sense even in the latest patches. I'd provide a positive review if the game was a beta with room for improvement.

Also buggy on anything but a small map even though i have supported hardware and twice the required memory.  At least it autosaves every game year, because otherwise I would have lost alot of effort due to crashes. After 6 hours of frustration, including stopping to try to read various guides, I still could not get a single piece of cargo to be moved properly. Somehow while having improved graphics over the old Railroad Tycoon series, the game play just does not compare.  In every way that Railroad Tycoon worked, Train Fever fails.  While Railroad Tycoon was logical and rather easy to get a grasp on the basic functions, Tran Fever is just pure frustration.  So sad.  I can only be happy that I got this at 90% off.  EDIT - I want to enjoy this game, and I can see how eventually I may be able to once I fully learn how to make the game operate the way it should.  The problem remains that this is an incomplete game because to much is left to the new user to figure out on their own, and you simply can not do it without seeking outside help.  If not for YouTubers creating visual walk trhus of how to make the signals function and how to make cargo routes work, i would have had no concievable idea of how to do it, because the in game guide is completely inadequate, and doing what worked in other comparable games fails completely in this one because logic mechanis are not the same but also not explained by the developers. It was not until watching a Youtube walk thru that I found out how the cargo system actuall works and how routes have to be broken up to get them to function correctly.  Basicly for the common gamer this is still definitely thumbs down, while for train and management simulation enthusiasts it has some potential, but be prepared for hours of frustration before things start to click.","February 1","false","33.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I hate the cargo system. First of all, it works on demand, not on supply, which is an economical error. Second of all, it's buggy as hell. Several times happened to me that a cargo line was used for half a year and then it became unused for no reason and would remain unused unless I changed line's options. (Point A to B switched into point B to point A and everything came back to normal for another half of year). This is really irritating since cargo lanes are the main source of money.\nThe third thing is the variety of vehicles in the game feels really narrow. You start with two trains in XIX century, maybe fifteen trains in XX century and a couple of new ones in XXI century. This many trains should be available in only XIX century at least.\nForth thing is this game is unbalanced. Providing goods to towns is less profitable than providing goods to factories which is totally incorrect. Moreover, on hard mode providing goods to towns with trains is money wasted, because there's no way to make any profit out of it. Some vehicles are highly profitable, while others are just garbage.\n\nWell, about pros. They are still developing this game so hopefully all of this will get sorted out.","September 22, 2015","false","89.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I hate the cargo system. First of all, it works on demand, not on supply, which is an economical error. Second of all, it's buggy as hell. Several times happened to me that a cargo line was used for half a year and then it became unused for no reason and would remain unused unless I changed line's options. (Point A to B switched into point B to point A and everything came back to normal for another half of year). This is really irritating since cargo lanes are the main source of money.\nThe third thing is the variety of vehicles in the game feels really narrow. You start with two trains in XIX century, maybe fifteen trains in XX century and a couple of new ones in XXI century. This many trains should be available in only XIX century at least.\nForth thing is this game is unbalanced. Providing goods to towns is less profitable than providing goods to factories which is totally incorrect. Moreover, on hard mode providing goods to towns with trains is money wasted, because there's no way to make any profit out of it. Some vehicles are highly profitable, while others are just garbage.\n\nWell, about pros. They are still developing this game so hopefully all of this will get sorted out.","September 22, 2015","false","89.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Honestly, I've made more money from buses and cargo trucks than I have with trains in this game. I've attempted to make a successful rail line many times, but failed. Almost immediately after I bulldozed all of my train lines and created bus and cargo truck routes, I began to make large sums of money. I'm almost on $100 million now without ever using trains. So, if you want a train game that's more profitable when you don't use trains, look no further.\n\nEdit: Alright, I might have lied when I said "Without ever using trains". You pretty much have no other option than to use trains when you first start the game, but once the steam powered bus becomes available, you can just create a bus route between two towns and use that to make money for the rest of the game.

Also buggy on anything but a small map even though i have supported hardware and twice the required memory.  At least it autosaves every game year, because otherwise I would have lost alot of effort due to crashes. After 6 hours of frustration, including stopping to try to read various guides, I still could not get a single piece of cargo to be moved properly. Somehow while having improved graphics over the old Railroad Tycoon series, the game play just does not compare.  In every way that Railroad Tycoon worked, Train Fever fails.  While Railroad Tycoon was logical and rather easy to get a grasp on the basic functions, Tran Fever is just pure frustration.  So sad.  I can only be happy that I got this at 90% off.  EDIT - I want to enjoy this game, and I can see how eventually I may be able to once I fully learn how to make the game operate the way it should.  The problem remains that this is an incomplete game because to much is left to the new user to figure out on their own, and you simply can not do it without seeking outside help.  If not for YouTubers creating visual walk trhus of how to make the signals function and how to make cargo routes work, i would have had no concievable idea of how to do it, because the in game guide is completely inadequate, and doing what worked in other comparable games fails completely in this one because logic mechanis are not the same but also not explained by the developers. It was not until watching a Youtube walk thru that I found out how the cargo system actuall works and how routes have to be broken up to get them to function correctly.  Basicly for the common gamer this is still definitely thumbs down, while for train and management simulation enthusiasts it has some potential, but be prepared for hours of frustration before things start to click.","February 1","false","33.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game had reignited a passion for trains (steam trains especially) that I hadn't had since I was 10. The game immersed me in a potent mixture of nostalgia and wonder. I recommended the game based on these feelings.\n\nAnother ~5 hours later and the illusion of wonder has worn off. The cracks have begun to show, and now I understand why reviews are mixed. Because the game is essentially a mixed bag - here's why.\n\nMy specs I've been playing this on are:\nIntel Core i5 @2.5GHz\n8GB RAM\nIntel HD 4000 Graphics (mobile)\n\nI'm gaming on my subpar school laptop. The game actually doesn't look bad on the lowest settings. Stutters a bit when zoomed completely out and viewing the full map, but as long as I don't zoom out completely, it plays pretty well. Props to the game for that.\n\nMoving on: the gameplay - you build bus routes to ferry your passengers around inside cities, build train stations in these cities to connect cities to each other, and watch as the passengers line up at the station, begging to be allowed onto one of your fancy railroad cars. Add sidings, loops, or even another whole length of track to allow more trains to ferry your passengers between towns. Expand to another town, repeat the process! Dig tunnels and build bridges! (you even get to choose your kind of bridge truss!) Add more cars to your trains and upgrade them as technology advances with time! Cargo trains are much trickier (based on what gameplay I have they seem more like a late-game feature), though they are much more complex than simply connecting passenger lines together. Hook up different industries and resources like coal mines, ore mines, sawmills, and more and connect them to goods manufacturers like oil refineries, lumber yards, and more! Pay off your initial starting loan and make millions! Sounds great, right? Well, it is. What ruins the experience in the long-run is the UI.\n\nThe first (and biggest) mistake the game makes is lumping all your bus and RR lines for all cities into ONE management window. Doesn't seem like a big deal, right? Not at first. But it becomes really frustrating later on when I'm trying to see which bus lines correspond to which railroad lines, which ones are running cargo, and why some bus lines are losing money. Every line is numbered. So if I create two bus lines in three different cities, and then connected two of the cities with one RR line, it would look like (ignoring the parenthesis and the words inside parenthesis):\nLINE 1 (bus line city 1)\nLINE 2 (bus line city 2)\nLINE 3 (bus line city 3)\nLINE 4 (railroad line for city 1-city 2)\nYes, each line is color-coded, but that doesn't significantly alleviate the problem. Additionally, the way line numbers are listed, it's extremely wonky. Say I have 30 bus and railroad lines. The game will list the lines as follows:\nLINE 1\nLINE 11\nLINE 12\nLINE 13\n[...]\nLINE 19\nLINE 2\nLINE 20\nLINE 21\n[...]\nLINE 29\nLINE 3\nLINE 30\nTHIS IS HOW TRAIN FEVER NUMBERS ITS LINES!!! It becomes a logistical nightmare to manage your trains. Make no mistake, large corporations can be bureaucratic minefields to one degree or another, but Train Fever takes it to an unreasonable level.\n\nThe other major part of my beef with this game is the laying of track. Specifically, train stations. So I want to have a passenger station and, the way I was planning it, I was going to have a cargo train directly across from the passenger station. No biggie, right? WRONG, WRONG WRONG!!!\n> try to build cargo station directly across from passenger station with tracks in between\n> TF hates me\n> lay down second line of track and over a road just outside of where planned stations will be\n> creates two-line railroad crossing\n> still can't build cargo station without the game raging on me\n> give up after 45 minutes\n> try to delete one of the lines crossing the road\n> TF wants me to delete both\n> rage\n> begrudgingly delete double-RR crossing\n> try to lay down new track to reconnect original passenger station\n> Unable to place track\n> Rage\n> delete road\n> able to lay track\n> try to repave road\n> Unable to pave over track, you must build track after paving road\n> RAGE\n\nOn that note, the game will seemingly at random not want to place track in a given spot or create a split line for whatever reason. It's frustrating when it seems it happens for no good reason.\n\nI bought this over winter sale for 80% off ($6 USD). That's all it's worth.","December 28, 2015","false","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Bugs everywhere...\nEspecially after the year 1920 you try to do anything and *Hiccup* It's so unpolished and buggy, its got me into the habbit of saving every 5 minutes wich really takes you out of the game world at times. The music is really out of place, it sorta sounds like a fusion of 50s swing and techno and in the early stages of the game (1850-1900) it really doesn't fit the time period, aswell as this IT GETS IN YOUR HEAD I can't believe how catchy it is, you ut the game down for a couple days and then suddenly you start humming to yourself... and then it never ends...\n\nDespite I found this Incredibly addicting, I found it really hard to put the game down at times even when it did crash or the framerate tanked I rebooted the game and found myself playing for another few hours.\n\nA really good comparison to this game is : Cities Skylines (Paradox Interactive)\nThe gameplay is incredibly simillar however Cities Skylines hasn't got much depth in the railroad department but invredbile amounts in the city building aspect honestly I'd recomend that game alot more\n\nSO all in all this isn't worth buying but if you see it on sale say 50 - 80% off Id definately pick it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 17","false","77.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

They built a slow-at-the-end tiny-map game that at maximum is a communter train simulator for a middle-sized city in a incredibly boring map. Graphics, other than trains, are simply "meh". Plus, you do by far more revenue with buses (in a game called "TRAIN fever") that with trains, even more, you go bankrupcy with trains if they are no 100% full all the time and only 5 years old.\n\nWhat has gone wrong? Easy, Chris Sawyer developed the original game using a programming language called "Assembler" that allowed him to juice ALL the resources of the computer at that time so the result was amaizing. The swiss team but used a 3D engine base, that also is based in tons of another programs, so they had little control of where the resources of the computer are spent. Actually is not their fault, the 3D simulation and its level of freedom of possibilities is by far more complex than the 2D graphics of the original game plus using that kind of programs is a normal choice by small software companies.\n\nWhat to do? Play OpenTTD (it's FREE), and if you love it, help it to fund a better graphics patch. That's all.\n\nFinally, please note that is simply impossible to do a decent high-scale 3D transport game, too many resources spent for a game that will be used by not a big chunk of people (hoping that I'm wrong about that last sentence).","April 2","false","137.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I mostly played this game earlier, before the US update, but I reinstalled it some time afterwards and gave it another shot. Not that much appears to have changed, which is disappointing, as there are still quite a few things that could be improved. They promise they will keep supporting this one at least for a while, but major updates probably won't be forthcoming. I'm expecting only some bugfixes, not added content or changed mechanics. Such a shame. It is, in many ways, a decent game. There are also various mods which improve the game even further. But it is certainly not a great game. It really showed a lot of promise and might have ended up as a much better game than even Railroad Tycoon or any of its successors, never mind Transport Tycoon. Now my hope for that is fading fast. So not recommended, unless you're a hardcore train fanatic, eager to play anything to do with trains.\n\nLong version: there are many good things about this game. It looks pretty great. It allows you to play with trains and road transport alike. It allows you to build a transport network across a map, connecting various cities and industries, which evolve and grow as you play. New trains and vehicles are unlocked with time. You can play with European or US buildings. It can be a lot of fun to lay out a track and watch your trains, even high speed TGVs, race across them. Unfortunately, the flaws of the game are very distracting.\n\nTrack laying is often anything but intuitive. There are a few guides on how to create overpasses and the like, but that kind of thing should be easy to do and it isn't. It often feels as if you're wrestling the game, to try and trick it and get it to do what you want it to do. I've had episodes where the game kept telling me something couldn't be done, or where tunnels ended up coming out just wrong so I had to relay track that then didn't match up, costing me literally millions or whatever coin is used in game, bankrupting my company so I had to restart from a save game. Sometimes I was just trying to lay track alongside of existing track, or turn a single track bridge into a two track bridge and the game just wouldn't cooperate. Why is there no option to lay out track, check if it is the right way, THEN confirm to actually lay the track? How about an undo option? Sometimes you try to lay track and the game things it is easier to carve down a hill, costing you millions, instead of just building a tunnel. Although there is something to be said for the feeling of being victorious when I managed to do something that the game had absolutely refused to cooperate with, even told me repeatedly that it couldn't be done, I highly doubt that any game should be made that way and that people would want to play a game that worked like that.\n\nI also ran into trouble trying to get my trains to pass each other at a crossing. They ended up stopped, again costing me millions before I was able to fix it or forcing me to go back to an earlier save. Just when you think you've laid it out properly, a train stops, for no apparent reason and just turns back, headed the wrong way, all the way to the other side of the map, only losing money in the process. This game really should be able to use signals in a proper and realistic way. But even trying to create proper switches or points (intersections) is next to impossible. When I think I've managed to do exactly what I wanted, they end up confusing my trains so much they just stop altogether or start running on the wrong track. This is a game that tries to appeal to train enthusiasts, the trams and road vehicles seem to be thrown in as an extra, but it doesn't even get the train thing right. All in all, it feels unfinished.\n\nSome things are really still pretty basic. You can't create a map from scratch or adjust the random map in any way. So no placing industries, creating or deleting villages, nothing. Adjusting the settings un such a manner as to make it as flat as possible still results in a map with significant hills, so I can forget playing on a map that even remotely resembles my native country, never mind create an exact replica of an existing area, no matter how small, as the maps are also still pretty small even at the largest settings. The game inclused road vehicles in addition to rail vehicles, but don't include either water or air transport at all. This makes no sense and further limits the opportunities in the game.\n\nImproving or deleting streets is also quite difficult. Some options, like highways, don't even exist. Other options don't work very well, as you quickly end up having to destroy entire buildings, at great expense. In the end, you still end up with gridlock, with no clear way of getting people to get out of their cars, to take public transport. I have a sneaking suspicion that the AI that governs where people want to go is very, very basic and very, very flawed. That makes a game like this pretty much pointless, as instead of a realistic and challenging transport network, you end up having to play along with some obscure rules.\n\nWhen I played earlier, there were several serious issues, that should not have been allowed to exist in a released game. At one point, I ended up with several corrupted savegames, at another I was completely unable to remove sections of road as they were deemed to be an essential connection, despite them not leading anywhere. I haven't played the current release of the game long enough to be sure, but I haven't encountered them again and am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume both are fixed now. However, it says something about the state the game was in when I bought it and the level of Quality Control that these flaws were in a released game in the first place. So what hope do I have that their next game will be released in a better state? Why would I preorder that one, or buy it at full price, or even at all, based on this experience?\n\nThis game comes pretty close to being great however, which makes it all the more sad. With the Developers moving onto another game, there won't be as much support as there was, so all hope of this game being improved to be all that it could ever be, seems lost. It is not terrible, but it is certainly not great. It has something for enthusiasts, but mostly because of how little competition there has been in this field in the past few years. It leaves me feeling disappointed and sad, eager for more. And yet it could have been so much more and seemingly without too much effort. I've seen some interesting suggestions on the community hub and if the publisher changed its mind and came out with a solid update, that would fix the remaining flaws of the game and expand on its possibilities, I might even be persuaded to buy it. Something that I would do with reluctance, as it is still rewarding a company for releasing an unfinished game, but if it was good enough, I'd be willing to set that aside. They have people to feed too and moreover, I really want a game like this, only better. Just a bit better. I get the impression the developers were disappointed too, that they were too ambitious and now want to wash their hands of this game and move onto the real thing. But that would be wrong. Not only because they risk losing the trust of their customers forever, but also because they pass up the opportunity of making something really impressive out of this. They should invest in this game and really build it into a flagship product, show us what they really can do. Then keep releasing expansions. Then move onto the next engine and improve the game even further. They could milk us for years.

Windows pop up everywhere, very inconsistently.\n-UI needs more scalability.\n-Music is awful for the setting, at least in regards to the USA map. Doesn't in any way resemble what I would expect for the old west.\n\n\n\nIffy:\n\n*Campaigns are really just large sandbox maps. Some will love this, some will hate it. Not much in the way of structure.\n*Can't speak to how accurate train models are. I've played enough train games to know it's in the ballpark. It's not something that's overly important to me, so beyond that I can't say much.\n*It'd be nice if there were more interaction with the cities, a la Railroad Tycoon 3. A little more interaction with industry.\n-Tutorial is... less than great. If you don't have a basic grasp of these sort of games, you'll probably be lost.\n\n\nI know I nitpicked, but I really do enjoy this game. It's Railroad Tycoon meets Cities in Motion.

New trains and vehicles are unlocked with time. You can play with European or US buildings. It can be a lot of fun to lay out a track and watch your trains, even high speed TGVs, race across them. Unfortunately, the flaws of the game are very distracting.\n\nTrack laying is often anything but intuitive. There are a few guides on how to create overpasses and the like, but that kind of thing should be easy to do and it isn't. It often feels as if you're wrestling the game, to try and trick it and get it to do what you want it to do. I've had episodes where the game kept telling me something couldn't be done, or where tunnels ended up coming out just wrong so I had to relay track that then didn't match up, costing me literally millions or whatever coin is used in game, bankrupting my company so I had to restart from a save game. Sometimes I was just trying to lay track alongside of existing track, or turn a single track bridge into a two track bridge and the game just wouldn't cooperate. Why is there no option to lay out track, check if it is the right way, THEN confirm to actually lay the track? How about an undo option? Sometimes you try to lay track and the game things it is easier to carve down a hill, costing you millions, instead of just building a tunnel. Although there is something to be said for the feeling of being victorious when I managed to do something that the game had absolutely refused to cooperate with, even told me repeatedly that it couldn't be done, I highly doubt that any game should be made that way and that people would want to play a game that worked like that.\n\nI also ran into trouble trying to get my trains to pass each other at a crossing. They ended up stopped, again costing me millions before I was able to fix it or forcing me to go back to an earlier save. Just when you think you've laid it out properly, a train stops, for no apparent reason and just turns back, headed the wrong way, all the way to the other side of the map, only losing money in the process. This game really should be able to use signals in a proper and realistic way. But even trying to create proper switches or points (intersections) is next to impossible. When I think I've managed to do exactly what I wanted, they end up confusing my trains so much they just stop altogether or start running on the wrong track. This is a game that tries to appeal to train enthusiasts, the trams and road vehicles seem to be thrown in as an extra, but it doesn't even get the train thing right. All in all, it feels unfinished.\n\nSome things are really still pretty basic. You can't create a map from scratch or adjust the random map in any way. So no placing industries, creating or deleting villages, nothing. Adjusting the settings un such a manner as to make it as flat as possible still results in a map with significant hills, so I can forget playing on a map that even remotely resembles my native country, never mind create an exact replica of an existing area, no matter how small, as the maps are also still pretty small even at the largest settings. The game inclused road vehicles in addition to rail vehicles, but don't include either water or air transport at all. This makes no sense and further limits the opportunities in the game.\n\nImproving or deleting streets is also quite difficult. Some options, like highways, don't even exist. Other options don't work very well, as you quickly end up having to destroy entire buildings, at great expense. In the end, you still end up with gridlock, with no clear way of getting people to get out of their cars, to take public transport. I have a sneaking suspicion that the AI that governs where people want to go is very, very basic and very, very flawed. That makes a game like this pretty much pointless, as instead of a realistic and challenging transport network, you end up having to play along with some obscure rules.\n\nWhen I played earlier, there were several serious issues, that should not have been allowed to exist in a released game. At one point, I ended up with several corrupted savegames, at another I was completely unable to remove sections of road as they were deemed to be an essential connection, despite them not leading anywhere. I haven't played the current release of the game long enough to be sure, but I haven't encountered them again and am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume both are fixed now. However, it says something about the state the game was in when I bought it and the level of Quality Control that these flaws were in a released game in the first place. So what hope do I have that their next game will be released in a better state? Why would I preorder that one, or buy it at full price, or even at all, based on this experience?\n\nThis game comes pretty close to being great however, which makes it all the more sad. With the Developers moving onto another game, there won't be as much support as there was, so all hope of this game being improved to be all that it could ever be, seems lost. It is not terrible, but it is certainly not great. It has something for enthusiasts, but mostly because of how little competition there has been in this field in the past few years. It leaves me feeling disappointed and sad, eager for more. And yet it could have been so much more and seemingly without too much effort. I've seen some interesting suggestions on the community hub and if the publisher changed its mind and came out with a solid update, that would fix the remaining flaws of the game and expand on its possibilities, I might even be persuaded to buy it. Something that I would do with reluctance, as it is still rewarding a company for releasing an unfinished game, but if it was good enough, I'd be willing to set that aside. They have people to feed too and moreover, I really want a game like this, only better. Just a bit better. I get the impression the developers were disappointed too, that they were too ambitious and now want to wash their hands of this game and move onto the real thing. But that would be wrong. Not only because they risk losing the trust of their customers forever, but also because they pass up the opportunity of making something really impressive out of this. They should invest in this game and really build it into a flagship product, show us what they really can do. Then keep releasing expansions. Then move onto the next engine and improve the game even further. They could milk us for years. How is that for a marketing strategy?","August 16, 2015","false","59.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Train Fever is obviously inspired by Transport Tycoon (Deluxe) and/or its opensource version, OpenTTD.\n\nBoth games use a simple grid system with sprites and to put it midly, the graphics look dated. Train Fever obviously ups the stakes in the graphics department and when it runs, it looks pretty decent. But nobody played openTTD for years for the graphics, it was/is the gameplay, refined through years of development, that kept people coming back.\n\nDoes Train Fever compare well to an ancient game, the most common player version available for free? No.\n\nFirst off, this game is closer to TT then OpenTTD, it is a common problem for a new game that is based on an existing game, it tends to lack the refinement, content and bug squashing its pre-decessor went through. When Locomotion came out, the official sequel, people liked the improved graphics but were less enthused by essentially taking a step back in time with regards to features.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, Train Fever feels like a lightweight TT when I have gotten used to the heavyweight OpenTTD.\n\nBut why does this game remind me how brilliant Chris Sawyer is. Error messages. You will see a lot of them in Train Fever and they will drive you up the wall. Some are to due with the terain and it shows how brilliant Sawyers decission was to go for a simple grid. Sure it looks ugly but you always know what you are doing and building tunnels and bridges is a breeze. Not so in train fever.\n\n\nAnother is bridge building, Sawyer simply saw pillars are graphical niceties, who cares if they are to far apart, it is gameplay that matters. Train fever insists every bridge pillar is in the right place and therefor building a bridge over anything at all is extremely error prone.\n\nRealistic I hear you say? Not really, if in the real world a rail bridge has to cross another track at an angle, engineers simply place two pillars on each side of the track, put a crossbeam on top and the bridge on top of that. Job done. The Dutch rail network has plenty of examples of these fly-overs (way to cross a track without blocking the other track).\n\nThat is Train Fevers biggest failure, the desinger thinks error messages beat gameplay. No you can't cross this road at a right angle, BECAUSE! No, we can't space the pillars differently, BECAUSE!\n\nIn OpenTTD if you run into trouble with lost trains, you can build track in front of the train to lead them back. In train fever, you can't build track close to a train, can't change or delete signals close to a train, the stop/reverse buttons are on a seperate tab from the route assign and find depot depot, Once ytou do manage to place a depot close to a train, it can't find it.\n\nI have had to cancel several games by now because of trains completely stuck and overlapping each other. Routes you define get changed randomly, the slightest hickup sees trains going off in all directions, try to manage it with signals and trains get stuck. You can't force a train to move or ignore a red light, nor do signals show a red light. Trains do occasionally drive through each other.\n\n\nMissing features that really should be in the game and bug that shouldn't:\n\nIndustry is far to simplistic with just 2 chains (ore/cole -> goods) (wood->goods) goods can be deliverd to a city.\n\nIndustry seeder is to random, one map with one forest, four sawmills.\n\nIndustry often produces no raw material, only way to build a semi reliable network is to watch the flow of existing cargo and move goods faster. Simply building a route yourself will not startup production.\nStations, even if grouped do not share cargo, so your truck dock is overflowing but your train runs empty.\n\nIt takes two click to select track layer, if you are destroying track,it is just an extra hassle that doesn't need to exist.\n\nBuilding road bridges is near impossible, you can't simply build a road, force it to go up and create a bridge, it creates a hell of a mess, if you even manage to get the "collision" type error messages to go away.\n\nBuilding shortt tunnels to dive under a track is a similar mess.\n\nDespite claims of wanting to fix the economy, which in TT is broken in that passenger traffic pays of most of all, this game again makes passenger traffic the most rewarding. The better you connect the cities, the more pasengers, the same does not go for cargo. You can have full trains with a simple route, cargo trains take decades in game years to build up to few wagons.\n\nSignals are very basic.\n\nNo visual indication for signals as to their state, signals are to small to see and their icon does not show what direction they are pointing in.\n\nDespite the game using routes (the game shows a ribbon for your train routes over the track, they SHOULD only follow thar route, you can't easily change it, there is for instance no way to force a train to a certain platform or to take a certain route) trains easily get lost and end in all the wrong places, often staring each other down nose to nose each refusing to move.\n\nRoute finding is extremely iffy and trains can't pick their own individual routes, no mixing fast and slow trains and having them overtake each other. Or another train arriving on one platform as another on the same route is leaving.\nIn OpenTTD, I scoff at players that only create simple routes, a train station at each end, each route on their own seperate track. I love making big complex networks getting enjoyment out of creating stations with half a dozen trains entering and leaving at once.\n\nForget about that in Train Fever.\n\n\nThe game as it is now is an interesting project but the developer needs to hire someone who is less anal retentive about perceived reality and introduces some much need "game" into the engine.\n\nMaybe if the game gets picked up by the openttd developers or this developer plays that game and learns something, it will improve but right now, only buy this game if you got a very high frustration tolerance.\n","October 12, 2014","false","112.6"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"

The text was all fuzzy and barely readable on a Win10 4k resolution. That problem went away after I restarted the game, however the mouse pointer was restricted to 3/4 of the screen. Lowering the resolution at that point didn't fix it, playing in a window did.\n\nThe game lacks a tutorial. It lacks a campain. You're just thrown in the game on your own. It's unbelievable how unpolished the UI is in this game. It really feels like splatted buttons and text by a novice.\nLaying rail track is a pain. Raising a road to create a bridge over rail tracks is easy, but that is a whole different ball game for rail bridges over roads. Go figure.\n\nI kept going though, looking at guides and reading forums. But I immediately stopped playing and asked for a refund when I realized that every time the game was computing the finances and displaying the maintenance cost for 3 !!! running vehicles froze the game for a fraction of a second on a 6 core I7 and a 980TI. I'm a software developer and I immediately understood that the simulation is running on a single thread. If this was happening in the first hour of playing the game, imagine what it would be like later on in the game.\nUPDATE: Digging into the forums, this is indeed one of the top complaints: http://www.train-fever.com/forums/topic/req-multithreading-performance-issu-large-map/\nIt becomes unplayable later on in the game or on a large map.\n\nDon't believe the excuse that synchronizing resource access in a multi-threaded app is killing its performance. If the code is done right, and the synchronization primitives are being used correctly, you'll get a cool working game with nicely balanced work loads on all the available CPU cores and even on the GPU compute cores. If things get too hectic and the load reaches a high threshold value, the code can simply lower the simulation speed or coarse grain the steps in order to compensate, but still run tasks in parallel. Nowadays, there is no excuse for not fully taming the power we've got in our computers. Multi-core CPUs weren't invented yesterday!\n\nThe graphics are nice, that's the only positive about the game. The developers simply stopped short of finishing the game and moved on to DLCs and future titles. Or I could give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they lacked the skill. Simulations are not easy to get right.","April 8","false","1.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Simple cargo-truck, bus, and even tram lines are plenty workable. However, when you start trying to build railways, you run into lots of intractable problems:\n\n1. The handling of elevation in rail tracks/stations is not good. Stations seem to be elevated off the surface of the map (and the terrain raised), or recessed into the ground, for no obvious reason. It's hard to build tracks between relatively near stations, because the system wants to build them at a high slope.\n\n2. Trains often have trouble finding their way on really straightforward rail routes, even when you're using things like waypoints. Conflicts between trains are far too common, and the use of signals is complex and fraught with peril. Basically, forget about having more than one train per track, and expect persistent headaches at terminus stations.\n\n3. It's possible to end up in a state, especially on multi-train lines, where your trains are PERMANENTLY stuck and you simply must revert. That's unacceptable.\n\n4. Train Fever doesn't let you do anything with elevation, except in the form of the afterthought hacks in the path-finding phase during build. No elevated or subway trains, making it hard to do much better than streetcar/tram light rail in the cities.\n\n5. The cities grow so slowly that they never really arrive at the sort of scale that makes a transit system a fun challenge. On easy, you build a few cargo lines, cash in and watch the money stream in. On the harder difficulties, it's a challenge to make headway at all.","February 7, 2015","false","62.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","3"

It is an unfinished at best and unplayable at worst game. It has some gamebreaking bugs that make this game a chore rather than a pleasure to play.\n\nFor starters, I had troubles even getting the game to work. The store page states that I need a GFX card with half the power my system has to run this game. Even so I had frequent stutters and a LOT of crashes. I spent hours trying to fix this game. The forums are littered with complaints about crashes, many of which have not had any answer whatsoever by the devs.\n\nEventually I seem to have found some sort of half-arsed solution (since apparently in all cases it's the systems fault NOT the game, when it crashes) which causes my game to only sometimes crash.\n\nNow that I have got my game running (kinda) I face all the other issues:\n\n1. Laying train tracks and stations is tedious beyond comprehension. If you can even find a way to place a track, don't think about removing it and placing it again, because it changes the landscape permanently. Yes you can fix this with the landscape tool, but why would I need to?\n\n2. Placing lines seems to work fine at first but is then met with many complications. Oftentimes resulting in trains not moving at all. There are workarounds for this, but they require manual interference rather than the AI just being clever enough to figure things out themselves. This should be something that works intuitively, but rather than that, it require hours of finetuning just to get 1 train track to run half-decent.\n\n3. The game has massive framerate issues. As stated before I ran this game on a card with more than enough power. I set all the settings to the lowest possible. I lowered the resolution and STILL I had frequent drops in framerate. Once again I went to the forums to check if there was a solution and once again I was met with "You need to update your system" rather than "Our game is not optimised properly".\n\nOverall this game just feels very sub-optimal. The way you would expect an early access game to feel. If I were to play this, not knowing in what stage this game is, I would say late-alpha, early beta.\n\nAll that said, the developers ARE updating this game regularly, including performance updates, but I don't get my hopes up too high, since this game has been out for a while and has had many updates and still doesn't run well at all.","February 17, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I was a hardcore OpenTTD and CIM2 & 1 player and managed to achieve massive and functional cities but this?! This thing right here is just plainly stupid. It tries to wow you with nice graphics and at first you might fall for how great it looks but you just wait for this bug fest! Btw. this is my first ever hate comment and first game ever to make me so angry. I really tried to overcome countless amount of problems but it's just impossible.\n\nFirst of all UI is just terrible. Windows can't be resized, they pop up in random places (sometimes beyond your screen), buttons are tiny, everything requires loads clicking especially if you manage to grow your corporation to a decent size. Developers recently added auto renew option to your lines. Great. It doesn't change the fact that you still have to manually click on every line and chose which car/train you want to use as your new vehicle. What if a new model is researched? Well, repeat that whole process. Is it really that difficult to think and allow to select many lines rather than just one and make batch changes to them?\n\nOther UI problems include little things like the fact that when changing a name of your line you have to always press and hold backspace to delete a default "line 1" name. You can't select what you've written, you can't copy it, you can't move your cursor. Basically you can't do anything that Notepad application can. Little things but wait until you have 100s lines and want to do some simple cleanup.\n\nBigger errors include things like a lack of save menu! I mean this is just ridiculous. When saving you have to type your name and that's it. You can't select a previous save so if you make one spelling mistake you will create a new save file or what's worse you can easily ovewrite a different game. You can't load a game from any other screen but main menu and all auto save files are mixed with your regular ones so it's just a massive cluster ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEnough about a terrible UX. How about the game itself? I said already that it looks great but that's about it. There is absolutely no AI. ZERO! Your vehicles will move along set paths and that's it. It doesn't matter that there might be other vehicles blocking it, if it's stuck it will be stuck forever and you won't know because obviously there is nothing that would inform you.\n\nYour trains will always stop on the same platforms. There is no point in building big train stations because computer will always use the same place to load and unload which is totally ridiculous as there might be 5 billion trains waiting in line to one platform while there are 7 other available. You might think that maybe I need to build signals? I tried. I really tried but this game only has 2 and all they do is let or stop a train. They won't direct to a different track, they won't do anything useful. You need to have them so your silly train drivers won't crash into one another but you can't use them for anything useful. Just bloody terrible!\n\nBuilding roads and tracks is just totally unbelievably idiotic. Route finder will prefer to build massive, stupidly high bridges or long tunnels and claim that it's cheaper that just laying a road on a hill. You also have to lay paths in separate segments and seems like height is applied to a whole section so you end up with these ridiculous lines that costs a fortune and totally wrecks surroundings because computer seems to mix uber high bridges with total destruction of nature. Same with depots and other structures (not that there is many of them). If you put one down on a slight hill, you won't get a gradual terrain alignment, you'll get a fricking cliff in the middle of a city that looks weird as hell.\n\nBut the worst of it all is cargo. First of all there are only 4 types which you can increase with mods but that doesn't change the fact that factories doesn't follow any rules at all. They sometimes won't produce anything while suggesting that you can increase manufacture by shipping more of the produce. How am I supposed to increase sending of ZERO??!! Then they'll say that line is in no use even if city is accepting resources and all of them are properly connected.\n\nThat's actually another thing. There is no explanation to how all of these things work. No tutorial no nothing. If there was a wiki made by developers that would in depth describe the engine of this game maybe you could understand why certain things are happening but at this point it's just a massive lottery. Loads people are speculating on the internet and share their experiments but no one knows for sure. For example there is apparently a 20 minutes limit on waiting time for a cargo to be picked up but I only know this from players that observed such behavior.\n\nYou don't know how population is transferring, you don't know why cargo is not moving, you don't have any proper stats, there are no good overlays, you can't even set your trains and truck to unload outside their dedicated destination (like a transfer station), performance is ridiculous even on high spec computers and more and more issues.\n\nSeriously, this game is more like an Alpha then anything else. It's not even about bugs which there is plenty but about the whole way this game works. How in 2015, can you make a product that is waaaaay worse than Railroad Tycoon 2 that was launched 17 years ago!!! It really annoys me that Steam is letting things like this go. Is there zero quality control?\n\n+ Graphics are pretty nice but ruined by things like ghost buses and horse carts, people waiting on bus stations in a perfectly aligned grid and disappearing if there is too many of them and of course trains and buses reversing in place.\n\n- everything above.\n\nThis game has a great potential but god dammit there is still a lot to do. Shouldn't be released by any standards.","March 5, 2015","false","21.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","13"

There are trains but not much fever :)\n\nPROS:\nNice visuals, especially when it comes to the terrain. Railway cuttings and embankments look very realistic. Individual people also change their attire as time passes by, which is an interesting touch.\nModding support, allowing the users to download additional game content.\nAn American DLC (Free) allowing you to run the simulation in the different environment.\nThe game is very stable and can happily run in the background as you strive to do more important things on your PC :)\nCONS:\nBuilding multiple tracks or a station throat is a nightmare. Modernizing the track layout is next to impossible.\nYou cannot rebuild a station - add a new platform, goods yard, extend the platform length. Once you want to do so, you need to demolish the existing building and make space for your next one - which includes bulldozing a lot more. Occasionally, the bulldozed space is immediately filled by a new structure, forcing you to repeat the operation again.\nYou cannot build railway crosssings other than laying track across the road. You are not allowed to build a street crossing an existing track. And should you prefer to build an overbridge instead, you will need a lot more space to run your street above the tracks.\nModding support is... well, flawed.  I needed to reinstall the game and the TF Game Manager (mod manager) after the latter had crashed, rendering my installed mods invisible and thus unable to be enabled (sic!) for my current game. Mods are not used automatically - must be enabled first, then selected when starting (or loading) a game.\nStrange selection of trains. In the vanilla game there are only 14 locomotives available for the entire game period, and only 4 of these are available for the 50 years of 19th century. One needs to wait until 1902 to see an engine attaining 100kph speed. Well, I believe that GWR's City Of Truro did 102,3 MPH (that's 165 kph) in 1904, and a lot of British trains had their running speeds in the range of 100 kph well before the turn of the centuries. The LNER A4 Mallard is a curiosity since there is no other British railway vehicle (and only two other non-German/Swiss). No Patentees, no French Cramptons, no French Atlantics or Pacifics, no DRG Einheitslokomotiven, no TEEs. No Shinkansens. Again, this may be corrected by modding, but... see above.\nIntermodal passenger transport does not work. Once you place the station in the city, other passenger transport in this city is rendered unnecessary - somehow all the citizens immediately want to travel to other cities and will go by foot to your station, avoiding any connected bus/tram line. It seems that building the intercity connection changes the behaviour of citizens to look for their work/leisure targets somewhere else than their home city.\nThe game is essentially eventless - once you build your intercity connection, money starts flowing in and that's all. No competition, no breakdowns, no crashes, almost no interaction required other than occasionally replacing the ageing vehicle.\nNo proper savegame screen. You must specify a filename when saving, and there is no warning if you overwrite any previous file of that name.\nResource hungry. My 3rd Gen i5 laptop with 8GB RAM and 1GB GT525 is barely able to run the game full screen; with full details I achieve single fps. The same laptop can run Arma II, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified and Ultimate General Gettysburg on recommended settings with no trouble.\nThe game may appeal to German railway fans (or maybe Swiss railway fans), of which I am neither. With the American DLC, it may also appear to American railroad fans, again not to myself. Since the developers are updating the game, perhaps some of the mentioned problems may be fixed.

The engine seems to have been unfinished or unsuitable from the start, an inability to cross roads over rail is something which apparently can't be fixed. The building system is frustrating, the game is feature lite, the whole experience has been frustrating.\n\nI wanted to like this game, much of my play time is idle time spent minimised while I while away frustration in order to give the game more chances.

It's impossible to use. There are no "standard" game features/controls I would expect. Such as ESCAPE to bring up the menu and/or quit. I used the "Windows Key" to bring up the desktop then force quit with task manager. The menu for the game is completely non-functional while in-game, clicking settings highlights the button and does nothing. The menus are constantly in the way and disable the mouse scroll so if I move the mouse over a menu while trying to scroll the board, it doesn't move the map, I have to move the mouse around and in-between the menus to scroll - super frustrating. The tutorials do little to help you get started and are constantly in the way. The placement of all the menus is terrible and they cannot be moved around. When I finally did get something working, I somehow managed to use up all $3M with a train depot and a single straight piece of track, left unable to purchase cars or figure out how to get citizens to use the newly built lines. The load this game puts on my computer is extreme and causes lag and this is a gaming PC with dual graphics cards, SSDs, fully loaded. I'm extremely frustrated and probably won't play this game again. Good thing I got it on sale.\n\n---- NEW BELOW ----\n\nAfter quite a lot of tinkering around, I've finally got 3 trains up and running, and lines for them to follow. I determined the menus don't work on a multi-monitor desktop PC, when I loaded this game on my laptop, the menus showed up on-screen. I've also figured out a work around for the scrolling problem, don't put the menus up against the edge of the screen and your arrow has room for scroll - big oversight on the developers if you ask me. I'm still not very pleased with the interface, it's incredibly clunky, and I'm not getting used to it. As for game play, I did manage to figure out the loan program to get enough funds to complete rail between 2 cities, and add some bus stops within the cities to get people to my stations, then paid off my loans so I can just build now in the black.\n\nDue to the enormous amount of problems and glitches with this game, I still have to rate it a thumbs down.

Construction of lines is fussy, with constant complaints of obstructions and missed connections.  It is certainly not as smooth and simple as the demo videos show.  Navigating the 3D landscape is frustratingly slow and laborious, no overview map to see the land.  Lots of scrolling in and out.   When you scroll out you cannot be close enough to the terrain to edit, but when you scroll in you cannot see where you are going to build your lines.\n\nThe game is basically a 3D copy of Transport Tycoon.  Taking the worst aspects of Transport Tycoon and combining them with the annoying 3D interface of Railroads!.  The game suffers from billions of pop up windows, just like transport tycoon.  The interface looks unpolished and poorly thought out.  Add to that the difficulty of interfacing with a 3D world and the limitations that full 3D puts on map sizes and you have a dissapointment.   If you are looking to build continent spanning empires, go grab the original Railroad Tycoon series and skip this.  The game lacks any story line and is simply an impersonal generated map, with no specific goals, needs or other driving factors.\n\nOverall it feels unfinished, unpolished.

But IMHO, the core problems from my initial review still exist. And even though gridlocks have been noticable patched, they havent been fixed. They are still there, just less.\n\nGraphics/Sound is all good. Simulation has its problem and illogical parts, which can become problematic at times.\n\n-- original review --\nI would have to say it was worth my money considering how many hours I have spent on it, on the other hand the value of that time was taken down drastically by the problems the game has on a simulation level and with its tools. And considering this game has little to no value for a quick 3h game, but is meant to played for many hours I would have to say it isn't worth it as once you reach a level where it starts to get interesting the nuissances become problems. Graphics/Sound/Music was fine. But the core of the game, its simulation is just bad.\n\nNot to badmouth the game, cuz they could still fix things, but to support my negative review here goes a list of things I have encountered: Laying down roads or rails often results in "collision" without clearly specifying what is colliding leaving the user to guess what to demolish. Using the "Load All" option can actually cause your line to be ignored completely. The amount of traffic that buildings generate can bring the traffic in the city to a grinding halt, so that bus routes become so slow that they arent used, causing probably more cars to spawn. You can only draw rails over roads, but not roads over rails or rails crossing rails. You sometimes can build a ridiculous 45 degree slopes, but most other times a 5 degree slope will give some error that it's too steep. There are also some very unbalanced issues. I've seen situations where building a road on fairly flat land cost more to raise lower ground for road than it was to build a bridge over it. Loading bays can hold equal or less to the trucks you have ( in late game ).  2M to remove a football field with 2 bleachers, but 700k to remove a 14 story building. And more of these weird inbalances. I've seen a (in-game) months worth of cars get priority to cross an intersections, while the busses that were the first in their lane never moved an inch. The UI is really lacking in many ways and there is little feedback to the player. Something as basic as visual feedback on the signal states isn't even in the game. I could probably name a few more.","September 24, 2014","false","194.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Everything that makes a good transport building game fun.   There is no competitive element whatsoever.  No AI and no multiplay compability,  No way to measure yourself against something.  This is a game of survival.  It is impossible to make money at anything besides passenger transport.   It's very difficult to make money running industry in this game.  The cost to maintain your vehicle is outrageous compared to how make it will make on a run. Supply seems to be dictated by how frequent the trains/buses stop at the station.  There seems to be no limit to the loan you can take out ( maybe i just never reached it, but when your 50ish mil in debt it's time to startover )\n\nI think this game is suppose to appeal to people that build scale model train sets.

Had I tried this game on a demo, at least I would've been happy as I would have known what I was getting into before buying the game.\n\nThe UI is hard to get used to. When you put down tracks, quite often instead of going with the terrain, it builds bridges and culverts everywhere. Straight, seemingly flat pieces of land with farmland on them, and it still wants to build a bridge or a culvert. Moving around the interface is very difficult, none of the "windows" have screen movement, so if you move your cursor to the bottom of the screen to scroll down, it only works if there's no windows there - since the non-movable menu icons and the time bar are there, you have to move the mouse down the middle and not the edges of the bottom of the screen to move. If you've opened up another window, say a Depot screen, scrolling down doesn't work if that window is there. Diagonal scrolling is out - if you want to move diagonally, you can't since all four corners have HUD elements that don't have scrolling. Scrolling to the right is even harder - when I scroll the mouse to the edge, the screen doesn't move. Instead, I have to move the mouse so that it's a pixel from the edge of the screen for it to move - assuming there's no window there for line info etc. (for info, yes, I do have Edge Scrolling set to On in options)\n\nThere's also data bugs in the game. For example, I send a carriage around my first bus route, it passes through a couple stops, only after that second stop did it say "You have your first passenger", and it highlights the bus stop - without actually stopping at that bus-stop. I then got a You have delivered your first passenger" but the bus was still moving and didn't stop anywhere between the two notifications. I have a station with 39 passengers. The train has three carriages for 6 passengers each. When they board, I only have 16 passengers on the train (16 of 18 it reports) and passengers now waiting on the station is 22. I'm like, what?!? Where are those numbers coming from? It also seems that, as that train is moving to the next station, the numbers drop. 15 of 18, 14 of 18... what are they doing, jumping from the train at 40 km/h? That's suicide!\n\nYep, I said km/h. Even though there's all British style names in the game, such as Letchworth Garden City, Totnes and Dursley, the game only allows km/h, there's no settings to change it to mph.\n\n","March 1, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

That's pretty much what this game offers, but only at a very shallow level. I'm sad to say it didn't live up to my expectations at all.\n\nAs a train set it is extremely limited in what you can do and requires extensive time to unlock any eras or vehicles at all to play with. There is no competitive element. So, just what is compelling here?\n\nMost of it felt to me very incomplete and broken, with very poor feedback on what systems are doing under the hood and therefore little way to make sense of its failings. Often things just won't work for no reason. It's hard for me to rationalize why this game can't measure up in a fairly dead / abandoned genre, as it seems to have plenty of good ideas and then nothing at all to hold them together. If this were an early access alpha I would call it promising.\n\nInstead I'm surprised that this game came out last year and it still hasn't been patched so that track and road laying were not so cumbersome, limited, and fails so often. I can't think of any problems mentioned in Rock Paper Shotgun's review that have actually been taken care of, and it's been a long time and many patches since so just what is happening here where a game is released with serious, unintentional flaws and just keeps them?\n\nYou'd be better off with Sid Meier's Railroads! or for a single-player transport tycoon experience maybe Cities in Motion 2. This game just feels extremely unfinished and I feel really betrayed that they made me pay 35$ for it. You'd think a 65% user rating would mean something but the rating system has really failed here.

For those of you who are debating about if you want this game or not,read this review,and decide from there. Basically,this games is like a modern day Locomotion or Transport Tycoon,only not as good. Like,at ALL. The game does have redeemable factors,but all the bad things just completely drown them out.\n\nPros:\n\n-Good Music: I have to say,the music is catchy and is very Tycoon game-ish.\n-Decent Graphics: Not the prettiest,but not the most ugly either.\n\nCons:\n\n-No Objectives:In games like Locomotion,you played on many different maps each with a unique objective (transport a certain amount of goods,reach a certain company rating,etc.) In Train Fever,however,there is no goal in sight other than "Don't go bankrupt!" which is the barebone objective of tycoon games.\n\n-No Rival A.I:No competing companies,no rivals trying to make more money than you,nothing. Just you and yourself,which gets old very fast.\n\n-Bad Construction Tools;Something that should be simple and basic is rather clunky and frustrating. Horrible collision detection (I seriously had collision problems with something that was atleast 50 feet from the track),Landscaping controls that use the camera button to take effect,crossing roads and rails is a pain in the butt,and sooooo much more.\n\n-Poor Performance:Despite the fact that my computer is very modern and runs lots of other games perfectly,Train Fever constantly lags and often takes a few seconds just to do basic things like move the camera.\n\nAnd finally,the biggest problem of all...\n\n-Crashes,Crashes,and more Crashes:Oh.My.God. This game crashes more than a drunk driver. Gameplay consists of 10 minute sperts before a crash,which deletes your save data if you didn't save before. If the crashes were few and far between,it could be forgivable. But they're not. The longest I've ever gone without a crash was about 10 minutes,and although I went even longer without a crash,the game's perfomance dropped even more,so it looks as though to prevent crashing,the game needs to run badly. And to run well,the game needs to crash constantly. Pick your poison,I say! And not does the game crash a lot,but 9 times out of 10,it's going to not just crash the game,but the computer entirely. This game has crashed on me 8 times,and 4 or 5 of those were hard crashes. Not only that,but it once crashed so hard,the crash error screen crashed too. How the hell do you do that!?\n\nIf you haven't figured it out by now,I don;t recommend this game at all. It's way too overpriced for what it is,and even though I got it on sale for $13,it was still too expensive.\n\nHere are 3 better ways to spend that $40:\n\n1.Go buy food,clothes,gas,a gift for your sweetheart,anything really.\n\n2.Buy a bunch of other games on Steam. I recommend the Five Nights at Freddy's trilogy,Team Fortress 2,and Gt Legends,just to name a few.\n\n3.If you stil want your tycoon game fix,buy Locomotion or Rollercoaster Tycoon.

Where by "playing" I mostly mean figuring out how it works, WHAT in it works and to find workarounds for things that are supposed to work but do not. This is because no game mechnics are explained anywhere. (Frequently reading and participating in the forums, where players exchange knowledge, is the best bet to figure out this game.) And also this is because the game is full of bugs and design flaws. Still. I would be not mad at all, if this game was Early Access. But it is released and financed via crowdfunding.\n\nI stoppped playing this game because to me it is more frustrating than fun. Maybe this will change. I am visiting the train-fever website weekly, to see if there is a new patch (and release notes). And I hope I will read, that the bugs that upset me so much, got fixed, one day.\n\nBut until then I do not recommend to buy this game. I recommend to hold your money and wait, until the game matured.\n\n----------------------------------------\n2014-09-07 after 20 hours of game time\n----------------------------------------\ni would like to have my money back. seriously. i would wait half a year and observe if all the bugs and design flaws get fixed and the game gets an overhaul so it is more challenging and fun and less painful and frustrating.\n\ni loved transport tycoon back in the early years and today i still play railroad tycoon 3. but train fever at this stage is simply not fun to play. train fever looks nice, in some ways, yes, but there is very little versatility in this game. just 5 cargo types? small maps? very few vehicles? no ai competition? no option to build industries? no financial market options? expensive trains in a train game? the landscape looks the same everywhere? no sandbox mode? (i am not even asking about multiplayer)\n\ni miss the fun of competing the ai opponents, ruining them and finally taking over their companies. i miss the fun of managing 30 different cargo types, i miss the fun of watching a lot of different locomotives with different train cars for each cargo type ploughing through the landscape.\n\nbtw, in train fever you wont have a lot of trains. road vehicles are the main source of income. just on routes with a very high concentration of cargo or passengers, trains are profitable. road transportation is really very dominant. suggesting to rename this game to "road fever" or "transport fever" would not just be a joke.\n\nthe usability is medium at best. managing a large transport network can be painful. i wont bother you with how hard some advanced goals can be to achieve. but a simple example: you can not build a rail crossing when you want to cross a road over a track. this feature simply is not implemented. you just can cross tracks over a road. meaning, to cross a road over a track, you need to bulldoze the track, lay the road, and then cross the track over it. ...\n\nand then there are the bugs. ... disappearing cargo, blocked truck stations, stuck trains, wrong cargo count. ...\n\nalso the game lags even fast computers, the user interface is ugly and uncomfortable, the music is horrible and better turned off, sound effects are poor. though the graphics are detailed, the landscape looks boring greenish and repetitive.\n\nand the gameplay as a whole ...  no goals, no challenges, no missions, no opponents. the only goal is to build the perfect transportation network, grow cities and industries, to increase the need for transportation. ... well to be honest, in this last regard, the game is not very different from other games in this genre.\n\nit is the multitude of frustrating things. that make me not like to play this game for now. it needs a huge amount of work to get out of a development-/testing stage.","September 4, 2014","false","70.5"," 21 of 47 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","21","47","0","5"

Here's major reasons why you'll be disappointed:\n1. Crazy controls. I mean it. You build double track train line and want to place one way signals along the way, how many clicks this action deserve? 3 clicks for each signal! You want to replace your aging truck fleet? Great, you can seen all of them to depot, but then you need to buy them one by one, assign to line and space them evenly, or they will roam in crowd for their lifetime. Thats just couple of examples, user experience is totally appailing.\n2. Supply-demand system, It is unbalanced. You can build your 1M$ line + 500K$ train from the oil wells to refinery only to see that wells only produce 1 unit of oil/year, even if the refinery is connected to towns striving for 'goods' (you see, oil well->refinery->town - thats really long production chain), The only way to assess future production is to check whether the industries send their goods on foot by the roads (on my maps its 1/10 of all industries, others lie dormant with 0 production).\n3.

What came out at the end of the tunnel was undoubtedly a beautiful game but the pace is so, extremely slow and it is very difficult to remain enthusastic and keep playing.  The "intuitive controls" are worse than that of CIM2 and Sim City, I found myself getting very frustrated trying to build a basic road when some road or rail section about a half mile away was preventing me from doing it.  A bug? Perhaps but it happens constantly and becomes a burden very quickly.\n\nI can go on and on but if you are looking for a Railroad Tycoon/Cities in Motion 2 spin-off or similar game then Check out OpenTTD.  It's free.  I see that the developers will be continuing updating Train Fever which is a good sign, I'll copme back and re-review at some point.

Tough luck, that is set in stone and CAN'T be changed in the options.\n\nAnother problem I have noticed is that the audio tends to go wonky and skips during gameplay, this especially evident with the gameplay music if you are opening menu's or the like, and it isn't a lack of performance / FPS, as the game runs nicely elsewhere when scrolling and zooming, but opening and closing menu's triggers it, and may be a symptom of much bigger problems underneath the surface.\n\nIn short, do I recommend you buy this game? Well it is a refreshing breath into the transport genre, but their competitors who only had the problem of being old, with poor 2D or DirectX 6 or DirectX 7 graphics, will  kick this game hard when it comes gameplay.\nOpenTTD is a serious contender to this game, and is also under constant evolution, and while it is hard to beat, the devs better shape up and get their act together.\n\nEDIT: As a quick update to the latest set of updates rolled out at 22nd of May 2015, the issues STILL stand, except now you can hear the music problem even just idling in the main menu.\nSteam guides are still used, and Steam is STILL unreliable with frequent downtimes, and the keybinds still cannot be changed.","December 28, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

It is a very boring game.\n\nDo not believe the minimum specs listed - not even close to accurate.\nGraphics are poor - dull, drab and lacking crispness.\nRailway operations are too simplistic and do not work like a real railway operations. (when I saw steam engines running at speed pumping out black smoke I should have realised then that that the devs probably did not know much about trains)\nMany bugs still to be fixed.\nSignals are invisible except on max zoom level.\nTrack laying is a pain even when it decides to behave correctly.\nThe industry/goods side of things is very weak.\nGame maps tend to be repetitive.  Played one map then you've played them all.\n\nAnd the showstopper - there are too few trains.  One train will usually be enough to service an entire line connecting 5 or 6 towns.  In the 20 or so games I have played the most trains I have had running is 5.  The game becomes one where you watch 1 or 2 trains run back and forward over a featureless landscape, then upgrade them when a new engine becomes available, and then sit there and watch the 2 trains run back and forward over a featureless landscape, ........  It's like a record playing the same song again and again.\n\nThere is no incentive to build long lines as exist in the real world because no-one wants to go anywhere far away.  There is a 20 minute rule where the population won't travel at all if the entire trip is longer than 20 minutes (which equates to the next train stop usually).  This is possibly a result of modelling passengers individually.  Each boid chews up cpu and so the game has been dumbed down to minimise the number of boids but maximise the number of boid trips by making maximum trip length quite short.  End result is that the game just doesn't feel like a real railway.","September 11, 2014","false","375.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","2"

I have over 85 gaming titles, including "other" train sims. Many have incredible graphic emersion and I set them all to the highest resolution available. These games run smooth and with solid framerates. (none of them required me to "tinker" with the graphic card or any aspect of my computer to run at capasity)\n\nSo when I looked at this game I saw that the graphics were not of the same caliber I assumed that running the game would be a breeze for my computer. Wow.. was I wrong.\n\nI loaded my first game (Medium map)  and once it loaded I was beside myself at the lag that was present. I thought.. this cant be right... So I tried to dumb down the graphic settings to see if it helped. No change..\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nI7 3.00 on an X58 motherboard.\n24 gig of ram\nNvidia GTX 580 (2 gig Vram)\nWin 7 pro\n\nEven with this level of system resourses the lag spikes make this game unplayable.\nAnd I don't understand it. I run Skyrim at full settings, X Rebirth at full settings, Crysis 3 at full settings. and all of them are high end graphical miracles that emerse you into new and amazing worlds.  Train Fever although fun looking does not even come close to delivering this experience. Its a map with roads and rails crossing over them. You dont even get a "ride / follow the train" view.\n\nHow can a simplistic looking map game harsh my system so bad?\n\nClearly there is something wrong with the game. And I will NOT tinker with my system to make this game work at the risk of making my computer unable to run the other games.\nWhen someone buys a new game. they should not have to jump hoops to make it work. The developers need to sort it out within the code. To do anything less will only limit your market share. Not everyone knows how to tinker with system settings.\n\nI am very disapointed with Train Fever and I have no choice but to shelve it as an "unplayable game" and move on to another game. I cannot recommend this to anyone and I caution those that are considering buying it.. You WILL be disapointed with the frame rate.","September 10, 2014","false","13.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Inserting stations is quite straight forward but when you try to connect those with tracks, the agony...\nLet me explain little bit more detailed. In principle it is straight forward, you select track and drag it from point A to point B. When you start dragging the line it tries to keep it levelled at all costs, literally. So what I did to keep costs lower, adjust it by the contours. This would even by itself sound tedious, but it's not what made me stop playing.  It was that once I tried to cope with contours the track wouldn't get levelled again. It was raising at steady pace. I couldn't get it to lower at all, raising on the other hand was possibility.\nHave they tried playing this game before publishing or did they just wish for the best?\nThe game has good concept but at it's current state I wouldn't suggest it to anyone. If they fix the bugs I might even get to core part of this game, but now I'm too irritated to try.","March 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","3"

This game has (or rather had) so much potential. Just a remake of Transport Tycoon would have  been enough for most fans. But its just a bad game. Here it goes:\n\n- lackluster interface that looks like something you can program in VisualBasic with smallish numbers and UI elements\n- no AI\n- weird size ratios between stations and town buildings. Some bus stations are huge compared to the town size\n- very little economic gameplay, don't expect RR2 levels of management here (on par with TTD though)\n- no area indicator for stations (really not funny if you want to build bus/ tram lines)\n- you can't start later than 1850 until you get the achievements. You start out with a horse buggy. Its called TRAIN Fever. TRAINS!!\n- very unintuitive cargo system, industry buildings are relly small sizewise compared to trains and stations, looks just weird.\n\nHere comes the most annoying aspect: Building tracks:\n\nBuilding tracks is similar to RR2 but it does not work out. There are constantly farms. buildings or really small roads in the way. Sometimes it says not enough space. The tool permanently builds cuts or embankments. The whole track looks juist ugly with those. Worst of all you have to build your track in small segments. And don't get me started on double tracks.\n\nThe problem ist that sometimes you realize that the planned route will not work out (gradients are not well shown on the map) and you need to plan an alternative route. Well, your money is gone...you CAN NOT PLAN your route. How could they not add a route planner for this game. I wasted so much money trying to build track (and buying this game).\n\nStick with OpenTTD. It looks dated but the mechanics are solid.\n\n\n---\nHave a look at my channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/phoppe1980","December 28, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","2"

I just write down my impressions , after playing that game a long time. Maybe it helps some ppl, who think about to buy that game.\nYeah and i am not a native english speaker. So dont care about my typographical errors and others ;-)\n\nI use a new i7 CPU, 12gig RAM  and the new Gtx970 (4gig) under win7 ultimate 64bit. THE GAMES RUNS SLOW and i get under 20 FPS sometimes. I run FPS shooter with incredible grapik under ULTRA settings and full HD with 60FP+-. THAT MEANS:\nThat game is really, really bad programmed!\n\nI played that game now for so many times. I wonder how addicted that thing made me. But i guess, its the luck for the programmer, that there are not alot other transportation games on the market like this in "transport tycoon style", so the gamer HAVE to choose this one. Otherwhise, it would not be worth to be played at all.\n\nFACTS:\n\nThere are so many more bugs and issues. Clipping errors is one word. Trains cruise through private cars like ghosts, terraine modelling is aweful, looks like i would play a game from the 90's. We would need more resources, not only iron, oil, and some of the others. What about fruits and plantages? Or fish industry on the waters? Seems like the programmers had to hurry. And then the fitting cars for that resources? I have to use about 20 mods and dont have enough resources though...\n\nIT IS FACT, that this game has really problems with that game code, which couses unstability and bad performance (Game use 1 CPU core only, and this with bad code- feel free to google that), and you will know that problems by yourself, if you ever played that game more than a few hours.\nOne big problem is, that most of this issues are "hardcoded", not easy to repair without coding the whole code new. :-(\n\nThere are no tools at all in this game, which are already standard since years, like "underground few", when trying to build tunnels. Most of the time you get "collision" warnings while building something in that game world, but it is not shown where, and why. So it gets to a really frustrating work to connect two train stations or even simply roads!\n\nThere are no options to build up real, working routing chains, especially passengers... Passengers dont use smart routing chains like they do in "Cities in motion" for example. Try to connect 3 buss routes togehter, it wont work well. They enter one transportation route and go to one other, or to their direct goal. Even they would be faster than walking, they dont use more lines. Tried this out may, many hours.\n\nWhen upgrading a road, most of the times i get a error messages on road crossings. So i have to crush the whole part and make a new one. I understand that- within cities, because of the insufficient place to make that road bigger, but outside, middle of nowhere, nothing in the way? Why cant i plant roads over train tracks? I have to crush that tracks, build a road and then build that track again... huh?\nAnd its nearly inpossible to construct a nice bridge within a city, it need so much space - and you'll get lots of error messages again.\n\nToday i tried to electrify an elder train track part. I needed 1/2 hour to find that small track part (about 1 milimeter) which was not clicked to get elecrityed, and so i got "no way found" messages in a row from my first electric train...\nA annoying klicking orgy, nothing in common with fun imho...\n\nThere are NO options at all, to interact with cities. You cant pay for commercial to raise the stream of passengers, and so on. Why cant i build something like "attractions" or something else like this to get more tourists for my train routes! Oh, i forgot - THERE ARE NO TOURISTS! I know, this is a transportation game, not a city builder. But man, we have seen it could be done better in other games.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf this game would be a game in beta state, which will be releases in the next 1-2 years, that game would wake my hopes. But like this, i have all the time the bad feeling, all the time the anger about this many mistakes in that game, that i really want play this but... I am faced all the time by irregularities, while playing that game. But i want fun, not getting angry all the time. There is a great potential, but unfortunately its not used at all. Its a half-hearted thing, but some german magazine testers gave so many good reviews about this game - but what for? Because its a small budged game? Because there are not many others of that kind of games? Maybe, i dont know at all. So its to say: its not THE transportation game, not even close to that. Maybe there will come some patches, that could help. Now at the moment i can't recommend that game.\n\n\n\nRegards,\nTom","September 21, 2014","false","121.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I've been looking forward to Train Fever since I first heard about it. Unfortunately, it has proved to be probably my most disappointing game purchase this year.\n\nI think my big issue with Train Fever is that it is just not quantitatively fun. It feels like you are wrestling with the track editor in order to build anything. The challenge isn't identifying where to lay track in order to maximize a profit, but simply in building the infrastructure. A prospect like building a junction between two pairs of lines is almost nightmarish in complexity and difficulty to execute.\n\nI've concluded that the developers are huge fans of trains, to the expense of actual gameplay. Things like the actual trains are rendered impressively well, with little things like the coupling rods on the wheels working perfectly. Unfortunately, trains won't route to spread load between multiple lines on a station. You can't lay road across railway lines - it has to be the other way around. You can't do something as simple as have an intersection between two lines without them connecting.\n\nThe game also lacks anything in the way of charm. The music is not particularly good, and gets repetitive very quickly. The cities and industries feel very lifeless. I compare it to the (admittedly flawed) Railroad Tycoon 4 which used music and graphics to evoke the nostalgia of steam era trains.\n\nCould it still become a good game? Possibly, but I doubt it. It feels like it should be in early access, and it feels unfinished. It feels like effort was put into the game, but that gameplay is secondary to just making cool looking trains.\n\nShould it be at the $30 price point? Not at this stage.","September 19, 2014","false","14.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

As others have noted, it's trying to jam too much into one game so it feels very half-butted rather than doing one or two things whole-butted. The panning and scrolling are jerky and feel very "shareware" like. The graphics are pretty rudimentary. For example, when creating a tunnel you get an angled mess that looks like a bottomless quick sand pit rather than a nice entrance and exit to the tunnel. Even the main menu looks like a major accident when you change to higher resolutions. Errors are even funnier! You'll get errors like "Not enough space" when you're trying to connect a road to a station...in the middle of a pasture! Or "Collision! Terrain alignment collision. Not enough space" What the heck does THAT mean?\n\nWhen you're building a track, to scroll the landscape you have to continue holding down the left mouse button to lay track while at the same time holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse in the opposite direction to scroll the screen. Really? Did anyone teach these developers how to write software? When laying track it automatically curves when you want to go straight...and then you get another error messages that have more meaning in a C++ compiler than in a train simulation game. It seems like the designers got into a room and decided on the following tenets:\n\n1. Make the help as useless as possible.\n2. Make the error messages even more useless than the help.\n3. Make the controls for the UI as useless as the error messages.\n4. Make the graphics look as close as possible to Pac Man.\n5. Make the game extremely unintuitive to chase potential customers away so that we can go bankrupt.\n6. Charge a lot of money so we came make as much as possible before declaring baankruptcy.\n\nThis wasn't worth the money it cost me, and I would HIGHLY STRESS that if you're thinking about buying this game, invest in a tree stump instead...it'll provide less aggrevation and more entertainment that this game.","April 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","1"

Just why?\n\nI have been waiting for this game a long time, well only 2 month but if you like this kind of game every day waiting for it is painfull. Finally the release day arrived i instantly added this game to my library, without seen any reviews and so on...\n\n\nNow after 2 Hours i am dissapointet. Let me explain.\nThe menue is horrible.\nTry to find a manual, i didnt found anything.\nAnnoying Sound when a new vehicle is availible.\nPerformance, yeah i know you proberbly have the uber l33t h33x0r system with 5GHz and double Octacore CPU and so on. No thats not the point. I have watched the frame drops when opening any information window.\nYou start at 1850 and you are not able to chose any different starting date until you have reached that date. Means You have to start 1850 and then play until 1900 bevore you can chose that date as starting age. This is stupid, simply press fast forward after your loan is paid and wait for that date....\nHow to rorate things? I dont know since there is no manual found yet.\nWant a loan from the Bank? Ok, have fun clicking all the time there is no Shift/Alt/ctrl hotkey to increase the loan by10x or so. Takes some time ....\nDid i mention the graphic glitches?\nHotkey confoguration? Nope.\nAdvanced map settings? Nope.\nAdvanced sifficulty settings? NOPE\nBus line creation is buggy, if there are to many crossroads near your bus stop. Start praying.\n\n\nJust 3 difficulty settings, which no one explains.\n\n\n\nWell, i think most of you guys dont like what i wrote, you simply wont agree, thats okay. But  you should consider the oposite side of your thoughts... If you do not state the bad things that could be fixed(Its not the gameplay itself i complain about!) No one will ever change it.\n\nAnd for those wo think, they made a good job, they are new in this industry, etc... Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? Only because you like this genre and there hasnt been a release of this genre since ages, you want me to close my eyes for on the bad things?\n\n\nIts a game like OpenTTD, everything reminds me on OpenTTD. Exept the graphics they are new. If you ask me, the game is worth the Price if the comany doesnt stop the developement of the game. We will see.\n\n","September 4, 2014","false","11.9"," 35 of 79 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","35","79","0","5"

I then went to town and bought the only copy I had remember seeing for sale for a full £30, but it was £30 well spent as it is probably the game I have played the most over the years.\n\nTrain Fever is a blatant rip-off of the concepts of TT, but is missing quite a few features that were in the original TT, so might be considered Transport Tycoon Lite with better graphics. It is however also missing gameplay aspects which means this game is not very enjoyable. While TT was quite basic I think Train Fever needs a few more features (and perhaps a few unique ones not copied from TT!) to make it less basic.\n\nThe aim of TT was not really about making money, as once you got past a certain point you would be earning enough to do mostly anything, and spend time refining and increase train lines on routes needing more demand and the upgrade them to Monorail and then Maglev and Subsidies at the start which paid more and would help you get the money rolling in.\n\nSubsidies are not included in Train Fever and it only seems to have road vehicles and trains, where TT also had ships and aircraft although this game also does not have any water, so ships will not be possible. Expect to just create a few train lines and then hit high speed and wait until they start making money to be able to create more.\n\nOther things missing from this game is competition where TT had computer opponents, even though their intelligence was not always great. Train Fever seems a bit empty and lonely as you are the only transport company in the game.\n\nThe graphics are nice but the playability just ain't there for me. The railines I have created have all been curvy to avoid mountains and speed restrictions of tighter curves and bending\curving the track 90 degrees seems to be too big\long. Perhaps I am not doing something right but it does not seem to be possible to raise or lower track to be the same level as the terrain, where terrain will be raised on tracks or cut through's will be created through terrain leaving the track level. When it comes to road vehicles I created a bus route with one horse carriage though a busy town but it just lost money and did not make anything - perhaps the early road vehicles just cant and only later in the game with more demand and bigger vehicles. The houses also look incredibly modern for the 1800's. The Music is partcularly good which many tracks having a guitar feel of "The Shadows".\n\nAs a test, I also tried playing the game with an erection, but this made the game even less enjoyable.\n\nI don't think in its current form this game is worth £20. Its more like a £10 game at present.","September 5, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

The user interface is painful.  I read others talking of this but I thought I would give it a try as I might be more willing to overlook this for the gaming experience - it is not intuitive at all and really hurts the initial desire to even want to start playing the ‘game’  HOPEFULLY – this is ‘sort of’ an Alpha Release and the developer will work on improving the UI as well as a reason to play… Sandbox mode is fine but for how long.  In short - hold off buying this for right now for one of two things - price drops a lot OR major improvements to UI & game play.  I'll update here is I see any - "if I don't loose interest in the wait"\n\nNew Day - trying to play to get my $$$ worth. Nope not happening.  To painful to play right now.

Primarily because the user "interface" is really really poorly designed, despite all the nice looking screenshots and videos, this game is almost unplayable, it is more of a hassle fighting with the interface than it should / needs to be.\n\nThis game's user interface is on the level of Sim Tower - i.e. non-existent, boring font and text, surrounded by boxes facts and numbers using standard Arial font. Certainly not acceptable in today's standards.\n\nDon't be fooled by the nice screenshots of the game running. You'll run the other way when you actually see how bad the interface is.\n\nThere are many other reasons not to recommend this game.\n\n- Performance issue particularly when moving around the map. I have a AMD 290X, one of the top end graphics card money can buy at the moment and it stutters moving around a medium map on medium graphic settings.\n\n- Gameplay bugs, really basic things like coaches for some reason goes to the 2nd stop in a line instead of starting from the 1st once you start a new line. How can bugs like this still be in the game after how ever many patches it has since release?\n\n- Lack of WASD/Arrow key/edge of map movement consistency - it seems like sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Does it even have key bindings? Who knows.\n\nIt simply isn't even worth the $20 sale price given the amount of time I spent in it before I've given up in frustration. Given that this game is considered "complete", has been released for some time and not an early access / alpha stage game, people should not put their hopes up that the developers will make this into a polished game with their gratis patching.\n\nIf the developers proof me wrong, I'll gladly update and change this review. But at this moment in time, in my opinion it is a $5 game for effort, which is a big shame as it has so much potential. Will the developers unlock it, well if they were planning to I would've thought they should've released this as an Early Access.\n\nYou probably don't want to pay to find out. I'd rather pay $120 for the Japanese version of A-Train 3.0 than any money towards some incomplete garbage. Even Cities in Motion 2, a game that is considered "rough around the edges" but complete, is hundrds of miles better than this "game".\n","November 20, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyb4ss/recommended/304730/","funkyb4ss","funkyb4ss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyb4ss/","470 products in account","This game could be fun. Unfortunately it comes with no documentation. There is a small palette onscreen when you start a game that briefly outlines how to do the first two stops of a line. That is all.\n\nWhen you combine that with the picky way the game wants you build road and track systems, you will find yourself struggling to connect lines and stations, because the game can't manage its own topography. It simply has no tolerence for any variation in terrain, curvature or elevation. Straight lines are a breeze- but connecting all those lines is a chore.\n\nDon't even try complex interchanges on railoads until you've experimented for a while- for example, as I understand it you cannot at time of writing build a road across existing railroad tracks, at all. You can only build tracks over roads- otherwise you will have to bulldoze the track, connect your road and rebuild the railroad again. And every time you tear down a section of road or track, you'll also have to use the leveling tool as well, because you won't be able to build anything other than what was already there until you flatten the terrain again. Because of this, I don't even bother with anything other than "flat" terrain maps, as anything else is just asking for extra fiddling around.\n\nTo add insult to injury, as you pixel-hunt for the few places you can actually build on or join sections, the game likes to makes sound effects. So as you patiently wiggle the cursor around, hoping for that little green check mark, you've got a  little jackhammer noise rattling away everytime you move your cursor. rattle rattle rattle.\n\nYou can get the hang of it after a while, but even then you'll be fiddling around. I just quit the game after I built a whole industrial complex of road-train cargo lines supporting the local indsutry - the wagons simply will not find a path. I have three stops and a depot, and not a single stop works with the pathfinding. The road itself is fine from what I can see. Gaaah.. I just couldn't be bothered any more. Every project involves massive setbacks as you discover you can't connect something with something else, becase the game gives you no guidance and no hint as to how much space the segments need. It's pure guesswork.\n\nOnce you manage to get everything working, it's fun to watch the trains. But there isn't a lot of depth here. You'll build train stations and depots and stops and plan lines until you're bored, and then one day you'll do it again. or not. You can't control scheduling, you can't set fares. One thing I find particularly annoying is that if you have a new line and buy new vehicles for it, you can't just buy a fleet and set them on their route. If you do that the game will send every vehicle on the new line all at once. It doesn't make sense.\n\nThere are a few other issues as well. Performance could be much better (zooming causes heavy stuttering), the interface is unfinished (palette locations aren't saved, so every time you open a game, you will have to re-open and reposition every palette again. THis happens with new games and saves), I've had several issues with road vehicle pathfinding at cargo stations- they can't tolerate more than two vehicles at a time it seems). Other minor quibbles but those are the main issues.\n\nIt's disappointing. Train Fever could be much better- it might even already be - but I can't tell, because as I said, the game has no documentation. No links in the forum, no wiki, not even basic controls are explained. The game feels like a promising early access title, not a full release. It's not finished. Don't buy it until it is.","December 5, 2014","false","20.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Maybe I was expecting too much!  I prepurchased this after reading the early access reviews (though i was unable to gain early access! really must follow kickstarter more often).  And watching the teaser videos.  It looked so good! like Railroad Tycoon but, better.\n\nSorry, but it is not.  It is not even close to as enjoyable as RT3 is, it is, depressing.\n\nSo here is a run down of what I worked on in the game.  Started with a small map, medium terrain and easy.  (as advised)\n\nI followed the tutorial to make a bus route in the larger town on the map.   Started making revenue.   Went off and watched 5 episodes of Breaking Bad as my wife wanted to revist the show.  Went to bed.   Woke next morning made 10 million!!!! Game finshed then.   Pretty much.\n\nThought about and started to make a transport route to take  in some of that tasty commerce travellng (by foot) along the roads.  Can't build a road on a track that is already there,  huh,  Ok, building one alongsides is pointless and incredibly hard.  Flood the road with trucks after several infuriating attempts to set up a distribution point.   30 trucks.  6 episodes of Breaking bad return to more money!  ok now the game is finished?  Nope I want to do what is plastered all over the front.  Build the best rail network the world has ever seen!  Nope.\n\nInfuriatingly unintuitive railtrack laying system that seems to have a default route that will burn through your millions as it carves its way over under and through the landscape with little or no ability of the player to work around obsticles.  Crossing rivers? yeah, maybe if the game allows it at that point,  have a selecton of bridges to choose from, only allowed to select the one the game lets you select.\n\nOh, and when you have built this track and laid out the right stations you have to spend a fortune maintaining the track and trains and the roods vehicles that deteriate over time sucking more of your hard earned money.\n\nSo I restart.  I have the best bus/tram route the world has ever seen!  I make Buckets of money every year!  I have no debt! I have no railway or commerce trucks.\n\nI am so happy i unistalled the game.  Maybe after a year the game will have been worked on and finished, because it certainly isn't at this finished at this point.  Or, maybe the developers will bring out Train Feaver 2 for another $35 and it will have fixed all that was wrong in the first game.\n\nI wanted to be happy with it, I really did.","September 15, 2014","false","32.3"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

Graphics are great, but that's all. With that much limited options, one cannot even think of comparing this game to openTTD, not even the orignal TTD.\n\nI haven't played much since the game is constantly crashing. At this point, I am very disappointed - I hope the devs are planning to improve the game.\n\nEDIT: A patch (the third probably) made the game playable for me. However, it just deepened my disappointment: when you finally grasp (or read somewhere on the net) how the cargo is actually moved around, it is a pain to construct anything more complicated. The construction tool is hard to use but you can manage to build something (although no crossings are allowed...) All the fun stops when you get something like "I can't find a way to my stop" from a train that was built in a depot just next to the line and has direct access to it. Pathfinding is a chapter for itslelf... There are still some other bugs like the trucks on distincts lines blocking each other at stations, which renders these stations useless for multiple lines. And more and more... so the feeling that the devs should charge for a full release is still around...:-(\n\nEDIT: build 6219. The devs are definitely working on the game - the performance is now much better. The UI is also somewhat improved, but there are still glitches like windows constantly opening out of view. Second sad thing is that your trucks can still get easily blocked: 4 lines at connected to a 4 platform large truck station often end up with 2 lines using the same platform (not a hard algorithm to get that right, hm?). You can try to remove stations so the linkink resets...which might help you until next change. But you usually get stuck again as the old linking is stil used for incoming trucks...\n\nOn the other hand, some updates are cool, like the DLC and mods! Thumbs up for that. I hope I can change my review to recommend next time.","September 4, 2014","false","37.1"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","10","28","0","0"

I like graphics and sounds, it is good enough for this type of game. I was also surprised by a music, but I was kind of anoying after 90 minutes of playing.\nBuilding of tracks is awesome and annoying together. I love a possibility of a free building as it seems like a real track, but it is hard to guess which track is buildable, so it is needed to build & destroy back and forth to continue construction of the track from one city to another. A planing mode would be a nice feature. I wasn't also able to find any shortcuts for building, but may be I was just not looking enough.\nI am probably too much used to build complex traffic light chains in OTTD, but a traffic control in this game is a huge step back.\n\nThe game also crashed 3 times while I played it for not even 2 hrs and there is no option to reload a recent state, so I give up\n\nOne day it might be a good game, which is fun to play, but now I regret at spending 23EUR.

The graphics are mediocre, at best.  Sure, you can zoom in and see people walking around, but you can't do anything productive with a view like that.\n\nThe train's AI is completely below standard.  For instance: Picking up oil with one train and dropping it off at a refinery makes "goods" which is the generic demand for towns.  If you use a different locomotive to pick up goods to drop off at a town, then they jam up at the refinery and sit there waiting for eachother to get out of the way.  Signals are useless as they only allow trains to travel in one direction, not wait for a train to move out of the way.\n\nWood is the only way to make a decent amount of cash and that's only because "wood" and "goods" can utilize the same cars.  There isn't a way to change the consist of any other trains so you need 3 oil cars and 3 goods cars on the same locomotive and 1/2 the train is empty during it's route.\n\nIn short, the mechanics are garbage compared to an OLD game like RRT2 or even Railroads! which was fun, but wasn't as indepth as RRT2.\n\nAs far as the "business" part of the game, it's not even close to Simcity 2013.  The "town" doesn't develop if you pump "goods" to it.  A few buildings pop up, but then they stop after a short while.  I'm assuming it's because the goods aren't getting to the "low value" areas of the town but none of my "cargo" (non-rail) stations are productive as far as money goes.  Yes, they work, but they don't make money because the distance is too far.  In order to rectify this, you can lay rails, but then you're back to square-one with the "not using the same train to transport goods of different types" nonsense.\n\nI don't care about graphics when it comes to business simulations (to a point).  I want complexity yet it needs to be intuitive.  This game has neither.  If you can't change consists at a station, then it's impossible to use the same locomotive transport different types of commodities.  If you must have multiple trains on a single rail, then the programmers need to figure out how to make one train wait for another BEFORE they're 2 feet away from eachother.\n\nIn real life, companies have yards and spurs....not enough room in this game to do this so "reality" is NOT an excuse for this.\n\nThis is the first game that I would like a refund for.","October 20, 2014","false","11.5"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

I've played several versions of Railroad Tycoon, along with SimCity and other transportation and urban simulations, and while this one is pretty and has some enticing features, the overall game play is frustrating.\n\nSome positives: It is nice being able to manage transportation within cities and between them. The ability to use buses and trams and not just trains is fun. Detailed reports of how each line and vehicle is doing are nice. The visuals are good.\n\nSome negatives: Overall game play is just plain frustrating. In a game like this, the main experience is in setting up routes and connecting things. This game basically ruins this experience.\n\nIt's not so bad when setting up bus lines, since you are using existing roads, but it totally fails when you start laying railroads. It is almost impossible to get a railroad to cross a road. This appears to be related to grade differences, because typically the tracks are running in a cut or embankment that is above or below the road grade. Why can't the AI just automatically regrade the road so that the two can cross, and add to the railroad cost accordingly. The last thing I want to do is have to fiddle with individually grading road crossings, especially since it is expensive and time consuming and may fail, since even after I'm done, I won't be able to know if the tracks can go there anyway.\n\nIndustries are a major pain. You are supposed to build a depot next to the industry, and it may or may not begin to fill with some of the goods that otherwise magically travel down the road by other means. After building expensive depots at two industries that should feed into each other and the tracks to connect them, it typcially happens that you watch the goods totally ignore your nice transportation system and continue marching down the road without your assistance. Maybe there is a reason for this--some parameter that needs to be set, some limit on the placement of the depot. But if there is, it is a complete mystery, since there is no documentation that would help you figure it out.\n\nSpeaking of documentation, this game really lacks it. There is a very basic tutorial at the start, but nothing for the more advanced things you typically would like to try.\n\nThe game largely feels unfinished and untested, and not worth the rather high price that would be more appropriate for a game that totally works.\n\nI love transportation sims, and I laid down a fairly large chunk of cash to buy this. But I'm not playing it. Life is frustrating enough without having a game make it worse.\n\n","October 20, 2014","false","16.7"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

For example, you have to build truck depots near industries. One of the main advantages of trucks in real life is that they don't require depots or yards - trucks just go from industry dock to industry dock.\n- There is no good way to visualize the cargo economy. In railroad tycoon, you could switch to a cargo view, which would show you where a good was produced and demanded. In this game, you just have to hunt around until you happen upon two industries that will create a supply chain.\n- Optimization is abysmal or non-existent.

While people often say that such and such game don’t hold your hand, I never felt it truer than in Train Fever. Although prepared, even before purchase, I still had to look up quite a lot of information elsewhere, but this is fun to me, understanding the inner workings and mechanics at play. Sadly, even now it seems to me that some mechanics are still not understood, or at least not fully, making it rather difficult to reach an optimal play style.\n\nBut the flaws become even more apparent on a higher difficulty level. While the game is perhaps too easy on lower settings, on hard mode the lower profit margins and the limitations of the construction tool require a near perfect play style. It is just plain unfair: cargo is profitable, but not passenger transport. You would think that a vehicle full of people would make a profit, no matter what, and I’m not talking just about trains here, where you could argue that you need more wagons to transport more people and thus improve the profit margins (which doesn’t work by the way: there is a limit to how much a locomotive can pull, and that’s even disregarding the artificial transportation time limit of twenty minutes the game forces upon you). It might have something to do with the travel distance, which gives a bonus to the income of each line, but since it is rather difficult to measure distances (only travel time), it’s hard to judge what line will or will not turn up a profit without testing first, which is not an option with the limited resources of a higher difficulty level. And even then, it doesn’t explain why cargo is always profitable, regardless of travel time or distance.\n\nStill, you need both cargo and passenger to improve your cities (and even about that I’m not sure since nothing is explained and there doesn’t seem to be a consensus on the forums about it. Some say its cargo, other passengers, others still argue it is both. I’ve heard it say that’s it’s actually the line usage percentage that is used in city growth but from my experience that wasn’t the case, with cities with lower index actually growing while interconnected ones didn’t budge at all, even over longer periods of time). It would thus seem that people and goods are a must to make a profit later on: as you progress in the game, the running costs of vehicles rise, which means that more passengers or goods are required to make a profit. It is thus my belief that you can screw yourself completely over in this game if you take too slow a start, and don’t develop the cities rapidly.\nIt feels completely unbalanced, with the effect of the player feeling rather limited or the sensation that it comes down to luck. It’s hard to get involved when your impact on the game world feels so loose sometimes.\n\nWhat actually makes the whole ordeal truly worse is the interface. Replacing vehicle is horribly unintuitive and slow, with the game opening dozens of tabs at a time, grinding the game (already in need of performance optimisation) to a halt, regardless of the characteristics of your computer.\nThe construction tool isn’t much better. The way double lanes work isn’t intuitive at all, but it is manageable. Problems arise when trying to get double tracks crossed by other double tracks and so forth, although the difficulty might come from the fidgetiness of the construction tools. It’s not completely broken, and that’s what makes it so aggravating to me. If it was completely broken, I would just stop playing, but since there is always a way to do what I wanted, with a lot of work and patience, I tried.\n\nOn a final side note, it should be said that the music is fantastic, I did truly enjoy it. Weirdly enough, it somehow felt like it made perfect sense in this game.\n\nStill, the value of the game is to hold ones attention for long hours without pause. There is always something to do, always something to improve, to update, new routes to plan, etc. That, to me, is fun, and truly addicting. It’s one of those management games where time just flies by, something that I haven’t experience since my time with the Anno series. It’s just a shame it had to come with so many faults. I grew tired of having to put up with them and just stopped playing after that, feeling disappointed.","October 25, 2014","false","99.2"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

Not because of difficulty, but because of game mechanics and functionality. My first issue is that when I switch to 1920x1080 I have an issue where my mouse won't be able to move into 1/3 of the screen anymore. My biggest issue with this is that the settings option is on the 1/3 of the screen that I can not use and after uninstalling and reinstalling the game I am still experiencing the issue. The second issue that I am having is that the track placement is very clunky. I will try to lay down some track between two stations and it will usually tell me that there is a terrain issue. Or I will try to place some track and the price of the track will jump dramatically because it is going to automatically adjust some terrain or build a bridge. So I often find myself spending a lot of time placing track inch by inch to make sure that the game will not overcharge me and bankrupt me. The third major issue I am having is that I cannot seem to get some road objects to make a propper line and thus I can't use one of the expensive stations I just put down and have to leave it there or bulldoze it for a price.

Also,\n\n- may run, may not run, how up to date your rig is does not influence this as it is the code of the game that makes it unstable\n- even if the graphic is shiny, the landscape looks a bit dead and empty\n- trainstation not upgradable\n- no real tutorial, only 2 texts regarding line creation, lots of things not mentioned (signals, passanger capacity, concept of how long passangers are willing to wait for a train etc)\n- no option to but 2 lane tracks (you have to put 2 1 lane tracks next to each other)\n\n+ shiny graphics\n\nAll in all, unstable alpha build with serious performance issues - but the graphic is shiny!\n\nGoing to play some RTD2 now ...","September 5, 2014","false","10.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

It has several issues besides the known problems that with some system configurations  the game often crashes or is completely unplayable. Following the issues I came across and that I feel need to be adressed soon.\n\nFirst off the track laying. One of the most important parts of a game like this is the track laying. However it often is just not working properly. For example on a pefectly flat peace of land the game desides that the track after you crossed a street has to go up and starts building a ramp for no reason. This happens often and leads to the player fiddling around to correct the issue.\n\nAnother issue is the performance. I do have a good middle class PC where games like X-Rebirth, Guild Wars 2 and Sim City 5 can be perfectly played on almost maximum settings. But with this game even on a small map with medium settings the game often starts to stutter and the mouse lags like hell. This might not sound like a big deal but in fact it is because everyone who does not have an absolute high end gaming rig will not be able to enjoy maps bigger than ones who can accomodate at maximum 4 to 6 bigger towns!\n\nJust not to my taste is that you have to start out at a time where horse carriages are the only street cars available. I want to be able to set the start date from the beginning on by myself and as I please. As of now you have to achieve certain goals to open up the options to start at another date.\n\nIf they fix these issues the game might become enjoyable.","September 6, 2014","false","94.2"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

I have an idea how to make money now and I can get my emperium off the ground.\n\nHowever, understanding the basic concept now shows that the game is rather dull and empty. After a few bus lines and a single train line(which makes some good money, by the way) I have found that it is mostly waiting to get enough dough to continue on. Outside of buying a few vehicles and laying out the lines, there is nothing to do in between.\n\nOh, and removing a depot renders your vehicles to that depot useless, you can't send them back anymore or send them back to your depot because it can't find one, even though I already had build one on almost the exact same place, on the exact same road.\n\nThe UI is vague, the mouse moves like crap for some reason and the FPS isn't too good either.

No manual so just other players input. There are so many things you can't do, like put crossover tracks on a bridge, signals on a bridge, can't supply industry from more than one resource.....the list is endless. And you only discover this by trial and error and bulldozing or repeated reloading.\nIMHO procedures and routines have been botched to make things try and work. When building a railway and you have everything ready to go, click set line.....and the train has "no path" even though the coloured "path" is lit. The problem is that you have the game paused. This is such lazy programming that is unexcusable. A simple "Paused" would be more appropriate, but you end up checking the line for faults for 15-20mins anyway.\nDepending how many vehicles you have on a line will determine your frequency. You may have a frequency of 3mins, but according to the timeline, they take 5 months to get there!  Also, two trains on the same track with the same number of passengers and yet they get different income!\nWith one train carrying upto 64 passengers why do so many disappear? Poor programming again!\nThe game is only half finished judging by all the updates that are being implemented and due.\nMy i5 4570 is o/c to 4.2Ghz and my HD 7850 is o/c 20% and on a large map with large cities and everything turned low, I get 8fps.

I managed to place a couple bus stations and spent the next 15-20 minutes figuring out how the hell I am supposed to buy a vehicle. Once I finally figured that out, I tried placing a Railroad and let me tell ya, it is very hard and very expensive to place track. I still haven't even gotten as far as buying a train because I cannot get the track layed out.\n\nI am very frustrated mainly because the tutorial is so basic that you are struggling to figure out how the hell your supposed to lay your roads and track and even transport things, let alone make money doing it.\n\nI am only 41 minutes into gameplay and I already regret spending an outrageous $35.

I don't even understand how Total Biscuit was able to take more than 10 minutes of it. (In fact he even excused the lacking options-screen, so he probably has a stake in this title, I guess.)\n\nBasicaly what we have here is a transport-tycoon offering that misses the mark on everything it touches.\n-Management is obtuse, confusing and totally left to the player to figure out.\n-It's called trainfever, but trains will bankrupt you.\n-Randomly generated map that actually blocks you from doing what you want.\n-Incredibly slow. So damn slow... So slooow... (Kill me now.)\n-Trucks and buses are where it's at. Ignore trams and trains or go bankrupt.\n-Most poorly optimized game of this decade. It must be a new standard for developers, I think.\n-Simulation depth is threadbare, uninteresting and not at all offering an incentive to play.\n-Industry can be ignored.\n-Trams and train can be ignored.\n-Developing cities can be ignored.\n-Upgrading roads can be ignored.\n-Modernizing your fleet is agonizing punishment.\n-Music is worse than elevator muzak.\n\nI wish this developer saved himself and us the trouble. I think that this developer hates gamers and especially those gamers that like transport-tycoon style games. I have no other handle on Train Fever to explain it's sorry existence. There can be no other explanation. This developer actively hates you and tries to have you commit suicide while you slowly come to realise, as you play Train Fever, that you're a pathetic slug who shouldn't be alive.\n\nProve him wrong!

The idea was great, but that's it it WAS great but the way the devs brought it to the computer is ...let's say below average.\n\nEdit 05.09.2014\nThe mechanic of not upgradinga trainstation is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. all the time you get collision error or smt and you cannot build it at the same spot again, waht dev is so stupid to to such things, or are the devs to stupid to programm such stuff? i just had a game where i was still in the early years and wanted to have 2 tracks at a station buuut after deleting the first one and wanting to put the same station just with 2 tracks at the same sport the game says uhh you cannot smt is in the way....wtf ? your kidding me...now no money left and alt + f4 this game is done for me. delte and be sad the money is gone :(\n\nEdit:\nI gave it up. The massive stuttering is the worst. Every time you try to build Bus stops or smt else the fps drop like mad from 60 to 10 this is clearly a game issue. Nothing to do with my specs and so on, cause when i don't touch anything just watch the game fps are between 30 to 60 (depends on the angle i watch the landscape) but when i try to do smt with the game tools ( building and stuff) fps go down.

Adequate management in various forms of transport, from over the road to railroad. Trains do some pretty stupid things once in a while, like sit face-to-face at a signal for no apparent reason. There is no warning for when trains have stopped, or are becoming excessively late for their routes. The game has no intermittent signals like in real life. This allows trains to follow closer than switches as long as they are Goin the same direction. Need excessive amounts of double iron to handle some train traffic in the case to track overload. A few updates, and addition of a few features that are used on railroads in real life would make game a lot more enjoyable. Still very fun, definitely recommend.","January 2","true","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
