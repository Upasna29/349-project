After almost a YEAR with absolutely no support (including ignoring GAME-BREAKING bugs that any COMPETENT developer would fix in DAYS at most), they finally release the long-overdue draft mode.... together with an announcement that they wouldn't be developing any more content for the game, so it's basically dead (oh, but of course they're leaving the servers up so suckers can still buy cards with real money, because THAT doesn't take any effort). Hey, Blue Byte? YOU NEVER DEVELOPED ANY CONTENT FOR THE GAME AT ALL! Oh and just to add insult to injury, this last patch broke the blasted game, introducing more game-breaking bugs and crashes than they managed to fix! The uselessness on display is simply JAW-DROPPING! They took the game and KILLED it because they simply didn't care. A heinous display of incompetence by an utterly worthless developer squandered a potentially fantastic game. Damn you to hell, Blue Byte.

There are factions that all heroes of might and magic fans should be familiar with. Each faction has distinctive characteristics. There are also differnet spell schools which do determine your limits and openents battlefield tactics for example if you know they have fire spells you can assume they have fireball so you would avoid have any creatures near eachother. Mana is produced constantly by +1 each turn. It has heroes what is expected from might and magic. Life points that each hero has differs which makes it more ineteresting as it represents the idea that everything has a cost and to master the game you need to master your ability of making your deck efficient, which limits you in way since all decks will have a weakness, so you have to decide whether you want to invest more in rushing to victory or playing a steady slow game. Another thing that was intresting is that you can redraw your cards at the beginning, with consiquence which is weird to me, but I am staying neutral with it. I gave it a four because I feel like they could of added another lane, made it at least 5x5 instead of 4x4, so then it would five enough space to make it more strategic. What I mean by that there would be a middle row on both sides which would be harder to dominate since the center would be the most dangerious spot on the field. By making a small difference such as that it would increase the variaty of formations possible, not sticking to them would bring additional dangers to the player.\n\nFlow/Economics 4.25/5\nI was really happy with this game. Economics of it was most appreciated, since there was a daily reward that grows for 7 days and then is collected on the 7th day along with being awarded 10000 gold and 100 seals per level. There were also some achievements that rewarded in seals. Prices seemed reasonable to me except the fact that five towers set packs were not available for gold, which didn't make sense to me. If you look pass that then everything else is accessible each level as you go on (except the fice towers they are only accesible later when you have enough seals) cards in the game at a reasonable pace. I liked the fact that they have a sacrafice pit to recycle cards in a way but you need a lot to do that. Another thing that it makes it flow more is that there are such things as wild cards which you can use for getting specific cards in the altar of wishes, but first you hace to unlock them though by buying packs. It's a 4.25 because I think each set of cards should be accessible with gold and only the boxes should be priced with seals as they are now. Only when the set is really new it should be priced with seals for a month and then it should change to the ordinary price as the other packs.\n\nAestetics 4.25/5\nIt's organized each faction has it's own field look, quality pictures on the cards, nice log in menu background. There are also alternate art for some cards. The flying creatures move up and down, there is some other animation. I cannot give it a five though, because that would mean there is no room for improovements to be made. The aim of each card game should be to become more lively and more animated, so there would be movement and with it comes character of each creature. Everyone wants to see their creatures come to life and all spells become animated. I think even basic animations would be a start like one for each type of spell I guess. When thinking about makes you think about the ability to change the whole field and that change gives certain effects.\n\nStory 1/5\nI think there is something written on those 13 quests. I think it needs some story each hero at least to add more depth to the game. More quests some short animations or at least pcitures with writing on it or descriptions on cards.\n\nTotal: 14/20 I would recomment this game to all people that like card games and strategy.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n<<<After the update\n\nMechanics 4/5\nNothing changed that would have a huge impact.\n\nFlow/Economics 1/5\nThere seems to be no more daily rewards just some daily quests and no award for leveling, it almost seems that they don't want to reward their players really for playing the game. All prices changed to seals which disguisted me. I think it is also not fair as other people that are further ahead get the advantage as they had the ability to earn more seals. If you start just now you will never go ahead of other people. I was really disappointed by their choices that they made in this area as they also removed the achievements that awarded seals. I mean how will you feel knowing that there is no way to catch up with people unless you empty your wallets. Before it was player friendly now it's not. From play to win to pay to win.\n\nAestetics 4.5/5\nThey added some spell animation for each type and menu looks cool. Event animaiton different.\n\nStory 1.5/5\nThey added more quests. There were description on every one of them.\n\nTotal: 12/20 I would not recommend this game anymore after the update.\n\nFinal remark: They ruined the game after the update. Changed it from play to win into pay to win. If you want to play you will have to pay. Before the update I liked the game so much that I chose to support it by buying some seals as a sign of my appreciation, but now I began to regret doing so. I am very disappointed.\n\n-Thank you for taking the time to read.","April 9, 2014","false","515.3"," 734 of 869 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","734","869","0","29"

Now, granted, I haven't tried Hearthstone or Shadow Era or any of the other online card games that seem to be popular, but I used to play a ton of Magic: the Gathering and have watched a lot of friends play Hearthstone. Honestly? This game has just as much strategic depth as MTG, if not more, and both MTG and Duel of Champions blow Hearthstone out of the water if you like complexity in games like I do. The one thing that MTG has going for it though is that it's been out far longer and there are way more cards to play around with and collect (though there's no shortage of cards in DOC either). With a little more investment from its developers in terms of expanding the content and team, I can definitely see this game becoming one of the best/most popular card games around.\n\nEDIT 10/12/15: Welp, they've just announced that they'll no longer be supporting this game with updates. Honestly, screw Ubisoft. They've proven that they have no idea what they're doing, and can't handle games that have potential, especially with how HOMM 7 turned out on release. Still holding out hope that eventually they'll turn it around with expansions, but definitely not gonna waste my money on it for now. Tl;dr: don't buy anything related to Ubisoft ever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/19godfather93/recommended/256410/","19godfather93","GoDFatheR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/19godfather93/","37 products in account","MMDoC is a digital Card Collection Game (CCG) with cards belonging to six different factions, each having their unique heroes, crreatures, fortunes and buildings. Each hero can use spells from 1/2/3 schools out of a total of 7. There are also 8 event cards in play from both sides. A duel is a fight to death between two heroes, each having 18/20 Hit Points. Each card uses resources. Spells, creatures, buildings, events and heroes have synergies. One good combo can change a 25 turn long game. Nearly every game for the first 100 games teaches you something if you are experimenting. Just imagine. All this, for free. Paying money only to get in game currency that buys premium packs, or buying premium packs as-is. The best CCG concept, with the most balanced and innovative F2P model.\n\nOnly I have any clue how painful it is to mark a thumbs down on this game; because, this is was hands down the BEST digital CCG ever. Don't get me wrong, it still uses essentially the same game mechanics - easy to learn, complex to use and difficult to master - that made loyal users and fans of a lot of players. But just when everyone thought "Hey, Ubi isn't ****ing this up!", they did exactly that. And after botching it up, instead of fixing it, passed this game to a third-grade dev that goes by the name "BlueByte". Seriously, I don't say this lightly, but ROT IN HELL BlueByte. You sucked the life out of my beloved game. If you didn't want to manage the game, why acquire it?\n\nIn 2013 to early 2014 this was a lively game, with a great community, good CMs and responsive devs, regular tourneys. 1000+ concurrent players. Weekly, and by winning touneys, it was possible to earn a healthy amount of both, coins (for buying stuff) and seals (for premium packs - basically, packs with better chances of better cards and 2 wildcards). Alas, I came in JUST as that party was about to end. When I joined, UBI had "overhauled" the economy and made it impossible to earn seals (except for a couple of one time achievements). They also made the older decks restricted to "Open" format, so for the standard mode (used in tourneys) people had to start anew. Thus, player numbers were falling. And still, without putting in any cash, I was having fun playing both, ranked and unranked. It was so much fun making strategies, multiple decks, tactics and gimmicks to surprise the opponents, making knockout move combos. It had a few bugs and the guide was old and unintuitive so I even collaborated on a huge guide. That was how much I was into it AFTER the economy got restrictive.\n\nBut then, for a long time, Ubi didn't fix known bugs. No innovation, no balancing, no new cards, no interesting announcements. As people got used to it, a few decks came out too OP and the meta-game stagnated at all levels. Still, for a newbie like me, it was all fun and games. Then they released a new pack and more stackable units and cards that made stackable viable, which was enough for me to tinker but not higher level play. Basically, people wanted Draft mode and the devs were silent. Then one fine day, the dev changed from Ubi to BlueByte. BB wreaked havoc with the community. Absent CMs, no updates, just weekly epic cards in the infernal pit that only got more and more laughable each week, followed by mindless, childish, puzzles posted via facebook regularly only angered the playerbase more. Then BB released a couple new series, but about 80% cards were recycled from the older sets, bringing into the standard game the older, unusable cards. Of course, ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan as veterans with fine tuned OP decks with 10 epics gathering dust since an year and a half grabbed the matchmaking, and balance issues were everywhere. On top of that, when the draft mode was finally released, there were more bugs than players could possibly "adjust" to. Most of them giving the opponent an insta-win.\n\nSoon, an announcement followed, that basically said "We're closing down all dev work on this game, you can still give us your money if you want by buying stuff in the game shop but we're officially killing the game from our side. So as long as you suckers want to play, you can, but we don't care." And that was it. An amazing CCG killed by stupid, lazy devs and utter greed, mismanagement and abandonment of a AAA developer like Ubi. I really loved this game and like many others, I've spent hours in game and in my mind thinking up good decks. Alas, the game is no more now that even the resilient guys (like me) have also started to uninstall it and play other games.","January 7","false","172.9"," 69 of 70 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","69","70","0","2"

Rewards for a single match are negligible and you're only rewarded with a reasonable amount of gold (basic currency) when you level up. The problem is, after the first few levels it will take you around ten hours of playtime to get another one. Some mechanics are in place to make the grind less monotone, but they have their own share of issues.\n\nThere's a PvE mode available in the form of campaigns. Each campaign consists of 5 missions that, upon being completed with one of the six available factions for the first time grant a significant amount of gold plus some experience points. Clearing the entire campaign with a faction also grants a free booster pack. The problem is, those free boosters are largely useless, since following an overhaul in 2014 most cards from older sets can no longer be used in ranked play. The gold rewards for campaigns also happen to have a nasty incident in their early history. Two weeks after being introduced those rewards were increased by a factor of five and this increase was not retroactively applied to players who already cleared the campaigns. Since the increased rewards were ridiculous - clearing 2 missions took next to no time and granted as much as a single level up normally does - pretty much all the players who weren't already veterans found themselves in a situation where it would simply be easier for them to start the game anew (which isn't allowed), even if they already spent money on it.\nThe previously mentioned overhaul also made it impossible to gain seals (premium currency) without paying money for the game, even though previously they were received upon leveling up and as a reward for 6 consecutive days of playing. Since every new card pack is only available for seals for the first few weeks, this also means that paying players now have an actual advantage over non paying ones.\n\nThere's also a lot of balance issues. Unless you manage to build a decent deck, which involves lots of grinding or spending several AAA titles worth in money on card packs then you'll struggle even against mediocre necropolis players, mostly because dark magic school is broken to the point where it enforces the meta (not worth it to use any creature costing more than 4, because otherwise casting Soulreaver or Death Seal will remove it for a lower cost, while casting Wither will make it useless). Necropolis isn't exactly overpowered though: it just isn't really possible to counter if you lack cards, so for the first ~40 levels or something around ten times that amount in dollars/euros.\n\nIf you bothered to read this wall of text, you might've noticed that most problems are nailed down to the controversial overhaul, that:\n1. added PvE campaigns and then screwed over everyone who finished them\n2. made over half of the cards in the game useless by excluding them from ranked play or the so-called 'standard format'\n3. removed all the free ways of gaining premium currency, except for some achievements that are mostly hard or even impossible to get without paying for the now obsolete card sets in the first place.\n\nPoint #2 effectively negatively affected paying players by making some neat decks that require a select pool of cards useless and wasting their money in the process, point #3 made the game feel like a 'pay to win' for free players, while point #1 was a bad decision that screwed over everyone. What all of those points have in common is that the combination of these things irrecoverably ruined the trust in the developer that many players had at that time.\n\nEven with those problems playing MM: DoC can be enjoyable from time to time, but as far as I'm concerned, major updates tend to create more problems than they solve, not to mention that removing what used to be half of the cards available in game from ranked play instead of actually bothering to balance them (and not even managing to tweak the remaining half properly) was probably the most lazy development decision I've ever witnessed.\nIf you're looking for a more complex alternative to Hearthstone, you might want to check out Infinity Wars instead.","February 6, 2015","false","4.1"," 91 of 112 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","91","112","0","2"

It has depth , quite a few cards to choose from (around 600) and one of the best F2P models I have experienced . I hope the community will keep growing now that it is on Steam.\n\nEDIT : I am taking back what I said . The game does look very promising but it only gets worse as you level up . Your dependency on packs is not visible when you are a beginner , but when you try to face an opponent with 500+ elo , you WILL find a guy that has emptied his wallet on this game . More specifically :\n\n- The lack of a trading system is killing MaM . It does not matter if you want THAT card .You have to buy a pack every time and expect to find it there . Most packs contain 10-12 cards . There are all in all 600 cards. You do the math.\nAnd it gets even better . Most of the epic monsters can only be found in 2 card packs , which sometimes DO contain duplicate cards . So if you want one of those cards you are pretty much screwed.An alternative to praying to the godess of luck , is to purchase it directly with wildcards , a currency that you get with packs.\n\nHowever the only sure way to have them is to buy packs with seals . You get 100 seals per level up (roughly 20 matches if you haven't bought cards with real money , as you will lose most of the time ).There are two packs ( essentially one )  that you can buy with seals.The ''normal pack'' costs 175 seals and gives 3 wildcards , along with 12 other game cards . The second one costs 225 seals gives 4 wildcards and has the same card pool with the previous pack , with the onl difference being that they are ...shiny.\nSo after 4 level ups (400 seals) you can get 7 wildcards , 48 random cards and all the gold you will have gathered by then. Well done ! An epic card costs 8 wildcards.After so many matches , you can not have the epic card you want.Now imagine what happens if you want to fit 10 or more epic cards in your deck  , which i assure you is the minimum to have a chance at higher elos.\nIf you do not want to pay for seals , and do not want to spend the ones you get by leveling up , you can use your gold ( the in-game currency ) to get packs. Sadly those packs have a mediocre 40 % chance ( at best ) to have ONE wildcard .And they most likely fill your card collection with dozens of duplicates. I believe you see my point.\nAnd that concludes the bad moneytary system .\n\n- Another probem of MoM is the matchmaking . The tournament mm that is . Are you a low level player that want to participate in a tournament ? Forget it. You will get matched with guys that have spent an eternity in this game , and more often than not have far better decks than yours .\n\n-Finally any help you get on the game stops at the tutorial . There is no library , catalogue , list ,whatever you want to call it that can inform you of the cards each faction has . You must either visti the ( poor) wiki of the game , or suffer again and again as you are bombarded with effects you didn't know they existed , even after 200 games after you started.\n\nTo conclude this game is good for a while , but transforms into a cash sink later on.\n\nEDIT 2 : Right now the only way to play with legacy cards is to pay real money . Open duels are officialy broken . Well played Ubo , well played.","November 10, 2013","false","37.5"," 637 of 944 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","637","944","0","46"

I can't stop playing this since I started and now I'm having trouble sleeping... :D\nDeep game strategy, deck building skills and lots of cards to choose.\nEvery part of the game is excellent.

It is also quite possible to have fun with it without spending a dime, which is always a bonus.\n\nThe game play of this CCG is slightly different from others I have played.  The battlefield has a 2x4 grid you place your creatures on.  Melee creatures can only be placed on the front line, and archers on the back line, flying creatures can be placed anywhere.  Most creatures cannot attack outside of their row, nor can they attack the enemy hero if enemy creatures are in the way.  To me, it helps add a bit of the Heroes of Might and Magic feel to the game.\n\nAs far as spells go, you have the usual assortment of nukes, removals, buffs and various other deck manipulation tools.  Spells are broken up into their respective element, and each Hero only has access to certain elements.  This combined with the fact that Heroes only have access to neutral troops and the ones from their faction leads to a wide variety in the strategies you can deploy.\n\nIf you play through the short single-player campaign, you should get enough seals to buy 'The Box' which has 10 packs of cards to help get you started.  You can also look around on the net for some codes you can redeem for additional packs and rewards.\n\nIt should be noted though that this game is almost exclusively PvP once you have completed the campaign.  So if you are not into PvP at all, you might want to skip over this one.","November 7, 2013","true","6.2"," 178 of 266 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","178","266","0","1"

(as it is complex, and GREAT!)\n- Sometimes the randomization of the cards you get in your starting hand is flawed (getting 3 copies of one card 2 of another and 2 of another is strange when it happens a once or twice a day)\n\nMy past experience: I used to play MTG (I find it too expensive now days, so I use Work Station for free with friends), currently playing Hearthstone (I have most of the cards, only 4 legendaries to finish the collection)\n\nI have been playing for a week TO DOC and I still have lots of fun!\nThe solo play is really good, it gives you LOTS OF GOLD to buy packs and some 20 packs. The only problems with the 20 packs is that they are from the old editions, so most of cards are not valid for standard game (only for open - for Pros)\n\nWhat most of people complain is about the changes that happened from the old edition to the new. For me is ok, as I do not care about most of things they say. For example, you can only buy with seals (mostly real money) packs from old editions with cards that we can not use in the Standard game, so WHAT'S THE POINT!!!\n\nCOMPARE TO MTG:\n\nNot as good. MTG is the King. Strategy in not as deep and versatile. But illustrations in DOC are better for my taste.\nIn MTG you can mix all the cards, in DOC you have classes and some general cards, very few. So it is limited in that aspect. But you can mix spells and there are 7 schools of magic, and many Heroes with abilities and mixes of magic schools that create different strategies.\n\nCOMPARE TO HEARTHSTONE:\n\nFor the moment I proffer the deepest of DOC and the extensive amount of spells. Hearthstone is great and I love it, but is all about minions and sometimes it feels a bit limited. I have been playing since close Beta and I'm a bit bored now. The brought only 30 new cards with Naraxxramas and the Meta has changed, but is more or less with the same cards, not so interesting.\nI also prefer the illustrations and the darker look of DOC, but I miss the animation of the spells of HS.\nHS is fast and great for any moment, DOC could be slower but deeper so more planing is requiered to play.\nHS has Drafts in the Arena and is amazing, the best of all, maybe that is missing in DOC.\n\nMy advice is to try it and decide as it is FREE. If you want all the basic decks to start with, use my code as Referal: 8BKDTC\n\nIf you see a bad review of someone that has played more than 40 hours, read it careful, most of people do not like changes and get angry when that happens. There are reviews of people that has played more than 50 hours, even 400 hours and they are bad reviews. Tell me how someone that has played so much has not liked the game? They are angy with changes.\nDon't miss the opportunity to try it!\n\nHave FUN!\n","August 29, 2014","true","69.9"," 49 of 61 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","49","61","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colinodbl/recommended/256410/","colinodbl","colinodbl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colinodbl/","68 products in account","The game mechanics themselves are enjoyable, but the paywall is much too high. After playing for a few hours, I've come to the conclusion that it is not possible to actually play the game without paying for it. If you want to run a successful pay to win game like this one, the game has to at least be fun and fast paced enough in the beginning to lure people into paying for things later. This game fails to do that as you are immediately faced with a paywall or easily over 20 hours of grinding with the same starter deck to even unlock even the most basic features common in modern 'free to play' card games. I stopped at about hour three. (Note that I started playing this game outside of steam, which is why I only have an hour logged playing on steam.)\n\nIt's not that the game mechanics are bad, in fact they are quite interesting. Each deck being bound to certain factions and schools of magic is a promising feature that unfortunately does not come out prominently in the beginning as you are forced to play with the same intro deck (you can make some slight modifications to it with your starting cardpool if you wish) over and over again. The tactical mechanic of positioning your creatures and having area of effect features is also quite enjoyable. This is the meat of the game's structure and it is well executed. The main problem is with the way the paywalls are set up.\n\nThere is a simple conundrum in these pay to win games. If you don't want to pay, you have to spend countless hours grinding, which is boring, but at least you are playing the game. If you are willing to pay, you have to realize that you are in effect paying the game company to NOT play their game. It is quite an achievement for game developers to create a game so boring that people are willing to pay to NOT play it. So then what's the point? This is the pit that many of these games fall in.\n\nSo what would make this game better? More variation. The game should give every player access to all the starter decks. This way as they continue to grind through the game they are encouraged to try new things which will keep them playing, rather than get bored repetitively grinding with the same low power decks. Also removing the level requirement for the card trade in system is a must. This will allow players to more greatly customize whatever starter deck they like the most which will also encourage them to keep playing and trying new things. As is, the lack of customization available in deck construction to the new player really dampens the exploration of the game. It should be set up so that playing the game intrigues the player into wanting to try new things and then maybe pay to help that along instead of making them have to pay before even the creative spark fires, not knowing what they really want to do. This puts out the fire of imagination before it even starts.\n\nTo sum up, this game does not offer the non paying user any encouragement to want to play the game - let alone pay for it. Furthermore, the first few hours of gameplay do not adequately sell the game's features to the user, leading to the user to doubt that the game would be fun even if they put in a few dollars.\n\nFor interesting mechanics despite a horrible paywall system and an unfun experience, this game has a lot of potential if a few minor tweaks were made. It shall therefore earn a 1/5 rating. I will not be spending any more time playing this game.","April 26, 2014","false","1.1"," 191 of 293 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","191","293","0","0"

Yeah the game had some problems some months ago, but they are working to make it enjoyable, they made so much progress!\n\n- You can get all cards for free only playing, yeah it's grindy but that's normal since you don't pay a dime. If you want to speed up a bit you can buy more cards with real money and just that. There's no real diference between a paying player and a free player, the only benefit is the time spent.\n- Lots of achievements that gives you cards, the various types of currency in the game and other fun stuff, another way to get the cards you want.\n- 2 formats of dueling: the Open Format, for more experienced players and where you can play with all cards from the game, and the Standard Format, for beginners and where you have a tinier pool of cards that you can play with.\n- Also there's a extra format of dueling: the Weekly Format, where every week the game choose some restrictions to put in the decks. Example: You can only play with Spells, or Creatures, or a specific Faction, etc.\n- Campaign Mode and Puzzles: This one is great, you can learn a lot of things with it and get good rewards for doing it. Also the Puzzles are extremely challenging.\n- Wildcards System: Since the beginning of this game everyone asked for a trade system, but the fact is the trade system would broke the game, so they implemented a way to get the cards you want by colecting Wildcards and trade it for them.\n- Infernal Pit: This system help you to get rid of the cards you don't want. You just need a max of 4 cards from the same card in each deck so, if you have 5, 6 or more from that card you can "sell" them to the npc and he gives some amount of money for it. Also there's a featured card every 8 hours that you can get by selling a great amount of cards, the more cards you sell the chance of getting that card will increase until 100%.\n- Unlike HS, where the game is extremely simplistic and casual, DoC is complex and very competitive, this can be a good or a bad thing depending on what kind of card game you want to play. If you want a simple game, this is not for you, you have so many mechanics and effects on this game, you must read every cards if you are a beginner or you will make a lots of errors. But that's normal, everyone does it, even experienced players make mistakes. It can be a bit harsh in the beginning, but after learn the basics you'll enjoy it.\n- The community is not great but they are very united, helpful and loyal. If you need help they will help you for sure. Also they are constantly creating community tournaments where you can try your skill and win very good prizes.\n\nThe only thing i complain about is the lack of Draft system, but they said they are working on it.

Also, the starter decks are all over the place.. Definitely make your own, simplified deck with a few good spells/fortunes and a lot of creatures, with a good resource-curve.. it'll be much easier to learn from.

The campaign is painfully short, but it does give you enough gold and "seals" to buy a decent number of cards with which to expand your collection (I recommend buying "The Box" and avoiding premium packs -- you'd be paying more for shiny cards).\n\nThe deckbuilding interface is easy enough to use once you understand the deckbuilding rules. The way your cards can only exist in one deck at a time is a bit of a pain, but since your hero's stats dictates which cards you can have in that hero's deck, there isn't a whole lot of overlap to begin with. Plus, any cards you don't need can be converted into other cards, so nothing is wasted.\n\nBetween the campaign's rewards and daily log-in rewards, a smart and/or diligent player can get along without ever paying to play or be competitive. And speaking of competition, it seems that there exists a formal competitive tournament community that is supported by the developers, which is always good news for the long-term health of a game of this type.\n\nOverall, M & M: Duel of Champions looks to have what it takes to be a lasting, engaging entry into the wide, wild world of collectible card gaming in the digital space.","December 4, 2013","true","20.0"," 117 of 178 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","117","178","0","1"

It's terribly frustrating.  I love the game and collecting as many of the different cards as I can, and there are some problems with the economy as mentioned in other posts.  I have logged over 900 hours, and 1700 duels.  I currently have 914/996 of the different cards.  Whether you like games like this for the sake of collecting the cards or are just trying to get that 4th Arcane Eagle for your deck, than you should expect to fork out some dough or become a total shut in and dedicate your life to grinding.\n\nThe game is very Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.  Luck is a significant factor as well as far as who gets the curse of having to go first.  I know that generally the first turn player statistically will more often get to also attack first, but the second player gets a card draw, a bonus card AND the first player doesn't get to boost their hero on the first turn!   Bizarre.\n\nI like how there are separate 'standard' and 'open' game modes.  Open is for old school players that are fortunate enough to already have a good collection of the best legacy cards.  My mistake was spending so much time trying to grind in open.  Some rebalancing was done, and I am optimistic that there is more to come.  A lot of cards were recently rebalanced and introduced into standard mode.  While I would love to say that I want to see more of this in future expansions, this will bring me to my next point.\n\nCOLLECTING\n\nI had set out with the crazy goal to try and get a copy of every single card from every set, as any obsessive collector would.  The only way to get the legacy cards now is by paying, aside from the wildcard farming (and infernal pit) or saving all your gold and waiting every 3 months or so for waiting for Emilio's packs to be available for gold.  Doing this presents a small problem though...\n\nWith each expansion, newer stronger cards are coming out that naturally players want to get their hands on as soon as they can to maintain an edge over their competitors.  Particularly, Sins of Betrayal and Time of Renewal especially have introduced a lot of powerful new cards.  So if all of the hard, hard, hard earned gold is needed for the newest, and priciest packs, than you need to decide whether your efforts are to work towards staying competitive, or getting really rare legacy epic cards.  (900 hours and i still don't have Eleonore, unfortunately I started not long before Base Set II came out) This wouldn't be an issue if legacy packs or Emilio's packs were always available for gold, or if you could still earn seals.\n\nRegarding my collection, I'm roughly 2000 wildcards away.  About 800 booster packs...\n\nECONOMY\n\nOverall, getting cards is slow.  Even with daily achievements (which sometimes take hours to finish), it generally takes a few hours just to get a single pack.\n\nSeals are finite.  After your early achievements, I think you end up with a grand total of 1600 or something.  Enough to get a box and a couple of packs.  Seals are the only everyday way to get old cards and they only available for real money.  They recently became even more overpriced.\n\nUbisoft needs to reintroduce weekly seals in the login bonuses.  Not necessarily a lot, averaging maybe about 100 a week or so just so players can get cards a little quicker.   I'll compare this model to the Pokemon online CCG, which (up until recently at least) gave a booster pack for every 5 login days.  On login bonuses alone, DoC would get you a free pack after logging in every day for roughly 3 to 4 weeks.  Don't even think about skipping a day or you will reset the week and have to wait even longer for the coveted wildcards.\n\nThere are a few basic things that Ubisoft can and should do to drastically improve the economics of the game and put it back on top.\n\n- Seals should be available in the weekly login bonuses, or they need to be WAY less stingy on the number of seals provided for $$\n- Emilio's packs should be available for gold at all times\n- The infernal pit should offer rares, epics, and heroes more often and way less commons from Base Set II and the timer should be 4 hours, instead of 8\n- Better achievement rewards (banners?  ... seriously?)\n\nSome economical improvements and continued balancing and this game would put it on top to stay for a long time to come.\n\nIf you found this review helpful and are starting a new account, feel free to use my referral code, you'll get extra cards to start out!

The game underwent some considerable changes lately and has become very welcoming to new players.\n\nIf you consider giving this game a try, keep the following in mind:\n1: Sign up using someone's referral code.  That way you get almost 400 extra cards right from the start.\n2: Here's a code that can be redeemed for some extra cards, but it can only be redeemed within the first 6 hours of opening the account: FBAW-CMRW-7AAS-4PZN-NKNL\n\nHave fun!","August 30, 2014","true","052.8"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

Despite what a lot of the reviews say, it is pretty easy to obtain new cards without having to spend any real money in the game- it is not very hard to get at least one pack per day (Increased gold reward from campaign is a huge contributor to that, but gold from dueling, daily quests and leveling is also generally sufficient).\nSmall complaints are:\nWildcards, the method for specific card acquisition, are a bit too hard to obtain (you can get 1-5 per week for logging in 7 days in a row, and [after you get to at least Champion I ranking] 3-5 per day from daily quests, which can be hard to finish if you get one that doesn't suit your cards. Rares/epics/heroes from the newest set are 15/24/24 wildcards each, respectively, so obtaining specific cards you are missing can take some time.\nInfernal pit could give more gold for the cards you are sacrificing\n\nEDIT: Pending the upcoming major update/expansion, wildcards will no longer be obtained from quests, but as an extra reward from sacrificing cards to the Infernal Pit. Quests that gave WC will now give gold. This may or may not be good- it will take 480 commons to get a recent epic/heroic. But if the gold reward scales evenly with current quests, the new quests should reward an equal amount of WC on average from saccing earned cards.\n\nLegacy cards are virtually locked behind a pay wall. This is only a minor complaint though, because they are only usable in Open format, which isn't the "officially supported" format and not usable in the main tournament (Road to Paris)\n\nOther notes: Card artwork is beautiful, and the community is generally very helpful (strategies, deckbuilding, etc).","September 3, 2014","true","662.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","3"

Most of the Complaints are either false or have been fixed in the new patch. I have pretty much all the cards I want in the game and only paid like $0.06 for 2 steam puzzle/decks (100+ cards) in the market place. I think it's more giving than Hearthstone, I have been playing Hearthstone since beta and still have a bunch of cards i need. The campaigns give a ton of gold/packs and can be completed with all factions for more gold/packs! You start off with 1 deck but earn other decks as u beat their factions or start with all 6 faction decks if you start the game through a referral.\n\nThere are weekly promotions like this last week for every Wild Card (WC) you spend, you get 50% back after the weekend. WC are used to buy any cards you want in the Altar of wishes. The WC prices are fair. There is a login bonus system where u just need to log in and get free stuff every day. Playing a game earns you gold and exp. win or lose, and there are daily quests to earn more gold. Leveling up gives a nice chunk of gold enough to buy a pack. There is a Infernal pit where u can burn your extra cards for Gold, WC and if u burn enough you also get a card(the card changes about every 8 hr). Another way to earn packs, gold, WC, etc is to earn achievements, and there are many of them! Also be sure to search for some codes online which give free packs/gold.\n\nIt's more strategic than Hearthstone since you have 8 placements to put your creature. You can be offensive or defensive. You can only attack the hero if there is no creature blocking your way. There are 3 different formats, Standard (recommended for new players), Open (Every card can be used here but could be chaotic for new players), and Weekly format which changes every week. There is also 2 tournament mode: Jackpot (chance to earn gold) Swiss (tournament of 8 players where 1-2 place get 2 packs of the last to exp set and and random player that plays all 3 games will get a ticket and a bs2 pack)  I think you should stay away from tournaments until you have reached champion 1 level or think you have a good deck and grasp of the game.\n\nThe cards consist of Creatures, Magic, and Fortunes. Most cards have a requirement where you can raise 1 per turn for Might (Creatures), Magic. And Destiny (Fortune). It's pretty simple, the tutorial explain everything clearly. Each Hero has magic school(s) attach to them and can only use spells from that school. There is also Neutral Events where both players can use so pick those out carefully. Try to pay attention to the events, cause I forgot about them when starting out and lost some games cause of it.\n\nOh and the art work in this is great!\n\nIf you use this link, you will start with all 6 decks:\nhttps://signup.duelofchampions.com/portal/index/DOC_world_02_0010_06_200_12_0614_00♥♥♥♥♥♥♥791SBN\n\nSo that's 12 decks you will have after beating all the factions once, and will have lots of extra cards to burn in the pit. You can add me too if u like to chat or play a game :)","September 22, 2014","true","162.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/recommended/256410/","3InkSheep","3InkSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/","218 products in account","I grew up playing card games, I dabbled with a bit of everything from Yu-Gi-Oh to Pokemon to Magic: The Gathering and so on. Naturally this game caught my attention and after playing it for a few hours, I'm hooked.\n\nWhat I think makes this game so much more interactive and enjoyable to play is firstly the smoothness of the visuals, gameplay and cutscenes.\n\nThe asthetics in this game look absolutely gorgeous, right from the card images to the slick painted backgrounds. Heck, even little things like the smoke clouds that vapourize from cards that go to the graveyard look incredible.\n\nThe gameplay is as you'd expect, it's strategic and requires you to think three turns ahead of what's actually happening. There's a tutorial to help new players, (such as myself) into the game, and unlike many other card game tutorials, it's actually incredibly easy to follow and understand. The developers obviously wanted to try easing the player into the game, teaching one thing at a time and slowly building up to the more complex duels and they've done a fantastic job.\n\nThe cutscenes are another beauty, but the main thing that really appealed to me is there isn't an unesseccary cutscene after every duel, they're only placed at major events. It's a little thing, but it's a trap that many developers fall into in hope it will enrich the story aspect of the game. I've yet to play through the entire game, but so far it's looking absolutely incredible.\n\nMight & Magic Duel of Champions also has some very nice features, simple features, but definietely welcome. The options menu, for example, includes features to stream directly to Twitch at a press of a button. There's customizable options to allow the player to toggle certain aspects of the game on/off, simple, but things like in-game cutscenes, fast dueling etc. It's simple I agree, but little things just make the game richer and more enjoyable to play.\n\nThe game also has some very interesting features in terms of how to manage increasing your deck size, or purchasing new cards. You can win the resources to purchase cards/boosters etc from the store from dueling, or you can choose to pay for the resources through microtransactions. Normally I would be highly against this, seeing as players could pour money into buying endless booster packs to build an incredibly powerful deck, but when the resources are as easerily obtainable from in-game playing, the need to purchase content with money seems like it would only be used by those 'hardcore' players who aim to collect every card. The beginners decks and the amount of obtainable resources in-game are generous too, it's not as if the developers have given you a horrible deck, only to go online and be destroyed. This kind of balance makes every duel, regardless of skill level a blast to play.\n\nGames aren't without faults though, and this game has it's own. For one microtransactions to many will seem negative and as much as I'm ok with it in this particular title, I personally would have preffered the game a little more had it not been implemented. I understand why they've included it though and it does seem fair seeing as Might & Magic Duel of Champions is free to play, so that can be argued both ways.\n\nThe menu that greets you for first time play is a little daunting. There's buttons and menus everywhere, which after an hour of playing seemed perfectly easy to use and navigate, but for first time play it can through many players off from playing, so just be warned.\n\nThe in-game music is very nice as fitting, but after a while can become a little boring and dull. I imagine it probably becomes a little more varied late game, but for the most part I play this game whilst listening to my own music, perhaps a few of you may feel the same way.\n\nI could continue to ramble, there is a tone of things to mention and talk about, but for the most part if you're either a fan of card games or stratgies, I highly recommend you try this out. Heck, just try it out even if you don't like card games. It's a very slick title with some of the smoothest presentations I've seen in a game for a long time.\n\nDo yourself a favour, try this title out. It's an absolute blast to play.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93/100. ~ A beautiful strategic card game that's easy enough to learn for beginners, but in-depth enough for veterans.","December 5, 2013","true","62.7"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Although many have been playing longer than I have I still feal as though I have the authority to review this card game based on the endless hours and dedication I've put into card games.\n\nAccessability:\n\nThis is the easiest to get started free to play game that I have ever participated in. There are good rewards for a campaign mode that teaches the basics of the game, there is a crafting system, and there are daily rewards for playing. Overall, I have yet to spend money on the game, but I'm happy with my collection and deck I have been able to build. I have played for less than a month. You can use actual money to advance if you wish.\n\nThis is also a easy game to learn, Even as an easy game to learn, there are many options during every turn so there is a challenge using the most basic decks against real players and the later computer players in campaign mode.\n\n4.5/5\n\nOnly a totally free all cards accessible immediatley type of game would be better in my opinion, but there are drawbacks to having everything at the start of the game. The game can be picked up quickly, but offers a deep sense of strategy.\n\nFlavor:\n\nThe artstyle of the game is comparable to that of Magic the Gathering. They are comparable in that this game draws inspiration from a number of fantasy areas; mideival, japanese, and middle eastern are a few of these fantasy realms that are drawn from. Additionally, this particular game doesn't feature art that is as dark and hard to distinguish as Magic the Gathering. If Magic the Gathering was Diablo 1 and Hearthstone was Diablo 3, then this game is in between when concerned with the art assets.\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a great aesthetic for a competitive fantasy game that wants to be taken seriously.  The art assets are memorable and work very well with the card effects.\n\nMechanics:\n\nThere are quite a few interesting, mechanically wise, things going on in this game that are not featured in many other games.\n\nFirst, card zones matter. This is a feature non-existent in many card games, but as creatures may only attack opposing creatures that are directly across from themselves and because creatures can be made less vulnerable to attack by putting them on certain board tile players do best by strategizing how to move and initially position their creatures on the game board.\n\nSecond, creatures health totals do not automatically heal every round - creatures keep the damage that they take throughout the game. Creatures are also, as mentioned above, only vulnerable to attack in certain board positions. Together these parts of the game come together to create a lasting investment in the cards that have already been developed onto the board. Players may strategize how to keep their creatures around so that they may stifle a future assault or begin to pressure the opponents life total without engaging the opponent's creatures.\n\nThird, attacking isn't always free. If a creature does not kill an opponent's creature with it's attack, then the attacking creature is vulnerable to retaliation damage. Attacking therefore becomes something more strategic than automatic.\n\nFourth, there are multiple costs to playing a card. Not only do cards have a mana cost, but they also have a threshold costs. There are three separate resources, other than mana, that players have the option of adding to every turn. Overall, these other resources add another layer of depth to card balance, deck building, and game play. Additionally, card zones and deck size are other limited resources that also may need to be managed during longer and more complicated games.\n\n4.5/5\n\nThese are just the mechanics that I find most interesting. These mechanics are rare to find in a good card game, but they all come together well to create a challenging experience in this game. This game also has very good use of key words that facilitate the understanding of what cards do. The room for improvement here is a few rules based questions about not being able to always predict what will happen without having experienced the given situation beforehand.\n\nPlayability:\n\nThis game has curtailed some of the more annoying occurrences in card games with it's standard format and general card balance. Many times non-interactive combo strategies and rush strategies can be frustrating and impossible to stop in games. Although those types of strategies do exist in this game, they are not game breaking. The amount of damage that a player can deal in one turn, in a long back and forth game, is hardly unexpected. This is not Yu-Gi-Oh! or Hearthstone where players will be able to reliably leverage their card economy into fast and lethal damage.\n\nThis game gets deck and card diversity right. All too often do card gamers consider deck diversity to be an automatic good. All too often deck diversity comes with the cost of imperfect knowledge about the opponent's deck and degenerate strategies. As I said in the previous paragraph, most strategies are interactive in this game. There is a real focus on combat and life managmnt in the game. Additionally, players are limited from playing every single card in every single deck and therefore players will be able to reliably predict the threats that an opponent may have - the issue of losing because of the opponent happening to be using a different strategy than expected isn't a problem.\n\n4/5\n\nThe point lost here is because of some balance issues. There are times, as in any game, where the opponent has a specific hand of cards that cannot be beaten. This is more of a issue with deck based games than this specific game, but there still will be a few games that will feel bad and that will be out of your control. The most recent set also has some very powerful cards that are difficult to interact with. This game does fall into the trap of allowing rare cards to be overpowered and there are also times when you will have no silver bullet available to use against the opponent, but, again, that only occurs twenty percent or a low amount of the time.\n\nTotal:\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis game does live up to it's claim of being the best online free to play card game.\n\nThere are more things that I could have mentioned, but that would not have changed the score. Stop reading this review and go play the game already.\n\nPlay through campaign as quickly as possible as that has the biggest rewards in terms of free cards.\n\nOnce you reach a certain rank, then you will be given daily quests that are very generous.\n\nTry to only use your wildcards for crafting heroic, epic, and rare cards. Also always uncheck hide duplicate on the crafting page so that you can find the lowest crafting price for the card you want.\n\nIf you get a referral link to play the game you will start with extra cards, but do not ask me for a referral link as that goes against the terms of my posting this review.\n\noccasionally check the online forums for promo codes as they will be occasionally released and grant you free cards.","September 3, 2014","true","1.5"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

This means, that in the standard format people can only have the cards you can get with ingame currency. What I like about this game is that you can get the currency so easyly. Where in Hearthstone you barely manage to buy 1 pack by doing the daily quest and winning a couple times, here you get money for dailys, winning and losing and after a while of playing 1 pack, play a little, boom another pack. Also where in hearthstone a pack contains 5 cards here it is 15. This all means, that you can get very many cards very fast. Whats also good is that there actually IS a lot of different cards. This game has existed for a while and every couple months they introduced around 100 new cards. This means that there is no way, that you can have a deck that always wins. There is so many insane ways to combine your cards, that its really just up to your capability to think strategically and creatively when building a deck. Once you have the cards that is. Fazit: I have nevered played Magic, so I cant compare it with that, but from all the other online card games I have played (and boy there are some crappy ones out there) this is probably the best.","September 18, 2014","true","87.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The game itself is fantastic, it has well designed and balenced cards, and quick and selective way to get new cards, and a vast number of cards, something that most of these games suffer because of. The gameplay is above average and easy to figure out. Until some time ago, I had nothing bad at all to say about this game. I did however take a break from the game for about a year however, and when I returned the experience was completely ruined. I came back to find that nearly every single card I had collected had been banned by a new patch, and were only usable in open formats, where every opponent has absolutely all the good cards available to them. I came back and faced the choice of fighting unwinnable battles for a while until I could get a better collection, I could start all over again with card collection, which would be hard since I didn't get another starting deck, or I could quit and never look back, which is exactly what I did. You may have more patience than I do, and heck maybe it won't happen again, but I doubt it. If you play this game, chances are you will come to regret it in one way or another.","November 4, 2014","false","117.6"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","32","48","0","1"

Maybe the best i've seen.\n\n- The resources that you need to summon units/use spells --- just excellent! Simple things like that shouldn't be taken for granted. Alot of TCGs have a problem thinking of ways to play your cards. Like for expample a game called Hex (still in beta) that shows alot of promise but you keep getting stuck cuz you either cant summon anything or you cant get anything to summon. Believe it or not i've been sitting there afk for 20 turns without being able to do anything while my opponent was crushing me.\n\n- Factions --- there are 6 factions to whom most monsters are locked to with the exeption of the neutral creatures who can be used by anyone\n\n- Card types --- You've got the usual monsters and spells with the eddition of Events, Buildings and Fortunes . I would've liked some trap cards but meh.\n\n- Monster Cards --- there are a few types. Meele, Ranged, Flying and a Ranged Meele. On its type depends the possition it can take or attack to on the field.\n\n- Spells --- There are a few types. Single target, Adjacent, Dmg in a line, Dmg in a row, Pernament/Over time and Field target.\nTheres also different magic types: Fire, Water, Dark, Light, Nature, Arcane and Air.\n\n- Fortune cards --- Fortunes have various effects that can change or twist the rules of the game.\n\n- Buildings --- Buildings can be deployed on the battleground on any space you can play a Creature on. Buildings have passive effects that give additional benefits to your creatures.\n\n\n2. Visuals:\n\n- The art of the cards is pretty damn good\n- The music is great but theres not much of it\n- The effects are nice, a few more animations were addet a few patches ago\n- card sounds are well done and recognizable. I can tell you what spell hit me (since creatures have the same sound when attacking) without even looking.\n- the interface is... ok... but i liked the old one better, it was simple and effective. I have no idea why they changed it.\n\n\n3. Game Balance\n\nNot much to say there. While yes there are a few annoying cards *cough*spellhungry*cough*breeder*cough*, alot has been done and about 99.9% of them are well balanced.\n\n\n4. Story\n\nTheres not much into the game itself, but its Might and Magic... we all know the story.\n\n\n5. Cash shop\n\nFinaly its come to this. This is the part that can ruin a game no matter how good it is.\nWhen it fisrt came out it was great, and it kept being great before the Heart of Nightmare expansion.\nBelieve it or not i made a smurf account and got from 0 to 1001 elo (people in 1k+ were considered to be the "pros" back in the old ranking system) using nothing but the starter deck and the few cards pack that you get from achievment just to prove wrong anyone who thought the game was pay to win.\nBUT the Heart of Nightmare came out and while it providet some serious card balance it ruined everything. You just couldnt play on the same level as others without paying.\nOnce again alot has been done since then and the cash shop right now is fine. While yes if you pay for cards you will have more than the others but the drop is random so that doesnt guarantee that you'll get what you need.\nSo to the people that for some reason still say that the game is Pay to win (and ill caps that) NO ITS NOT!\nI am curently a Champion 2 in the top 3 000 players without spending ANYTHING on the game.\n\n\nFinal Verdict - a solid 9/10\nTheres a few more little thing that annoy me, but the game is a damn masterpiece.\nIf you like TGCs, its just a must play!\n\nAnd heres a little bonus, using my referal link (or any referal link for that matter) you'll get 6 starter packs. I'd say thats a pretty good way to start.\nhttps://signup.duelofchampions.com/portal/index/DOC_world_02_0010_06_200_12_0614_00♥♥♥♥♥♥♥53DZ1W","October 24, 2014","true","432.2"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

A free version of MtG.\n\nIt quickly becomes difficult in both Campaign and Multiplayer battles. The Campaign is paced in difficulty so that you wont be able to finish it without learning how to and collecting the cards to build a serious deck. The puzzles are also a good way  to learn some tactical methods of the battles. In the Quick games, however, the biggest problem is the matchmaking. After the first five levels, the players you are matched with could be much higher in skill than you. After level ten, you are hard-pressed to find a player who isnt wielding a better deck with purchases.\n\nIf there were a more comprehensive matchmaking, or even a more restrictive one, the game would be enjoyable.  As it stands, it is unacceptable how the game is designed to make purchases necessary so early.","February 2","false","121.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It is in need of some serious rebalancing. At least 4/5ths of the online games I play are against Necropolis decks relying on Crippling. There are a few ways to minimize the effect of these (Enrage, Honor, repeatedly returning your creature to your hand, etc) but it is to the extent now that very few people even bother to play one of the other 6 Factions. I just can't get used to the idea that a game with so many options and gameplay styles can boil down to one factor.","December 9, 2014","false","40.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Setroc/recommended/256410/","Setroc","Setroc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Setroc/","404 products in account","I have been enjoying this game since release, so I thought I'd leave my thoughts here for the steam community.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. Each turn, your available resources increases by one, you draw a card, use one of your hero abilities, and play some combination of creatures, spells, and fortunes (more different spells). As ever in a good card game, the complexity comes from the abilities laid out on the cards, so playing the game is a constant learning experience as you discover new tricks and combos employed by your enemies.\n\nBut, there is also complexity in the basic systems of the game. The grid system for creatures, which lays out four rows of spaces with room for two creatures for each player per row turns in to a game of cat and mouse, of bluff and double bluff as you scramble to control the board. A spells effectiveness is often dependant on creature positioning so you are constantly second guessing your opponent's options while trying to force him in to an unfavourable creature layout to unleash your own devastating spell. Then there's the event cards at the bottom, these are a seperate deck that is cycled through, and 2 events are available to both players at the same time. This means the opponent can use your own event cards against you, so be careful with your choice.\n\nNow to address the (war) elephant in the room: is this game pay to win? Well, yes, if you drop big money on boxes of cards you will have a significant advantage over others, but don't let that put you off. There is a lot of enjoyment to be had in the lower ranks of the game, and working your way up through them. Rewards come fast and furious at the beginning of the game. After completing the extremely short campaign you will be able to afford The Box, a selection of 120 cards, and a number of reinforcement packs which are 12 cards each. After this it slows down considerably, with you being able to afford new packs of 12 every ~10 games roughly, and a new 120-card box after maybe 10-15 hours of play. Without spending a penny, I have always felt while playing that I am making constant progress with my deck, and slowly climbing through the ranks which is an enjoyable process that any cash-spender will unfortunately miss out on. The bottom line is that if you don't care about competing at the very top level of the game any time soon, spending money is not important.\n\nFinally I'd like to offer my take on some of the issues that other reviewers have expressed. The matchmaking is not a major issue. There are some players who keep their rating artificially low so that they have easy games to play. This is an annoyance, but I didn't experience it that much. And it's rare enough that you can enjoy the opportunity to play some advanced decks. There were also complaints about the game not being friendly to new players. Well, this is 100% true, but I think it's also true of almost every game with this amount of depth. If you are really serious about the game and want to know about every possible effect or combo then you are going to have to look at resources outside of the game. I would recommend for beginners to read Robvalue's Might and Magic: Duel of Champions FAQ over on gamefaqs. People who haven't played might want to read the section "Picking a faction" and then put it down and refer to other sections whenever you want to learn more.\n\nI give this game a rating of 1 surprised kitten and 3 weird looking dragon things.","November 26, 2013","true","694.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I'm not very good at it, unfortunately, but I enjoy it nonetheless. Each faction plays differently, and actually feels different. Haven is all about defence and healing, Inferno is speed and power, Stronghold is all about super powerful creatures, Necropolis has a good balance of everything paired with poisons and debuffs, Academy has a lot of comboing creatures and abilities with complex strategies, and Sanctuary has powerful tactical strengths, with creatures powering their neighbors up and working together to take opponents down. All in all, the game is great, if a bit difficult at times. The micro transactions are not actually necessary, but help a lot (they have two pack types you can get with in game currency that should meet basic needs, but the best decks pull from a variety of sets). I enjoy this game a bit more than Hearthstone honestly (part of that is the card variety, I think), but I still love Magic more.

It also teaches you about a bunch of mechanic and of how strong some cards can be (do not be afraid to make a deck specifically for the campaign and for).  Note that the campaign is open format.\n\n- The quest system is nice, it gives you 3 quest each day to do. If you don't do your daily quest one day you don't "lose" the next day's daily quest so you can skip one day if you don't feel like being too hardcore on the game. The next day's quest will be are given as you complete each quest that you had left.\n\n- This is a digital card game so cards are subject to change (which prevents most uninteractive combo decks from being played too long).\n\n- The Altar of Wishes is a place where you can exchange Wildcards for a specific card that you want.\n\n- The Infernal Pit is a place that allows you to sacrifice some of your cards to get some gold (recently you also get some Wildcards) and a chance to get the card the is shown (it changes every 8 hours). Note that it is possible to sacrifice enough cards to get to 100% chance to get the card and it is recommended.\n\nCons :\n- There is a refer a friend system that gives you a starting deck for each faction (you only choose one when you start) so don't forget to get a friend's referal code or just go on the forums and you should find someone's code or just ask. This will greatly help you with the infernal pit and to start out.\n\n- There is a lot of keywords and mechanics that you will need to learn in order to avoid mistakes which makes the game more a little bit like playing MTG except that after a month you should have seen all of the keywords.\n\n- Once you get enough cards you should not try to complete your collections, instead hold on to your gold until there is a promotion(sales on booster/selling special booster, ect...) or that you need cards to sacrifice to the pit for a card that you want. This is just a warning since I am not sure if it will happen again soon.\n\n- Open format is "unplayable" if you intend to keep playing for free as you will need more than the cards you can get at the infernal pit and from the campaign. To get more open cards from the shop you need to spend money to get them and the open format does not seem to get a lot of balance changes so I suggest that you stay away from open.\n\n- Edited: there are a lot of cards in each set and there are some chances that you will not get each of them after buying a lot of packs so you might not learn about the existence of some cards until you have played a lot (like in MTG).\n\nedited : to fix the last point and some typo.","October 4, 2014","true","288.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I was an old school Magic The Gathering player but wanted something new to play without collecting the real cards and the storage space it requires to be serious about game. I've enjoyed playing it for about a year now and have recommended it to all my ex Magic The Gathering buddies. I've tried almost every online card game and this is the one I stuck with.

I can say that this game is MOST tactical of all of them and can be recommended exactly for players that likes to use their mind to solve hard situations to make a big comeback. The game itself got pretty big card stock and they are releasing 100 card packs every 3-4 months so the game is refreshed almost everytime to prevent creating one OP deck.\n\nI must mention one other thing that grants another benefit towards the game. It's adding new uses of cards. With one of the expansions one new type of card appears it's called "building". It's pretty rare to see things like that happen inside tcg/ccg games so it's big plus becouse devs are working to IMPROVE the game as much as they can.\n\nThe game  isn't p2w, but there is pretty big obstacle that you need to pass before you can acquire your dreamed deck it's called "time". I mention about it becouse this game needs especially big amount of time to get what are you looking for, i mean after you finish campaign you have to buy packs for gold and it's pretty long to get enought amount ( match = 500-1000 gold). Devs added challenges but they are too pretty demanding to fullfil them.\n\nOverally, if you are looking for hard ,demanding game with upcoming improvements almost everytime you HAVE TO play this game. I can recommend it to both hardcore ccg players and newcommers to universe called digital collectible card games :)\n\nSee you in the game.","October 10, 2014","true","0.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttpisser69/recommended/256410/","buttpisser69","nerdfury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttpisser69/","59 products in account","I’m having strong mixed feelings giving this digital card game a thumbs down. The actual gameplay of DoC is excellent. I love the multiple-lane game board and making decisions such as “Hmm, should I sacrifice this lane in order to fully control that lane?”.  Wrestling board control away from my opponent is very dynamic - much more so than in Hearthstone. DoC has many layers of strategic depth, not only because of the multiple-lane game board but also due to the many varied play styles available.\n\nEach faction has a certain way of approaching battle, and within each faction, heroes have unique abilities (spells, and spell school access) which can facilitate very different play styles within one faction. For example, consider two heroes within one faction. As they’re from the same faction, the creatures they get access to are the same, but their spells may greatly differ. The hero with Light spell access is going to have a distinctly different approach to board control than the hero that casts Dark (Death) spells, as the former focuses on buffs while the latter focuses on direct creature removal. I truly loved this dynamic element of deck-building and gameplay, and I also loved that the game didn’t feel pay2win at all. I’ve never spent money on DoC and I felt like I had a competitive Haven deck at Champion II while playing fairly casually (i.e. not grinding for hours and hours each day). Of course, if you want many different competitive decks, prepare to grind or hasten the process of collecting by paying.\n\nSo – the gameplay itself is awesome. The lack of pay2win (in my opinion) is equally awesome. Then why am I giving DoC a negative review? Because I think the customer service level of Ubisoft is awful, and as a result, I can’t trust them. I think it’s a bad idea to put your trust and time behind a developer for a digital card game that is not transparent in its communication to its player base.\n\nMany weeks ago, a high number of players (including myself) reported an infinity loading bug in which you could not load into a regular “Standard” game -- the most popular game mode (the other game mode, “Open”, allows the use of very old cards which are not readily available without spending money, so of course Standard mode is what interests me and most other newer players). Obviously, this is a pretty critical bug, and the initial response from Ubisoft was extremely weak (“We’re aware of the issue but there’s not much we can do about it”). There has been no follow-up response nor has the bug been fixed, which is pretty dodgy in my opinion.

Wbrew temu co mówią ludzie, gra wcale nie rządzi się zasadą pay-to-win. Nawet bez dokupowania premium boosterków z kartami, nadal mamy możliwość uzbierania sobie wymarzonej talii wydając złoto zarabiane w trakcie potyczek.\n\nPatrząc na karty pomyślałem 'eh, klon MTG. Nawet Heros ma 20hp'. Ale wrażenie szybko minęło. Gra jest bardziej od MTG zorientowana na rozstawianie swoich wojsk na planszy podzielonej na osiem pól i na tworzeniu formacji. W czystej mechanice (nie wspomaganej efektami kart) nie mamy kontroli nad tym czy dany stwór blokuje i co blokuje (właściwie atakować może go tylko stwór umieszczony na planszy przed nim, a blokować musi zawsze). Nie doświadczymy też MTG-owych Landów i kolorowej many.\n\nNa początku gameplay wydawał mi się zdecydowanie bardziej ograniczony od MTG, gdzieś na pograniczu Heroes of Might and Magick VI i giganta Wizards of the Coast. Karty wydawały mi się nie posiadać sprytnych  i morderczych combo, ale po zarwaniu nocy na grze zmieniłem zdanie ;)\n\nKart na dzień dzisiejszy jest ponad 800 i ich liczba rośnie o kolejny standard deck i jak obecnie wynosiła tradycja 2 expansiony rocznie, co daje ponad 300 nowych kart co rok. Potyczki można grać w znanym z MTG formacie Standard obejmującym karty z ostatnich expansionów, lub open zawierający wszystkie edycje.\n\nOverall polecam.","July 21, 2014","true","128.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'd probably be higher up if I didnt keep changing decks xD But anyway to the review! I like the resource system so theres no way of getting mana screwed like in MTG and the battle grid gives a lot of tactical gameplay as you can sweep attack, charge and evade while using spells to affect rows and columns. The card art is very good as well and I never feel like I'm hopelessly outmatched when on PvP. Admittedly I sometimes don't win because I don't get the cards I need to win when I should of won but thats because I overfill my deck sometimes and thats noones fault but my own. All in all I prefer this game alot more to MTG which I played for about 3 years on and off but I can't get enough of this game!\n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10. The only way to improve it IMHO is to open a trade function between players but then the whole wildcard system would be defunct and I like to buy a pack or box when I can to support the developers.","January 5, 2014","true","115.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I figured there wasn't gonna be much for me to get into and it was a shallow experience at best. As time went on I realized that this game truly reprisents the concept of "easy to learn, hard to master". It sucks that 8 hours in and I'm already craving all the stuff I can't have for free...\n\nI feel this game's solid and if there was just a little more available for purchase in the store, for free, I could live with missing out on all the pay stuff. Hope that there's still enjoyment to have, for free, in another 8 hours of play.

If you have ever played a strategy card game before and even remotely liked it i highly recommend giving this a try.\nIt has a very good tutorial and is easy to learn but hard to master. Everything is possibly to earn in game so you are never forced to use the ingame market unless you choose too.\nThe cards art work is top class and makes collecting them a joy and with over 650 cards anyone that enjoys trying to collect them all will have there work cut out for them.\nDeck building is my favorite aspect of the game and with the right cards there is a limitless amount of strategy to be thought up.

But if you really wann play this game like a professional, you better get ready to empty your purse on fancy cards.\n\nI think most people who played for more than 10 hours would agree that it's simply not possible to just win a game (God, I mean even just a normal duel!) with poor cards and awesome strategies. YOU  MUST HAVE AWESOME CARDS!! And i'm afraid all the awesome cards must be bought with real money if you don't want to spend your llife time in this game and earn those in-game currencies.It's still a lota fun when you play with someone on about the same (card) level and who enjoys simple duels, but I'm afraid that doesn't happen too often when you level up or getting to higher than 500 ELO, which is in most cases as far as you can get without buying cards with cash.\n\nIt's a good game, if you have a good temper AND a lot of patience AND always accept your failures because other people simply spend more money but not more brain than you. I would say that this game has a lot of potential (a very good duel system afterall, except for the tournament part), if it's not designed to devour your savings that deliberately and hungrily, it'll definitely do better.","December 3, 2013","false","96.3"," 35 of 64 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","35","64","0","0"

Try it out, but only spend money if you're actually hooked by the gameplay.\n\nThe game sports an interesing lane system for creature attacks. Redeployment can be just as (if not more) important than attacking. The two rows allow for tactical positioning if you built your deck right.\n\nThe game consists of a 'campaign' component that pits your decks against quite a few computer-controlled opponents and their specific decks. They usually build up on a theme and thus become a kind of puzzle to be solved, partially in the deckbuilding and partially in actual play. There are also actual 'puzzles', i.e single-turn 'chess puzzles' that require you to find the right moves to win.\n\nThere is a story to the campaign I think, but not anything that seems worth following or remembering. It can be safely ignored.\n\nThe second component is the actual game, i.e. the different 1v1 game modes (against other players).\n\nThe game sports a considerable number of achievements that award you with different in-game items when first achieved.\n\nRegarding monetization: There are, as is usually the case for such F2P games, two types of currency available: The one you can earn with play and the one you have to buy with actual money. Card packs for the recent expansions are available with the earnable currency. However there is also the option of buying 'premium' packs, which consist of more rare cards than the regular packs.\n\nBalancing: Probably too early to tell, but I have so far found it to be mostly fair. I have only earned currency and cards through play so far and have fared pretty well,but I am not far into the game yet. I seem to win most of my matches against other players, but they will probably be on a similar level to me.\n\nSince it costs nothing but time to first try out I feel confident to recommend the game: If you're unhappy with the gameplay, you can stop without having wasted too much. I would definitely recommend against investing any money into it early. See if you like it, play for a few weeks, then consider whether you want to inject any actual money into it.","July 14, 2014","true","46.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Plus, standard format is the latest set of cards only, which you can solely buy for with real money (at least at the time when I stopped playing).\n\nIf you don't have a lot of friends playing the game who help you get the Achievements for what little free stuff there is anymore, you might end up feeling pretty lost. Another thing I found aggravating was the fact that the game lets you, for a hefty sum of premium currency, buy the World Champion's Deck - which pretty much guarantees you domination over other decks, assuming you know the base mechanics of how the game works.\n\nNot a bad game, mind you, fun in small doses. But there are way better, free TCGs out there that still have at least a semblance of care for their non-paying customers and the game's balance.","December 28, 2014","false","94.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

But as you play it more and go deeper into the latter part of the game, it fails to deliver.\nThe game is relatively easy to understand. Although its simple with respect to the learning curve, the game is quite complex when it comes to the strategies you can use. It offers you choices on type of strategy you wish to use, which I find to be a great positive feature. Of course to try these different strategies, you need the relevant cards, but more on that later.\n\nOne of the downsides of the game, as per my experience is that there is imbalance in duels. After playing a lot of them(currently level 7; approx 100+), I've noticed that very few duels are actually what I'd call a "close encounter". Most of the times, its easy for either player to gain a momentum from the beginning, which later on is impossible to deal with. Although, you can try the best, the card randoms always seems to favor one player more than the other, thus dealing him the better cards overall. Again, I'm speaking from my personal experience and yours may differ.\n\nNow, about the accumulation of cards thing, the game uses a micro-transaction payment model. It is pretty evident, that those willing to pay can gain a significant advantage in the game, going totally FTP(Free to play), requires you to spend a huge huge amount of time with the game, which is certainly not worth it, at the end. Moreover there is no trading system for players to trade their cards with other players. This makes getting the rare cards all the more difficult for a free player like myself.\n\nPros: Easy to learn, Vivid strategies, Well painter cards.\nCons: Requires you to spend a lot of time or a lot of money, late game progression is minimal for a free player, No card trading system.\n\nTL;DR\nFinal Verdict: This game is a great pass time, I suggest you try it out for fun and/or if you're bored and have nothing better to play. It will surely offer you with at least 20 hours of game play. But, surely not a good game to play for a longer duration, unless they improve on their cons.\n","November 25, 2013","true","31.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

It's a great way to spend some spare time and nothing feels better than drawing the ONE card that you needed to save you. But despite this, there's too much  downsides to the game that I just can't fully enjoy it.\n\nFirst off, I understand that the game is free-to-play and the dev's need a way to generate income, but the price of Seals is VERY high. Five dollars nets you a measly 250 Seals, while a card box costs 1200 Seals. But let's say you don't want to spend money and you'd much rather use the in-game Gold. Well, you CAN'T spend Gold on the latest packs; only the previous ones, which cost 18500-25000 Gold each (in my experience, I've earned 1000-2500 gold per game so you'd need to play around 15-20 games just to earn a single pack) and if you want the latest pack, you gotta cough up the Seals. There was an offer on the Featured page that said, "Earn up to 5 card packs if you buy Seals!" and when I went to look, the 5 card pack was only available if you bought $100 worth of Seals. Thanks, Ubisoft.\n\nTournament Mode is an absolute joke. Unlike actual dueling, there is NO ELO ranking for tournament mode. I joined one at an ELO rank of 220 and was matched against players with up to 1300~ ELO ranks. Needless to say, I was destroyed in about 6 turns. There is no reason to play Tournament Mode unless your ELO is in the thousands, even though you're given about 5 free tickets when you make an account.\n\nIf you want specific cards, your only options are to either pray you get them from the pack you buy every 15-20 games OR use Wildcards to get them. You earn one Wildcard (if you're lucky, two) from each pack you open and you can spend Wildcards to get specific cards in the Altar of Wishes. However, some cards cost up to 20 Wildcards so you'll need to open quite a few packs to get them. Let's say you manage to scrounge up the Wildcards you need and are finally ready to buy that card! Well, surprise surprise! Only the original card set is available to exchange for Wildcards unless you collect 200 cards from the other sets! So go back to farming even MORE gold to buy MORE packs until you earn 200 cards from those specific sets!\n\nI want to like this game; I really do, but I can't because so much of it is poorly implemented. I hate to use the word "Pay to Win", but in a game where someone with disposable income can just buy all the rare cards they want until they're better than the people who refuse to pay, there's nothing else to call it.","February 12, 2014","false","51.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","1"

On one hand, i feel rather helpless that knowing that once i had certain cards, i will be much more powerful, but u have to pay real money to buy packs and try ur luck, the other slower but free way is to log in everyday to get free gold/stuff and wildcards, eventually when u accumulated enough wildcards, u can get whatever card u want, but that could take several months.\n\nIf i compare this to my favourite CCG, Shadow Era, this game still pales in comparison to diversity in tactics, adding to the fact that in Shadow Era, u can get any individual card u want because u can buy it directly with ingame-earned gold, instead of buying packs.\n\nHowever, the plus side of Duel Of Champions, is the strategic element of positioning, lacking in many CCGs. Another awesome feature about this game are the Scenario Puzzles, last i know, you have to unlock them 1 by 1 with single player campaign though. To me, the puzzles are very good and test your problem-solving abilities. The puzzle will give you a preset scenario, preset cards, and give u only 1 turn against overwhelming odds, to survive and defeat your AI opponent, like you only have 1 life and opponent has 15 life, and you have to kill your opponent within 1 turn, YOUR TURN. It's possible, through several steps, the solution is usually not immediately obvious, and you have to try out different methods. You will feel smart when you manage to do that on your own without searching for hints.\n\nSo, my conclusion,\nIf Shadow Era is 9/10 (extremely diverse and encourages creativity, totally free to play)\nthen Duel Of Champions is 7/10 (need effort or money to buy your dream deck)\nand HearthStone is 6/10 (too simple and too many limitations for my liking)\n\nBut it's worth a try, you may like it.","May 12, 2015","true","72.2"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

Sadly it was ruined by very greedy design choices.\n\nWith the Base Set 2 expansion that was released in April 2014 we were told the game will be "more free to play".

This is crazy, DoC arrived to steam.\nExcellent strategic card game!\nIf you want to start the game with 6 decks follow my link at the end of the review.\n\nMy steam playtime is not representative at all, add 120h -raptr said so- since the anniversary of the game and third expansion (september 2013). And hundreds during beta in 2012. You can play for free as me with some good decks at level 25 or one good one sooner.\n\nWHAT'S ALL ABOUT?\nThe core of the game is duels with decks consisting on creatures you deploy on a battlefield to attack the rival and use of spells, fortunes and events to affect rival, creatures, part of the battlefield or the whole battlefield. All in all magic the gathering with a battlefield as you can see on the pictures. Strategically is far supperior to the new wow spin-off copying the battlefield idea. Which in fact existed already on other japanesse game which I forgot the game, yuggi oh maybe?\n\nGAMEPLAY\nDeck editor is not perfect but after the improvements it's much more usable and also the card package opening is cute, will make you feel as a kid opening a gift, it also marks the cards you don't have.\n\nYou fight other users or vs stupid IA during the campaign to learn the basics and get game currency. Note stupid IA doing wrong moves with good deck and advantage can defeat a noob user.\n\nThey implemented tournaments and installed the game into the e-sports world, the problem is that ubi is noob on this and have done some mistakes until now. They're improving, hope the devs get more investment from ubi and the game becomes as good as the potential it showed since the first beta. New cards expansion every four or six months (not remember now) will keep bringing new mechanichs and will make better the game. Also the spectator mode will come and they help everyone doing clan tournaments.\n\nAt this point of reading you should be convinced to download it and give it a go. It's free and you start with a basic deck and some card packages so you can taste the deck editor. Matchmaking will pair you with people that has your gaming level (not profile level) except in tournaments.\n\nPROMO CODES SYSTEM IS BACK ON STEAM CLIENT TOO\nYou can register through my referral[signup.duelofchampions.com], so you start with 6 decks and I will get a little part of what you earn/spend.\nIf you want codes that provide extra cards, just ask me and I will gladly tell you the still active ones.\nSpecially I think I have one or two codes that work only during the first 6 hours of registration so if you plan to start this game ask me BEFORE registering, to planify and get them. The previous promos ran out of keys:\n\n"grab a code here to get 120 cards (accounts with less than 6 hours)": old promos[eu.alienwarearena.com]\n\nBUYING ON STEAM THE DLCs OR INSIDE THE SHOP?\nDon't get the expensive dlcs, probably is better to spend money on the internal store so you get seals you can distribute as you wish. To maximize the impact of themoney buy seals when the company gift booster packs as reward, and spend the seals when there is a promo on the store.","November 7, 2013","true","450.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

At the beginning I was kind of lost and like any new game you need some time to understand, what the priorities of the game are.\n\nAlso whats important: you dont need to pay anything. Everything is accessble throu achievments and "Gold" or "Seals" wich are easily earned by simply playing the game. Of cause the choise is yours. You can spend real money to get to your goal faster but in my opinion, this is not neccesery. Since there a system that lets you play along other players wich have a similar Elo (Elo - determants your  streangth in battle)\n\nI can highly recomend this game if you like card games. Its fun, frustating, smart and it makes you hooked. For me thats a perfect combination cause there is nothing more boring, than a game that is too easy or too hard.\n\nI hope this will help you in your choise and enjoy creating your own deck of cards :)\n\nBest\nThe Smile","February 18, 2014","true","114.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

And if you choose to stay, and most likely you will, because its a very funny game and nobody wants to surrender, you're doomed. People who know Magic the Gathering will know what im talking about, with the only difference, that DOC does NOT support trading.\n\nYou will have to achieve your cards by drawing!\nAnd epic cards are VERY hard to get.\n\nI still am feeling bad every day for having paid so freaking much money for nothing, couldnt even compete with the good players, and dont get a single penny back.\n\nDo yourself a favour and !dont! play this game...","March 24, 2014","false","159.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","2"

Unlike many of its competitors, the available space on the battlefield is limited to a 4x4 grid split in half between you and your opponent: the key to victory lies in the correct positioning and movement of your own creatures, and it is often possible to defeat the enemy hero while his creatures are  still on board.\n\nCreatures and heroes are related to one of the factions available, which is six as of the expansion Griffin Bane; there are also some neutral creatures that can be used by any hero, but they have either very specific uses, or are meant to be used as filler until you earn better creatures of a certain faction. Still, once you have unlocked heroes of other factions, expect to fight and use a wide variety of cards; just like any other card game, it's up to you to discover what's userful and what is not for your decks.\n\nThe economic model has been the cause of many controversies in the past, but after much twiddling Ubisoft has finally managed to create a system that works for them and for us both. There are  two  three currencies available: you earn Gold as you play (even more if you actually manage to win), and you spend it to buy packs for the Standard format (the newest and the most relatively balanced, it is composed of Base Set 2, Heart of Nightmares and Griffin Bane).\n\nSeals, on the other hand, are a premium currency mostly available through real money. Seals can buy you anything from any previous set, and hasten up the creations of decks immensely by giving you Wildcards. The Open format allows you to play with any cards you have, just don't expect it to be balanced in the slightest.\n\nApart from achievements or seals-bought packs, you'll start earning Wildcards by completing daily quests once you reach Champion I level. If you don't like the quest, simply forfeit it to recieve another one. You can exchange Wildcards to get specific cards in the Altar of Wishes. This is the most reliable way to get rare cards.\n\nAchievements and daily quests will earn you quite a lot of gold, but the first thing you should aim to complete is the PvE campaign. It is very generous with the rewards, and every mission can be completed once again with each faction for the same reward.\n\nAdditionally, you will want to insert these codes in the ingame shop to earn some free goodies. Just go to the shop and click on the Redeem Code button.\n\nCD-Action-Play-MMDoC (2 BS2 packs)\nTH4NK5-70K-D0C-F4CEB00K-L3G1ON (2 HoN premium packs)\n\nLastly, you can use my referral link to get six heroes of all different factions.\nhttps://signup.duelofchampions.com/portal/index/DOC_world_02_0010_06_200_12_0614_00♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LUILUH","August 6, 2014","true","72.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The matches are one sided, to say the least, and it becomes clear that you've reached a fork in the path.  Do you spend the money or stop playing.  I will say that the prices are comparable with what RL cards go for.  To get the cheapest booster pack will run $5 and that gets you 2 12 card packs.

There are a ton of cards with many, many interesting mechanics and abilities. The typical cardgame gameplay is mixed up with the positioning on the board which makes for a cool twist as does the event system. The artwork is good, in parts even spectacular.\n\nSadly there is so much bad to outweigh the good.\n\nSince this is a F2P game it has of course a daily login bonus, some daily quests and the option to buy additional cards for money. Those are a given in this day and age and I willingly put up with it since the game itself looks so promising. But the developers decided to make only the most recent of the editions buyable for the ingame currency. So a good portion of the cards is out of reach for all free players. Sure, you get the occasional booster for an achievement but thanks to the randomness of those boosters that's not enough to build a solid cardpool.\nThere are two additional ways to gain cards one might otherwise not see. The Infernal Pit where you sacrifice unneeded cards and the Wildcard mechanic. Both are pretty awesome but again not enough to mitigate the disadvantage one automatically gets for not paying.\nIn my opinion, a paying player should get his cards at a faster rate, of course, but almost every F2P game goes way overboard with this idea. As a result this bleeds the free player portion away relatively fast and soon there are only some paying dudes left which is not a healthy playerbase.\n\nThen there is the lacking Steam support. MMDOC is a game by Ubisoft and thus requires the player to have an account in their uPlay system. This was annoying enough by itself. But now for some reason they did not update the Steam achievements when they overhauled the whole system ingame. As a result I have some achievements ingame that are not available in Steam whilst I'm missing some on Steam that are not even existant anymore in MMDOC.\nThis reeks of either incompetence or a disregard for a polished product. Or both.\n\nSince I finished every singleplayer activity I have nothing else to do but to play against other players. Which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for a couple of issues.\n\n1) The balancing is bad. 3 or 4 out of five games my opponent will play Necropolis. Since this is only one of six factions that's a pretty telling sign. It is also the one faction I (and maybe many others) don't want to play against. It has more annoying mechanics than the other five factions combined. At a high level of gameplay where everybody and their mom has an optimized deck Necropolis might not even be overpowered. But at the low-medium end it is just not fun to play against.\nAs a general rule of thumb, if you build a deck and include only the most unpleasant cards you possess, chances are you built the strongest deck you can. I'm not talking raw power here. Rather mechanics that are the equivalent to giving your opponent the bird. Necropolis cards are only the most obvious example but it applies to the rest, too.\n\n2) The playerbase is divided into several ranks which reflect your skill and the effectiveness of your decks. When you win a certain number of times you rank up. The only way to avoid this is to lose games. If you don't want to rank up and are about to win, you have to forfeit your game. Once you reached a higher rank there is no way to decrease it. I am now sitting at rank 5 or so (Lord Commander) and have no way of going back. Since I reached Lord Commander my percentage of wins has decreased significantly. Before it was at ~50% which is where it should be if I and my opponents are evenly matched. Now it is way, way below 50%. So it takes me forever to finish my daily quests. And I can't do anything about it. Yeah, that's fun!\n\nI spent a lot of time playing MMDOC and at the beginning it was a pretty good ride. The longer I play it though the more it becomes upsetting. Thanks to my achilles heel (achievements) I'll stay on it for a while longer but I don't expect much happiness to come from this.","July 27, 2015","false","316.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But i can review the game mechanics a bit from the standpoint of a CCG (Collectible Card Game).\n\nLoss of game complexity for the sake gameplay simplicity and shorter learning rate was never a good concept for CCG in my opinion. games like this one should be more complex. they are all quite the same even if a few mechanics are different from the rest.\nI like CCG and think virtual CCGs are great game genre for a fair progression based system, but most importantly the game needs trading. Else its almost for sure a pay to win title, because there would be no other solution for the publisher to make some cash other then to sell cards or fancy cosmetics items. i know only about very few online CCG's that allow trading. i think MTG Online has some sort of trade, Urban Rivals and Scrolls. This is not a nice feature, its a godda.mn must have.\n\nMight and Magic isn't the best universe to make a CCG from anyway, and i think its very suspicious that every major publisher suddenly has needs for a CCG. All of course with minimal player win / maximal publisher win principle. No trade, simple mechanics, too easy to learn, themed with thier own franchise makeing them a different form of advertising. Imagine yourself watching tv and insead of a break you have to play a "how i met your mother" CCG for the show to continue. (:D could become the next big thing in future entertainment. The Touch-TV hahahaha)\n\nI know about the problems a trading in such games can have. players could exchange cards between 2 accounts they both own. In my opinion a level that you have to reach would be nice to prevent abuse. But in from another point of view i can't care less if a goon has 10000 cards, he should be ranked differently anyway at that point. and why even care? because its not fair?! lots of things are not fair. Its not fair if you have lvl 30 and get rap.ed by lvl XY Rouges & Druids in World of Blizzard Dung.\n\nBtw Blizzard's Hearthstone is a fine example how you should not make such a game. Games against friends don't give any benefits, the progression takes the hell of a time, the dynamic map and fancy buildings to click on are not making the game a good game in any form and the warcraft theme only applies to those who like it (unfortunatly too many). And as i recall they always had like 10 years to create thier ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games, but a moba and virtual CCG together are made in 5 month. Mobas btw are exact the same thing. LOTR MOBA, BLIZZARD MOBA, EA MOBA.....\n\nDota 1 & 2, League of Legends, Heroes of Newearth and Bloodline Champions are ok in that manner i suppose, but dota was a mod and it took like 10 or more years to make this mod into a game. its nothing new its just recooked food. I Love Dota 2 its awesome the rest is not my taste. LoL, for me, is just Nika "Nikasaur" Harper, a person that should be shot on sight for random totalitarian reasons.\n\nBack to Might & Magic: DoC i see things which could be cool but were flopped. like the the daily reward. it sucked sooo much! who the hell wants to be the slave of this game... logging in every day or failing your gift. i failed to pick it up on day 7 and never touched the game again. sure you can choose if you come in tomorrow or not, if you fail you wont get anything though. For a random CCG i just wanted to try a bit, it just didn't suffice. if you play those games you have to be dedicated or you will never have the full featured game sensation. You just have to be a fan that would love to get ra.ped by some gay manager of the product you so blindly love, because else you would be unable to be so close to the makers of your favorite thing, what the hell ever it is.\n\nLove is the missing link here. These games have none what so ever, they even stink putridly from the money they sooo desperately try to make.\n\nI recommend post-natal abortion!","April 13, 2014","false","2.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

It's got a great reward system for early players to increase there card count and give them a chance to build new decks, as well as daily rewards for veteran players to earn new cards through game play. As long as you go into it knowing that people who have played for a long time or play a lot are going to have a more robust card collection than you (which will yield a certain advantage) you will not be disappointed. Honestly I've found that being a smarter player will usually trump a deck with better cards.\n\nMy advice if you start playing: check the forums for how you can earn cards. There are lots of little tricks to getting more cards/the cards you want.","May 26, 2015","true","016.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

I've spent enough on magic cards to know not to play an online version after spending hundreds on cards. But I thought hey, it can't be that bad, for new players even. NO, ranked matches, be prepared to get squashed. All the matches I have played have been with inferno players, so I'm going to assume that inferno is the ultimate race in this free game. I also don't see how they think me being lv 1 with very little choice of cards have any chance against a completed fire deck. And I don't see why the campaign requires you to face these OP players online. I know how to play the game, and I am good at it, but this does not feel like the real game. So yeah P2W, I don't care if I will be missed or not, cause this game does not have the feeling it does IRL, I will probably try Hearthstone.

It makes you think hard about your actions to the point where you're pondering the turn you're in the and turn to come. Choosing between moving and attacking can decide victory or defeat, hinging on knowledge and foresight. The factions are well-varied enough to make each one feel like a different kind of experience every time you switch. Plus getting achievements usually yield some type of reward like a card, sometimes a pack, in-game currency or just unlocking a new feature.\n\nHowever...in usual form, Ubisoft is trying it damndest to make sure they mess up the experience by overcharging on everything and messing with your money. The packs are far too overpriced for what they offer and it feels especially galling when you buy a pack and end up with mostly common cards UNLESS you buy the special packs with the paid currency, then you're guaranteed "premium" cards whereas the packs bought with in-game currency you only have a 1-in-6 chance.\nSpeaking of the paid currency, they try and make it so you always have some of it left over, just under the amount you need to buy another pack, so you always have that messing with your head. If you do the math you cannot help but feel like they purposely priced the packs so you always just don't have enough to finish off your seals or are left with just enough to where you can't hope to do anything with the remainder. Doesn't help that with this last update there's even less things in the store to buy with the in-game currency, the old starter packs seemed to have gotten shoved off into the void.\nAnd just for the sake of my own gripe the practice A.I. couldn't be more obvious with the fact that it cheats if it was playing with it's deck face-up and spread out over the table. I have too many examples of times where I'm getting a card's use negated before I even play it or my new-found advantage turns into a complete board wipe.\nAs it stands I cannot. in good faith. recommend this game. It can be quite addictive but Ubisoft's greed shines through and ruins the experience. Better priced packs or regular sales might get me to look upon this game with more favor but if I know Ubisoft like I think I do, that's not likely to happen unless the game starts failing on it's own due to lack of interest.","July 11, 2014","false","207.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","1"

Everything else now requires seals?!  :(\n\nAside from the obvious, this sucks becuase now there are many many players that had a MUCH EASIER time building tough decks (pre latest update) than any newcomer to the game (unless they want to plough some cash into it) so they have a much tough challenge ahead of them in pvp - an instant disadvantage.\n\nNow, I'm not against paying for games, I often do put a little hard earned cash into the games I play to spice them up or sometimes I'm just swayed to purchase purely because I love the work and want to support the developers...\n\nNow one of my previous gripes was how you started to feel the pinch of playing for free as you got higher and higher in rank, It was obvious that the dynamicly changing ranking system at the time was designed intentionally this way by making it possible for level 5's to play level 20's+ purely because they hit a few a winning streaks and their rank went up... hence, players would quite quickly start to feel they needed better and better cards faster and faster!  BUT this was still passable, and I continued to play regardless of this irritation..  BUT now I feel like this pinch and need to spend money is placed on the players right from the get-go.\n\nWell, as much as I was enjoying this game previsouly, I'm removing this game out of principle.\n\nTo be honest, I'm pretty sad to see it die, and also pretty disgusted.","April 9, 2014","false","78.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

The mechanics of the game are suitably "digital" in terms of taking advantage of a new medium, but beware, even 3 or 4 sets in, this game is anything but balanced.\n\nThe problem with playing free is that this is very much a pay to play game with packs costing an amazingly high amount and most things not being purchasable through the more commonly available gold currency.\n\nThe cards that are good are just insanely powerful, and the row-based combat only seeks to make that worse as opponents with powerful collections fill them with unkillable opposing creatures.\n\nIf you plan to play for free, then you are going to find the rewards few and far between, 3 campaigns to this point are the most rewarding participation I have found so far, and in direct combat with opposing players, I have found that people are either loaded with cards and apparantly not good enough to maintain a real rating or people tank their rating to farm players with smaller collections in order to level up quicker. The grind for cards is very long and very tedious. Worst still, it's very hard to get in to a deck you like since we are talking about 20-30 dollars to get one of the premade decks with the hero for the class you want.\n\nIf you plan to pay to play, I might suggest a better digital card game in the realm of hearthstone or a more "tangible" product like Magic Online where at least you can turn your investment in to real card if you do it right.\n\nI would recommend this as a free-to-play diversion for the campaigns and not much else.","December 5, 2013","false","13.5"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

It is dangerously close to becoming pay-to-win especially after the later patches.\n\nWhen the game was first released, players got gold and "seals" (a unique in-game currency). With gold you purchase packs containing basic preset cards with few unique ones, or you can buy the basic starter packs of other races. With seals however, you can purchase the advanced packs with more unique and epic cards. At release, the game provided players with gold and seals as a daily or weekly log-in reward. So you can take advantage of the seals if you are an early player\nTHEN at some point, they patched the game and NOW you only get a few seals when level up 10 times. So all those powerful seal packs can only be bought with actual money right now... (you pay money to get more seals)\n\nYou can still have fun for the first 15 level ups or so, perhaps try your hand with multiple unique heroes and races... but as soon as you bump into the early players, there's just no piercing through with skill alone. Since they got all the seals and acquired more unusual and dynamic cards that the rest of us will take ages to get to!\n\nMost of my gold income comes from ranked duels right now. And most of my cards come from buying with in-game gold, level-up and the OCCASIONAL achievement (you have to win and achieve some unusual/impossible victory conditions). 8 packs are available for gold purchase, and 6 of them contain only the basic starter decks for each of the 6 races >> This leaves only 2 packs which might POSSIBLY earn you advanced cards! So if my level reaches that of the early players, I won't be able to progress further unless I pay money to catch up with their crazy unique card combos! Otherwise, I will have to grind and lose for an eternity...\n\nOther than that, the races are pretty well balanced overall, and that is truly remarkable. You can even play with purely nuetral monsters/cards and still be competitive. Oh well, since it's free to play, I can't complain too much. But as soon as I start going against the early players, I might as well just ignore the game forever.\n\nI ONLY recommend this game to fans of card games in general, or if you are a fan of the Might and Magic series like myself...

So here are my main thoughts after 10 hours play.\n\nFor the HOMM fans, the lore and artwork and creature / building / spell names are taken right out of the 6 strategy games, so you will feel right at home with that. I had played some Magic The Gathering, but always became bewildered at the sheer amount of cards available - not to mention problems with compatibilty of decks. With Duel of Champions you don't have to worry about that. Sure there are far less cards (around 670 split between the 6 factions) but you certainly have enough to make multiple decks of each faction or even a dual deck. The gameplay is fast and easy to learn but hard to master. I won about 20 of my first 30 games and this allowed me to buy, with in game money, a handful of reinforcement packs and also 3-4 powerful cards to beef up my deck. My winning streak continues and it's great fun. As I am going up in ELO the players are becoming more challenging but that is all part of the fun.\n\nA word about money, because I read some negative things on Steam Reviews concerning this. You are given a free deck of your chosen faction at the start with everything you need to play. After playing the tutorial and the first single player campaign (an extended tutorial really) you are given A LOT of free money. After leveling up (which happens fast at the beginning) you are given MORE free money, plus wildcards. Earning some easy to get achievements in PVP games will net you even MORE MONEY and free reinforcement packs and even wildcards. So in short, if you add all that up - you could afford to make a very strong deck within about 2-3 days without spending a dollar of real money. I'm sure that as you advance through the ranks in PVP you will hit a point where you might be tempted to buy some extra cards, and this game is very good and why should you not support the developers a little? I liked it so much I bought cards to the cost of about an average in-store game and ended up with FOUR DECKS and about 20 epic creatures. Needless to say I'm competitive now.\n\nSome things do need improving. The general UI and it would be nice if the game made use of an HD resolution to it's full potential - something here seems that the PC version wasn't thought out enough after they made the I-PAD version.

You can only meet players by running in to them in a random matchup.\nCards cannot be traded.\nIf you want good cards, you have to either put in hours and hours of dedication, or empty your wallet.\n\n\nOverall -\n\nI would recommend giving this game a try, if you like turn-based card games. It is easy to learn, and fun to play. It's also great if you get a friend in to it, and you two can build up your decks to face off against eachother. However, I would NOT recommend spending cash on the game. The amount of cards you get for the amount of cash you spend is very unreasonable, and you'll end up spending a ton of money, for a chance at a good card.","March 21, 2014","true","255.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So here are my main thoughts after 10 hours play.\n\nFor the HOMM fans, the lore and artwork and creature / building / spell names are taken right out of the 6 strategy games, so you will feel right at home with that. I had played some Magic The Gathering, but always became bewildered at the sheer amount of cards available - not to mention problems with compatibilty of decks. With Duel of Champions you don't have to worry about that. Sure there are far less cards (around 670 split between the 6 factions) but you certainly have enough to make multiple decks of each faction or even a dual deck. The gameplay is fast and easy to learn but hard to master. I won about 20 of my first 30 games and this allowed me to buy, with in game money, a handful of reinforcement packs and also 3-4 powerful cards to beef up my deck. My winning streak continues and it's great fun. As I am going up in ELO the players are becoming more challenging but that is all part of the fun.\n\nA word about money, because I read some negative things on Steam Reviews concerning this. You are given a free deck of your chosen faction at the start with everything you need to play. After playing the tutorial and the first single player campaign (an extended tutorial really) you are given A LOT of free money. After leveling up (which happens fast at the beginning) you are given MORE free money, plus wildcards. Earning some easy to get achievements in PVP games will net you even MORE MONEY and free reinforcement packs and even wildcards. So in short, if you add all that up - you could afford to make a very strong deck within about 2-3 days without spending a dollar of real money. I'm sure that as you advance through the ranks in PVP you will hit a point where you might be tempted to buy some extra cards, and this game is very good and why should you not support the developers a little? I liked it so much I bought cards to the cost of about an average in-store game and ended up with FOUR DECKS and about 20 epic creatures. Needless to say I'm competitive now.\n\nSome things do need improving. The general UI and it would be nice if the game made use of an HD resolution to it's full potential - something here seems that the PC version wasn't thought out enough after they made the I-PAD version. I hear they are addressing this very shortly. But apart from the odd cosmetic problems, that's really all I can think of.\n\nSo come be a powerful hero, raise an army and see if you can advance through the ranks with us. It takes less than 30 seconds to find a game at any time of the day.","April 3, 2014","true","227.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Deep, strategic, and dynamic, i love it. Better than Magic, for me.\nI won't describe all its mechanics here, just give it a shot, playing is better than words.\n\nAnyway, I have to warn you.\nIf you want to play casually, like a-little-duel-with-cocktail-on-the-beach, it is perfect.\nBut if you wanna play after 500Elo (ranking), be aware that you'll need to buy cards with real money, even if the game gives you gold and seals (campaign/duels/daily reward). These "gifts" won't be enough against optimised decks, unless you are the patient type and buy wisely your packs/boxes.\n\nThe reality is that with little investment, plus the level/achievements' awards, and a fully working brain, you can have a great long term fun on this MoM DoC, without spending that much money.\n\nAnd a good deck is not a "Only-Epic" one, like some people said here.\nFor example, my best one contains only 2 epic on 59 cards, and the other cards aren't that rare, or WildCard expensive.\nAnd it works. So well ^^\n\nSee you on MoM DoC !","January 1, 2014","true","428.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you have ever played Magic: The Gathering, I can guarantee you that you will love this.\n\nThe rules are, you pick a faction, get a hero, and have to keep your hero alive every match while killing other heroes with other monsters. Sounds simple, right? The thing that makes this card game more complex and addictive is that there are loads of cards, combos and strategies to choose from. Plus, with the new Griffin Bane update, it is better than ever, with at least a few more heroes for each faction.\n\nThere are 6 factions in the game, each with its own style of gameplay: Haven, Inferno, Necropolis, Sanctuary, Stronghold and Academy. Each has different cards which can turn the tide in your favour. For example, Necropolis decks can focus on killing others and bringing your dead back to life; Inferno decks can attack right from the first turn; you get the idea.\n\nOverall, it is a great game. A full 10/10.","July 9, 2014","true","49.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/encourage/recommended/256410/","encourage","Encourage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/encourage/","133 products in account","This is legitimately a fun online card game.  It plays fairly quickly but there is enough variety in cards that deck building is pretty fun.  The game has a free-to-play model, but the "only thing you get from spending money is the ability to collect rare cards more quickly.\n\nThe game has the basic card advantage, board control, and tempo mechanics you would expect from any Magic-like card game.  The hooks for this game are:\nthat the board has a grid so that you have to position your monsters to block each other.\nthere is a front line and back line to the grid, so creatures can protect each other.\nspells and effects hit locations on the grid, so positioning has a whole meta game to its self.\nyou play with a hero/commander card that changes how your deck plays and gives you special abilities.\nyou have three attributes (might=creatures, magic=spells, fortune=tactics) and you raise one each turn.  Every card requires a certain level of at least one attribute.  So if you want to play a 6 might creature on turn six, you will have to put off playing a 6 magic spell or 6 fortune tactic until late in the game.\nThe nice thing about this game is that you get 99% of your cards through random packs and about 1% through a special store that lets you pick any single card you want for a very rare currency you can't buy directly.  There is no marketplace or website where everyone just buys the most powerful cards, so everyone has access to different cards (especially different rare cards) and almost no one has all the cards.  This means everyone has a slightly different deck.  It reminds of Magic before it got to the point where everyone just looks up the strongest deck lists online and buy the exact cards they need off Amazon or something.\n\nIf I were to compare it to Magic, I would say that there are fewer ways to win but the creature combat has more depth which mostly compensates for that.  There are seven or so factions but you can't combine them with other factions.  There are about seven schools of magic spell cards and you hero card will determine which one(s) you can use in your deck.\n\nThe way the game is set up, you get a lot of cards early on--you get free starter decks for each faction just by beating someone else playing that faction, and then you get a lot of the game's free currency to buy packs with from completing campaigns.  You can get access to most of the common and uncommon cards that you will want fairly easily without spending money.  The game tries to make money off you by selling you better packs with more rare, legendary, and heroic cards for money.  However, you will get new cards for free pretty steadily until you play through all the campaign games with all seven factions, so that will give you plenty of time to decide if the game is worth spending real money.  They also sell limited-edition alternate art packs for holidays and such.","November 11, 2014","true","572.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

I'll speak to them and they'll tell me some story about how they were awake at night and had this idea, or it came to them in a dream or something, and well, I do the exact same ^^\n\nAnyway, I don't know if I can really recommend new casual players to start this game. Truth is it's probably going to be annoying as hell to start playing now, but I would give it a try.","April 21","true","979.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970488031/recommended/256410/","76561197970488031","twopounder","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970488031/","338 products in account","An interesting take on the Heroes of Might and Magic universe, Duel of Champions falls short of capturing the allure of Magic: The Gathering. DoC contains both fresh and well known card game mechanics. Anyone who has played a traditional card game will feel comfortable with elements like deck building, color/theme binding (white = angels and healing, red = spells and demons, green = creatures and elves, etc), and player life count.\n\nHowever, the actual game play mechanics differ quite a bit. Instead of utilizing resource cards that you play, your total resource pool (mana) increases automatically each turn. This prevents the annoying "mana screw" that permiates traditional card games. Each card requires one or more of your heroes static abilities to be a certain level (more on heroes further down). The different abilities are Might, Magic and Destiny. So a creature may cost 3 resources to put onto the battlefield, but you must have at least 2 might in order to play it. These stats are not "used" or expended, but a simple static threshold that you must meet in order to play more powerful cards.\n\nThe board is not dynamic like traditional card games. You have one hero, a deck, and a discard pile as normal. However, you can only have 8 creatures at any given time - 4 in your back row (archers) and 4 in your front row (melee). Flying units can occupy either row, making them more flexible. While this prevents armies swelling with thousands of tokens, it also means you have to be very careful about which units you deploy - too many cheap units and you won't have any more room for your powerful creatures.\n\nHeroes - Duel of Champions revolves around the idea of the hero card. You can only have one hero, selected when you build your deck, and they are always in play. The hero contains your life total and is the focus of attacks during the game. If your hero has 0 or less life, you lose the game. Each turn, the hero can use one of their special abilities. By default, every hero can increase one of their stats (might, magic, or destiny) by 1. The majority of heroes can also pay 1 resource to draw a card. However, the rare heroes have further special abilities at their disposal.\n\nHeroes compare best to Planeswalkers from MtG, except you always have the hero you select and losing them means losing the game.\n\nUnlike the Heroes of Might and Magic series, there are not artifacts to collect or equip. Each hero starts out at level 0 at the beginning of every game, and experience only serves to effect your Elo rating.\n\nFree-to-Play: on the Pay-to-Win scale, I'd rate this at about 9/10. Not surprising, considering it's supposed to be a collectible card game. However, this element is made far worse by three things:\n\n1) It's a collectible card game, not a trading card game. That means you are unable to trade any of your cards - not for gold/seals or to other players.\n\n2) Premium packs give you special tokens that can be traded for specific cards. While free packs have a very, very small chance of giving you these tokens, it would take you months of playing to get enough tokens to trade in. Thus, people who pay in can take elite cards that free players have little to no access to.\n\n3) Each new expansion set is much more powerful than the last, so whoever drops $50+ is going to have a very distinct advantage over players with older cards.\n\nAt a glance, the game seems cheaper than card games, with a $5 purchase netting ~3 booster packs. However, the inability to trade anything you find makes 90% of the cards worthless. Similar to MtG, you can only have 4 of any type of card in your deck, so you'll quickly end up with piles of useless commons that you can't get rid of or use.\n\nMultiplayer Only - Despite the initial apearance of single player missions, there are a total of about 20 missions (including 5 training missions), that don't really tie into any kind of tangible story. They really amount to an extended tutorial and are only worthwhile for the gold and seals it gives you. If saved and used during a sale, you get enough for one premium and one regular card box (around 250 cards) and enough tokens to trade for a single hero card.\n\nGraphics - I'm usually kind to smaller or indie games in this regard. However, DoC was created first and formost for the ipad. They did nothing more than port it over to PC, so expect tiny fonts, and a barely usable deck builder. Full screen mode simply adds a larger border and keeps all the content the same size. This must be the single most frustrating part of the game.\n\nSummary - While the game is fun (though desperately needs balance), the inability to trade cards with other players and the necessity to pay money for the newer card sets to have an even playing field subtracts substantially from the game's allure. Simply adding a trade mechanic (similar to how steam trading cards work) would go a very long way to fixing the game and keep non-paying and low-paying players interested. Also, without any way to trade, you're just throwing your money into a static board game, not investing into a community driven collectible game.\n\nAt it stands, only people with a decent amount of disposable income and extra time to kill will enjoy this game. Everyone else will probably find too little for the cost of admission.\n\nFinal Score - 5/10","November 26, 2013","false","6.7"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kattanaita/recommended/256410/","kattanaita","Kattanaita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kattanaita/","152 products in account","I just recently started playing, so I did not suffer the sudden change from regular Seal rewards to only Gold, which are basically the currency of the game - Seals are used for the better/more expensive stuff. When I started the game, you could only easily get seals by using your real money. And I did. And I'm stupid. The noob-trap alert was apparently off at that time.\n\nI spent about $75 to get the cards that I wanted. I built my own deck that took me days to put togehter... and so far I have lost 15 times in a row. I'm not very smart, I give you that, but damn, if I think I wasted too much money to get a handful of cards I thought were good, but in fact are s**t compared to the cards they have, how much money must have they spent on it? It's not only greedy, but it favors old time (rich) players - "f*** you for taking an interest in our game, you should have done that years ago."\n\nThe most infuriating thing is that it limits how much of it you can play in the Campaign. There's a stupid requirement to win at least 5 publich matches before you can play the second chapter of the campaign. Not the final chapters, no... the second one! The one before that you have to only play a public match, but for this one you have to win them. When is that gonna happen? Who knows. I understand it's free to play and you need to coax people to buy cards, but if they do, couldn't you simply unlock the Campaign chapters because we were dumb enough to spend our money in this? I'm super butthurt, definitely, because I want to play the other options the game offers (since I'm too dumb to play the regular one), but I can't. YOU HAVE TO WIN. Well, I suck at life, so I guess I should go jump off a nearby bridge or something -- can't win 5 fakkin' public matches. Wow, that's one fine loser. And playing with your friends does not count. What, you want it easy? Think this is what, a game? No fun for you, mister; nope, not at all. Go lose to those better players, that's the only thing you're good for after all. Give them some easy ranks.\n\nThe cherry at the top of the cake is exactly that: I spent what I consider to be a fortune on this game to build a simple, cool deck to play casually, but all my matches were with people using some pro strats -- GO PRO OR GO HOME . The game has interesting mechanics, a good design and the artwork is pretty nice too. But the payoff is ridiculous and the options are limited. For such expensive cards, you could at least have a more elaborate public profile where you could display your favorite/most precious cards so the world could see how stupid you are for working your ♥♥♥ off for something that has no real tangible value. "Hey, I'm too dumb to use this card, but doesn't it look lovely on my profile? LOOK AT IT!" Maybe this is focused on championships and whatnot, but really, is it that hard to find people who only play for fun?\n\nAs a new player, I reiterate: it's not only pay to win. It's pay a lot to win, because if you don't, you're paying to lose. And I am so proud of myself for doing that... I could just simply murder myself with joy.\n\nYou gain some gold (that allows you to buy common packs only) and experience for losing as well, but, really, who will remain motivated after losing time and time again? Unless you want to spend a lot of time and money building devastating strategies to win championships, I don't see why anyone would play this game. I'll make an effot to keep playing it till I can at least finish the damn campaign, otherwise I'll hate myself forever for spending money on a game aimed at such a specific niche I clearly am not part of. Ooh, I hate myself so much right now.","August 14, 2014","false","50.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Mechanics are diverse, cards are truly beautiful. The client is just ok, sometimes it lags, sometimes it crash (even when you open a card pack that maybe you have even payed for and that's really grievous); the same (client) feature just decent graphics and sounds, but the battleground is just mediocre. You can play it for free since the game sort people by calculating their relative skill level, so generally you will not find an opponent much stronger (or weaker) than you. You can climb the ranking by buying some card packs or box set (better the latter) having the chance to acquire better cards but you can acquire them even spending the actual currency (Gold) inside the game. You can acquire Gold by fighting against your opponents or completing quests and when you have enough you can buy some card packs.\n\nThere is a single player campaign but it's limited so you will want early to play it in a multiplayer fashion and face human opponents. The community is strong but Factions are a bit unbalanced, Inferno is the strongest at the top of the ranking (and the easiest to play) and Necropolis is the strongest at the bottom, but other Factions are (just) playable too, simply not so competitive.\nThere are various ways to play the game (even without too much committment) and there are tournaments held continuosly.","January 1, 2015","true","664.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even with intro decks you can have a very involving duel, and this game starts you off with several decks and gives a lot of stuff for free before you need to start using your own money.\nOne of my favorite card games ever. If it was to make it big and muster a mighty community, I'd love to dive head first into it. I wish it had Hearthstone's arena gamemode however, it'd be sick, but I can understand that a not-so-popular game can't afford to give away such resources.","January 3, 2015","true","97.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The new referral System will help entering the game, but the economic system is so unbalanced that ranked duels will soon reach the point of being unbearable. Bad deck progression will naturally leading with a sour taste in the mouth, because the mechanics are interesting at least.\nHoping for a turnaround by the Devs on the economic system, but they've been too much silent about this for the last year.","June 19, 2014","false","43.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But after several matches you just realize that It's really not that exciting, especially when you have one deck and no cards to tweak it with. Even after getting some of the other decks it just feels bland and boring, and even though there are a lot of strategy involved, the game just feels more or less like a snore-fest.\n\nBut it doesn't stop here, in order to get a decent deck or even get the cards you want, you would have to play this game forever. This is a pay to win game straight through, and spending all that time with a concept that gets extremely boring pretty fast is a no-no. I don't mind pay features in games like these, but the difference it makes in buying vs not buying is extreme here, and that's why I can't recommend this game.\n\nThe concept is not for me, but I'm sure that there are a lot of people out there that finds it fun though. But if you want a great card game I will direct you to Magic the gathering instead.\n\nPros:\n\n+New and fresh concept.\n+Lots of varied cards (Interesting mix up in deck building)\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of variation of decks at the start of the game. (1 deck only)\n- Payment barrier is HUGE\n- No rewards when dueling your friends.\n- A concept that gets very boring, very quick\n- Non-existant combat animation.\n- No instants.","June 13, 2014","false","20.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The beginning of the game is quite fun, until you decide to go against other players.  There is an option that you can select to "duel only those close to your skill level" and yet still get placed with people 150+ levels above you who have obviously put a lot of time and money into the game.\n\nThe most fun part about this game for me was the campaign mode.  It wasn't mind numbing repitition as you go from one AI to the next, each one was completely unique.  And that last campaign AI.. oh man.. scratched my head quite a few times.  While going through the campaign, you gain lots of gold, and lots of extra card packs to upgrade your decks with.  I finished the campaign in roughly a week.\n\nThe biggest downside, once you are completely done with the campaing mode, you are FORCED to grind through matches with other players, and like stated before, thier system is not capable of realising someone is outside of your "skill level".  And dont even consider tryng for any sort of tournament mode or jackpot mode, that is where you will see people who have spent thousands of real currency on the game.","April 15, 2015","false","58.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Might and magic helped me understand the actual card game while teaching methods of a whole different one. Now yes there are games on steam, like the actual magic the gathering game. So why choose this one? because it's a change in venue. Playing one game over and over again will get boring so this mixes up the change in gameplay. What i liked the most was how it taught me the difference between the lives your action cards have and your life. The champions i put out will die but it doesnt affect me, when it affects me thats how i know i may lose, or are needing to put down more cards to keep me from taking damage.","October 16, 2015","true","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That is the only mode which I feel new players will have a chance to win, as only Base Set II and HoN cards are allowed in the Deck. These packs are available to anyone for gold, so no need to purchase seals [unless you wish to be a pay2win player which is also fine].\n\nI believe that if you are a player who started when this game first came out and have an incredible cardpool of the first 5 sets, and had a decently built deck, then you may be able to do fine in the Open Ranked games. I am that type of player, I have a good cardpool since the Base Set I through Forgotten Wars [Not much came from 5Towers anyways]. I did buy a couple boxes. Right now I am at 1500 Elo.\n\nSo really you must become a Pay2Win player if you started during the HoN expansion, and you wish to play in Open Ranked Games. Your other option is to make the best out of the Base Set II and HoN cards which is doable but you will still have certain cards that are not available to you but available to people who started before HoN.\n\nI must put emphasis it is very important to join the Ubisoft / Duel of Champions forum\nhttp://forums.ubi.com/forumdisplay.php/333-Might-amp-Magic-Duel-of-Champions?s=3c98aca04e192221b4c939aa85803e46\n\nIt is VERY important that you go to the Deck Building / Strategy section of that forum.\nPost on there and ask for help!\n\nVery important to watch WorldofEnclase on youtube and his Deck Building Guide (There are 5 Episodes)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCARezaDUyq3r3gwmIr6W2Dw\n\nAlso the following website is a Deck Builder's Paradise, in which you can craft a deck and have a place to save it.\nYou will especially need this website because players on the forum will ask you for a link to your deck idea, and they are more than awesome to give you a hand.\nhttp://mmdocking.com/\n\nI know that a lot of players are mad with the changes, making packs from the older expansions cost seals instead of gold.\nTaking out the Seal rewards from leveling up and instead replacing it with Wild Card and/or Gold rewards.\n\nAlthough the Daily Quests are kinda nice, but I have to say that most likely only be able complete quests that related to the single faction you have chosen.\n\nGG","June 20, 2014","true","887.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Defenitely try it! This is NOT just a boring card game.\nThe beginning is a bit hard and sometime frustrating, but when get in higher levels and buy some cards with the gold that you got from duels, this game makes many hours of fun.\nIt has a nice tutorial, but the campaign could be a bit longer. It prepares you for the different races you will meet in the duels - of course the players will be harder as the computer.\nThe ranking system (you will meet players with your duel level) is balanced in the most times. When a player bought some new and better cards with the different resources he will get in the possible ways, he will be harder to defeat of course.\nJust dont give up, think about your tactics, use your cards wisely and optimize your deck - your time will come.\nA nice game to chill out.\nDifferent modes make a nice content. Manage to finish the campaign, practice against AI, friends or other players, play real and ranked duels or even tournaments. Nice options to get and sacrifice cards and build new decks!\nBuying gold and seal for real money is a bit expensive in my opinion, but you have to devide on your own. For just playing the game it is not really needed.\n\nThumbs up for the friendly community - no flames as long as i played the game! Add me if you want.\n\n\nSee you in game\nmr. tobsson","March 1, 2014","true","133.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Fans of Might & Magic series will be very delighted. But ultimately there are certain problems that keeps casual player away.\n...\n1, there is so little things you can do with gold. You can only purchase 2 card packs, they don't have any wildcards, and keep on giving me repetititive cards. It's annoying, waste of gold, and hard to build a decent deck without commitment in either time or real money.\n2, no real trading, turn out this game is more to collective card game.\n3, you don't win card from matches, not even duplicates.\n4, reward from playing PvP matches is so little and they are based on total time of play, not per win. Eg: 5 minutes game yield just around 500 gold. While the cheapest card pack costs 15000 gold. of course the latest campaign reward changes to 5000 gold per mission is nice, but they are after all, finite and can't be repeated.\n5, not on Android platform","June 29, 2014","false","93.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It had a wonderful tutortial that teached you how to play the game. Your first few matches between NPCs aren't too hard and aren't too easy, progression seems good! You get like 5 free packs to open as well.\n\nHowever, the ball is dropped after you reach around lvl 4 which I did. Everything becomes a korean grind. You get enough in-game gold buy yourself a handful of packs and you start with a few packs too Around 3-5 or so I believe after that your screwed. The campaign is extremely short and you could be through that in a 2-3hrs. So no more bonus gold from missions.\n\nNow you do get some seals from playing through the game at the moment of this post I had over 1,000 which would get me a card box of that value which would give me 10 more packs. So that is nice. However seals are the cash shop currency, so I'm not entirely sure if I'd want to spend that just yet.\n\nWith PvP matches you get around 800-1000 gold. The cheapest pack you can get is 12,500 gold. Roughly 13 matches minium to just buy ONE card pack of 12. I don't recall the amount of gold you get if you lose. So there's that to consider too. There are these 2 card packs that you can get but they are 2,000 a piece. So 2-4 matches to just get a 2 card pack?\n\nFinally, the card packs themselves is just evil. In this game the cards you can use both monsters/magic/fortune cards are all determined by the hero card you have. So you could spend 12.5k on a card pack and not get a single card you can use because the cards in that pack does not match your hero's faction or their school of magic. So finding the cards you need to improve your deck will be a shot in the dark every time you open a card pack.\n\nI could've easily fallen in love with this game. I had played a Yugioh card game on the DS for endless of hours yet I'll be forced to grind and play with the same deck for dozens of times before I begin getting cards that can help improve/evolve my game. Sadly it's not worth the trouble. I rather go look at one of the other new card games that have came out or will be in the future. (Scrolls, Hearthstone, SolForge, Shadow Era, etc.)\n\nOh well, back to Yugioh.","December 23, 2013","false","10.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Fans of Might & Magic series will be very delighted. But ultimately there are certain problems that keeps casual player away.\n...\n1, there is so little things you can do with gold. You can only purchase 2 card packs, they don't have any wildcards, and keep on giving me repetititive cards. It's annoying, waste of gold, and hard to build a decent deck without commitment in either time or real money.\n2, no real trading, turn out this game is more to collective card game.\n3, you don't win card from matches, not even duplicates.\n4, reward from playing PvP matches is so little and they are based on total time of play, not per win. Eg: 5 minutes game yield just around 500 gold. While the cheapest card pack costs 15000 gold. of course the latest campaign reward changes to 5000 gold per mission is nice, but they are after all, finite and can't be repeated.\n5, not on Android platform","June 29, 2014","false","93.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It had a wonderful tutortial that teached you how to play the game. Your first few matches between NPCs aren't too hard and aren't too easy, progression seems good! You get like 5 free packs to open as well.\n\nHowever, the ball is dropped after you reach around lvl 4 which I did. Everything becomes a korean grind. You get enough in-game gold buy yourself a handful of packs and you start with a few packs too Around 3-5 or so I believe after that your screwed. The campaign is extremely short and you could be through that in a 2-3hrs. So no more bonus gold from missions.\n\nNow you do get some seals from playing through the game at the moment of this post I had over 1,000 which would get me a card box of that value which would give me 10 more packs. So that is nice. However seals are the cash shop currency, so I'm not entirely sure if I'd want to spend that just yet.\n\nWith PvP matches you get around 800-1000 gold. The cheapest pack you can get is 12,500 gold. Roughly 13 matches minium to just buy ONE card pack of 12. I don't recall the amount of gold you get if you lose. So there's that to consider too. There are these 2 card packs that you can get but they are 2,000 a piece. So 2-4 matches to just get a 2 card pack?\n\nFinally, the card packs themselves is just evil. In this game the cards you can use both monsters/magic/fortune cards are all determined by the hero card you have. So you could spend 12.5k on a card pack and not get a single card you can use because the cards in that pack does not match your hero's faction or their school of magic. So finding the cards you need to improve your deck will be a shot in the dark every time you open a card pack.\n\nI could've easily fallen in love with this game. I had played a Yugioh card game on the DS for endless of hours yet I'll be forced to grind and play with the same deck for dozens of times before I begin getting cards that can help improve/evolve my game. Sadly it's not worth the trouble. I rather go look at one of the other new card games that have came out or will be in the future. (Scrolls, Hearthstone, SolForge, Shadow Era, etc.)\n\nOh well, back to Yugioh.","December 23, 2013","false","10.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I was no stranger to Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon the TCG, Yu-Gi-Oh and many other lesser known card games. It's been many years since I found a CCG that help my interest, let alone one that I actually felt warranted my giving it some money. The drought has ended. I have found a new CCG that has sucked me in.\n\nThe game is simple to jump into if you are familiar with CCGs. Your objective is to attack your opponents hero until they run out of health. The game elegantly handles problems some other CCGs have, such as resources. Resources, needed to pay for monsters you summon and spells you cast, increase by 1 every turn automatically. This eliminates problems other CCGs have, like in Magic, where your game can be ruined by never drawing enough Mana cards, or drawing nothing but. The game is also quick. If playing a competent opponent, most games end in under 15 minutes. Theres a tournament mode where each player only gets 7 minutes total and the vast majority of the time, this is more than enough to win by wiping out your opponent.\n\nThe cards effects are simple and can be understood with one reading. The art looks great and is based, of course, on the robust M&M universe. Factions include Haven (high defense and healing), Barbarian (units have haste and atk power that steadily increases), Necromancers (lots of instadeath spells and reviving units), Infernals (high damage swarm/rush deck), Forgotten War (aka Sorcerers. Lots of potent spells that can be reused and the ability to banish cards from play) and Sanctuary (oriental theme, momentum deck where units give adjacent units perks creating a snowball effect).\n\nA lot of good ideas are borrowed from other CCGs and come together to form this well made, fun game. It's also free to play, which is a huge plus in my book. Newcomers get to choose 1 basic deck from Haven, Barbarian, Necro or Infernal. Decks consist of 6o cards minimum and this includes 8 month cards (month cards are drawn each turn outside of the playfield and have effects on both players ie: for the next 2 turns, all spells cost 1 less resource to play). When you win an online match, you gain some gold and exp. Everytime you level up, you gain a stash of gold which can be used to buy booster backs or other decks.\n\nA LOT of people make it to the high ranks of play and never spend money, which is great. That being said, once you clear the campaign and hit higher levels, the speed at which you come into money greatly slows down. The game also has 3 kinds of currency. Gold (common) which buys booster packs and some decks, Seals (uncommon, awarded upon completing certain campaign levels and leveling up) which buys decks and better booster packs and Wildcards (rare, only gained by buying booster packs, must be used to buy specific cards you want). If you want to play competitively without spending money, it can be done, but will take a lot of time. I personally, liked the game so much, I have made a couple of purchases to give me a better card slection.\n\nAll and all, I'm very happy with the game and play it pretty much daily.

Especially the card art is very nice, and it's a lot of fun to collect cards. The new concept for rotating formats that was introduced with Base Set 2 is good, but suffers because of poor execution.\nThe new economic model that was introduced recently is a big disadvantage for new players, and if you are into competitive play you might want to keep in mind that you have to spend around 30€ if you don't want to get crushed by players with access to more cards.\nOverall you should definitly give DoC a shot, especially if you are on the look for a CCG with a strong tactical complexity.\n\nMy experience with the game\nI have been playing DoC for half a year now. My recorded hours on Steam are around 50, but only because I play on the iPad most of the time (Steam and iOs sync seamless). In total I have played around 1.500 matches now, witch is enough to give you a educated review of the game.\n\nWhat is a Collectible Card Game\nIf you are totally new to this, a short summary. In DoC you buy packs, just like in the old Magic the gathering times, only that you can get packs for free. From this packs you get random cards for several factions witch you can combine to form decks that are 59 or more cards (but stick to 59). You use your deck to compete with other players online. A battle basically consists of playing cards and hitting your opponent until he is dead.\n\nThe changes with the latest patch\nRecently, with the Heart of Nightmares update the game was seperated into 2 Formats: Open (all cards count) and Standard (a selected pool of cards counts). This move was necessary because the card base for DoC was growing fast and it became very hard for new players to get into the game. Base Set 2 was intended to make it easier for new players to get into the game (witch failed, more on that later).\n\nBasically Base Set 2 is a collection of 300 cards, witch are a little less then 50% of all existing cards. Especially some extremly powerful rare & epic cards have been removed from Standard, because those were dominating the game and hard to get (i.e. hard for beginners). The idea was to create a reduced card pool that was easier to collect and reserve open format for the experienced players. Unfortunatly this didn't work out.\n\nThe (dreaded) economic changes\nThose ruined the game for beginners. Period. Before I can explain why, you have to understand a few concepts for DoC regarding the economy.\n\nThere are two ways to get cards, you buy packs (with gold or seals) or you change Wildcards into specific cards you need (Wildcards are the dust in Hearthstone if you have experience with that game).\nSeals are the premium currency and can only be obtained with real money (after BS2). The real premium currency though are Wildcards, because even with seals you can only buy packs and have to rely on RNGesus to give you the cards you need.\n\nWhen introducing the changes for BS2 the developers said they would remove the options for obtaining free seals BUT they would up the amount of wildcards you can get. Unfortunatly that didn't happen, after the patch I'm getting EVEN LESS wildcards then before AND no more seals for free.\n\nLet's break it down without to much detail: As a new player you will recieve massive amounts of gold (witch buys you a lot of packs), 1-5 wildcards a week and no seals. That basically means you will have to rely on RNGesus to build your deck and that's no problem in the lower ranks (all other new players are going to have the same problem), but boy you are going to get crushed when you get into competitive levels.\n\nAlso at this point there is no way of getting into open without opening your wallet or two years of constant power grinding (no kidding, it's actually about two years until you have the necessary wildcards for a single competitive open deck). This really needs a massive fix right now.\n\nSome beginners Tips\nFirst, the game shifted towards Necropolis & Inferno with the patch, if you want to know witch faction to choose. A ranking would be:\nFirst: Necropolis, Inferno\nSecond: Academy, Stronghold\nThird: Sanctuary\nWay last: Heaven\n\nAt this point there isn't a single competitive deck for Heaven, they are really sub-par right now. Don't choose heaven if you don't want to get crushed constantly.\n\nAlso consider getting the starter packs for all factions for 10€. This will help you a lot, because it's close to impossible to get other heros / factions in the beginning. And, while quite hard, you can start finishing the campaign witch will give you lot's of gold, 300 cards for open and 40 wildcards (doesn't sound like much but is a real value). Last but not least, there are quite a bunch of daily quests like "win 2 games with necropolis" and you need a working deck to finish those.\n\nBest try to stay in the lower ranks at the beginning. It's tempting to get to champion as fast a possible to get daily quests with wildcards but a daily quest doesn't help you if you can't complete it because everyone else is just too strong (and they can't be canceled so you will be stuck with them).\n\nAlso keep away from Tournaments completly. Free tickets are really rare now, save them until you have a really good deck that can actually win.\n\nCheck out the offical forums, there is a lot of advice on deckbuilding etc. there (helped me a lot in the beginning). Just a quick note for beginners: Limit you deck to exactly 59 cards and don't include creatures with any requirement higher then 5. There are a lot of beefy creatures that look awesome but there is an insane amount of removal in this game and they will just get killed and you will loose.\n\nAnd last but not least: Don't spend your wildcards until you are absolutly sure what you are doing. Just don't, you will regret it later, I assure you.\n\nShould you play this game?\nWith all this economic ♥♥♥♥ going on, my answer is still yes, give it a shot. This is such an awesome game, there is such an incredible card base with tactical options, the ears of the stadard Hearthstone player would bleed. If you are looking for a deep strategic game, your search is over.\n\nJust keep in mind you might want to put some money into the game, around 30€ should be enough to keep you competitive. I think that's alright for such a game, but it's up to you.\n","May 2, 2014","true","55.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You do not need the super fancy cards to keep up with ranked duels cause they choose opponents for you at your level, if you have fancy cards from spending you will level up fast to others that have spent, or if you are a dedicated free player, complete acheivments to earn to seals which buy you booster packs that would normally be bought with some money. Is it longer this way? absolutely! but you already get a fun strategic card free to play and you can stay this way WITHOUT hitting a wall because they keep you at the same level as guys like yourself who are free (for the most part) So quit your complaining if you want a free card game this i guess would be your only option BUTTTT it is a good option for fun strat. games as far as im concerned. and its not too expensive if you do spend, maybe it was cheaper before. but to keep the game going money has to flow doesnt it?","May 11, 2014","true","162.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justchris/recommended/256410/","justchris","justchris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justchris/","109 products in account","This game is essentially Hearthstone, except it's been out for a while longer.\n\nRather than having playable reasources, like Magic: The Gathering, or restricting the number of cards you can play per turn like SolForge, you have a single resource meter, which increases by 1 each turn, and that's how much stuff you can play that turn. You also draw a card each turn as well.\n\nUnlike Hearthstone, this game places value on positioning, as there are 8 spaces (2x4) on each side of the board, and you can only attack our opponent if the opposing 2 spaces are empty. Otherwise, you can attack the creature(s) there. There is also a distinction between ranged (can attack either of the two opposing spaces) and melee/flyer (can attack the closest opposing space) creatures. And when attack, creatures also retaliate.\n\nCards have a faction, and usually an element as well. The basis of each deck is a Hero, which determines what factions and elements you can use in your deck (as well as the factionless and elementless cards any deck can use).\n\nIn addition to their resource cost, cards have an additional limiting factor on their play. Each hero has a Might, a Magic and a Valor? stat. Each turn you can increase one of these stats for free (or pay 1 resource to draw a card), and your stat must be equal to or greater than the requirement on the card to play it. It is not a resource you spend, just a limiter on what can be played, probably to ensure proper scaling of the battle.\n\nPlayers start at 20 life each, and there are a variety of heroes, some which have special abilities, which you can use instead of increasing a stat or buying a card. They also have different starting stats (the base heroes start with 1 Might, 1 Magic & 2 Valor).\n\nThe game is fairly enjoyable, and it has a very well done campaign mode, which really helps you learn the game. It also has a leveling mechanic where you gain experience from battles. Not sure what all you can do when you level up yet. It has daily rewards, and the more days you long in in a row (up to 7), the better the rewards you get (but if you miss a day, you could lose all those rewards).\n\nOverall, I think I would recommend this game, however there are a few issues with it. The cards from the first base set (which will be most of the cards you get in the starter decks), don't have creature abilities explained on the card consistently. This can make it difficult to plan strategy. There doesn't seem to be an upper limit on resource generation, meaning if a game last long enough, you get to the point of casting your entire hand, and then some. Also, each card is required to have 4 event cards, which flip over (along with your opponents 4) each turn, and provide either a purchasable or ongoing affect. However, your opponent can use these events as well, and there's not a lot of variety to them. There's not a lot of ways to use them to strengthen your deck, and they hinder you as much as help you I'd say, 80% of the time.\n\nI would still recommend Magic or SolForge over this game, but if you're looking for another CCG to play, this is definitely a fun game.","May 30, 2014","true","22.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

(some examples; time lapse, bound succubus, prison)\n- inferno is kinda annoying beacuse, it has all of excellent starting creatures, early spells to board clear(low cost, both single and multi target spells),and decent mid-late creatures to carry on.\n- neutral cards generally too weak for their cost. i want to use them, but i cant :'(\n- inferno is so fkn annoying. nerf it ffs.\n\nSo basically what i like in card games ; strategies with counter strategies, mind games, unique cards, creating my playstyle, reading some stuff about good players options and learn about current meta, constructing a deck and ofcourse collecting rare cards. With this said, lets return to the topic. MMDoC has no balance in factions, spells, events, minions, heroes actually nearly in anything. This game doesnt encourge wide variety of open and new strategies. Only very specific strats are usefull, you have to use a rush deck or 70% of the time you gonna lose very soon. There is no mind games(heartstone secrets, saving spells for combo etc). Some cards just dont pop out from boosters although you open dozens of packs but some cards pop out every fkin time.I just get 20 sea elves, 15 water elementals and 30 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vultures, same cards always pop out. I am not looking for extra rare cards man, just gimme some different commons or maybe some other uncommons. I am just bored to see these same cards every time. I really like to read forums or some guides about the game i am playing, but there is so little things about the game's content to read which (i think) is caused by game itself because there is really little room for making new plays or decks-strategies in this game so people just write the same things over and over. So i am kinda dissapointed because game has much more potential imo. Lastly, dont invest money until you got a full idea of the game and unless you are certain that you gonna enjoy the game.","August 18, 2014","true","293.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

You're better off sticking to Magic the Gathering Online, or even waiting for Hex. Hell, Hearthstone is 1000X better. If you think Im wrong, weel guess what, Im not. Try it for yourself, its free. Also, as with almost every free to play game out nowadays, be ready to pay real cash for the ability to beat other players unfairly.","July 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's not that this is a bad game, it's that the cash shop and playerbase make it totally not worth playing.  It has a campaign mode that helps, but becomes so difficult so quickly that you feel trapped in it too.  The game has a solid rules system, and lots of cool cards.  However, many of those cards can only be bought with cash.  What's worse, you can litterally purchase any card in the game, as many copies as you like and can afford.  This is a riddickulous option, because it allows players with money (I've found most of them to be spoiled little brats that have nothing better to do than drop hundreds of dollars online.) to buy the ultimate deck without needing to search thru booster pack or box sets.  This is probably, by far, the most abused part of the game.  I have seen countless players with a full deck of 60-100 card decks that are all rare cards, hand selected by a player with too much money and access.\n\nThis feature alone would be enough to turn many players off, but then you add in the annoying ♥♥♥ player base.  I've played collector card games for years, online and off. I'm talking magic, yu'gi'oh, vampire, might and magic, and many others.  I've never met a playerbase who seems to not give a ♥♥♥♥ about wasting your time.  I mean, it's epidemic within this game.  I'd say that about every 2 out of 3 players takes over a full minute to take a turn.  This is common even at the   beginning of a game, and you only have 1 point to spend.  ONE FREAKING POINT!  I mean, come on.  It should never take you that long to play out a simple round, and if you play the game, you'll see that there's absolutely no reason for it.  What's worse, I've actually ran into several players that will simply hold the game up when their loosing.  They do this so you'll just surrender or quit, and they don't get a loss on their record.  I've heard about competitive gameplay, but this goes way beyond that.\n\nIn the end, if you're looking for a really great, base defense, card game that will be mostly a waste of time because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players, then look no further.  If you just want to play in a game where being absolutely unfair and ruthless pays off, then this ones for you.  If you want a game that you can dominate with your mommy and daddy's money, and they have lots to waste, then hop on this train right here.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a fun card game to play online, you'll most likely be disappointed.  If you're looking for a fair game, where the cash shop doesn't rule everything, stay away.  Finally, if you're looking for an online game with a friendly community that doesn't consist of cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and time wasting jerks, then you'll want to avoid this one.","October 31, 2014","false","187.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

In the time I played my deck consisted of pretty crappy cards (even after I used the allowed gold coins from completing the tutorial etc.). In my one quick game my opponent had several premium cards and a deck consisting of many minions well above mine - in fact, he had a house card that allowed him to take any of his minions off the board on his turn, gain the turn cost of playing it, and then immediately play it again, so that essentially no unit of his could die, while of course mine could. And... back to the crappy deck that I had, there were no options in turns of spells etc. to counter this.\n\nOK, so no pvp for now, right? Well the only reason I played one quick game was because immediately progressing through the campaign required it. Well outside of the tutorial and your first 2 campaign runs, of incredibly low difficulty, low-and-behold the computer gains an incredible card deck and suddenly progression becomes near impossible.

In order to log into any games made before Oct 14, 2014 I would have to know this legacy name and use it as my username.\n\n... fine >.<\n\nSo I go back to my account and find the legacy name, go back into the game through steam, get to the login screen, MANUALLY type in every ♥♥♥♥ing random letter because it wouldnt let me copy/paste it into the game, and finally get into the game, only to discover that my profiles PERMANENT player name, visable to all other players, was Guest-bunchofrandomletters... forever, if I should choose to play. Another run to the forums has confirmed that, at this time, there is indeed no way to change my username without creating a whole new account.\n\n♥♥♥♥ you, Ubisoft... this has been way too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ for a game that I dont even know if I like yet. There are too damned many games out there for me to climb this mountain of ♥♥♥♥, just to get to yours.","October 16, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I was excited to see the game with a campaign mode, that is, if you are into reading walls of text and playing the same match over and over again which you cant do until you earn the heroes from the other factions that is unless you want to do it for fun without rewards. You are pretty much forced to play quick match (pvp), and unless you pick a faction with three stars on one of the statistic areas you will lose almost every game until you can get enough packs to get another hero and make a new deck out of a different faction ( which you cant do unless you have a hero from the said faction). In the event you don't like the faction you chose, you can always opt to start over. Honestly, to me it felt like a magic the gathering style of game in the way it plays with a small hint of yu gi oh mixed in. Nothing really new or unique from this card game to others, but it is a more free based game in comparison, again if you are into that sort of thing.","January 30, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Ultimately, that is this game's main failing--it is not a good product, even if it is a good game.\n\nI actually started playing it before the single-player overhaul--back then, you could get Seals (the premium currency) from the campaign, and could also get them from daily log-in rewards.\n\nNow, the only way to earn Seals without real money is a handful of acheivments, some of which are beyond the reach of average players (like winning 25 swiss tournaments--very high level play).\n\nThis means that anyone who chooses not to pay money is at a severe disadvantage. Okay, fine, nothing new for a F2P. The real problem comes from the fact that the game only allows purchases of randomized booster packs (buying singles takes another premium currency), and does not allow trading of your spare cards. You are only allowed to sell duplicates back to the game, and for a very tiny amount.\n\nI have spent ~40 USD on this game, and I do not regret that purchase. For that amount of money, however, I really wish that the game gave me more resources. For the cost of a nearly new release, I received a bunch of cards that I couldn't trade and had no interest in playing. The large number of factions makes it harder for new players to build a focused deck, and the random nature and lack of packs means that building a good collection is a very frustrating, arduous process.\n\nThe game itself is fun, but I can't bring myself to recomend it to other people when it is such a frustrating product. At least IRL TCGs allow things like trading and purchasing singles, and the lack of these features really damages the experience.","June 8, 2014","false","538.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The problem with deck building is being a jack of all trades and a master of none works sometimes, not often. The other games where you go in highly specific with your deck and still get instagibbed with mass Geysers(Aoe spell that is really cheap) and perfectly timed damage spells. ♥♥♥♥ I hate how much time I wasted on this POS ♥♥♥♥ing game. Ubisoft is ♥♥♥♥. People usually just use heros of any faction as long as they have dark magic (the only magic that can destroy every creature without darkward for peanuts, roughly like 90% of the creatures get rekt). The RNG is horrendous, ♥♥♥♥ING horrendous. 59 card deck drawing 3 of the same cards consistently (80% of the time they are cards you really dont want until you set up your combo). Thats not luck, thats not RNG... thats ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. Every game starting hand has at least 4 dead cards, ♥♥♥♥ing useless until at least turn 8. Sure you can play a cheesy ♥♥♥♥ing RUSH deck but they are so ♥♥♥♥ing boring id rather jack off with barb wire. Fun to start, higher lvl is all the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over.... Oh vs thorns deck great, welp i dont have a spell block because prime blows my fat sausage so Ill just get enchanted to death and rekt myself k thx... Oh rush zerg deck k awesome, hope my aoe spells show up..nah why would they, they always ♥♥♥♥ing bottom deck the ♥♥♥♥ing cards i need.\n\nNo ♥♥♥♥ing skill needed, at least not in standard league. Very rarely is there a game that goes back and forth nicely...its usually one sided from the get go. You need to follow the meta decks or you wont get anywhere, they just have a higher win chance from synergy...and there isnt enough synergy in general with cards...\n\nDont be a ♥♥♥♥ing queer ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mother ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ like me and spend money on this huge waste of ♥♥♥♥ING time... Oh there are also bots that waste every ♥♥♥♥ing turn, and the typical ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that think they are so good because they drew that 1 extra card and got what they needed with 40 cards left to pummel your ♥♥♥ out of existence.\n\n1/2 a dirty chicken k*unt out of 10. ♥♥♥♥ you ubish*t, GARBAGE GARBAGE ♥♥♥♥.. all these ♥♥♥♥ing "trading card games" and you cant even trade? wtf is with this ♥♥♥♥... capital punishment to companies using the wrong words to describe their products +1.

I've seen players use a creature that only had 2 attack to destroy my very expensive 6 hp creep that I just played in the last turn, no spells or specialty cards, just outright died. There's no history log to review the card in question or what he did to destroy that creep.\n\nNot noob friendly, the deck builder is terrible becuase you have to filter out all the cards that can't be used.\nYou can't even play the campaign becuase you need the other factions to complete the current mission to unlock the next mission, but you can't even do that because you have to grind in multiplayer to buy card packs that may or may not have enough cards to build another deck. There 8 factions but you only need 6 to unlock a mission.\n\nSeems to be another pay 2 win game.\n\nIt's very frustrating game, suppose to be for casual, but losing every game is not relaxing.\n♥♥♥♥ this game.","October 12, 2014","false","5.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I don't think this is a better game but it offers up something different with the strategy of hero abilities, point allocation, and cards playable by both sides. I wouldn't be surprised if many enjoyed this more than any other CCG. Recommended if you're a big card game fan or looking to get into a card game that offers something a little different. Strong mechanics, gorgeous art, and a sleak designs make this a game I will gladly dedicate mulitple hours to trying to unlock new cards and decks. Plus, you really can't beat the price.\n\nPro's\nReally solid F2P CCG. It should be possible to get a portion of the cards unlocked and multiple decks without spending a dime.\n\nCon's\nThough it is F2P and I did say you could unlock a good bit without spending a dime. It is true that it won't be easy and you really have to be commited. I could see someone tiring of playing the same deck over and over for few pack of cards here and there.\n\nOverall: 7 out of 10.

Too many cards per expansion. Probably too many heroes overall. Difference in skill and decks between players creates a canyon too wide to keep new players attention. Time investment neccessary is enormous, and the economic investmentment is out of proportion for gathering revenue (I will blame European culture and mindset for business illiteracy). The foundation is there for a thriving business and a great CCG, but there is no physical property (ie cards) and the 2 investments above restrain a viable model.\n\nIf several thousand persons is what they want playing a game and receiving minimal revenue, then success is 100%. If they want hundred of thousands of players and tens of millions in $US-equivalant, then corrections need to be made across the board.

While it is fun it is now VERY costly to get into and very limited to cash in order to begin being competative. Where as prior to the past 2 updates there were lots of ways to get seals (which cost real money) now there are no longer any ways except cash. That mixed with the diffrent mechanics in the newer sets makes it like trying to play MTG mixed across a bunch of diffrent series while you use a old starter deck. Fun game, ruined by their change in cash mechanics.\n---------------------\nFun game, the only computer ccg that I have really found enjoyable. It feels much more like the old battletech card game then magic the gathering to me. The pace is some what similar to slower then magic, and no where near as fast as Hearthstone. The matches can go back and forth, a lot, giving strategy a nice amount of time to develop and really play out. It isn't nearly as much based on getting a one or two trick poney and just waiting till it pops out...you'll really have to go through stages of the battle.\n\nOverall it is a great game. The interface is good in battle, outside of battle dealing with cards is ok.\n\nThe addition of wildcards is nice, the ability to basicly earn credits that you can use to buy specific cards you want (as opposed to randomly).\n\nThis isn't a pay to win game per say, it is rather balanced...that being said like any CCG, especialy one with 600+ cards, having access to multiple copies of a card or access to rare cards vastly increases your versitility. There are very few cards that just flat out are not fair/balanced, and in general the game can be very fun with little to minimal monitary investment.\n\nIf you do put money into it, the best deal is the steam Champions Pack 2, especialy if you can get it on sale. 70$ for 600 cards is far better then anything the duel server its self offers...and if steam will put the pack at -50% again...wish I had bought 2 of them.","February 23, 2014","false","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Obviously it is a MTG copy, but it has many differences to keep it fresh, such as more to manage than Mana and attacking specific cards. The choices in battle intrigued me. However, around the second hour in the game I realized I have to pay a lot to play, and the card decks just didn't seem organized. The solo game loses its guidance and I found myself grinding in the third hour to attempt to unlock stuff. The game forces you to do multiplayer as well. The UI with all its menus and locked sections were a drag.

I was not expecting to like it very much. Boy was I wrong. After installing this I played for an insane 18 hours straight and was totally hooked. But here's the important part, during that time I didn't spend a penny in cash and didn't NEED to. What you get to start with and the occasional booster every time you level up is more than enough to get you well on your way to being a good player. I dipped into the large and challenging campaign mode, I played 25 games of PVP with an 80% win rate, and I even held my own in ranked play with 3/4 wins. There is no time with this that you HAVE to pay and what you CAN pay for is very reasonable in cost. You can get a whole box set for a little over £12 or you can pay the price of a full game in a one-off that will get you the bulk of cards from every deck. The point is you don't need to.\nSo, the game itself, it's very different from magic, a lot faster and more intuitive, easier to learn but still with plenty of tactical depth. It's impossible to describe it fully in a short review but I HIGHLY recommend you give this one a go. 98%","July 12, 2014","true","403.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

You will constantly duel people with the same cards and those duels will take forever(and they'll win because the spent $100 on the game to buy 10 copies of the cards that are supposed to be rare). You'll only go back to try and win to relieve your frustration. Try as you may, this game will ultimatly just lead to you feeling you wasted your life trying to enjoy something that is just crap. You can not even trade cards. sure heartstone is good, but I recomend waiting for hex. This is just not worh the effort.\n(oh and did I mention buying 10's of packs and not ever getting something new, check your statistics, you will have just one or 2 less than you need to unlock a pack every time-the main difference between these online garbage games and the real ones is that they can track what you have and only give you something new when they feel like it, bunch of garbage).","June 9, 2014","false","266.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think this is a better game but it offers up something different with the strategy of hero abilities, point allocation, and cards playable by both sides. I wouldn't be surprised if many enjoyed this more than any other CCG. Recommended if you're a big card game fan or looking to get into a card game that offers something a little different. Strong mechanics, gorgeous art, and a sleak designs make this a game I will gladly dedicate mulitple hours to trying to unlock new cards and decks. Plus, you really can't beat the price.\n\nPro's\nReally solid F2P CCG. It should be possible to get a portion of the cards unlocked and multiple decks without spending a dime.\n\nCon's\nThough it is F2P and I did say you could unlock a good bit without spending a dime. It is true that it won't be easy and you really have to be commited. I could see someone tiring of playing the same deck over and over for few pack of cards here and there.\n\nOverall: 7 out of 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeddsdead/recommended/256410/","zeddsdead","Zedd's dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeddsdead/","1920 products in account","This game needs a lot of work and I am on the fence about it.  If I was going to give it a rating I would say a 6 out of 10.  It is a free to play model and it really seems that you can get away with not spending anything and still succeed for a while if you are a veteran of the card game genre.  The game strategy is definitely solid and has some interesting elements, but there are pros and cons:\n\nThe good:\n\n1. At its heart, the game seems like a solid strategy game and there are plenty of cards to mix things up a bit\n\n2. The Swiss tournament system is one of the best I have seen in an online environment, but there are very few other options to choose from\n\n3. Card art is good\n\n4. The different decks and factions have a rich variety of play styles\n\n5. Other than the lack of single player content, the game is getting a good amount of development work.  They even fixed an issue with Steam achievements when may publishers don't bother.\n\n6. If you want to play and play and play, it seems that you can eventually get everything you need without spending one thin dime.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n1. There is no way to ramp up outside of playing other people.  With one deck worth of stuff it is a pretty monotonous way to grind to expanding your arsenal of cards and the campaigns/solo challenges are almost non existent.\n\n2. The interface is definitely a bit raw.  It is clearly designed for mobile platforms but has a free to play java feel to it and it lacks the finesse that other titles in this genre have\n\n3. No card or resource trading.  What you get is what you get.  This is only mitigated by the ability to forge cards out of sacrificing others or by getting special tokens from packs.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n1. While the game has truly diverse play potential, you are locked to one deck unless you do a LOT of slogging through games to get enough cards and a new hero to build more.  Most of the cards in the game are keyed to a faction and CAN NOT be played by another faction under any circumstance, so every deck is a "one color deck".  This is only mitigated by the fact that the one color tends to have enough diversity to be well rounded while still themed.  This means that when you do get enough coins to buy a pack and open it, 90% of the cards are unusable and I do mean unusable until you luck into a hero card from that faction to play them with.  Even then, it is unlikely you will have enough staple cards for alternate decks to do anything anyway.\n\n2. The pricing of the pay to play portion of the game is high in my opinion making getting a second faction starter even less attractive.","December 3, 2013","true","43.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
