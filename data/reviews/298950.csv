And I think they're great, this one especially. The graphics aren't that great, kind of on par with early Frictional stuff (think Penumbra) and the gameplay is great if you're an adventure fan. The puzzles can be awesome, or sometimes baffling, the voice work is not great, but fits the vibe, and the atmosphere is fantastic. Also, after having played so many bad first person horror games lately, this one was a breath of fresh air. If you liked Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth and are down for something a bit more lonesome, and focused on puzzles instead of action, you'll dig. If you're a graphics-snob who gets bored or frustrated easily, stay away.","December 12, 2014","true","3.9"," 69 of 72 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","69","72","2","2"

The story and atmosphere are still satisfying but...\n\nThis sequel is different from the first game in that it now requires WASD to walk around. So if you appreciated the laziness of point-and-click in Darkness Within 1, you will not find it here. In fact the game itself does not include any kind of mouse-only layout.\n\nNow here comes the universally frustrating part: The Steam version of this game is different. They switched the clues and puzzle solutions around, and no one has put together a walkthrough to cover it. You will only find solutions in the Steam forums. The saddest part is that some of the solutions are illogical and you will probably NEED a walkthrough. So enjoy that little hitch. I'll try to post some clues here and in the forums.\n\n**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\nBelow the Old House:\n\nThe "container for liquids" and the means of opening the closet are now in the underground gallery beneath the Old House.\n\nThe contents of the metal box in the underground gallery: You will need them to get through the padlocked door in the underground gallery beneath the Old House. There is no key in this version.\n\nLet a few bugs sting you on purpose and listen closely as you walk near the stairs leading down into the pit in the center of the underground gallery.\n\nBelow the Old Mansion:\n\nStatue w/ Sacrificial Dagger beneath the Old Mansion: Take a second look after you hear the weird sound.\n\nThe ring found beneath the Old Mansion: Its too dark down there to look at it properly. Go up into the Mansion's basement and look again.\n\nInside the Old Mansion:\n\nThere is something to pick up in room through the door by the fridge. It is necessary for you to see all the endings.\n\nThere is something in the tub.\n\nThe Retirement Home:\n\nGrab the thing at the foot of the stairs as you leave for the sewers. You will need it.\n\nThe Necropolis:\n\nThe snake-head recoils each time that you get the 3 symbols correct on a disk on its head.","June 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

I, however, think these games are thee best lovecraftian games of all time!\n\nThe game itself is beautiful, the voice acting some of the best I've ever experienced and the soundtrack is haunting, yet beautiful.\n\nOne of the things I like so much in these games, is that you don't get every detail served. I remember playing it the first time, and rushed to the end, but I was left with so many unanswered questions. The second time, however, I tried to keep note of everything I read, and the game was suddenly so much better.\n\nThis is the series, I personally, would love a new game of the most. A 3rd one would be great! Or at least a game in the Darkness Within universe!\n\nWord of advice: Play the first game first! I've read somewhere in a review some years ago, that the second game can be played by itself, but for your own enjoyments sake, don't do it. You will lose so much information, and chilling experiences.\n\nLovecraft would be proud!","December 29, 2014","true","10.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

Everything just looks and feels a little wonky (and occasionally buggy).  Worst of all, the world is too soft around the edges and lacking in detail compared to DW1... I just didn't feel as immersed in the environments despite the increased freedom to explore.  This lack of visual subtlety seemingly leads to a similar lack of subtlely in the story and characters (e.g. in DW1, Howard is understandably shocked by every strange thing that occurs; in DW2, Howard is carrying a living homunculus in his pocket for most of the game and barely bats an eyelid).  And while the inclusion of more characters in the world was ambitious, the more prominently featured conversation system is clumsy at best and occasionally broken.\n\nDW2 does do one thing more effectively than the first outing:  the flow of the game and its puzzles seemed much smoother and more intuitive... I never felt stuck simply because I had no idea what Howard was supposed to be trying to do (as sometimes happened to me in DW1).\n\nIf you played and enjoyed Darkness Within 1, I can recommend Darkness Within 2 simply by virtue of the resolution it (sort of) provides to the storyline and the healthy dose of Lovecraftiness.  If you haven't played or didn't enjoy DW1, however, you should consider avoiding DW2.","October 14, 2015","true","9.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I highly recommend this game and its predecessor.\n\nBut, to be completely fair, it's not quite as good as the story it finishes.   This slight drop in quality is simply a result of it showing the player too much.  Arguably, the secret to nailing a proper Lovecraftian vibe is to keep all the important things endlessly in the shadows.  This game breaks that rule, and takes you right to the center of everything.\nStill, that's a very minor sin here, especially since the story had to go SOMEWHERE.\n\n(Eccentric side note: the game looks amazing on a 3D monitor once you turn off a few of the new graphics settings.)\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game unless you haven't played the first one yet.  But if that's the case, I just recommend the first one even harder.\n","February 29","true","105.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","3"

I was unfortunately disappointed. I don't mind that the graphics aren't impressive, since it's an old game and it does get the story across just fine, but the story is the biggest problem. It's full of Lovecraftian horror cliches, loose plot threads, bad story pacing and hardly makes use of the previous game's story or events at all.\n\nI get the feeling that the game really wanted to be a classic Lovecraft-style horror tale set in the 1930s, but kept forgetting it's established in 2011. The first time we see an indication of a modern day environment is when we see a box of discarded VHS tapes in the bookstore, but it ends up being the only one. Howard has misplaced his cellphone sometime between the two games, and the newest-model phone we see is a broken 60s variant. There's not one television in sight, let alone a computer. Even the few (nonfunctional) light switches we see are early 20th century. The only car we see (and actually get to use) is a 30s style fordor that belonged to Howard's grandfather - gone is the small but modern car from the first game. Every NPC talks like they stepped out of a turn-of-the-century novel, fear of "strangers" is rampant, everyone talks about curses and "rites" even though in the next breath they insist they don't actually believe any of that, oh no, but let me tell you in detail and purple prose about all these curses anyway. And who writes diary entries that come with cliffhangers for events that will take place weeks or months later!?\n\nAlmost all of the referred-to NPCs from the previous game are killed off somewhere behind the stage before the game even begins. We never find out what became of Howard's police friend, Arthur. We spend a good quarter of the game making a mysterious machine work at the bottom of an abandoned building, but besides one scrawled note, we get no results or consequences from it. We don't know who the robbers' employer was, nor do we know what was in the sewer. I understand that part of horror is fear of the unknown, but that's no excuse for sloppy storytelling!\n\nThis game does have superior sound design, and the full 3d environment is more comfortable to play in than the Myst-like static backgrounds, compared to the previous game. But as a whole, DW: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder is much better than this one.","October 13, 2015","false","11.8"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

(i think this game needs a prequel rather than sequel)\n-there is a low fps problem. i played and finished Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage 3 years ago with my old computer but i m still can't play direction cut edition with my newer laptop because of this low fps problem.\n\noverall darkness within 1 and 2 great games and i m really proud some turkish game developers can produce original and interesting games such as darkness within series. i ve played several times both of games and when i buy a new computer, i m looking forward to play this direction cut edition ,too.","November 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I had to fight some annoying technical issues - if you have an AMD video card, be prepared to spend some time messing around with software and settings (you'll find the info and links you need in the game discussions.)\n\nBut once I got over that annoying hump, the game was great ... I basically played it start to finish, I was so engrossed in the story. It is an hommage a Lovecraft, and you'll find elements from many of his stories in the game (as well as a bunch of Easter Eggs that pay tribute to him.) I spent most of the time on the edge of my seat and often afraid to open open a door or walk down a dark hallway. As in many point-and-click games, some of the puzzles are easy and some are pretty tough.\n\nIf you like Lovecraft, and enjoy this time of game (story driven point-and-click) you will definitely like this game. If you haven't read Lovecraft ... you should read his stories before playing.","October 26, 2015","true","11.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Buggy as hell, I fell through the ground several times and had to reload an old savegame which made me replay about half an hour of gameplay which isn't very fun in a glitchy puzzle game with 20 FPS.\n\nWeird riddles you don't even know you have to solve. Some riddles are broken; I couldn't solve the elevator code riddle in the beginning because it didn't give me the feedback you need to be able to solve it.\n\nHours of backtracking for objects you can barely see. I got stuck because I didn't pick up a bottle. As it turned out it was a bottle standing between 5 or 6 other bottles I couldn't pick up. I had to backtrack to pick up a small wooden handle lying on a wooden floor in the shadows.\n\nWalkthroughs aren't helpful because this is the Director's Cut Edition which changes riddles and object locations.\n\nThere's an achievement "Find all 4 flashlights". After I fell unconscious I lost most of my inventory, including my 3 flashlights. When I woke up, I found my inventory in the other room - but only 1 of my flashlights. When I got back to the mansion and found the 4th one, it didn't trigger the achievement because I didn't have 4 flashlights at the same time.
