It's a short game, but it's fun once you get the hang of it.  A couple of stages were gimmies.  It was almost like they were trying to fake you out, but still quite fun.\n\nThere were a couple of minor bugs that I noticed - I forget the stage, but one of the orbs wasn't lit and it passed me anyway.  There was also a stage where I used all the orbs, but it wouldn't fail me right away.  I hit 'r' to retry and that got it reset.\n\nOverall, worth the cash and doubly so if we could get some more game modes or more stages.","August 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
