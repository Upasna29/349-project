"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/298340/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Wipeout is a series I only recently discovered, but almost instantly fell head over heels in love with. Unfortunately, it's also a series that's been almost entirely confined to itself, with little in the way of similar games to be found on other platforms, and whose future looks incredibly bleak with the shutdown of its developer, Sony Liverpool. As such I've been clamoring to find something to fill this soon to be gap, and the unapologetic clone that is Flashout 2 seemed like a good stopgap while I waited for a more fleshed out experience. How very, very wrong I was to assume even that much.\n\nIf you've (sadly) never gotten the chance to play Wipeout, it's a futuristic racing game set at an absurd speed as you careen through gravity defying courses, shooting off missiles and hitting speed boosts along the way to fend off competitors. Flashout 2 recreates this almost exactly, but what it loses is everything that makes Wipeout such an addictive, visceral game in the first place.\n\nFirst on the chopping block are the controls, which have the dubious honor of being among the most unnecessarily convoluted control schemes of any game I've ever played. Every pickup is tied to a different button (or direction on the analog stick), and these are explained through a horrendous button map screen and almost hilariously bad tutorial, which couldn't even be bothered to remove the "tap the screen" text from the original mobile version.\n\nSecondly, the racing itself is plagued by extreme repetition and a noticeable lack of any sense of speed. Each of the games ten tracks are almost entirely indistinguishable from each other, and are so plainly designed that I was already tired of them the first time around, let along the hundreds you'll be seeing them throughout the campaign. The different ships you can pilot all feel more or less identical, with the only difference being each is slightly faster than the last and takes more to blow up, but even when you're flying at seemingly impossible speeds it doesn't feel like you are. Flying through races in Flashout 2 is unbelievable dull and tame in what it attempts, which for a game that bills itself upon light-speed futuristic racing is a huge problem.\n\nFurther to this point, the handling is especially odd, with a bizarre alignment problem that feels halfway between an overly controlling assist and another person trying to steer your vehicle at the same time. It's awkward and I have no explanations for why it is how it is, or what reason the developer could have for making it this way (assuming it's not simply another of the many bugs of the game). Online multiplayer is a joke, lacking any way to invite friends, and opting to use your PC's name instead of your Steam handle.\n\nGraphically there's a lot happening on screen, but none of it is particularly impressive. Textures are blurry and simple, and the color pallet virtually unchanged from every race in the game. Particle effects lack any power behind them, seeming more like excessive lens flare than explosions. If there is anything nice I can say about the game, it would be that the soundtrack is actually not half bad, and in another context I might actually enjoy listening to it.\n\nI had high hopes for Flashout 2, despite its always questionable mobile origins, but it failed on a fundamental level to deliver even a small dose of the excitement I get whenever I play the series that "inspired" it. Even taken by itself, there's nothing fun or impressive about anything Jujubee S.A. has done, and the more I dug into it the lazier they seemed, with an abundance of bugs and mobile-port carryovers that have no business in a PC version.\n\nAt this point I guess it's time to make another sacrifice at Sony's altar and hope they bring Wipeout back, because this just isn't cutting it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 9, 2014","false","2.7"," 82 of 98 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","82","98","3","7"

The gameplay is basically done for you, you can't even turn around on the damned track if you wanted to. It basically auto steer's and aims the same. I came wanting a game faithful to the old wipeouts, and the advertisements promised it, and were presented pretty well, but not at all reflected the actual gameplay.

It almost reminded me of a less complex variation of FzeroX for the N64. It was pretty fun for a few races. Then the glitches started pouring in. The basic AI functionality seems flawed to its core. Some races are unwinnable as AIs hit the improbability drive to appear at the finish line while others appear to forget that they left their parking breaks on at the race's start line. Normally I could find some of this forgivable, however once I made my way to the proverbial final boss level... Well the level just wouldn't load. I tried reloading it several times and changing every setting I could to no avail. This kind of coding error is unforgivable.

Think Again.\n\nThis game had me excited from the moment I checked out the videos; I was extremely disappointed though. Nothing on this game how it should. The graphics hit the mark in a futuristic way, but lack any real brilliance or high quality. You use the shop to upgrade your car but most of the add-ons are quite overpriced. This means you are prevented from playing the season until you win a ton of tournaments. You won’t want to win that many.\n\nThe actual racing portion was ultimately the deal breaker. This game reminds me of an endless runner more than a racing game. You only need to go forward and you can finish the race, there aren't any challenging obstacles other than the other competitors. It's extremely easy to die so get used to the wonky key bindings early so that you can have a fighting chance to win.\n\nWorth $0.50 or so; I would suggest passing on this offering though.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

When I won my first online race, I also unlocked the "50 online races" and the "100 online races" ones, and at some point during the game, I unlocked the "complete 100% career" thingy achievement, while I only did about 5%.\n--\nGood, bad, it'll depends. My first start was a little bit weird as you're kinda thrown away, and you've got to find your way around in the menu, but I was quickly invited to play the tutorials (in two parts). The first was fine, even though I didn't really know what I was doing, and I couldn't finish the second one, totally lost it at some point. I'm not really sure if the tutorial helps, but the game itself is, I guess, rather simple to play. You press W and you go at your maximum speed, which will be rather slow at the start (you better fly over the speedboost). The ship felt responsive, and I could feel the speed, but the camera is bad. You can't really see where you are going, and what's going on in front of you. I'd say the core of the gameplay is rather nice and fun. I tried some multiplayer, won the match, but I have no idea if I was playing against actual players, or bots, as the game uses your computer name's (yes, I was Marshall-PC!, it could at least ask for a name to enter, or use Steam's name). Felt pretty easy, but once again, bots or real players, who knows. Graphically speaking, I like the style of the game, the colors and some nice little effects, but you can't just say it has "High-end visuals" and is "HD". Well sure it is HD if you play in 720P, 1080P and maybe more, but the texture are bad, and isn't HD at all (if I'm not right, I maxed them out). Now about the music, well, I liked the music, well, the three songs I heard. I'm not sure if you unlock for as you play, but it felt repetitive, even tho it was nice overall. There's some cutscenes (not 3D or using game's engine, but a sort of comic style) with poor, really poor voice acting (and not all the lines at present). It is better than nothing. For a $10 game, can you ask for more? Well, I don't really think so. It's in overall a nice game for 10 bucks, and I hope for the players that there'll be players for the online for some time. I would recommend the game to have some fun, maybe with some friends! If I had to give a rating, I'd say 7/10. It's a $10 game, lack some details graphically and have a rather clunky menu when you first play (you get used to it very fast), but it's fun and responsive.","June 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","3"

This is a clunky/buggy Wipeout clone riddled with issues. The interface is unintuative and provides no information on how to change which vehicle you're going to pilot. The tutorial tells you what to do, but not how to do it... ie. buttons are not displayed on screen during the tutorial.  Also the "Failed" pop up screen during the tutorial doesn't accept gamepad input. There is no victory ceremony after having won a cup. The voice acting is on par with House of the Dead as some of the worst I've ever heard. The empty multiplayer lobbies do not allow you to invite Steam friends to race, leaving you to race A.I. bots in multiplayer. Even with all of it's shortcomings if they had only included local splitscreen multiplayer I would have been happy, but they didn't.

They are like IOS games. From far-away, wow it's pretty good, and then close-up, it's complete crap. The only reason you wont notice the crap graphics most of the time is because the freakin' game has major bloom effect going on and it's all just a blurry mess. That isn't how you make a game look cool ffs! Even the backgrounds are complete ♥♥♥♥. On the France level there is a 2D Eiffel tower. Really? it's freakin' 2014 and you have 2D images in your backgrounds??\n\nOh yeah and the voice acting... WTF also. It's really bad and sounds like ♥♥♥♥. One of the rival characters in the game is Duke Nukem for some reason, it's just stupid.\n\nAnd guess what? The weapons are just plain bad. You cannot tell if the 'guns' are actually hitting, most of the time they miss and then sometimes the enemy will explode in 2 seconds like you hit them with a death-ray. The 'rockets'(really smart rockets are dumbfire, missiles have guidance systems to lock-on, they can't even name the weapons right) require a lock-on mechanism to hit the target but it's a total piece of ♥♥♥♥, once again! It will lock and if you don't hit that button right away too bad it breaks lock and your 'rockets' go into a wall. And quite often if you get a lock the damn things wont even catch-up to a freakin' enemy. And if the enemy racer hits a jump while your 'rockets' are following they will disapear... WTF!\n\nOnly buy this game if it's $0.99.\n\nI will give it 1/10 for creating a sense of speed at times and the music is decent. Everything else is just crap!","June 6, 2014","false","4.5"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews - it seems like most folks on here are biased against racing games anyway, so I think that's why.\n\nThe controller works just fine (there's an options menu off the main menu where you can choose input) and it's got a great soundtrack. Graphics are good enough - sure, it's a mobile port so the graphics *could* be better on your uber:pc but you know what this is a low budget racer and its not like you're paying full whack for it - the graphics are good enough and when you're whizzing down the tracks at a zillion mph you should probably be concentrating on the gameplay instead!!\n\nI got it on sale, so I'm super happy with my purchase but I don't think I'd be too disappointed at full price.

Fo2 has the same feel in terms of speed and turning, but the graphical environments are not as "cool". I understand the criticisms of this game, but for less than serious gamers, Fo2 is quite entertaining. The 1st single race for the Redox trophy has some sort of code bug which causes the player to be trapped within "infinite laps", never going beyond lap 1. Of course I did about 50 laps, made 100,000 ducats, but quit the race, lost the money...I figured out how to get beyond the bug by winning the other 4 races for the tourney after quitting the 1st one. Red Swan is beatable; one just has to be perfect in terms of hitting all the speed boosts, laying mines in the right place, and collecting Nitro powerups. (You can figure out how to do that exactly without me spoiling it completely). Also, Fo2 is much better than the racer simulators found through Linux repositories; using WINE is a security risk, so we linux folks make the best of what games we can currently use for our platforms and flavors.  Finally, maps with long straightaways (London) are actually...soothing; there might be a market for driving simulators where the object is to just "chill".","April 25, 2015","true","20.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of the problems for me was the layout of the controlles, but at least you can re-bind them.","June 8, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Unlike most racing games I've seen on Steam that are rooted in modern day reality & are sims, this is fast paced & arcadey, & feels like I'm playing a game like F-Zero with weaponry that, for me, brings Mario Kart or Wpeout to mind. All this being said, if you wanna play a racing game but don't feel like playing a sim, you can't go wrong with this.","August 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I bought it on sale and id probs buy it off sale now knowing what the games like also to all the people complaining about how it doesnt have full controller support if you go into ur settings and click controller instead of the keyboard it works so maybe just check that next time you think of giving a game a bad review because of that this game is amazing and i plan to get many hours out of this i normally dont even write reviews :D Moral of this is buy this game !!!","March 27","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
