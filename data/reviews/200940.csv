"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwordOfLegend/recommended/200940/","SwordOfLegend","Supreme Gentooman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwordOfLegend/","80 products in account","It all started when I was 7 years old. My parents gave me a Sega Genesis and a copy of Sonic the Hedgehog for christmas. I fell in love with it the moment I booted up the game.  The graphics, the music, the speed! It overwhelmed my young mind. I played it for hours on end, memorizing each level, the location of every powerup, every enemy, every single ring. It was the only thing I did, I stopped going outside and playing with my friends, for Sonic was the only friend I needed. Eventually I became unsatisfied, I needed a new Sonic the Hedgehog game to fuel my addiction. My prayers were answered with the release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. My parents refused to buy it for me. They believed I was too obsessed with the first one and knew that buying the second one would only make my obsession worse. This devestated me. I NEEDED that game, I felt like an alcoholic going through withdrawl. I lost all of my spirit, I had trouble sleeping at night, and sometimes I would experience hallucinations where Sonic was in the room with me. I begged my parents every day, but they wouldn't budge. I felt I had lost the will to live. Thankfully, I got the game. I aquired it the same way every kid got something that they wanted but their parents wouldn't buy for them, Grandma. I was overjoyed, finally I could experience the masterpiece that is known as Sonic The Hedgehog 2. This time he was accompanied by Tails! I was delighted. I played this game, and mastered it like I had the original. By now I had lost contact with society, I didn't talk to anybody at school, I had no friends, and I never left the house. This didn't bother me though, in fact I preferred it that way. Just as I started to get bored of that game, Sonic 3 came out. My obsession had hit an all-time high, I was amazed at the quality of that game. We now had Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. They were my friends, or "The Gang" as I called them. My parents were scared of me now. If they tried to take the game away from me, I would throw a tantrum and break things until they gave it back. No amount of reasoning, counseling, or Native American rituals could change me, because by now Sonic had was not just an obsession, but a lifestyle. I lived and breathed Sonic. But then came the dark days, no sonic games were coming out. Sega had stopped supporting the Genesis, and had launched the Saturn. I didn't have one, but that didn't matter. No new Sonic games were coming out. There were rumors, but the only one that ever turned out to be true was Sonic R. I saw it as an abomination, how could Sega do that to Sonic? After several years I had just about given up. I would often times cry myself to sleep, believing that Sega had given up on the blue hedgehog that I had come to adore. I wrote my own stories about Sonic, but they weren't enough. But then it happened. I was at the grocery store with my mother, when I saw it: A magazine with a picture of the Sega Dreamcast plastered right on the cover. I begged my mom to buy it for me, and she did, relieved that I wanted something that wasn't Sonic related, or so she thought. I read the articles about the upcoming system, and then I saw what I have been wanting to see for years, a new Sonic game was in the works, and it was 3D too! My life had a purpose again. When the day finally came, I was there. I was the first in line, I had convinced poor old Grandma to buy it for me, and I made sure I got a copy of Sonic Adventure. If the games on the Genesis amazed me, Sonic Adventure left me speechless. The worlds were so detailed, the graphics so realistic, the music blew me away. This was the way Sonic was meant to be. It rekindled the fire that had laid dormant in me that is Sonic. I wrote more fanfiction, I made my own fancharacters and I even shipped them. Then I realized something, Sonic wasn't just a blue hedgehog on TV, He was a part of me. I became one with Sonic. If you want to be like me and know what truly matters in life, I fully recommend this game to you. Sonic is more than just a game, Sonic is a way of life.","October 29, 2014","true","42.0"," 195 of 250 people (78%) found this review helpful 134 people found this review funny","78","195","250","134","30"

That being an extremely rare thing to say for a sega title.\nThe game is a constant GOTTAGOFAST type deal were experienced players can rush through every stage with absolutely no break in the momentum (so unlike the first and 3rd games were enemies and the level design were made to stop you in your tracks/make you think about how you'll go about it) and rush to get the best possible speedrun time. It's also easy enough for inexperienced players to get into and eventually "git gud"\nThis is my first time actually writing a legitimate review, and hopefully wont be my last because this game is an extremely special case. If you are even so much as slightly considering buying this game, GO FOR IT. IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.\n10/10 Just enough water - IGN.\n*Side notes\n-Yes i'm aware i have a measly 5 hours clocked in on steam, but multiply that by 100 in terms of the sonic gems collection port.

Between getting from the start to the finish of the level, Sonic can collect rings. These rings are insurance. If you get hit with rings, they all spray out of the hedgehog. If you get hit without any rings, Sonic dies and its back to the last checkpoint. If you have 50 rings at the end of the level, you can jump up into a giant ring that lets you do a bonus stage for a chance to get a chaos emerald. The bonus stage feels like Sega's version of Sonic running around a Mario Kart track. After every 2 levels comes a boss level that has you stock up on rings or lives before you face the boss Robotnik. The game breezed by in a few hours without me noticing.\n\nFor those that haven't played any Sonic games from the 90s, the controls are simple enough to use one button. That one button is jump if you're standing or running. If you're ducking and push the button it charges up a spinball. When you release the down direction, Sonic will fire off with a super boost of speed. If you press down while running, Sonic tucks into a ball that will damage enemies.\n\nThe real gimmick of Sonic CD is the ability to go into the past or future. You do this by first hitting a sign and then going so fast that you will either go to the era. It feels like nothing more than a pallet swap. There are changes here and there, but you won't need to visit one era or another to progress. Plus there is a screen that takes Sonic to the era and it stops the gameplay. There's not that much variety in gameplay. Even the brief water levels only slow down Sonic, forcing you to find air bubbles to breathe. He can't swim or anything.\n\nFor the explorers out there, jumping between past, present and future will reveal secrets. Visit the past to improve the future. When you make two levels have good futures, the third level will take place in the good future. Without the exploration, every level goes by after a few minutes.\n\nNew to the series is a Metal Sonic who kidnaps Amy shortly into the game. At some point you will need to race Metal Sonic to get her back. It adds to the unique boss fights. The boss battles are what make the game stand out from other old school Sonic games. You need to defeat each Robotnik boss in different ways other than the traditional 'hit him.' Some you'll need to run fast while dodging objects. Others you'll need to go up on hovering rocks and still others involve chasing him.\n\nSince the game came out between Sonic 2 and 3 there are only a few items to find in boxes. Items like extra lives, 10 extra rings, super fast shoes, temporary invincibility and a shield barrier that lets Sonic take an extra hit. There is nothing new that you won't find in the first two Sonic games.\n\nUnique to the Sonic CD is an animated cartoon introduction and then another when you beat the game, before and as credits roll. Both are nice to look at and pretty brief. They add some much needed flair outside the game to make it feel different from the other old school Sonic games. Sonic CD shouldn't take more than 3 hours to complete. Once you complete the game, it unlocks Tails as a playable character. Tails is a fox that plays the same as Sonic, but if you tap the jump button in mid air, Tails can helicopter around for a while. I can understand why he is an unlockable character, because with him it becomes far too easy to just hover over entire levels.\n\nThe game feels easy up until a point, which lets new players get far into the game before it gets challenging.  To add to how easy the game is, if you use all your lives, you start at the same level you were at, instead of restarting the zone. The backgrounds are beautiful and have a lot going on. The levels feel large enough to get lost in. The real challenge is traversal, because the enemies are quite forgettable. Sonic will be bouncing off of springs, doing loops, running up ramps, zooming through tubes, running against treadmills, avoiding crushing blocks, hopping on enemies, running around what I can only call gears, but they're not and much more. It didn't feel to me like there were many moments for Sonic to get up to top speed.\n\nEven with the future and past dynamic, the game feels like a big sidestep from Sonic 2. There is nothing new here, but is that a bad thing?","November 11, 2014","true","3.5"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","4"

Even the old FMV sequences are in HD & look a ton better.  This is probably the best version of Sonic CD you can get & even surpasses the original in every single way.\n\nIt's still kind of confusing when compared to other 2D Sonic games.  The goal isn't to reach the end as fast as possible.  You have to find some wierd projection machines & destroy them & then do something...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mettaur3/recommended/200940/","mettaur3","Mettaur3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mettaur3/","83 products in account","Ah, Sonic CD. Arguably one of the only games worth owning on the ill-fated Sega CD, this title takes the classic Sonic formula of high-speed, momentum-based platforming and adds time travel to the mix, and this is the feature that will make or break the game for you. Scattered throughout the levels are signposts with 'past' and 'future' written on them. Running past one of the signs, then building up enough speed, will send Sonic backwards or forwards in time. Each level actualy has four variations: the past, the present, and the good and bad futures. This generaly works well (although I did get once stuck in a wall after warping to the past), with the differences in layout between the time periods providing for some interesting platforming, and adds to the game's greater focus on exploration.\nIn each Zone (called Acts in other Sonic games) there are two objects to destroy in the past: Eggman's robot generators, and Metal Sonic holigram projectors. Destroying the projectors results in animals roaming about the Zone, to no effect whatsoever. However, destroying a generator will result in all enemies in the Zone instantly being destroyed, as well as changing the future. You see, if you travel to the future normaly, it's a corupted wastland, a bad future. By destroying the generators, you can alter the future, creating the harmonious good futures instead. However, this only applies to the first and second Zones of each Round (called Zones in other Sonic games). In the 3rd Zone of each Round you start in the future; if you destroyed the generator in both other Zones, this will be a good future, and if not, a bad future. Locating the generators can be quite tricky, due to the non-linear, multi-level stage design, and the Zones in this game can be hard to navigate. In addition to all that, to get the game's true ending, you have to make good futures in every single Zone. Or, instead, you could get 50 rings during a Zone, reach the signpost, and enter 3D, UFO-Smashing special stage to collect the Time Stones. Getting all 7 will automaticly get you a good future in every zone, and and guarantee you the good ending.\nThis is where the game's main problem rears it's ugly head: It claims to have a focus on exploration, but there's really no point to actualy exploring. Getting the Time Stones is so much easier then smashing every single generator, and once you have them, the level design can seem like more of a hinderence then anything. Worse, if you don't care about geting the good ending, and just want to play this like any other clasic sonic game, you might find the level design to be an outright hindrance, with few places to pick up and keep speed. Whether you find the level design to be a blessing (huge, beautiful stages, full of interesting gimmicks) or a curse (massive, mazelike, slow hells) will depend mostly on your playstyle, and is almost entirely subjective.\nOn a more positive note, this game looks realy good. The game's been updated with 16:9 widescreen support, and you can use one of various filters if you wish to. The game also sounds great, with both the US and JP/EU soundtracks being available to choose from. Each version is great, and having them both is absolutely fantastic. As this is an updated rerelease of the game, various improvements have been made, including tweeked collision detection in both the main game and the special stages, the above-mentioned dual soundtracks and widescreen support, and Tails as a playable character, unlocked after beating the game with Sonic.\nAlthough level design may be subpar for some, Sonic CD is still a good game with a lot to offer, and if you enjoy hunting for secrets, the game has you covered with large levels, each possessing four variants, and lots of little touches that fun to find. Having exploration as it's main focus, rather than being secondary to speedy platforming, may make it the black sheep of the Genesis titles, but the game still nails the smooth platforming that defines classic Sonic. This version is without a doubt the best way to experience Sonic CD, and for just $5, I'd definitely reccomend this game.","November 27, 2013","true","17.5"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","1"

The SEGA / MEGA CD was a rididulously priced add on for its time and it produced some good gems and known for their hillarious novelty. The developer of this game from what I read online built this game from scratch to make it HD. They did a very good job of building this game. However, I can't understand why the Japanese Intro when you start a new game does not have any lyrics to it. Because of the Smooth Framerate you may have difficulty passing certain points of the game. The worst part of the game is Stage 2-3 (I think is Collision Chaos) The Smooth framerate makes it next to impossible to go up to the top and defeat Dr Robotnik) You need real skill to do this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Modernu/recommended/200940/","Modernu","Modernest (Dead for exams)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Modernu/","107 products in account","In my opinion, this game is certainly the best game in the 2D sonic series, I might go as far to say the best game in the franchise. Whilst a lot of people will say this game is overrated and isn't as good as games like Sonic 2 or Sonic 3 & Knuckles, I beg to differ.\n\nSonic CD is your normal every-day side scroller with our favorite blue hedgehog, whilst a lot of people think this game didn't bring as many new things to the table as it could have, it brought in great new features with the inclusion of Past and Future signs. Once you run into one of these signs, you'll have to keep your momentum and run for a certain period of time. If you lose speed or hit an obstacle you'll lose this ability. But if you keep up your speed, you'll be transported to a Past/Future orientation of the current stage. The past orientations usually show the stage at a much better time, with greenery and a serene atmosphere, a lot nicer in contrast to the future versions of the stage which either look chaotic, rusted or dull and overrun with machinery. Along the game you'll run into collapsed robot transporters, if you go back in the past of the level and return to them you can break them, resulting in a good future for the stage, if you go all the way to the future in the current stage you'll be greeted with a Good Future rendition of the stage, the Good Future's are like the Bad Futures in terms of the technology, but they look a lot more wonderful and are all generally amazing to go through.\n\nAn alternate way to get all the good futures (And the good ending) Is to collect all the time stones by finishing the stage with 50 rings and jumping into the giant ring at the end. This will transport you to the special stages of the game. Which compared to the other 2D sonic games, are very unique. They take place in a 3D enviroment in which sonic has to jump and destroy UFO's to complete the stage, it may sound simple but the stages are usually surrounded in water. If sonic lands in the water, 10 seconds are lost instantly making it very hard at times, especially in the last two stages. Whilst I find the controls to be sluggish, these stages are certainly the most unique in the sonic series.\n\n\nAside from the tenses in this game, it also presents something new in the sonic series, it posesses 2 sountracks which can be accessed in the steam version. Whilst I believe the US soundtrack has the best tracks, the Japanese soundtrack also has some of the best music, it also contains one of the most iconic themes in the sonic series, the Stardust Speedway Bad Future track.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the sonic series, I'd recommend it to anyone in general. 10/10 from me.","March 17, 2014","true","29.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cobaltbw/recommended/200940/","cobaltbw","CobaltBW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cobaltbw/","66 products in account","Sonic CD is a pretty good game that took advantage of some great ideas, but after multiple playthroughs, I felt that it was marred by noticeable flaws which dragged down what would otherwise have been a solid game.\n\n\n\nTime travel enhances the exploration factor to Sonic's already multi-tiered level design by creating secondary objectives that require seeking out specific objects, in addition to changing the terrain for each time zone. This gameplay element is reinforced thematically; if you don't find the badnik spawners, the zone enters a Bad Future where Eggman has soiled the landscape... but if you do destroy them, things look even better than in the Present, and as a bonus all of the enemies are destroyed. I always feel a certain sense of satisfaction from going to the Past, destroying the spawner, and then going into the Future of that same level to enjoy the scenery and rack up rings and 1ups ("I did this, and now I'm reaping the rewards"). You can also create a good future by collecting all of the time stones (which also gives you the "good" ending, as miniscule a difference as it is).\n\nThere are two main problems with this factor of the game: the sole method of travelling through time is obnoxious, and the secondary objective is ultimately not well incentivized.\n\nTime posts allow you to try to build up speed; once this hedgehog reaches 88 mph, a cutscene will play and Sonic will then find himself in the same spot forward or backward in time. Well... it's inaccurate to say you go through time by "building up speed", it's more that you go at "run speed" for a certain amount of time, then the HUD indicator starts blinking, and if you're still at running speed for a certain amount of time, you complete the time travel sequence... otherwise you lose the ability.\n\nThis system is stiff and unforgiving. Sonic's camera doesn't give you enough room to plan ahead for certain terrain when going fast, which makes it very easy to lose momentum just after you reach the "blink" mode. Unless you stop, walk around the act, and strategize a track that you can sprint through, it's usually more favorable to find two springs close to each other so you can bounce around and circumvent the challenge in a stupidly easy fashion. It all feels very clunky and not exceptionally well skill indexed.\n\nIt would have been more favorable if Sonic could go through time by finding giant rings or something similar, like at the end of the levels or in Sonic 3's hidden rooms. Actually, why not make it so that Sonic's peel-out mode instantly transports Sonic to the next time zone so you don't even have to create this ugly speed system for it? The peel-out isn't even that great of an addition to begin with; the spindash lets you do pretty much the same thing but in roll mode.\n\nThe other thing is that it's honestly a lot easier to create good futures by just beating the special stages. You don't have to go through the time post ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or hunt for the spawners, and plus you only have to do it seven times if you're good enough (there are twice as many spawners in comparison, not counting the Metal Sonic holograms), and so if you just want to beat the game optimally and quickly, you really just have to ignore the Past for the most part, which devalues a good chunk of the gameplay. And hell, even if the game allowed you to start every level in the Past, you'd still have to figure out where the spawner actually is, which sometimes feels like finding a needle in a haystack. And once you find it, there's usually very little opposition keeping you from actually destroying it, which makes it a bit underwhelming.\n\nI love the idea behind the time travel gimmick, and it's a great fit for Sonic's levels because of how diverse and multilinear they are to begin with. However, I also believe it's not as good of a fit for Sonic's _mechanics_ as it would have been for other platformers, like Metroid or Castlevania, or even something fairly simple like Mario. Levels with time travel dynamics work best when it creates design space for puzzles, exploration, and combat. While Sonic does inherently have a good deal of exploration, it's far more focused on the momentum-based physics than it is on gimmick puzzles or even badniks, and so it's difficult to really expand on this through the game's gimmick.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of badniks, this game is hands-down the easiest of the classics. Sonic Team had some of the best ideas for bosses in this game, but they're squandered due to positioning/blink time exploits on the player's part as well as overall just being too forgiving. There are very few death pits in this game in general, the only one even coming to mind being on the last level, and the final boss itself is a joke. It's still possible to game over if you're new at the game, but otherwise the difficulty curve is very shallow.\n\n\n\nThe environments are really gorgeous and diverse, probably some of my favorite from the 16-bit era. IMO this is what actually makes the game memorable. I will say that the backgrounds are a bit too "busy" in terms of contrast, which sometimes makes it a little difficult to follow the action.\n\n\n\nThis port allows you to choose between the American and Japanese soundtrack, and both are nice in their own ways. The Japanese version has the kind of "bounce" and focus on melodic motifs that you would expect from the Sonic franchise, but Spencer Nelson centralizes more around rock and ambience, which is a great fit for the Future levels. This port in particular creates looppoints to all of the original tunes, and some of the American tunes even take advantage of extended arrangements previously only featured in the album "Sonic the Hedgehog BOOM". Overall a very nice sound package. (Now if only we had American "Past" variants... )\n\n\n\n\nIf you already knew about this game and are wondering which version is the best, it's definitely Steam's. If you're wondering if this is the go-to Sonic game... some diehards will tell you otherwise, but I would say Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles are preferable in terms of gameplay. The boons of the time travel gimmick aren't present in these games, but both games offer a more satistfying challenge and are quite a bit longer than Sonic CD. If you just want a decent platformer on Steam, then I would recommend this.","September 2, 2014","true","27.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

When Sonic passes certain posts in the game world he gains the ability to transport himself through time by gaining enough speed for several seconds (an obvious inspiration from Back to the Future).\n\nEach stage features a design for the current time period (whether it's a good/bad future, present or the past) complete with new colours, different enemy patterns and an alternate arrangement of both the level layout and music. Such variety for a game released in 1993 is stunning (as each level essentially comes in four flavours) and it helps set Sonic CD apart from the generally lacklustre titles that call the Sega Mega CD console home.\n\nAlthough the method of time travel is clunky, it remains an interesting mechanic and part of the game's advanced challenge as the only way to secure a truly good ending is to visit levels in the past and destroy a robot-producing factory present in each one.\n\nWhen you add in an impressive 3D bonus stage, a time attack mode and other unlockables that save to your console's internal memory; you've got a truly great Mega CD title that keeps very small company.\n\nThis HD remaster on Steam was helmed by wizard programmer Christian Whitehead and is the best way to experience Sonic CD today, and after many years the game is finally reaching the larger audience it deserved on current generation consoles and mobile devices.\n\nThe time this game spent as my #1 video game was time admittedly obstructed by nostalgia, as very few people I spoke to then had any knowledge of this special game at all; making the whole thing feel like a more personal experience than usual.\n\nThe gameplay isn't as fast or exciting as Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the challenge is a bit lax and the overall level design does leave a lot to be desired.\n\nBut Sonic CD is still a good game and it's one that has aged remarkbly well thanks to this gorgeous HD remaster.\n\nRead the full Sonic CD retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]\n\nRead a Sonic CD soundtrack retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]","February 27","true","1.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Add in a more than reasonable price of $4.99USD and this is a steal especially in a packaged deal or sale.\n\nThis game has the most replayability of any 2D Sonic. The deepest gameplay concepts. The best sound and music. Best cutscenes. AND the best sense of speed, which is Sonic's main claim to fame afterall!\n\nIts a shame so many fans of Sonic have missed this title over the years.

The internet kept telling me about how amazing it was and how it was the best 2D Sonic game ever. I bought the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005 and that was my first chance to play Sonic CD. I didn't see what was so great about it. In fact, I saw a lot of negative stuff. Fast forward to today, and I'm still not sold, although that's not a surprise since this is just a port.\n\nThe level design and art style in Sonic CD is just downright atrocious. The color scheme chosen for the later half of the levels is all over the place. The first level, Palmtree Panic, is bright and colorful; something you'd expect a Sonic game's first level to be. Once you're past that though, everything goes crazy. Collision Chaos' bright pink layout or Wacky Workbench's muddled purple shadows don't lend themselves to memorable imagery. I remember Angel Island or Green Hill zone very vividly, as those zones had their own color schemes that while popping out, created a lasting image in your head. How about Ice Cap zone or Lava Reef zone? All of the zones in Sonic 1-3 had character and personality and I can recall them very clearly. Here, I can't remember anything past Palmtree Panic. The worst offenders are the last half of the levels, from Quartz Quadrant onward. These all have a generic industrial feel to them with odd color choices that made my eyes hurt eventually.\n\nAnd I even haven't gotten to the level design. You thought the colors and art were all over place? You haven't seen anything yet. The level design in Sonic CD is - and I know I've said this a lot but I seriously mean it - ALL OVER THE PLACE. Again Palmtree Panic isn't too bad but you can still see hints of what's to come early on. There are sections in the level that literally look like they've been copied and pasted around. There are tiles that don't connect cleanly with other tiles and then there's just some plain old bad platform placement. Seriously, it's as if someone used a selection tool and highlighted random parts of the levels and shuffled them around in random places. The levels are also filled to the brim with really random gimmicks that don't compliment each other that well, the clearest offender of this being Wacky Workbench, where background objects can hurt you, floor panels can launch you, and other weird stuff. Most of my time playing through the levels I was just struggling to keep Sonic from flying around all over the place and then all of a sudden the level will be over. Overall, the levels are a mess and by the time they're over you will not remember anything about it. There is just no clean flow to the game, and for a momentum based platformer, that is a big flaw.\n\nThe cherry on top of all this? This is the first Sonic game to incorparate an actual mechanic about going fast. There are posts sprinkled througout the levels labeled "PAST" and "FUTURE". If you hit one of these signs you'll get an indicator you're ready to go to that time period. To actually pull off the time travel Sonic needs to go fast and maintain a fast speed for a couple of seconds. You can already see the problem with this. Because the level design is so clunky and messy, random obstacles will probably stop you from getting to or maintaing top speed. You remember those stupid little speed traps that were in the original trilogy? You know, like those small little platforms where there was two springs on each side and if you so wanted to you could just drop Sonic in there and he'd bounce back and forth endlessly? In some areas they had to put those kinds of traps next to the posts in order to give players an easy way to time travel. If that isn't proof that something isn't working right with your base level design then I'm not sure what is.\n\nAs for the time travelling mechanic itself it's nothing interesting. It's one of the two ways to get the true ending, the other being collecting all of the chaos emer- oh, I'm sorry, "time stones". May I mention that Sonic CD has probably the worst special stages I've seen in the 2D games? Imagine the Sonic 3 special stages but instead of only being able to move at 90 degree angles, you have full 360 rotational control over Sonic. UFOs fly around the stage and you have to destroy them all to get the time stone. Okay, doesn't sound too bad right? Well, first off, Sonic turns like a freaking rock, making hitting the UFOs really frustrating. If you've ever played Sonic R, that's how sluggish Sonic turns. Secondly, the stages themselves are filled with "void" zones, and if you're in these zones even for just a second, you lose a TON of time, and you automatically fail if you run out of time. Overall it's just an annoying diversion and not a fun way to get the time stones, like the Sonic 2 or 3's special stages.\n\nAnyways, so the time mechanic. For starters, it's not really explained that well. What you have to do is go to the past period of the zone you're in and destroy the machines Eggman/Robotnik has placed. Doing so changes the future of the zone into a "good" future, and if you do this for every zone you can get the true ending, instead of having to deal with the silly special stages. The thing is, you have to actually stop and explore levels to find the machines and traditional Sonic level design doesn't lend itself to exploration very well. It's all about going forward and finding new routes at the same time. But see, it's even worse here because the level design in Sonic CD is so messy it's even harder to explore. Aside from that, there is no point in going to the future period until you've destroyed the past machine. I know the bad future zones are supposed to be ruined and nasty looking but the present zones shouldn't look funky too!\n\nTo this day Sonic CD is praised almost unanimously and I still don't see why. Just play one of the genesis trilogy games and then play Sonic CD, the difference in quality will be as clear as night and day.\n\nBoth the US and JP soundtracks are great, though...","April 8, 2014","false","4.0"," 61 of 104 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","61","104","0","14"

This is a platform/speed game just so everyone knows. The game's story focuses on Sonic the Hedgehog as he infiltrates a once peaceful, but now mechanized planet. Doctor Eggman, Sonic's nemesis, uses the planet's time travelling properties to make it his own headquarters. He also has Sonic's robotic counterpart Metal Sonic capture Amy Rose. Sonic must travel through time to save Amy, foil Eggman's plans and bring peace back to the world. I will always recommend a Sonic game, except Sonic 06, but that's not the point, now isn't it? Anyways, to get the good ending, (For people who love good endings) go through the past signs, run really fast without getting stopped, go to the past, release the animals in a hidden capsule, go back to future if you wan't, then get around 50 rings or so (optional), go into the giant ring at the goal and try to break all purple capsules before time runs out, slipping in water decreases time, green capsules grant time, and you'll earn the time stone. To get the not as good ending (if you don't really care and just wan't to play the game), just get through the levels. Basically, I recommend this game to anyone, I won't mind if you don't wan't the game, but it seems like you would be missing out if it's a no.","November 21, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'd say it is on the easy side compared to the rest of the 2D Sonic games, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The levels themselves are very well crafted and the game has a stellar soundtrack, switchable between the  far superior Japanese and the still pretty good US version. The whole past and future mechanic gives it good replayability, especially since there are like 4 variations per level. It also has a ton of unlockables and an additional mode where Tails is a playable character unlike the original. I've already played it countless times on iOS and Playstation Network, this version is just as good if not better than those.

You travel to the past and have to explore the entire level (bearing in the 10 minute time limit) to find some objects to blow up so you can get a good ending. Hard when past signs are rarer than future signs and half the time you end up accidentally going to the future because you can't slow down, which has no real benefit other than a lack of enemies when you clear out the objects in the past. You have to do all this crap to get a good ending for each level, although I heard you can just do it the old fashioned way, getting enough rings and doing the special stage at the end of each level.\n- Some bosses are pretty badly designed or a massive pain to beat, like the pinball boss.","February 19","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's drop below 2.50 or your regional equivalent.\n\nIt's the exact same obscurely loved Sonic CD we all know from that popular SEGA CD. I adore the option to change the video filter to Sharp, Smooth or Nostaglia. It runs at a smooth framerate and it's in HD! It comes with a time attack, leaderboards and the ability to change the soundtrack to US or Japan. It actually has achivements that took me around ten hours to achieve.\n\nIt comes with extras such as videos and a soundtrack selection in the game. Don't you remember back in the "good-old days" when games would actually come with an soundtrack? Now, they charge us five to ten dollars for the soundtack.\n\nThe best part is you can play as Tails after you beat the game.\n\nHowever, I would like to mention: Sonic CD may have issues if you use an old computer. I gifted this game to three 3 steam users, who all own family, average intergrated-graphic old computers. They all had issues as the game refused to runs due to problems. One had Windows 7, other had Vista and the last one had XP. If I recall, one of them runs with an intel family graphic chip. We tried to update thier Direct X and such. So, be catious before purchasing.\nThis is based off my friends' experience. Yours may be different. Reguardless, you probably got this game from the Sonic Franchase bundle or from the amazon bundles.\n\nIn addition, they removed the Lyrics from You can do Anything.\n\nMy only complain is this game does not support Steam Cloud. So, if you delete your game, save data or restart your computer, you will lose your save and have to start over.\n\nI recommend you purchase this on your phone as its virtually  the same thing as the PC version. Unless you want to play it on your TV.","December 11, 2013","true","23.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

But, one of those rare times, Sega in particular decided to keep the game in all of its original, wonderful, glory and relaunch it with a great-as-ever look that fits most any resolution nicely with crisp, clear looks and vibrant, varying colors. I highly recommend it to any retro Sonic fan, or even newcomers to the games.","May 13, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltraAX/recommended/200940/","UltraAX","Shia Labeouf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltraAX/","14 products in account","This is an amazing remake of a fantastic Sega CD game. A classic reborn with HD visuals, 16:9 Widescreen, and Acheivments! This game also introduced a bunch of new concepts, and is the game that introduced Metal Sonic and Amy Rose!\n\nPlot - 8.0\n\nSame old, same old. Dr. Robotnik is up to no good and you have to stop him. Dr. Robotnik chained Little Planet to the side of a mountain, and Amy Rose gets kidnapped by Metal Sonic. So basically, you have to go and unchain Little Planet and rescue Amy Rose.\n\nGameplay - 9.5\n\nThe gameplay in this game is fantastic, and I actually liked the Super Peel-Out, a new move introduced in the Sega CD version of this game. The Super Peel-Out, if charged enough, will make Sonic blast off with a burst of speed, however, Sonic is vunerable during a Super Peel-Out. The Super Peel-Out aside, I really liked the Time Travelling concept. To Time Travel, touch a sign marked Future or Past, then run fast enough without stopping for enough time and you will be sent to the Past or Future, depending on which sign you touched. A neat little new thing was added in Sonic CD, Robot Teleporters. These can only be found in the past, and when destroyed, all badniks will explode, thus ridding that level of all of it's badniks. Other then all those new gameplay mechanics, the gameplay is what you would expect from your average Sonic game on a CD. By the way, Special Stages are torture. You run around a 3D field destroying UFOs. But there's a time limit, which makes the Special Stages so much harder then they need to be. Completing a Special Stage rewards you with a Time Stone. Collecting all seven Time Stones rewards you with the Good Ending. However, not getting all seven gets you the Bad Ending.\n\nGraphics - 8.0\n\nOkay, I'm not going to be too harsh on the graphics, this IS a remake, after all. There are three differant filters you can choose from. Nostalgic, which is pretty much the graphics from the original, but touched up so the screen isn't a blurry mess. Smooth, which smoothens the graphics so everything looks less pixelated, but all it really does is make the screen blurry. And the last available filter, Sharp, which pretty much makes the edges of pixels look REALLY pointy.The filters aside, the colors in the game are vibrant and my eyes love looking at the stages. Well, some of them. Some stages have bland colors, like Metallic Madness Present, and Wacky Workbench. Other then some bland colors, this game is pure eye candy.\n\nLevel Design - 7.0\n\nThe level design in this game isn't exactly the best, but is half decent. I give it a 7 because Spikes and Badniks are placed in the most trolling places. And seriously, why are there so many Badniks? There are way too many Badniks in most of the levels, and the level design can easily frustrate you.\n\nSoundtrack - 10.0\n\nThe soundtrack of this game is downright amazing. There are two soundtracks to choose from - the JP/EU soundtrack or the US soundtrack. I personally prefer the JP/EU soundtrack, but both are fantastic. The JP/EU soundtrack seems to be going for an Electronic feel, while the US soundtrack seems to be going for a Rock feel. Unfortunately, the producer of the JP/EU Intro and Ending theme had passed, so the developers could't obtain rights to use the lyrics for the Intro theme and the Ending theme.

After playing the Megadrive CD version last week, I figured I'd have to rehash my recommendation. Sonic CD features gameplay very similiar to Sonic 2, with slight changes to the spindash (reversible to S2 standards in the new port), and a time traveling mechanic. At certain points of the level, there are signposts that start a time traveling sequence you trigger by simply going fast. This will either make you go into the Future, or the Past. Each Level has 4 different versions of itself. A Present version, a Bad Future version (representing the bad guy winning), a Good Future version (representing Sonic stopping him), and a Past version, where you have to travel to in order to save the future. While this is a straightforward Sonic platformer in the quaint essence, it has a good variety of exploration as levels are laid out to be two-directional, which is necessary in this game as you have to sometimes go back in a level after you traveled to the Past in order to prevent Robotnik taking the area over, and as you might think, there are multiple endings reflecting your actions or lack of it. It's was a fantastic game back then, and still is nowadays, and the added widescreen support, new engine that fixes physics woes, the option to play as Tails as well as being able to choose the soundtrack wrap this well up as something you should definitely not miss having played if you are a platformer enthusiast, as being back as Sonic enthusiast since Generations, I can say it's definitely the franchise's best.","April 9, 2013","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its gimmick, time travel, offers an incentive to explore and map out the levels themselves, as well as providing opportunities for many little differences within single levels. The roboticizers and the holograms, which can be seen in both the past and the present, but can only be dealt with in the past, give a goal when hunting about the level. Destroying them rids the level of all enemies thus making it safe, or safer anyway, to go as fast as you please. The bonus stages offer up a new experience while being similar enough to the main game in concept to avoid breaking your rhythm. The cinematic at the start and the finish of the game frame it with a context and a healthy helping of Sonic Boom, a track that I just can't help but enjoy. The ending cinematic especially does a great job of releasing the tension built up throughout the game and leaving you thinking about all the exciting parts instead of those enemies that were made just to slow you down or the way Sonic seems to slip around like his sneakers are made of greasy bacon.","June 10, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also in this game, we are introduced to two new characthers in the franchise, Metal Sonic and, ugh... Amy Rose... ANYWAY, Sonic must stop Eggman from taking over the Little Planet before it's too late by retrieving the Time Stones, mystical gems that, when found all 7, (sound familiar?) can allow the user to, no, not turn into Super Sonic, but to travel through the flow of time itself!(Amazing, right? yeah. Pretty hard to believe...) After Sonic finds/or fails to find* all 7 Time Stones, he must face off against his metallic doppelganger(?), Metal Sonic. Later, Sonic finds Eggman's/Robotnik's base, the Metallic Madness, which he ends up destroying after the fall of Robotnik. *fakechuckle* After that, he rescues Amy from the collapsing base and runs off leading off into his next adventure.\n\n1.1  **SPOILER ALERT** Endings:\nGood Ending: Sonic manages to free the Little Planet after the collapse of the Metallic Madness Zone thanks to the use of the Time Stones, but un-expectinly Eggman/Robotnik still has one of the Time Stones in his possession (somehow?) with Sonic chucking a rock (Chuck Norris Style) at him and destroys his Egg-Mobile, ending off with the Little Planet leaving the Earth(?) with "Sonic Fireworks" and Sonic running off.\nBad Ending: Sonic manages to free the Little Planet after the collaping Metallic Madness Zone, ending off with Sonic leaving the Little Planet, but little did Sonic know that Eggman used the Time Stones to re-build the Metallic Madness Zone and take control of the Little Planet.\n\n2. Graphic: Thanks to the enhancement form Crhristian Whitehead and SEGA, it now looks more like a Sonic 1 remake on the SegaCD and it looks absolutly Amazing! I cannot say that enough without making it seem like i hate the game. The sprites have smooth movements, the texture are great for describing what kind of enviornmet I'm in, and the backgrounds are, meh, Backgrounds.\n\n3.

Before this new HD release, outside of a not-so-common Sonic compilation called the Gems Collection, Sonic fans had not been able to play this before without a SEGA CD, so this version is more than welcome in my book.\n\nSonic CD introduces Amy Rose, and Eggman's (Dr. Robotnik's) new robotic minion, Metal Sonic, and both of them will cleverly appear throughout the game as you progress. The story is pretty minimal, with Eggman trying to use the "time stones" to manipulate time and take over the world.\n\nWhat the story does do for the game is pave the way for Sonic CD's time travelling mechanics, which allow you to go backwards and forwards in time in an effort to mend Eggman's schemes. To time travel, you have to come up to a time travel post with enough speed, and run through it and beyond for a little ways without losing speed. Using these warps and traversing the world will allow you to get "Good futures" in the acts. This is where my only real problem with the game comes in, however. It can be slow and somewhat frustrating trying to get through all of the warps successfully. Alternatively, you can win a special stage in the acts, or you can just rush through the stages for default results.\n\nThe levels themselves, though, are simply brilliant. They each feel different, without making you relearn how to play the game after every act. They're designed for speed, but not in the way that you just buzz through them without "Taking in the scenery", so to speak. The way the past, present, and future comes together have rarely, if ever, been found in another platformer, and saving the future is always a rewarding experience. Also in Sonic fashion, each act will end with you fighting Eggman, and every boss fight with him in this game is its own unique challenge.\n\nGraphically, this really is a fantastically beautiful game that used the extra power of the SEGA CD to noticeable effect. Backgrounds are interesting and detailed, sprites are well animated and appealing, levels are crisp, and the game won't hesitate to use effects made possible by the SEGA CD.\n\nWith audio, the game is nothing short of incredible. The sound effects are great, but most important, it features one of the best soundtracks found on its system. The CD format was used to great avail, and no cartridge based system of the day was capable of rendering such impressive tunes! Not to mention, purists will be delighted by the option to change from the US soundtrack to the original.\n\nAll in all, especially for the asking price, this is a great adventure for new fans and seasoned veterans, and it firmly stands the test of time.","November 25, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Until I started getting into to it full-on recently. Sonic CD is arguably the best Sonic game in the whole entire franchise. When the Sega CD came out, it featured cutscenes for Sonic and had KILLER music (mostly Japan's soundtrack) and just showed you what the Sega CD was capable of.

I'd recommend picking this game up if you'd like a good 2D Sonic experience, but don't want to spend money on the Sonic 4 duo.","December 20, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Time was, this was actually a reasonably hard game to come by. Unless you were the rich kid in the neighborhood, you were stuck with the plan ol' Genesis, none of this Sega CD stuff. The rumor of a Sonic Game with animated cartoon sequences and CD-quality music and TIME TRAVEL and METAL SONIC and all kinds of other crazy ♥♥♥♥ in it became the stuff of legend among us poor cartiridge-bound schlubs.\n\nEven well into my adulthood, this one one of the ones that got away, swallowed deep in the halcyon dreamtime that was the early 90s, before there were Rules™ governing the attainability to the masses of what should've been flagship titles, particularly for for ill-concieved system attachments that some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ executive thought up because they were told this Full Motion Video thing was gonna revolutionize gaming forever (kinda like how touchscreen is supposed to be the next big thing now).\n\nSo the game stayed weirdly hard to get throughout the early 'aughts. Emulation was possible but not simple until way later, and good luck tracking down an .iso, the Sega CD system BIOS, and an emulator that would actually smoosh all that crap together. eBay was also an option but that took a fair bit of money to chase down what amounted to an ephemeral youth-dream, for me anyway. Not to mention the ♥♥♥♥ing headache of purchasing and setting up the godforsaken electrical-engineering night terror that was the Sega CD. Ever seen what it takes to get that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed thing up and running? It's not fun. You have to, like, bolt it onto the side or maybe underneath of your Genesis, give it its own power supply, configure the hell out of it so it would boot from the CD instead of the cartridge slot but still let you play the cartridge slot, wire up the sound output to supercede the crappy Genesis sound and it just kept getting worse the more you dug into its labrynthine, pre-Google-translate manual. More than one parent probably pitched the whole thing out the front door on Christmas day when it became clear upon trying to set it up for their screaming spawn what an unholy time vampire that shitheap was going to be.\n\nSo yeah. This poor game never got played much. The slow, choking death of its parent console didn't help, and given that Sega seemed weirdly reluctant to even admit its existence (let alone re-release it for modern ANYTHING), it remained somewhere in fantasy nostalgia orbit for a lot of people far longer than most classic games starring major, world-recognized characters really should.\n\nIt was the lost, legendary Sonic Game.\n\nNow you can buy it on Steam for the price of an expensive coffee.\n\nPROGRESS, PEOPLE","February 6, 2013","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its gimmick, time travel, offers an incentive to explore and map out the levels themselves, as well as providing opportunities for many little differences within single levels. The roboticizers and the holograms, which can be seen in both the past and the present, but can only be dealt with in the past, give a goal when hunting about the level. Destroying them rids the level of all enemies thus making it safe, or safer anyway, to go as fast as you please. The bonus stages offer up a new experience while being similar enough to the main game in concept to avoid breaking your rhythm. The cinematic at the start and the finish of the game frame it with a context and a healthy helping of Sonic Boom, a track that I just can't help but enjoy. The ending cinematic especially does a great job of releasing the tension built up throughout the game and leaving you thinking about all the exciting parts instead of those enemies that were made just to slow you down or the way Sonic seems to slip around like his sneakers are made of greasy bacon.","June 10, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now before you sit there and  say oh this is a emulated title,it's not this is a completly re-coded version using a new engine compete with a few new extras such as paying as Tails, time attack, leaderboards, widescreen, both JP/EU and US soundtracks, among other features. Now if there is one drawback it's that it currently has a bug that causes the game to run at double speed on 120hz monitors but that can be remedied by turing on Vsync and full AA on your graphics card or setting your monitor to 60hz until sega issues a patch(shouldn't be too long). So  is it the best sonic game ever? that's up for debate it is a great sonic game and this is a amazingly well done port.

Sonic CD gives you speed as a tool to meet your ends, but it heavily discourages it in favour of precision, thought, and exploration, while it still feels faster than your average platformer.\n\nOne of the most fun elements of Sonic CD is it's integration of time travel into the core gameplay, whether it's simply seeing what each beautifully designed level looks like in each of the four different timelines, or to find all the different objectives this non-standard Sonic platformer has to offer.\nIf you want to get the most enjoyment out of this game, take some time to explore each timeline in each area. Take a look at the bleak, dark bad futures, then go back into the past and destroy Eggman's machines so that you can create a good future, all while admiring the thematic changes in music and art that come with each timeline.\n\nSure, the game's design can be headache-inducing at times, but it's a short adventure that will leave you with some fond memories, and it'll certainly make you want to listen to those soundtracks over and over again. Plus, the animated cutscenes and multiple endings are a nice bonus.\n\nHonestly, if any Sonic game needs a spiritual sequel, it's this one! Time travel is a simple yet very interesting and game-changing concept. And unlike the recent Sonic Boom titles, exploration and nonlinearity in this game feels RIGHT. it's a damn shame this game was on a system that was all but a failure, but thanks to the power of remastering, we are here able to play it in glorious HD. Do yourself a favour and pick this game up, I have a feeling you'll like it.\n","December 31, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/200940/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic CD is a platformer game starring famous hedgehog from Sega and was originally released for Sega CD in 1993, making use of CD technology. And having two different soundtracks for JP or US region. It was later released for PC, having improved intro and ending movies, without limits of Sega CD. And now it was rereleased and improved for smartphones, PS3, Xbox360 and Steam.\n\nWhat's new in remastered version? It was ported onto new engine, allowing new menues, small stuff and even support of widescreen. It kept full movies from PC version. It even used rotation and scaling where it made sense, where Sega CD used choppy animation. And it even added new content, with ability to choose preference of Spin Dash from Sonic 2, ability to choose US or JP soundtrack, leaderboards (for your time attack fun too), achievements and even ability to select the ever cute Tails the Fox, that wasn't originally in Sonic CD. You have to beat game once to unlock him and even has ability to fly from Sonic 3 too. Lacks intro and ending movies though. Yes, he got new animation frames.\nThe only bad thing I can think of is that Japanese soundtack main songs lack lyrics, instead replaced with custom-made instrumentals. They lack some of charm.\n\nNow, if you have to descripe Sonic CD in one line: it's Sonic 1, but more gimmicky and easier.\nAnd it's not a bad thing, since Sonic 1, like most classic Sonic games, was one of the better pure-platformers out there (I mean, no attack button or such). With more movement-based awesome physics, both while running or rolling, simple control, nice pacing and multiple branches, it was great. It also had unique rings-health system, where you would survive a hit as long as you had at least one ring, while scattering them all around.\nSonic CD retains most of the greatness, and despite being released after Sonic 2, got the looks and control feels of the first part. Background look much more complex and game uses CD audio, which may not sound chiptune-like, but still has great tune to it. Japan version at least. US soundtrack is more of generic thing, with some dark tones here and there.\n\nSonic have to travel onto the flying little planet, which has time-teleport troubles and is controlled by Eggman, just to kick his egg butt once again. Oh, and to save planet. And Amy. And battle with Metal Sonic. Your mission is still same, to get to the end of the level, each of 7 levels having 3 acts, the third one being a boss act.\nBosses are one-trick ponies. They are easy, but have some gimmick going on for them. While other Sonic games have more of classic challenging bosses, each taking 8 hits, Sonic CD ones use various trickish mechanics, giving them a wackier cartoonish feel. For example, one of the bosses requires Sonic to keep running over conveyer belt of sorts, speeding it up and making friction melt the bottom part of Eggman's machine.\nAnd bad sides, once again, bosses are too easy once you know what to do. Or even if you don't. Final boss isn't that much of problem either, as you can just rush him down with the forgiving ring-health system of Sonic games.\n\nYou will also notice that level design is all over the place. It doesn't feel tight or much of challenge, instead being more of easy maze, having unneded branches and areas. And for sure you will notice Past and Future signs. Well, why, it's yet another gimmicky approach to game design, the Time Travel!\nOnce you pass over time travel sign, you will get ability to teleport either into Past or Future if you will be able to keep maximum speed for more than few seconds. This will make you learn the level layout, either to find the best cleanest path or to just abuse some springs that will send you into loop. The main difference between Past or Future is level layout and visual theme being slightly altered. It's not really a big deal.\nBut in the Past is where you can find two important objects: Flying engine destroying which will kill all the enemies in the act and will turn Bad Future into Good Future, while destroying Metal Sonic hologram will make animals appear in the level again. If you destroy all engines in all levels, you will get good ending. Hard work!\nThere is little reason to visit Future though.\nBut bad thing is, such exploration for Past and engine still negatively affects level design when player just wants to beat them in traditional way. Time Travel barely adds anything to the gameplay, because by time you would go to Past to destroy all enemies, you could easily beat the level. And if you are aiming for good ending, then there is actually even easier way to get it: Collect all Time Stones from Special Stages! Once you collect all time stones, you will get Good Future in all levels from that point and you will always have good ending, making time travel obsolote.\nThankfully, modern version gives you a special achievement for doing all hard Time Travel work, giving at least some reason to do it at least once.\n\nOh. And Special Stages, that you get by having 50 rings by the end of stage, are awesome in this one. Using a trick similiar to Mode-7 kart games on SNES, you control Sonic on 3D flat track, who has to jump and crush down every UFO that patrol around, under time limit. Running over water will deplete timer quickly and a special UFO will appear that gives time bonus once you have only 20 seconds left. This is my favourite Special/Bonus Stage of all Sonic games, it really is fun to control.\nAnd yes, this remaster upgraded special stages visuals greatly. Instead of having choppy pre-made animations frames for UFO enlarging as you come closer to them game now uses real smooth scaling for them. It allows you to measure just how close you are to them so much better.\n\nSonic CD is still fun platformer. But it's too easy to feel much of accomplishment and gimmicks are distractive game design. Time Travel feels unneeded and tackled on, but there are people who actually like this Past-searching quest. Some people dislike this game, others call it the best. I say, go for it, try it, you may love it.\nIt got old Sonic charm at least.","May 10, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take the basic mechanics of Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) on the Genesis / Mega Drive, add a killer CD/DA audio soundtrack, expand the levels dramatically, even polish up the graphics a bit, and there you have Sonic CD on the Sega CD... in a nutshell! With the time travel feature (needed for the good ending), you can traverse 4 different versions of each stage: Present, Past, Good Future (after destroying a hidden capsule in the Past), and Bad Future (when the hidden capsule is still intact)! For the time, a *massive* side-scroller!\n\nThis 2011 "port" gives us this original classic, but with glorious 16:9 widescreen display modes, and both US and JP/EU soundtracks! *Both* of the game soundtracks are remarkable, with a more Electronic/House/Eurodance feel for JP/EU, and a more contemporary Rock/Pop sound for the US. Personally, either soundtrack is equally fitting!\n(For the purists, however, you *might* notice that the physics in this remake are just-so-slightly inaccurate (but excruciatingly close), and even moreso inaccurate during the Special Stage rounds.)\n\nAnyway, at least *try* this game! My suggestions are to play it in "Nostalgia" mode (no graphics filters), and apply the "Opening / Ending Music mod" (find it on one of the Steam Workshop guides, or search on Google)! I genuinely cannot say enough good things about this.","June 4","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It also played well, like most sonic games, and was my favorite sonic game for it's complexity.

It just has a feeling other sonic games don’t have. It feels important. Going through the past and the future really expands the game more than just getting to the end as fast as possible. It also runs a lot smoother and faster than most other Sonic games allow you to do so. It lets you explore freely without worry of a nearby enemy coming out of nowhere and surprising you. The ability to explore in every level really makes it unique and it feels like you're really exploring a whole new world. And fixing the future in every level really gives a sense of achievement when you see that your work really helps in the "long run". And being able to switch between both the US and JP soundtrack is pretty neat considering both are good in their own right.

But the game has amazing level desing were you can get lost or at least get stuck on. Theres a dissoriating fell which is unique to this game only but the game is still good and i did enjoy it.

Way ahead of its time, when I think about it.  Looking at any point of any level, there are usually at least 3 routes running parallel that you could be taking.  Perfect balance, in my opinion, of speed and precision platforming; the game lets you run as fast as you like through certain sections, while others require reactions, timing and control.  While the latter sections may be somewhat challenging, none of them are infuriatingly difficult and you're unlikely to find yourself stuck at one section for any length of time.  The Past/Future mechanic is brilliant; switching between times changes the level around a bit to make it harder or easier in certain places, and this can be used to your advantage but only if you are able to build up enough speed to travel in time.  It adds an extra dimension to speedruns, and multiplies the already huge amount of ways to beat a level.  Boss fights are short, sweet and creative, varying hugely each time.  As for the port itself, it's a great port; about the best I could hope for.  There's a main menu and a save system that has up to 4 save slots.  There's proper audio options, you can use the old spin dash animation if you like, and you can apply a Sharp, Smooth or Nostalgic (i.e. classic) video filter.  It appears to be pretty happy running in Windows, no bugs that I've found and alt-tabbing brings up no issues.\nOverall, no real gripes besides the lack of story.","December 12, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/200940/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Sonic CD Review\nMore than just a classic action game, Sonic CD is an exemplary port of a retro game to a modern platform.\n\nHistory has not been kind to the Sega CD add-on, which has largely been regarded as a failure. Still, the console did have several excellent exclusives, among which was an ambitious time-hopping adventure in its most popular franchise. Sonic CD was one of the games that made a Sega CD worth owning. While its cartridge-based brothers saw frequent rereleases, Sonic CD's reissues on the PC and GameCube (via the Sonic Gems Collection) were clunky and inaccurate, as well as missing features. So it is with great celebration among Sonic series fans that Sega has rereleased Sonic CD on modern platforms as a download game, but what makes it even sweeter is the care and effort that has gone into the conversion.\n\nTime travel in Sonic's world is so quotidian that they post it on street signs.\nSonic CD is very much a game in the classic Sonic vein. As Sonic, you run, spin, and jump around colorful, themed areas; you collect rings, smash enemies, and interact with varied environmental gimmicks. Whereas Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 favored more open stages with lots of speed-boosting contraptions, Sonic CD's stages reflect the more cluttered feel of the original game, with elaborately designed backgrounds and decorations littering the landscape. It's incredibly difficult to simply speed directly through a level in Sonic CD because various traps, enemies, and deviously placed obstacles can send a careless hedgehog reeling.\n\nThis approach to stage design has its advantages because Sonic CD is laden with odd little one-off gimmicks and hidden surprises (see if you can find the hidden goddess statue--it even gives you an achievement!). It also influences the overall stage design in interesting ways: Collision Chaos is filled with more high-speed springs and bumpers than any other Sonic zone, while Metallic Madness is a maze that can loop endlessly if you don't pay attention to where you go. Some of the stages, however, have experimental elements that prove to be more frustrating than fun. The much-despised Wacky Workbench level features a magnetized floor that sends Sonic soaring up to the stage's ceiling at the slightest touch, which practically destroys his ability to run for long distances.\n\nIn fact, running long distances anywhere in Sonic CD is quite challenging, but there's a design reason behind it. Sonic CD's major selling point in its day was its time-travel feature, which greatly increased the size and scope of the game. Each stage has four variations: a past, present, a good future, and a bad future. And each one has different graphics, music, stage elements, and designs. Travelling through time is accomplished by touching a specially marked "Past" or "Future" signpost and then keeping up a consistent high speed for about five seconds to initiate a time warp. This is often easier said than done. Though some stages have areas well suited to time travel, others require careful obstacle dodging and knowledge of level layout to maintain a consistent speed. Figuring out where and how to initiate time warps is part of the game's challenge.\n\nWill Sonic finally discover the secret to Eggman's luxuriant moustache?\nTime travel yields many benefits. Going into the future, for example, means that enemies will be worn down from years of use and less of a threat to Sonic. However, by default, the future is ruined by Dr. Eggman's pollution and incredibly unappealing from a visual standpoint, with broken and malfunctioning machinery spoiling the landscape. To fix the future, Sonic can instead travel to the past, where Eggman has set up a robotic control machine. The past is often the most difficult of the level variations, but destroying the machine in the past changes the default future into a good future, which is bright and colorful, entirely free of enemies, and often features fewer traps and obstacles. Running through the default future might be the fastest way to finish the game, but taking full advantage of the time-travel system to restore the future is the more satisfying way to play.\n\nThe interesting level design and the time-travelling gameplay have long made Sonic CD a fan favorite, but the superb port of the game to the Xbox 360 makes an already excellent game even better. The port has been codeveloped with longtime Sonic fan Christian Whitehead, and it's a fine showcase for his custom Retro Engine. The game supports full widescreen display on HDTVs, and a variety of filters allow you to choose between smoother, modern-looking 2D visuals or authentic-looking pixel art that looks practically flawless in high resolution. Other varied visual enhancements show up throughout, ranging from the smoother scrolling of the once notoriously choppy special stages to cleaned-up and polished background elements and enemy motions. You can also select between the original Sonic CD spin-dash (which increases Sonic's speed based on time spent holding the buttons down) and the Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 spin-dash (where rapid button presses increase speed).\n\nThe boss encounters, while interestingly designed, tend toward the easy side.\nWhat makes the package even sweeter are the copious extras included. You can freely choose between the Japanese and US soundtracks to the game, though a few of the vocal songs have sadly excised the lyrics due to rights reasons. The original Sega CD edition of Sonic CD offered a host of hidden goodies and unlockable bonuses, such as staff artwork and sound tests. These are all present in the port, along with a major new feature: After completing the game once, the ability to play as Tails is unlocked. Tails' flight ability adds a wholly new element of exploration to the stages, allowing easier access to difficult-to-reach spaces.\n\nWhile Sonic CD is an amazing conversion, there are a few minor issues that keep it away from port perfection. Some rare bugs rear their heads here and there, leading to odd camera shifts and occasionally falling through solid objects. Most players will not encounter these issues in a typical playthrough, however. A few areas where Sonic is forced to travel at high speeds for a lengthy period of time have also been altered so that they no longer trigger time travel to prevent players from warping by accident. While it's nice to not have to worry about inadvertently warping, experienced players may be angered that these places are no longer usable when an easy time warp is desired. Finally, a feature of the Sega CD original that allowed you to restart at the beginning of the current time zone at the expense of one life is completely missing. Because certain areas in some levels become blocked off after proceeding past them (and Sonic CD has next to no instant-death pits to voluntarily kill oneself with), the lack of this feature makes it hard to reach and see certain portions of levels.\n\nDespite a few minor issues, Sonic CD is among the more impressive retro ports seen on modern platforms. Not only is the game faithful to the original, but it's also just plain better in many ways. And at a mere 400 Microsoft points ($5 US), it's a tremendous value to boot. If you remember Sonic CD fondly, there's no better way to enjoy one of the most treasured games in the series. And if you missed out on this one entirely before now, this is a superlative way to experience a beloved classic for the very first time.\n\nTHE GOOD\nA lot of fun platforming at a very good price\nFaithfully converts the pixel look of the original to high-res, widescreen displays\nIncludes a huge variety of old and new unlockable extras\nOffers a unique take on the classic Sonic formula\n\nTHE BAD\nA few noticeable changes to core gameplay may annoy some\nSome vocals removed due to licensing reasons\nWacky Workbench level isn't fun\n\n8.5","March 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The final fight in particular is a cakewalk, getting there is the challenge. The only other beef I have is that if you don't have a PC that meets the standards to a higher OS, the opening and ending movies will play choppy while the game itself plays just fine.\n\nOverall if you're looking to reexperience this gem, I'd give it a look if you can get past the negatives.","March 29, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is a fun ride through and through; but it has has some questionable design choices that I feel drag it down.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a classic sonic game. And to it's benefit, Sonic CD is more inspired than most of the other sonic games. When you step into a level,  you quickly come to understand the depth on display here. There are essentially three different phases for every one stage; meaning you can flip through different pallets and scenery by hitting a post and going fast. While this does wonders to help keep the game interesting, the real opportunities to flip the phase are limited unless you are clairvoyant or unreasonably reckless. In a game about going fast, Sonic CD seems to want to slow you down quite often, which is an issue.\n\nWhat's also an issue is some downright bizzare boss and game over music. A slowed down, pitch shifted version of a laugh accompanies a creepy tone. It's abundantly clear that this is supposed to be Dr. Robotnik laughing at us. The game plays this theme every time you see him. And I get that the point of the game is to stop him, but really? You couldnt've picked a less jarring theme for boss fights? This, compounded with the fact that Dr. Robotnik is seriously out of good ideas, as most bosses can be beaten by slapfighting them, turns bossfights into a chore.\n\nIt's good, but just barely so.","January 1","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't think it's the best Sonic game, and I don't even think it was the best game on the Sega CD (that honor would go to the Lunar games).\n\nIt's not a bad game at all, but I don't think it holds a candle to Sonic 2 or even Sonic 3 and Knuckles. My biggest beef with this game is the level design- it's labyrinthine and maze-like when compared to the more straightforward levels of other 2D Sonic games. It's hard to go fast in a Sonic game when the levels are filled with more platforms and speed bumps. This becomes more problematic when you factor in the time warping mechanic, which requires you to maintain a high speed after passing a warp post. I can definitely appreciate the ambition the developers had when making this game- the time travel system gives you more levels to explore, and there's nothing wrong with that- but it can be frustrating at times when it seems like the levels are designed against the principle of going fast.\n\nLike I said, though, this game is not terrible. The level design might be a little too weird for a game about going really fast, but if you want a challenge, look no further. This game's levels are long and complex, but they don't feel padded out at all. They deliver a unique kind of gameplay challenge that I don't think can be matched by any other Sonic game. It's unique, and I can definitely appreciate a game that dares to be different. You kind of have to change your playing style and be more methodical to really get the most out of Sonic CD.\n\nAlso, both soundtracks for this game are absolutely phenomenal. For those that don't know, the American and Japanese versions of this game had completely different soundtracks. The Japanese version had a pretty straightforward, Sonic-like soundtrack with plenty of catchy and upbeat songs, while the 'Murican release had a more unique score inspired by 90's rock, hip-hop and industrial music. The music buff in me really likes the American release, but whichever one you end up playing with, they both fit the game really well.\n\nAll in all, I still think Sonic CD is a great game despite its flaws. And for the low price of $5, you really can't go wrong. This game used to be much harder to get a hold of due to the limited market of the Sega CD, and the original PC release being a nightmare to run on modern machines, so having this HD re-release with both soundtracks is a huge treat.","December 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like, holy crap, "how do you do anything in this game" confusing. There's a time travel element, but it takes a man like Doc Brown to get it to actually work.\n\nIf you've played a classic Sonic game, then you know what to expect: a nonlinear level design with an emphasis on going fast. This entry in the series definitely keeps up that tradition, but with the significant addition of the aforementioned time-travel mechanic. You can go through the whole game without using it, but if you want to get the good ending to the game, you have to follow a very specific order of what to do.\n\nThere are "Past" and  "Future" posts that, when hit, will allow you to time travel to that era. Just run fast enough for long enough and you'll blast to the past or go back to the future. The trouble is that you only have shot to do it. If you start running and then get hit, you blew. Gotta find another post.\n\nTo get the good ending, you have to go the past, destroy all the robots, go back to the present, and then finally end up in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/200940/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","If you want my full thoughts on Sonic CD, you can listen to my review on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com] (Review itself starts at 18:12)\n\nSonic is a character that I grew up loving. I had a Sega Genesis as a child and played tons of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles. At the time, I had no idea that the Sega CD existed, so I completely missed out on Sonic CD. Now, years later, I received Sonic CD in the Sonic Games Collection and excitedly sat down to play what I thought would be a nostalgia-filled romp in a franchise I once loved. Perhaps I've moved on from Sonic or maybe Sonic CD isn't the best example of a classic Sonic game, because I found the experience baffling at best and infuriating at worst.\n\nGameplay\nWell, the game certainly moves fast, which no doubt was part of the marketing. Unfortunately, fast =/= fun. The game lacks a good sense of momentum. Sonic often goes from a complete stand still to flying across the screen, and vice versa, with no inbetween. This means that you feel very little control over the game at many parts and more often than not the game launches you into a death trap. Often these are unavoidable because the camera does not keep Sonic centered on the screen and you cannot see what is coming up and react to it. It's just poor design for a platformer and leads to a lot of frustration.\n\nAlso strange is the time travel aspect. I love time travel as a story conceit and as a gameplay mechanic but it's completely pointless here. The past and future versions of the level are nearly identical and destroying the robot machine in the past only effects the zone you are in. It's completely optional; you can literally beat the game without ever once time traveling. There are no puzzles based around the mechanic and you can get all the time stones without using it. It feels totally tacked on and without purpose.\n\nThe pacing of the game is problematic as well. Of the seven zones, only the final two offer any challenge. Most acts can be beated in under a minute, making the game incredibly short and unrewarding. The difficulty spike in the last two stages is simply unreasonable and is where you will spend the vast majority of your time. In particular, the race against Metal Sonic is one of the must unfair, rage-quit inducing sequences I have ever encountered in a game.\n\nPresentation\nFirst off, I love the hand drawn cinematics. Gorgeous, fun, bright. They are what I wanted the game to be. Unfortunately, the game's actual graphics are much less interesting. Unlike other Sonic games where each level has a unique look and setting, all the zones here, including their past and future counterparts, look pretty much the same. Also troubling is that it is often unclear what is an object vs. something in the foreground or background. Something may look like a platform but you'll just fall through it when you try to land on it. Having graphics that clearly convey information to the player is essential for such a fast paced platformer and Sonic CD really let me down in that regard.\n\nSound design is pretty much what you'd expect, except that there are two different soundtracks. The North American one sounds just like previous Sonic titles but the Japanese one, which is turned on by default, is a bizarre sort of hip-hop fusion that isn't fitting to Sonic at all. Skip to 29:09 in the episode[soundcloud.com] to hear what I mean.\n\nOverall\nI simple cannot understand the praise that this game receives. It is far from the strongest title in the Sonic franchise and has major flaws in nearly every part of its design. I can only recommend Sonic CD to those who loved it on the Genesis since it is a very good port. If you haven't played Sonic CD before, I do not recommend giving it a try now.","March 30","false","3.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DewsPage/recommended/200940/","DewsPage","StrangeDew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DewsPage/","75 products in account","Pros: Nice Soundtrack. Buy the soundtrack. Satisfying everytime you win. Fun boss battles IF you manage to get a hang of the slippery ♥♥♥♥ that Sonic wears in this game. It has a nice button layout for the keyboard that is nice and simple: Z to accept, X to cancel, Enter is the start button. Z and X are used in-game for jumping. Arrow keys to move. The designs are beautiful but I can't say the same for some of the level layouts. Comes with an amazing intro animation that is accompanied by yet another great track.\n\nCons: False difficulty. Dickishly placed spikes and annoying stage layouts. In an interview they said that they expect us to memorise the levels and the reward will be being able to go through the levels fast. I can do that in Sonic Generations but DEFINITELY NOT this game. Some of the paths will slowly become more confusing because there are these tunnels that take you places automatically. Slippery controls. It feels as though this blue ♥♥♥♥ is wearing butter for shoes. This really ♥♥♥♥s you up when you try to do some platforming. BTW: Getting hit by enemies will make you lose ALL of your rings. If you get launched high into the sky or get hit by the dickishly placed traps, you'll have to restart and collect 50 rings all over again. DO YOU WANT TO ♥♥♥♥ING DO THAT? I had enough patience to try 63 times. On the the second level of the first zone. Just find some hacks to make Sonic invincible and get all the chaos emeralds that way. Trust me. It's better that way.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is frustrating to get a hundred-percent completion but playing it normally is nice and satisfying. There will be times where you will definitely get frustrated and have to try more than thrice until you find a way to get around the problems which are sometimes bullcrud. The game had great concepts but the execution was not handled very well. Honestly, I feel that the only thing that's aged well about the game is the soundtrack. The game was a little too frustrating for me. THOSE F'ING SPIKES, MAN!!!\n\nI hope this review was helpful to you. Leave a hate comment. ♥♥♥♥ on my picture.

I was very unimpressed. There's not much variety and are just souless rehashed of the stages of the other 4 sonic games. The Most irritating thing about this game however, is the time travel mechanic. You can travel through time by passing these goalposts hidden in the game and then continuously moving without stopping for a period of time. The problem is when you do this, the game comes to a complete stop and plays this obnoxious cutscene of Sonic traveling through time. Its over quick, but is very irritating when every stage of the game is filled with a dozen or so of these goalposts. My second isssue with this game is how DUMBED DOWN the boss fights are. Instead of the traditional "8 hits to win" in all the other sonic games. The boss fights are reduced to "get this weird item" or  "just wait until dr. robotnik blows up" Not a bad game overall but the other Sonic genesis games are FAR superior.","December 24, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

So my first time ever playing it is April, 2015.\n\nOn a game like this, you can't really critique graphics/sound since it was originally released over 10 years ago, so I won't base my review on graphics or sound at all.\n\n\n\n\nIt's a cute Sonic game, but it lacks substance and coherency. Maybe that's just a result of the time period of when it was released and the technology that it was released on. It's a very short game - 6 levels with 3 zones each. It's super easy to beat except for a vew rare instances like the level with metal sonic. He's a ♥♥♥♥. Those conveniently placed metal spikes on the ground also suck. Especially that one that's only half on the ground and half floating in the air (derp?) because of a slope. Also, it doesn't really tell you this but you're supposed to race him... thanks for that heads up! (I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE END ALIVE! WAIT WHAT IT JUST KILLED ME??)\n\nThe concept of lives is pointless. It just lets you respawn at the last check point that you've passed. If you lose all lives, you can just load up the save and start from the beginning of the level. The levels are so short that it really doesn't matter if you lose all lives other than the annoyance of having to go back to the main menu and loading the save again.\n\nSonic has a new move (compared to Sonic 2 and Sonic3/Knuckles) which is just like the spin dash but you hold up and then hit a button. Supposedly it goes faster than the spin dash at the trade-off of leaving you vulnerable to attack. I never really encountered a situation where I would want to use this over the spin dash. I didn't even know it was in the game until I saw it being done in a YouTube video. I think this one is in the game manual... but who reads those anyway, especially digital ones.\n\nControl-wise it felt like a classic Sonic game, except momentum felt off. I don't know how to explain it. Also, Sonic takes a really exaggerated amount of time to start moving in a direction from a full stop. "Herp derp I have to start moving my feet now."\n\nI don't really understand the past/present/future concept. It is not explained at all in the intro video. Maybe it is something that was explained in the game booklet/manual. I kind of figured it out after reading about it online, but it still doesn't really make sense with the information provided to us by the intro video or any other storytelling cues. I don't know why you would ever seek out to change the time period except for going into the past for the achievements.\n\nThe special stages are really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. There is no reason whatsoever for Sonic to HAVE to be constantly moving. It's just infuriorating that he has to be moving all the time and turns ridiculously slow for no REAL reason. Also, wtf time stones? What's the point of them? It seems all they do is give the "good" futures for levels instead of destroying the teleporters and hologram metal sonics -- which I didn't know even existed in the game until I read about it online for the achievements.\n\nThe achievements are a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially with the lack of a "Restart Level" option from the pause menu. Why would you ever not have that option?? So I have to waste time going back to the main menu and then loading the saved game again. You also can't level select (besides time attack mode which isn't always the best option for achievements since they remove the past/future sign posts). So achievement hunters may be playing the whole game over and over :/\n\nAchievement hunters should avoid this game. There's only 12 achievements, but they are not worth the pain and suffering and you will grow to really hate this game.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:\n-----\nClassic Sonic look and feel.\nCons:\n------\nToo much not explaining what or why story-wise and gameplay-wise.\nSome interactive environment objects don't make it clear that you're supposed to interact with them or how.\nYou can beat the whole game and never know about a lot of things -- such as the enemy teleporters and metal sonic holograms in the past.\nThere's no reason to change time periods unless you're going for achievements which are all done in the past.\nSpecial stages: Sonic being forced to always be moving and super slow turning for no reason other than to ♥♥♥♥ you off.\nNo restart level option from pause menu (even at the cost of a life).\nThe concept of lives is pointless.\nWay too easy except a few parts that are way too hard.\nThe Wacky Workbench level is annoying as hell with the ground that shoots you way up into the sky.\nSonic's movement's momentum feels off and it takes an exaggerated long time to start moving from a full stop.\n\nI don't think this game is worth the money unless you can pick it up for a dollar or two and really want a short retro experience or played the original and want the nostalgic trip.","April 22, 2015","false","5.7"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

They messed up the Spin Dash and the level designs also don't feel very good compared to other games, even Sonic 1. Don't try to tell me that this game was before Sonic 2, because it wasn't. It came out afterwards, so there's no reason to have the SPin Dash how it is, especially if it's better in Sonic 3. And even if this was before Sonic 2, why doesn't the Super Peel Out appear again? No, Sonic Lost World doesn't count. The bosses are incredibly easy, the music wasn't very memorable, and the Special Stages are just awful. I am glad they're not manditory, but the alternative isn't much better. Backtracking in video games is usually a bad thing, and it always is in Sonic's case. I do, however, appreciate the additions they made to the Steam version compared to the Sega CD and Nintendo GameCube versions, especially the addition of Tails and the ability to switch from the U.S. soundtrack to the Japanese one, because the Japanese one was far superior. If you want a good Sonic game that shifts the normal gameplay style of Sonic 1-3, but is still good, I would reccomend Knuckles' Chaotix. Sadly, it hasn't been re-released, so unless you have a Sega Gensis and the clunky add-on known as the Sega 32X, I would just emulate it.","June 25, 2014","false","7.5"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

However it is still Sonic CD which is great! it's a fun game that allows you to play the stages in three different forms including three different variations of the level music which is some of the best in a classic video game, they might have done a little revamping of it but its unlikely because 200mb of the game is just the intro and ending videos. Overall it's the same sonic CD which many of us have played in the 90s and early 2000s (thanks to Sonic Gems), not much has changed except the addition of a new menu, a couple of logos in the startup proccess, and the option to change the music to that of the original japanese release.","July 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

Marty has to collect all 7 time stones to save his girlfriend and stop Doc. The first thing you notice in this game is it’s amazing 3D graphics and fine use of anti-aliasing. Sega did a great job in the graphics with this game.\n\nUnfortunately the controls and game play say otherwise. Sonic can only jump and can’t pick up guns from fallen enemies. That’s a real blunder Namco. Once you get past the fact that sonic can only do these two things the game gets really annoying. Finally once you’ve beaten Doc Marty McFly saves his girl Friend and little big planet is saved.\n\nOver all I have mixed feelings about sonic CD great potential wasted on graphix and not game play.

First of all I hated seeing rings stuck in the wall while in different time periods, the special stages are aweful, and the idea of having to break metal sonics machines and holograms is stupid. Did I say that the soundtrack is good? because it is amazing.....itleast the Japanese soundtrack is, seriously if you get this game, do yourself a favour, go into options and change the music from english to Japanese, there's no music with lyrics so don't worry about that. This game is signifigantly shorter than sonic 1,2 and 3K. This game a great 2D sonic (not the best, that titles belongs to sonic 3K and sonic 2) and if your a sonic fan you must play this, if your not a sonic fan, give this game a shot, it is reasonably cheap and you may have some fun with it.

The Steam port is one of the many, many ports of this game, and I think it works well, no technical problems so far. It is a little slower and more stategic than most Sonic games as you have to look for certain items around the level, while travelling backwards and forwards through time. The time travel aspect and the differences between the good and bad futures are an interesting twist on the usual Sonic game, I always like the dark, moody feel of the bad futures but it is so satisfying to get one of the slightly surreal good futures! In general, I really like the brightly coloured levels and proper, trance-inducing, old-fashioned Sega game music. It manages to be bright and slightly psychadelic without going to the extreme, creepy level of cheerfulness often found in Nintendo platformers.\n\nI would have preferred an actual soundtrack to put on my MP3 player to be included, or at least a sound test function in the game, as the US soundtrack is freakin' awesome and you can't buy it from any stores!

It had a dark and ominous vibe which was displayed in many of its greatest games that really wasn't like anything else out on the market. Games on the system very much felt like more fully realized, uncensored 16 bit games with crazy concepts as their base. This was evident in classics on the system such as Snatcher, Lunar, and especially Sonic CD. Sonic CD is an anomaly in the series that takes the platforming and speed of the original but throws in a time traveling element as well. Every level has a past, present, good future and bad future variation that is determined by Sonic's use of time travel and him destroying Robotnik's capsules. These "bad future" variations along with the boss levels have a pretty sinister feel to them that really defines the experience of playing Sonic CD. If you think you know what to expect from a Sonic game, give this game a shot and find out for yourself just how unique the Sega CD experience truly is.","November 18, 2013","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As there is future and past signs you can activate and respectively go to these times of the level, there is holograms of Metal Sonic and Robotnik engine-things to find, so there is a sense of\nexploration to it.\n\nThe graphics is not mind-blowing, but i like it.\nThe music could be a hate/love thing.

It is one of the best Sonic the Hedgehog games to ever grace a video game system (and I'm being a bit bias there).\n\nThe gameplay is typical Sonic the Hedgehog but has a unique twist: time travel. By going through time travel, each level acts differently. Each level has a Past and Future timeline, giving you unique ways to explore each level. What's also cool is the various secrets that you find in each timeline. This is one Sonic game that you can't speed through.\n\nThe Special Stages are back but with a slight difference. Instead of collecting rings, you destroying UFOs while running on a square grid. You can run around as much as you want but beware some of the traps laid across the grid.\n\nThe PC version has some nice extras such as letting you switch between the Japanese and American soundtracks and much more.\n\nThis is a Sonic game that still plays well and stood against the test of time (pun intended).

It is one of the best Sonic the Hedgehog games to ever grace a video game system (and I'm being a bit bias there).\n\nThe gameplay is typical Sonic the Hedgehog but has a unique twist: time travel. By going through time travel, each level acts differently. Each level has a Past and Future timeline, giving you unique ways to explore each level. What's also cool is the various secrets that you find in each timeline. This is one Sonic game that you can't speed through.\n\nThe Special Stages are back but with a slight difference. Instead of collecting rings, you destroying UFOs while running on a square grid. You can run around as much as you want but beware some of the traps laid across the grid.\n\nThe PC version has some nice extras such as letting you switch between the Japanese and American soundtracks and much more.\n\nThis is a Sonic game that still plays well and stood against the test of time (pun intended).

The latter is raved as one of the best Sonic games of all time and has gotten several ports to both other Sega and non-Sega consoles.  Sonic CD had a narrow accessibility for gamers and a pretty shoddy port done for the Gems Collection.  This more or less ensured it would never quite take the limelight like  it deserved.\n\nBut it has all come full circle with this multi-platform release that has reinvented a game that, by all means, was and always has been superior to Sonic 2.  It kept the original formula that made the early Sonic games successful, but took up a time travel focus that served to enhance the gameplay in a very compelling way.\n\nInstead of bogging you all down with the technical details, I'll just state the one thing that has stuck with me most prominently.  There are two ways to achieve the good ending, each catering to two different kinds of players: Explorers and speedrunners.  You could even toss aside being classified as either and attempt both approaches, seeing whichever one happens to land you the prize.  It seems like such a small change, but it's the kind of carefully chosen freedom that makes the reward that much more appealing.\n\nAside from that, you get an actual animated opening and endings, two different soundtracks, an expanded move-set, and a sizable game filled with a variety of interesting locales that  have four distinct looks depending on the time period.  There are also plenty of unlockables, of course.\n\nFind out for yourself why Sonic 2 falls short of this fantastic game.\n\n","July 3, 2013","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The boss battles in this game offer a change of pace from a few of the other sonic games, with boss fights with unique aspects such as dr. eggman on a treadmill, which offer new layers of challenge and strategy. In addition, the time travelling of this game is spot on as whenever you go through a "past" or "future" sign and accelerate to high speeds, you switch to a new version of that same stage, which has a completely new layout and aesthetic, which is a well ezecuted and fascinating mechanic. In addition, the implementation of online leaderboards and unlockable tails after the maingame gives you a little more to do after the main game is finished. Whilst this version seems to have a lack of "Sonic Boom", it definitely isn't lacking the awesome metal sonic, characterised by his appearance in stardust speedway act 3 which you have to play to understand how amazing it is. Some players may find the game a little short, but the alternate versions, endings and the ability to colllect time gems will keep you playing for tens of hours after you've beaten the game.","February 20, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sonic CD will always and FOREVER be my favorite Sonic game because of how well made it is.  The game has stood the test time and I can honestly see why.  The gameplay, while not all the different from Sonic 2, it's still amazingly smooth and responsive.  The music is still abosolutely fanominal and the graphics (do note this coming from someone who LOVES 16-bit games to death) are just pleasure to my eyes.  Now, this particular release on Steam is actually a remake.  It includes both the US and EU/JP soundtrack.  If you were to  ask me which one I preferred, I'd say EU/JP because I just feel that Electronic music fits Sonic more than Rock. Also, you can choose from three different Graphic filters and also three different Spin-Dash animations.  And the last added feature, which I really like, is the ability to play the game as Tails after beating it with Sonic.  Sonic CD is probably one of my best purchases I've had on Steam and always will believe so.  Have fun :D","May 11, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also enjoy the small things they have added such as being able to hold more lives than 9, and that just shows Sega really cared when recrafting Sonic CD. I haven't encountered any game-breaking glitches and with my Logitech controller, the game runs no problem, and it's definitely worth checking out if you are a Sonic fan.\n\nThe only gripe I would have is the fact that my saves weren't stored on the cloud or even in an obvious folder on my computer (such as the "My Games" folder which has saves for some of my other games) so when I moved to a new PC, I was very disappointed to see my files have disappeared. It's rather unusual too because my high scores are still intact on the leaderboards, so why couldn't the saves be intact as well?\n\nAll in all, perfect remake.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/recommended/200940/","BasilZero","Basilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/","900 products in account","Game: Sonic CD\nGenre: Adventure\nDeveloper: Sonic Team/SEGA\nSystem: Steam (PC)\nTotal Score: 83/100\nValue Score: 8.3/10\n\n• Story: 7/10\no Sonic CD takes place in separate time zone and possibly a separate reality. Sonic has found out that Dr. Eggman has been playing with time and causing all sorts of issues. With the power of the chaos emeralds, Sonic must travel through time to defeat Eggman and rescue Amy - a new character in the game that is closely related to Sonic.\n\n• Characters: 8/10\no Sonic and Eggman show up in the game just like in any other Sonic game but noticeably missing are Tails and Knuckles who did appear in other Sonic games. For their replacement however two new characters have been added. Amy the pink hedgehog who is in love with Sonic and Metal Sonic a robotic version of the blue hero created by Dr. Eggman to combat Sonic with all and every possible power that Sonic has. Other than that the boss battles most of them are remixes of the older games where you end up fighting Dr. Eggman in his Egg mobile. The enemies are changed somewhat but mainly in appearance as there are several enemies who were recycled in appearance and movement but with minor additions.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no Sonic CD plays like the traditional Sonic game unlike 3D Blast and Pinball. However a few new changes have been added. For one thing a time sign has been added to each and every stage every few areas. These time signs indicate between Past and Future - depending on which one you go through can affect which time you would go in as the name suggests. If you keep running past after check pointing them you will be warped into that specific time. The past usually involves less enemies but more obstacles while the future consists of more open paths but with more enemies. Obtaining the Chaos emeralds is similar to past games and upon capturing all of the emeralds will grant you super Sonic form.\n\n• Graphics: 9/10\no Sonic CD uses a similar visual style as the other 2D sonic games however the details of the locations and of the enemies are far superior to any recent sonic game around its time. Thanks to SEGA CD's upgrade from the genesis, Sonic CD was able to have a bit more texture focus than the other games in the series at the time.\n\n• Sound: 8/10\no Sonic CD uses similar to same sound effects from the older games with a bit better bitrate in quality than the older games again due to the thanks of the power of the Sega CD.\n\n• Music: 10/10\no Sonic CD uses a new set of tracks and tunes for the OST. The soundtrack is very different from the older sonic games bringing it a more exotic feel to it along with the industrial tech backgrounds of the older games.\n\n• Length: 5/10\no Sonic CD is yet again like the other Sonic games despite the fact that one can go different paths thanks to the time zones is still short on the length portion as one can finish the game within 2-3 hours at a quick playthrough. There are seven zones with 2 acts and a third act featuring a direct boss battle. Some of the Zones dont have a third round and could lead you directly to the boss of that zone.\n\n• Replay Value: 6/10\no Sonic CD's replay value allows you to replay each level again in a time challenge - you also have the choice to replay the game through different paths using the time signs but other than that there really isnt much you can do in the game post game wise.\n\n• Player Value: 10/10\no Sonic CD is a great new addition to the 2D Sonic games and undoes every damage that Sonic 3D blast and Spinball did to the series' credibility. Sonic CD brings back the traditional 2D style but brings a visually stunning enhancement and audio thanks to the power of the Sega CD at the time. The game features a bit more of a storyline like Sonic 3 & Knuckles thanks to the addition of the two new characters in the game and the whole time sign/gate aspect is a breath of fresh air introduced in this game.","December 30, 2013","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved it when I was young and I love it now. The game sountrack is one of my favorites as well. I am a bit odd as I prefer the US soundtrack myself to the Japanese unlike the majority of the fandom. One can change soundtracks once in-game. I'd recommend playing through on both.\n\nThis is one of the only sonic games I've found where (only if you want the good ending) you have to take it fairly slow and take in your surroundings. Took me quite a few hours to obtain every achievement, but I did improve my skills by playing the game to it's full potential. Although the juggling of past signs and future signs can be difficult the good ending is most definitely worth it you unlock tails as well in this version!\n\nAs a last note this sonic game is a must buy for any sonic fan as it provides the debute appearence of Metal Sonic and Amy Rose: sonic's #1 fan and self proclaimed "girlfriend".","February 14, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is rather unknown as it got released on the Sega CD.\n\nLike its predecessors. It has colorful graphics and whacky soundtrack.\n\nYou get the option to select if you wanna hear the American or Japanese/European soundtrack.\nThe Japanese soundtrack is a more happy and fast paced soundtrack while the American is a really interesting soundtrack. That has more of a psychadelic feel to it.\n\nSong from the American soundtrack: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJnMXlDq6cs\n\nSong From the Japanese soundtrack: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCPOo3bQIO8\n\nThe game has a kind of time travel "gimmick". There are gates in each level that lets you play in the past or in the future. This makes the game more variated. It changes how the level and enemies look like. And can change the level you are playing on.\n\nIt plays like the old sonic games and looks like them. But it sounds like a game that you would play on the PS1 or dreamcast.\n\nThe good:\nThe US music is interesting\nThe boss battles have good variety\nGood bonus stages\nThe level design\n\nThe bad:\nSome levels are short if you only run through them\nSome levels look really similar to each other and a lot of levels have the same "industrial" theme.\nBoss battles are sometimes somewhat short\nIt can become a bit nauseating.\n\nConclusion:\nSonic CD is a great platformer with interesting music and good level design.\nIts basically a new sonic game for the genesis with better music\n\nPersonal note:\nI have always referred to this game as the "Lost" sonic game. It's because of the Sega CD this game never got much attention.","February 16, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the days when Sonic games didn't suck and everybody eagerly waited for the next release, Sonic CD ranks high amongst fans has one of the best Sonic games to existance.\n\nIt blends platforming with time travel. To travel to the past or the future you need to touch the signpost that says "Past" or "Future" (dah?!) and go at top speed for about 5 sec, so you can go through time! If you go to the future without destroying the robot teleporters from Dr. Robotnik you'll get a bad Future, and vice-versa. It's really a great and fun experience overall.

You actually get proper widescreen support and great scaling options that almost make it look like all of the assets were recreated for hi-res diplays. Hell, even the opening movie is far higher quality than the Sega CD original.  It plays faster and smoother than any emulation I've ever tried (and that's not downplaying how good Genesis/Sega CD emulators can be at all). Being able to switch between the Japanese and US soundtracks is nice as well. Some people might decry the absence of the vocal tracks but that's nothing but a plus in my book.

Just do it.\nThe 3rd entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, or technically Sonic 2.5, is a revloution for the series, implementing cutscenes, two split soundtracks, and an ingeneous time-travel mechanic, and also introduces us to everyones favorite evil automaton, Metal Sonic. The story is great, the zones are fun, the gameplay smooth and easy to catch on to, and the soundtrack is kick-butt awesome.

I loved it when I was young and I love it now. The game sountrack is one of my favorites as well. I am a bit odd as I prefer the US soundtrack myself to the Japanese unlike the majority of the fandom. One can change soundtracks once in-game. I'd recommend playing through on both.\n\nThis is one of the only sonic games I've found where (only if you want the good ending) you have to take it fairly slow and take in your surroundings. Took me quite a few hours to obtain every achievement, but I did improve my skills by playing the game to it's full potential. Although the juggling of past signs and future signs can be difficult the good ending is most definitely worth it you unlock tails as well in this version!\n\nAs a last note this sonic game is a must buy for any sonic fan as it provides the debute appearence of Metal Sonic and Amy Rose: sonic's #1 fan and self proclaimed "girlfriend".","February 14, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We never had a Sega CD so I never got the chance to play Sonic CD - all I had were screenshots in magazines and majestic tales from those that had played it. As such, I had no real nostalgia for this game once I got it in the Sonic action pack. It was a brand new experience.\n\nSonic CD is weird, it's quirky, it's fun, it's cool, and it's still Sonic. There are layers of ideas packed under the Sonic exterior; the levels are designed so that you can either speedrun or explore methodically as Sonic bounces through time. You can either go back in time and destroy Robotnik's badnik generators to produce a good future or just speed through the levels. The game gives you a lot of freedom in that respect, and it also has my favorite special stages out of all the 2D Sonic games.  The soundtrack is funky and the visuals are psychadelic. Sonic CD is like the eccentric cousin to this Genesis brethren. It's a little different, but it's just as viable as an entry into the series.\n\nThis version of Sonic CD has both the US and EU/JP soundtracks that you can flip whenever you want and even an unlockable Tails. It's a great game and this is the definitive version of Sonic CD, and there's really no reason not to give it a go unless you dislike platformers or Sonic games, and even then...who knows? This one is just different enough that it may leave an impression on you.","January 4, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also enjoy the small things they have added such as being able to hold more lives than 9, and that just shows Sega really cared when recrafting Sonic CD. I haven't encountered any game-breaking glitches and with my Logitech controller, the game runs no problem, and it's definitely worth checking out if you are a Sonic fan.\n\nThe only gripe I would have is the fact that my saves weren't stored on the cloud or even in an obvious folder on my computer (such as the "My Games" folder which has saves for some of my other games) so when I moved to a new PC, I was very disappointed to see my files have disappeared.

It's challenging without being unfair and the time-travel mechanic allows you to go back to the past in order to prevent enemies from spawning in the future.

The only thing I found annoying in the game was that it was often difficult to find the Roboticizers in the past stages, so I would sometimes wander around until time ran out.

It had a dark and ominous vibe which was displayed in many of its greatest games that really wasn't like anything else out on the market. Games on the system very much felt like more fully realized, uncensored 16 bit games with crazy concepts as their base. This was evident in classics on the system such as Snatcher, Lunar, and especially Sonic CD. Sonic CD is an anomaly in the series that takes the platforming and speed of the original but throws in a time traveling element as well. Every level has a past, present, good future and bad future variation that is determined by Sonic's use of time travel and him destroying Robotnik's capsules. These "bad future" variations along with the boss levels have a pretty sinister feel to them that really defines the experience of playing Sonic CD. If you think you know what to expect from a Sonic game, give this game a shot and find out for yourself just how unique the Sega CD experience truly is.","November 18, 2013","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of the best Sonic the Hedgehog games to ever grace a video game system (and I'm being a bit bias there).\n\nThe gameplay is typical Sonic the Hedgehog but has a unique twist: time travel. By going through time travel, each level acts differently. Each level has a Past and Future timeline, giving you unique ways to explore each level. What's also cool is the various secrets that you find in each timeline. This is one Sonic game that you can't speed through.\n\nThe Special Stages are back but with a slight difference. Instead of collecting rings, you destroying UFOs while running on a square grid. You can run around as much as you want but beware some of the traps laid across the grid.\n\nThe PC version has some nice extras such as letting you switch between the Japanese and American soundtracks and much more.\n\nThis is a Sonic game that still plays well and stood against the test of time (pun intended).

The biggest differences in gameplay are having the ability to perform the spin dash and peel out. Also, the special stages are as irritating (or seethingly frustrating) as any other classic Sonic title. The time travel storyline for each zone was a really great idea because you get to see your handiwork in the past leave its mark on the future.\n\nAlthough I don't feel this game was as good as Sonic 2 or 3&K, I still think this is a must-have for anyone that enjoyed any of the classic Sonic titles or if you are like me and just want to add the last piece of the collection from a nostalgic era.","April 4, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Replaying it all the way through was not only fun, but left me wanting to play more. The addition of playing as tails and all the amazing extra's was great.\nThe only downside was some of the music choices. When I started the game and the sonic boom song started without lyrics I was instantly sad. The game more than made up for it with the ability to change soundtracks and a music player.\nOverall A terrific game ported well that reminds me of when sonic was relevant to gaming.","February 14, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is signifigantly shorter than sonic 1,2 and 3K. This game a great 2D sonic (not the best, that titles belongs to sonic 3K and sonic 2) and if your a sonic fan you must play this, if your not a sonic fan, give this game a shot, it is reasonably cheap and you may have some fun with it.

The time travel mechanic adds a lot of dimension and replayability (though also convolutes the gameplay slightly, you can easily change time periods without ever intending to, and getting the "good" ending requires completing certain objectives in certain time zones that becomes so complicated that I just don't bother), level design as good as ever and as far as art design goes this must be the trippiest of the series yet. Music is good, not as good as it's made to be. I've heard both the American and Japanese soundtracks, the controversy is overblown. The Japanese soundtrack is definitely peppier while the American one carries a loungier tone and a bit darker in places, but neither are spectacular (the Genesis Sonics have infinitely better music, the hype here likely originated from when CD technology in games was new and "Sonic with CD-quality music OMG!" was the response which has carried over to today), both have their merits though and it's worth checking out both to come to your own conclusions. So, if you're a Sonic n00b or only know Sonic through his recent 3D console outings (my deepest sympathies) then yes this is a definite must esp. at $5, let alone deeply discounted during its numerous sales.","July 15, 2013","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The platforming has slowed down quite a bit, so those who've gotten used to "Hold right to win" may find this transition quite jarring.  The most notable, and obvious, difference, is the time travel mechanic.  Basically, in each zone you can go to either the future or the past, the idea being, go to the past, destroy some machine, and stop Robotnik from messing things up.  It works well to provide extra content for completionists, my only gripe being that you have to keep and maintain a high speed in order to activate said time travel, which is nigh impossible in some areas.  Though never actually impossible, it does get a bit too difficult in some areas.\n\nThe port itself is done incredibly, ignore the "Mouse and Keyboard" thing, it has full controller support right out of the hypothetical box. (Which, on another note, is a problem that a lot of games have.  How about let us label games for controller support or the lack thereof on our own, Valve?).  It runs natively (!) in 16:9 resolutions, no stretching! You can also change the soundtrack between the Japan and U.S. releases.  I do like that, I only wish that they would've implemented a level-by-level soundtrack selections, but this is a minor complaint.  Also included are some neat extras and the ability to play as Tails, as well as some graphics filters (Though, these are mostly useless.  Pick the "Nostalgia" (Ugh, hate that word) filter, the other ones blur the image a bit too much.  And speaking of graphics...\n\nThis game is beautiful.  Seriuosly.  There hasn't been a game that looks this rediculously good in a long time.  The art style is colorful and varied from Zone to Zone (Each of which consists of two regular levels and a boss fight) and from time period to time period within each Zone.  Every little detail has about 12 billion frames of animation, the enemy/character designs are simple but pleasing, Not to mention: PARRALAX SCROLLING, which is done incredibly well within the game, giving a great sense of depth.  Basically, think the awesome graphical quality and detail of say, Sonic 3, but with a lot more Acid. :p\n\nMy only real complaints with the game itself are some of the boss fights are REDICULOUSLY annoying, and took me upwards of five minutes to finish, on occasion.  (Looking at you, Zone 2 pinball boss!)\n\nSonic CD is a standout in the franchise.  And it's routinely on sale, so there's no excuse not to at least try it.  It isn't up to the snuff of say, a Sonic 3 or Sonic Adventure, but still comes highly recommended. 7.5/10","January 22","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gurtygurt/recommended/200940/","gurtygurt","Butt Mother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gurtygurt/","352 products in account","Sonic CD is one of my less favourite classic Sonic games - the level design is the main problem as the game encourages you to go fast (especially with the time travel element), yet punishes you for going fast by having a spike wall right in front of you or something similar. There is often no clear path forward as springs just send you back and the stage having multiple floors just confuse matters. At times the screen is too hard to discern objects from the backgrounds simply because the artists went a bit overboard. Powerup placement is a bit questionable - for example near the first boss is an invincibility box which means there's zero risk of dying.\n\nAnd yet it's really hard to hate this game. It is ultimately a game that was designed with a lot of love and feels more like a sequel to the first game than Sonic 2 did. For all its faults, it still has a great aesthetic and feels more like a Sonic game than anything in the last 10 years does. The graphics were great at the time and still look good today and the soundtrack holds up just as well.\n\nThis version has a nice selection of options including various screen resolutions (including a windowed mode), a few extras, four save slots and achievements. It's pretty good value for money and if you can get it on sale, you're more than likely to get your money's worth out of it. If you played the original Sega CD/Mega CD version it's much the same and you're mostly buying it for the convenience of having it in your Steam library (which is why I've only got about 20 minutes of game time as I write this review), but these other features add to it, too.","January 30","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky."\n\nSonic the Hedgehog:\n"Tell us something we don't know."\n\nDr. Robotnik:\n"SHUT UP! HEED ME! ...and the inner dimension is known as the Land of Darkness. There I lived peacefully in a utopian city called Robotropolis, until Metal Robotnik came out of nowhere and attacked my peaceful city with a batallion of demonic robots. They conquered us and drove me out of my home. Metal Robotnik then sabotaged the Robot Generator which creates the high voltage electricity for the entire city. It is running uncontrollably, and there is no place to store this excess electricity. According to my calculations, if the Robot Generator isn't stopped by sunrise tomorrow, there will be a giant explosion...\n\n-Everyone has fallen asleep due to Robotnik's informative, yet monotonous monologue.-\n\nDr. Robotnik:\nFINE! DON'T BLAME ME WHEN THIS HAPPENS!\n\n-Dr. Robotnik proceeds to pop his favorite balloon model of Planet Freedom to demonstrate the fleeting nature of existence. The balloon makes a noise to signify its demise, and the word 'BAN' fills the screen. Immediately, we cut back to Dr. Robotnik who was humorously the only one affected by the balloon burst.-\n\nMr. President:\n"How can we stop this terrible thing from happenning, Robotnik?"\n\nDr. Robotnik:\n"There's only one thing to do. Someone has to get through Metal Robotnik's traps, go into Robotropolis, and stop that generator before sunrise, and it should be the fastest one here.\n\n-Sonic the Hedgehog lounges on Mr. President's desk. He pushes on his unnaturally elongated nose in the manner that a professional golfer might handle a tee before a triumphant teeoff. Tails, Mr. President, Sara, and a horde of haphazardly crafted robots watch him with anticipatory desperation.-\n\nSonic the Hedgehog:\n"Forget about it. You created that stupid contraption in the first place. Why should I have to go around cleanin' up your messes?\n_______________\n\nThis was apparently the premise of Sonic CD in the minds of the Studio Pierrot writers for the ADV film. Of course, Sonic accepts the mission, Robotnik turns out to be the real bad guy, Metal Sonic is the true threat created by Robotnik, and Knuckles saves the day because Knuckles is great.\n\nAnyway, the reason this film is important to me in correlation with the Sonic CD game is that in 1996, I acquired both the Sonic OVA on VHS and Sonic CD for PC. By that time, I had read the Sonic comics and seen a bit of SatAM. I specifically appreciated the elements of classic Sonic media that appeared dystopic or haunting. With the American soundtrack, Sonic CD presented a reality where Robotnik was more than a maniacal tinkerer. He was more reminiscent of his SatAM counterpart. In the past, places Sonic might visit appeared lush and vibrant but devoid of human life. In the present and future, signs of humanity were developing, but mankind was nowhere to be found.\n\nEnvironments consisting of ruins and mechanized cities in the game are filled with snares and structures that seem to be purposed to hinder Sonic. This insinuates that Robotnik could have created the ruins and cities himself as a means of writing his own history. To reiterate, no people are found in these locales. This implied to me that Robotnik was either a calculating warlord that was able to eliminate humanity and replace it with machinery or he was the last surviving member of the human race that was seeking desperately to bring mankind back by fabricating creatures and settings that could replace his lost race. Stardust Speedway's appearance almost draws one to believe that Robotnik wishes to retain a grasp of the artistic and musical in a world where everything has grown cold by his actions. Whether Robotnik was driven insane or was a tyrant, he must have seen the emergence of other sentient creatures as abominable. Sonic had to die because his mere existence contradicted Robotnik's plans for a new mankind.\n\nI will stop prattling on about my own personal interpretations. It is obvious that many others have overanalyzed the Sonic series, and as with many fictions, no one assumption is solely validated or refutable. However, I do believe that the classic Sonic series (Sonic CD in particular) focused heavily on visual storytelling and expected players to glean details through observation. I think this creative element was the initial reason that fans of the Sonic series were so passionate and verbose comparatively to fans of other simpler series. Sonic CD serves as a testament to the fact that the Sonic series can be contempletive and enjoyable, no matter what the future brings.","January 25","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, it's difficult to pick the best between this, Sonic 2, or S3&K. They are all excellent and have their own strengths. Sonic CDs strengths are the audio quality thanks to being a Mega CD title, the level design, and the core mechanic of travelling through time, along with the Time Stones instead of the usual Chaos Emeralds.\n\nOn a technical level, the sound quality is superior to the Mega Drive Sonic games, however I feel that the tunes are just not as catchy or memorable as the BGM found on the cartridge games. Both the Japanese and Western soundtracks are included with this release on Steam, and while the consensus is that the Japanese soundtrack is great and the Western soundtrack not-so-great, I personally find them both to be rather hit and miss. Both soundtracks definitely have their 'This is a sweet track' and 'lolwtf' moments.\n\nThe controls are your standard classic Sonic, movement left, right, up and down, and a jump button. One improvement in this release is you can set the spin dash and peel out moves to work like Sonic 2, 3 and S&K. In those games the instant you let the direction go (down for spin dash, up for peel out) the move was executed. In the original Sonic CD game, there was a warm up period you had to go through before the move actually came out, which made them a bit clunky to use. The game works fine on keyboard, I have not tried with a controller but I'd assume it's fine with that too.\n\nGraphics wise the display has been modified to fit either 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio correctly. There are also filters that can be turned on to soften and smooth out the image.\n\nThe level (or zone) design is the most colourful and chaotic of the classic Sonic games, with lots of pastel colours in the palette, and a level layout that utilises a lot of vertical space and many different routes to take to get to the end of a zone, making them both pleasing to the eye and lots of fun to play. Both the colour and layout of each zone change when Sonic travels through time, which brings us to the time travel mechanic that's unique to Sonic CD.\n\nSonic starts each zone in the present time. Scattered around each zone are sign posts that say either 'Past' or 'Future'. After touching one of these sign posts and running at full speed for a few seconds, Sonic will travel to either the past or future, depending on what was written on the last sign post he touched. Both past and future versions of a zone use a unique colour palette, as well as having different layouts. The past is more forgiving in that there are less badniks and obstacles like spikes about, however there are two different possible futures that Sonic can visit.\n\nInitially travelling to a zones future will take Sonic to the zones 'bad future'. There are a lot of badniks roaming about, a lot of traps like spikes and crush traps, the colours are dark and drab, it's generally a very unwelcoming place to be. However, it doesn't have to be this way as Sonic is able to prevent these 'bad futures' by travelling to a zones past and destroying a badnik making machine. Each zone has one of these machines, they can also be found in the present and bad future time periods, but can only be destroyed in the past.\n\nWhen one of these machines is destroyed, that zones future will become a 'good future'. It also kills all badnik robots in that zone. There are three zones that make up a 'Round'. The third zone of each round is always set in one of the two possible futures, and is where boss battles take place. When both zones one and two have good futures, the third zone is automatically a good future too. However if Sonic fails to make both zones one and two have good futures, the third zone will be set in a bad future.\n\nReaching the goal post at the end of a zone with 50 or more rings with allow you to access the special stage. It is in these special stages that Sonic can get the Time Stones. The special stages in Sonic CD play similar to Mario Kart on the SNES but in full screen. They are quite tricky to play, as it is difficult to judge distance due to the lack of depth perception of 2D sprite graphics. I can offer some advice with these special stages, you need to jump earlier that you think you do.\n\nPart of the replay value of Sonic CD is trying to make every zone in the game have a good future. Another part is collecting all seven time stones. Like all classic Sonic games, you can beat the game without collecting any of these time stones or making any good futures, but you will not get the 'real ending'.\n\nThis is a great game for people who loved the old classic Sonic games and maybe missed out on this one back in the day, due to it being released on the ill fated Mega CD. It plays and looks great, features some of the most creative level design seen in the classic Sonic games, and features the debut of both Amy Rose and Metal Sonic. Tails is also available as a playable character (needs to be unlocked). I recommend this game.","January 29","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now on the computer!\n\nAmazing game here. Level design gives you a slight challenge, but very little actual frustration. Love the time travel aspect of the game, it really gives the game it's own identity.  Interesting boss battles that do more than just have you dodge crap and hit Robotnik's latest Failatron 2000. And Metal Sonic. A racing boss battle. Oh man is this a lot of fun. Can get a little frustrating but you'll get it, don't worry. Metal Sonic's battle would soon be re-made in Sonic Generations and it's just as fun. You'll love it.\n\nThe spin dash is in here which is awesome, it's just as useful as it ever was. The Super Peel-Out is introduced here which gives you a giant boost of speed (so much that Sonic may even fly off the screen (for a couple seconds)! I'm not kidding, go look up some videos or something). However it doesn't protect you from enemies... So... yeaaah...\n\nDisappointed that Super Sonic isn't in here, so that's kind of a let down. But you still collect 7 of something, lemme say that. You get Time Stones. Get 50 rings, jump in the giant ring at the end of the level, and you get transported to a Special Stage where it takes a... 3D-ish approach? You move around, jump and destroy UFOs (don't ask me why UFOs, aliens ftw), avoid water (putting your foot in that stuff will eat 10 seconds off your time). Oh yeah. Time. You're being timed. So yeah, just be on your guard in those Special Stages.\nAnyway, get all the Time Stones and you get the real good ending.\nComplete the game normally and it'll tell you to try again BUT you can play as Tails. Soo... yay? It's a cool little feature but nothing amazing.\n\nOne last thing: The soundtrack. As a Sonic game, it delivers an amazing soundtrack that's so much fun to listen to. Except the Collision Chaos Act 3 (USA) music. Shut up, Eggie, this is not a horror game.\nYou can choose between the Japanese and US soundtracks. The main ones that stuck out to me though are the amazing theme of the game in the US, Sonic Boom (which Crush 40 would later cover, featuring Cash-Cash. Look it up. You'll thank me later.), and the Japanese theme of Metal Sonic, Stardust Speedway. The other ones are good, no doubt, but those are my favorites.\n\nI HIGHLY suggest you get this game if you are a Sonic fan. If you're not, try it, it is worth it (Really cheap price too... But hey, I'm not complaining).","August 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This gives the game more replayability as a different combination of levels falls on each playthrough. And some of those zones are the most beautiful and varied you've seen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VESTAE/recommended/200940/","VESTAE","VES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VESTAE/","239 products in account","Among the original Sonic games this is the one I find myself returning to the most. The art and music of this game is, in my view, the pinnacle of the original Sonic series. Not only does each stage have three iterations of its music - there are two different soundtracks to choose from (JP is best). Each level presents a good balance between brevity and intricacy, and are a pleasure to go through on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe time travel mechanic is somewhat awkward to execute, but allows for a multitude of interesting level designs and overall replayability. This aspect of the game is also completely optional. Sonic CD also features one of the more interesting special stage modes, although the faux 3D style is a small step down in terms of visual presentation.\n\nThis game does have the usual minor shortcomings found in the series. The bosses are creative, but generally too easy to beat. Most zones present little challenge to get through, although wacky workbench is perhaps the most irritating stage in history. I would say it is a shame this game doesn't seem to have the recognition the mainline sonic games have enjoyed. Updated features and achievements definitely make this one of the best Sonic games to get on Steam. I recommend this game.","February 12","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donut64s/recommended/200940/","donut64s","Ponut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donut64s/","88 products in account","Sonic CD is a 32-bit platformer that is strangely about exploration rather than speed. It's still more momentum-based than your average Platformer games, but the game itself centers around "going fast" only so far as travelling through time.\n\nThere are 4 versions of each stage. If you complete a Stage with 50 or more rings, you get to play the Bonus Stage. The Sonic CD (PC) lets you choose between the JP and US music for the whole game. Each stage has a Present, Past, Good Future and Bad Future. By default, the "Future" is the Bad Future and you have to go into the past & explore the level to find & destroy a robot teleporter thingy. After you destroy the teleporter, all enemies (but not obstacles) in the level are destroyed in the Past, Present & now Good Future.\n\nAs I said before, there's a different piece of music for each stage. The Present & Future feature .mp3 audio tracks, while the past features PCM (PC-Music) audio music that's programmed in a manner similiar to classic PC game music such as Warcraft II, Diablo, or Command & Conquer, so it sounds more unique. What might throw you off when you first play the game is that the MP3 music tracks have people singing sometimes; what I had to remember was that this is a 32-bit PC game, not a 16-bit console game!\n\nThere are a few gameplay/level features that differ from the original Sonic CD, the most major being after you have played through each stage as Sonic you can then play through the game again as Tails, with an appropriate (and adorable) updated sprite for Sonic CD. Playing again as "Tails" is basically easy-mode. Completing the game as Sonic gets you the credits-roll of the original Sonic CD staff & credits music, whereas playing as Tails through the game gets you the credits roll of the 2012 PC remake (of the 1996 PC port...).\n\nWhat is important to note for a diehard Sonic fan, is that this is a remake of the 1996 PC version of Sonic CD. It has nothing to do with a ROM hack nor does it have anything to do with DOSBox.","October 25, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In which, it's a very unique one.\n\nThis game (I find) is the darkest in the series. And I don't mean dark as in guns and devilish creatures (Shadow the Hedgehog) or a general dark story (Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic 360).\n\nBut it's the presentation that makes this game the darkest.\n\nIn this game, you have to find the Time Stones or venture back in time and destroy Eggmans (or Dr. Ivo Robotnik) generators in order to ensure a good future for Little Planet and it's unseen inhabitants.\n\nHowever, if you fail to do either task, you will ensure a bad future.\n\nA bad future is basically a bad ending. This means Eggman has won; he has ruined all the zones with mechanical machienery. This is evident with the pollution, the evil music (for the US OST anyways..), and overall disgusting look of seeing that nature has been corrupted.\n\nThat's why I find it the darkest game in the series (not to mention the creepy images in the sound test.)\n\nSpeaking of music, this soundtrack is AMAZING.\n\nThere is a common debate over which regional soundtrack is best, as the US s.t. differs from the JP/EU s.t.\n\nI personally LOVE the JP/EU s.t. so much. In fact, I think it may be my favorite Sonic soundtrack ever.\n\nThe US one is great as well, it really fits the stages and the boss (threatning music).\n\nWhile I love a lot of aspects in this game, I do have some problems as well.\n\nOne is the level design. I love the level themes, but the execution is..eh. I find that the levels in this game always have some sort of obstacle that stops all momentum. And while that's not bad once in a while, it gets ridicious as the game goes on. One minute you'll be zooming at the speed of sound then BAM! Either an enemy, item capsule, or something stops all that speed. Not to say the other classic sonic games did that, but I feel this one takes the cake in that department.\n\nAnother thing I don't care for...the special stages. I don't know if it's just me but I can never seem to get sonic in a good enough position to hit those damn moving ufo's! And not to mention, even when I jump RIGHT next to a blimp, it doesn't count.\n\nI recommend traveling back in time using the posts to get the good ending like I did, because I honestly can't be bothered with those annoying special stages.\n\nFinally, while I love that the bosses in this game are quite (might be some of the most unique bosses in Sonic history honestly), some of these too can get tedious (i'm looking at YOU pinball eggman)\n\n\nOverall, with a great game, amazing soundtrack, interesting story, and cool levels, Sonic CD is definetly a great Sonic game. Some problems, but still an enjoyable title i'd say.\n\nIf I had to rate it, i'd give it a 8.5/10.","April 5","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think as replacement music, its pretty good, but I know my ears are still expecting something different to play, so at times its a bit jarring in comparison. That's alllll personal opinion on that though.

It's different to other sonic games because of reasons like this, not to mention the story. The story is shown in Hand-drawn cutscenes at the start and end of the game. But it's not just this, but also in gameplay, accidentally travelling to the future will show you what happens if you don't do something. A desolate robotic wasteland of Little Planet; so as a way of stopping this, you must accidentally travel to the past, and destroy all signs of Robotnik.\n\nI think that the time travel aspect sets it completely apart from not only other Sonic games, but other games in general.\n\nI would recommend getting it on mobile, too.","November 4, 2015","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is amazing, the visuals are well-done and the extras are worth the extra price. On the other hand, the level design of this game is abysmal. It's a Sonic game that punishes you for moving quickly, throwing enemies and obstacles at you right when you start picking up speed. The game is also very exploration-based, which contradicts the speedy gameplay the rest of the series is known for.\n\nIf you want to enjoy Sonic CD, you need to get into a specific mindset. Don't expect a game as good as Sonic 3. Don't anticipate that it will be an action-packed. Don't hope that the gameplay is as good as the soundtrack. Set your expectations low, and it will make the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nAlso, play with the JP soundtrack. :B","July 29, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For many of the original-era gamers, re-releases such as this are the only way to play original titles and give them the attention they deserve.\n\nBut this is not just a re-release!  This version has been enhanced and built upon by fans of the game, and they have not only updated it, they have added new features that arguably elevate this title above the original.  It plays beautifully; a new pkayable character has been added (TAILS!!!) and of course Achievements have been included to bring it up to date.\n\nI only wish the other Sonic games built by the same team could be released on other platforms than the mobile market as they are excellent... but, we can be grateful for this at least.","July 26, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In which, it's a very unique one.\n\nThis game (I find) is the darkest in the series. And I don't mean dark as in guns and devilish creatures (Shadow the Hedgehog) or a general dark story (Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic 360).\n\nBut it's the presentation that makes this game the darkest.\n\nIn this game, you have to find the Time Stones or venture back in time and destroy Eggmans (or Dr. Ivo Robotnik) generators in order to ensure a good future for Little Planet and it's unseen inhabitants.\n\nHowever, if you fail to do either task, you will ensure a bad future.\n\nA bad future is basically a bad ending. This means Eggman has won; he has ruined all the zones with mechanical machienery. This is evident with the pollution, the evil music (for the US OST anyways..), and overall disgusting look of seeing that nature has been corrupted.\n\nThat's why I find it the darkest game in the series (not to mention the creepy images in the sound test.)\n\nSpeaking of music, this soundtrack is AMAZING.\n\nThere is a common debate over which regional soundtrack is best, as the US s.t. differs from the JP/EU s.t.\n\nI personally LOVE the JP/EU s.t. so much. In fact, I think it may be my favorite Sonic soundtrack ever.\n\nThe US one is great as well, it really fits the stages and the boss (threatning music).\n\nWhile I love a lot of aspects in this game, I do have some problems as well.\n\nOne is the level design. I love the level themes, but the execution is..eh. I find that the levels in this game always have some sort of obstacle that stops all momentum. And while that's not bad once in a while, it gets ridicious as the game goes on. One minute you'll be zooming at the speed of sound then BAM! Either an enemy, item capsule, or something stops all that speed. Not to say the other classic sonic games did that, but I feel this one takes the cake in that department.\n\nAnother thing I don't care for...the special stages. I don't know if it's just me but I can never seem to get sonic in a good enough position to hit those damn moving ufo's! And not to mention, even when I jump RIGHT next to a blimp, it doesn't count.\n\nI recommend traveling back in time using the posts to get the good ending like I did, because I honestly can't be bothered with those annoying special stages.\n\nFinally, while I love that the bosses in this game are quite (might be some of the most unique bosses in Sonic history honestly), some of these too can get tedious (i'm looking at YOU pinball eggman)\n\n\nOverall, with a great game, amazing soundtrack, interesting story, and cool levels, Sonic CD is definetly a great Sonic game. Some problems, but still an enjoyable title i'd say.\n\nIf I had to rate it, i'd give it a 8.5/10.","April 5","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel as though I played better as a child than I do now, but it may be to due to not having a good enough controller for my dying laptop. Disappointed in the change of music, as that was one of the things that drew me into replaying the game as a kid, but I understand why it had to happen. I think as replacement music, its pretty good, but I know my ears are still expecting something different to play, so at times its a bit jarring in comparison. That's alllll personal opinion on that though. It's a great rerelease and definitely any fan should own if they don't already have a copy available to them :)","March 31","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blatz42/recommended/200940/","blatz42","blatz42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blatz42/","119 products in account","Sonic CD strays quite a bit from earlier Sonic titles, and from one's since.  The platforming has slowed down quite a bit, so those who've gotten used to "Hold right to win" may find this transition quite jarring.  The most notable, and obvious, difference, is the time travel mechanic.  Basically, in each zone you can go to either the future or the past, the idea being, go to the past, destroy some machine, and stop Robotnik from messing things up.  It works well to provide extra content for completionists, my only gripe being that you have to keep and maintain a high speed in order to activate said time travel, which is nigh impossible in some areas.  Though never actually impossible, it does get a bit too difficult in some areas.\n\nThe port itself is done incredibly, ignore the "Mouse and Keyboard" thing, it has full controller support right out of the hypothetical box. (Which, on another note, is a problem that a lot of games have.  How about let us label games for controller support or the lack thereof on our own, Valve?).  It runs natively (!) in 16:9 resolutions, no stretching! You can also change the soundtrack between the Japan and U.S. releases.  I do like that, I only wish that they would've implemented a level-by-level soundtrack selections, but this is a minor complaint.  Also included are some neat extras and the ability to play as Tails, as well as some graphics filters (Though, these are mostly useless.  Pick the "Nostalgia" (Ugh, hate that word) filter, the other ones blur the image a bit too much.  And speaking of graphics...\n\nThis game is beautiful.  Seriuosly.  There hasn't been a game that looks this rediculously good in a long time.  The art style is colorful and varied from Zone to Zone (Each of which consists of two regular levels and a boss fight) and from time period to time period within each Zone.  Every little detail has about 12 billion frames of animation, the enemy/character designs are simple but pleasing, Not to mention: PARRALAX SCROLLING, which is done incredibly well within the game, giving a great sense of depth.  Basically, think the awesome graphical quality and detail of say, Sonic 3, but with a lot more Acid. :p\n\nMy only real complaints with the game itself are some of the boss fights are REDICULOUSLY annoying, and took me upwards of five minutes to finish, on occasion.  (Looking at you, Zone 2 pinball boss!)\n\nSonic CD is a standout in the franchise.  And it's routinely on sale, so there's no excuse not to at least try it.  It isn't up to the snuff of say, a Sonic 3 or Sonic Adventure, but still comes highly recommended. 7.5/10","January 22","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is amazing, the visuals are well-done and the extras are worth the extra price. On the other hand, the level design of this game is abysmal. It's a Sonic game that punishes you for moving quickly, throwing enemies and obstacles at you right when you start picking up speed. The game is also very exploration-based, which contradicts the speedy gameplay the rest of the series is known for.\n\nIf you want to enjoy Sonic CD, you need to get into a specific mindset. Don't expect a game as good as Sonic 3. Don't anticipate that it will be an action-packed. Don't hope that the gameplay is as good as the soundtrack. Set your expectations low, and it will make the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nAlso, play with the JP soundtrack. :B","July 29, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky."\n\nSonic the Hedgehog:\n"Tell us something we don't know."\n\nDr. Robotnik:\n"SHUT UP! HEED ME! ...and the inner dimension is known as the Land of Darkness. There I lived peacefully in a utopian city called Robotropolis, until Metal Robotnik came out of nowhere and attacked my peaceful city with a batallion of demonic robots. They conquered us and drove me out of my home. Metal Robotnik then sabotaged the Robot Generator which creates the high voltage electricity for the entire city. It is running uncontrollably, and there is no place to store this excess electricity. According to my calculations, if the Robot Generator isn't stopped by sunrise tomorrow, there will be a giant explosion...\n\n-Everyone has fallen asleep due to Robotnik's informative, yet monotonous monologue.-\n\nDr. Robotnik:\nFINE! DON'T BLAME ME WHEN THIS HAPPENS!\n\n-Dr. Robotnik proceeds to pop his favorite balloon model of Planet Freedom to demonstrate the fleeting nature of existence. The balloon makes a noise to signify its demise, and the word 'BAN' fills the screen. Immediately, we cut back to Dr. Robotnik who was humorously the only one affected by the balloon burst.-\n\nMr. President:\n"How can we stop this terrible thing from happenning, Robotnik?"\n\nDr. Robotnik:\n"There's only one thing to do. Someone has to get through Metal Robotnik's traps, go into Robotropolis, and stop that generator before sunrise, and it should be the fastest one here.\n\n-Sonic the Hedgehog lounges on Mr. President's desk. He pushes on his unnaturally elongated nose in the manner that a professional golfer might handle a tee before a triumphant teeoff. Tails, Mr. President, Sara, and a horde of haphazardly crafted robots watch him with anticipatory desperation.-\n\nSonic the Hedgehog:\n"Forget about it. You created that stupid contraption in the first place. Why should I have to go around cleanin' up your messes?\n_______________\n\nThis was apparently the premise of Sonic CD in the minds of the Studio Pierrot writers for the ADV film. Of course, Sonic accepts the mission, Robotnik turns out to be the real bad guy, Metal Sonic is the true threat created by Robotnik, and Knuckles saves the day because Knuckles is great.\n\nAnyway, the reason this film is important to me in correlation with the Sonic CD game is that in 1996, I acquired both the Sonic OVA on VHS and Sonic CD for PC. By that time, I had read the Sonic comics and seen a bit of SatAM. I specifically appreciated the elements of classic Sonic media that appeared dystopic or haunting. With the American soundtrack, Sonic CD presented a reality where Robotnik was more than a maniacal tinkerer. He was more reminiscent of his SatAM counterpart. In the past, places Sonic might visit appeared lush and vibrant but devoid of human life. In the present and future, signs of humanity were developing, but mankind was nowhere to be found.\n\nEnvironments consisting of ruins and mechanized cities in the game are filled with snares and structures that seem to be purposed to hinder Sonic. This insinuates that Robotnik could have created the ruins and cities himself as a means of writing his own history. To reiterate, no people are found in these locales. This implied to me that Robotnik was either a calculating warlord that was able to eliminate humanity and replace it with machinery or he was the last surviving member of the human race that was seeking desperately to bring mankind back by fabricating creatures and settings that could replace his lost race. Stardust Speedway's appearance almost draws one to believe that Robotnik wishes to retain a grasp of the artistic and musical in a world where everything has grown cold by his actions. Whether Robotnik was driven insane or was a tyrant, he must have seen the emergence of other sentient creatures as abominable. Sonic had to die because his mere existence contradicted Robotnik's plans for a new mankind.\n\nI will stop prattling on about my own personal interpretations. It is obvious that many others have overanalyzed the Sonic series, and as with many fictions, no one assumption is solely validated or refutable. However, I do believe that the classic Sonic series (Sonic CD in particular) focused heavily on visual storytelling and expected players to glean details through observation. I think this creative element was the initial reason that fans of the Sonic series were so passionate and verbose comparatively to fans of other simpler series. Sonic CD serves as a testament to the fact that the Sonic series can be contempletive and enjoyable, no matter what the future brings.","January 25","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art and music of this game is, in my view, the pinnacle of the original Sonic series. Not only does each stage have three iterations of its music - there are two different soundtracks to choose from (JP is best). Each level presents a good balance between brevity and intricacy, and are a pleasure to go through on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe time travel mechanic is somewhat awkward to execute, but allows for a multitude of interesting level designs and overall replayability. This aspect of the game is also completely optional. Sonic CD also features one of the more interesting special stage modes, although the faux 3D style is a small step down in terms of visual presentation.\n\nThis game does have the usual minor shortcomings found in the series. The bosses are creative, but generally too easy to beat. Most zones present little challenge to get through, although wacky workbench is perhaps the most irritating stage in history. I would say it is a shame this game doesn't seem to have the recognition the mainline sonic games have enjoyed. Updated features and achievements definitely make this one of the best Sonic games to get on Steam. I recommend this game.","February 12","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For many of the original-era gamers, re-releases such as this are the only way to play original titles and give them the attention they deserve.\n\nBut this is not just a re-release!  This version has been enhanced and built upon by fans of the game, and they have not only updated it, they have added new features that arguably elevate this title above the original.  It plays beautifully; a new pkayable character has been added (TAILS!!!) and of course Achievements have been included to bring it up to date.\n\nI only wish the other Sonic games built by the same team could be released on other platforms than the mobile market as they are excellent... but, we can be grateful for this at least.","July 26, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealDylanator/recommended/200940/","TheRealDylanator","TheRealGlaceon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealDylanator/","23 products in account","Introduction\nI bought the Megadrive / Genesis collection and was surprised to see Sonic CD as an added bonus. Sonic CD was a game that I never got too far into when I was younger, not even past zone 2, not only because I was bad at videogames but because of the amazing soundtracks single flaw. (For those of you who don't know, the gameover music is horrifying to a young child.)\n\nNow, keep in mind I love Sonic games old and new (excluding the new nintendo exclusives) meaning there's no bias, that and I didn't actually start playing Sonic games until I got Sonic Rush, I loved it and would love to see a steam remake.\n\nI will not be spoiling the plot, though it is pretty simplistic however. Due to the fact that Sonic Games have never been plot heavy the plot will not effect this review.\n\n\nThe Review\nTHE MENU\n\nOk, first up (after the developer splash screens) you're greeted by a main menu, what's so great about this is the fact that you can do 2 things that made the game more enjoyable for me, from the main menu you can alternate between the Japanese/Europen and American soundtracks. I never got to experience my own regions soundtrack before due to the Gems Collection on the Playstation 2 sporting the american one. You can also switch between the spindash styles of Sonic 2 (and almost every game to follow) or Sonic CD's style. Choose the one that works for you.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe opening cutscene is a visual masterpiece full of action and compared to the original is astounding. The widescreen ajustment of the game also works wonders and makes the game more amazing to look at, the spritework is amazing too and it shows that Sonic Team has always been passionate about the Blue Blur. I could continue on the graphics but I'd just start repeating points.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nDid you like Sonic 2's fast gameplay? Good, CD takes that and amps it up! Sonic is fast and has no intention on stopping, when your on a roll, bouncing off everything and spinning through it all as you watch numbers in the hundreds pop up and add to your score is really satasfying.\n\nTo those of you who've never played a Sonic game, the general idea is run fast and jump into everything. Rolling will mow through enemies and so will a charged spindash attack.\n\nThough in this game Sonic brings a new type of spindash to the table, the super peel out, it's faster but all you need to do is turn it into a roll and you get the destruction of a spindash and speed of the peel out. It kind of makes the peel out feel worthless.\n\nAnother mechanic is brought in, TIME TRAVEL. This game keeps it simple however, just go fast through a sign saying "past" or "future" and you'll go that direction in time, assuming you don't lose speed.\n\nThere are 4 timezones, Past, Present, Bad Future and Good Future. The past is a simpler time, less modern machinery, there will be Robotnik Generators and Metal Sonic Holograms, destroying them changes the course of the future entirely. More on that later.\n\nIn the present, things are basic, Robotnik is taking over though, there is some moder machinery and norma enemies, you always start in the present with the only exceptions being boss levels, which are in the future.\n\nThe futures is where this gets complicated. The future is automatically the bad future, where Sonic lost, Robotnik had taken over, the Bad Futures seem more difficult but that may just be the aesthetics fooling me. Now if you destroy the generator and the Metal Sonic hologram you make a good future in that act, good futures have happy music and are completely devoid of enemies. If you make a Good Future in every act of a zone, the boss fight will be in the good future, doing this for every zone will unlock the good ending. Though getting all 7 time stones will get the same effect.\n\nThe time stones are discount Chaos Emeralds, obtained by going through the giant ring at the end of a level if you have 50 or more rings. Doing this will take you to a 3D rendered mini-game. Destroy the UFOs with limited time, touching water reduces your time. Destroying them all gets you a stone.\n\nSOUND\n\nBOTH SOUNDTRACKS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND STILL HOLD UP TODAY! They fit the areas they were made for perfectly. For the Megadrive the sound quality is amazing, give both soundtracks a shot.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThis game is a classic masterpiece and a great upgrade to the original, the asking price is low too, there isn't really anything negative to say about whats in there, for those of you who own this version you'll notice I had a lot to say without even mentionint that you unlock Tails after beating the game or the time trial mode. I'd reccomend this game for sure, if you want a game that's fun and aren't all that fussed about plot, this game is for you.\n\nTheRealDylanator made a good future in Steam Sales Zone!","May 27","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's amazing to play this on Sega CD, and it's stunning to play it on PC. This version is indeed superior to the 1996 PC port for all of you hardcore sega fans.","May 30","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is Nearly a perfect mix of speed and platforming. But some stages can feel like mazes if you don't know where to go. Soundtrack is some of the best in the series! Special stages in sonic games are usually pretty bad but in this game they are very good. You must play this game!","May 4","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
