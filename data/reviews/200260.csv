Why? Because I'm just such a Joker\n\nIt's Bat and better than ever. Good story, nice gameplay, Arkham City has Gotham all. Don't listen to those crappy negative reviews, they're just a Bane in the butt, and if you're about to post one of those reviews, stop right there Mister, Freeze! I hate people who are always Wayne-ing like that. Anyway, like Victor Fries, Batman is just ice, meaning that you get to put a Dent in the faces of those who think Robin people is a good thing. You'll find yourself playing this game way, way late into the Dark Knight. In other words, after playing this game it will be hard Two-Face the real world again. Trust me, Ivy played this game so much. I can Harley believe how good this game is. If anyone is unhappy with this game, then I ask you, why so serious?\n\n\nOh gosh, Batman's probably gonna PUNch me now.","December 21, 2014","true","29.3"," 984 of 1,123 people (88%) found this review helpful 1,372 people found this review funny","88","984","1","372","34"

Rocksteady kept true to their excellent action, stealth, gadgetry and puzzle-solving formula and made improvements only where they were needed.  The freeflow combat and silent predator systems also make a welcome comeback.  Where Arkham Asylum was a bit more rigid in it's story telling, Arkham City makes the improvement of creating a more open world and adding well-integrated side missions that have some meaning to the main story and makes the game feel less linear.  Again the voice acting is top-notch and the pacing and progression of the story is a high-point of this title.","November 24, 2013","true","35.0"," 248 of 263 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","248","263","0","8"

There are so many criminals in Gotham City that someone decided Black Gate prison and Arkham Asylum can't house them all, so now there's an entire city district now being used as a prison / asylum. With that logic out of the way, this is an open world game unique unto itself. The city is gorgeous, every part of the city is a vista no matter how grimy areas are, they're all so beautiful. Every locale oozes personality, from a frozen police station to a clown infested steel mill. No exterior seems copied and pasted and that says a lot. There is an amazing attention to detail and the game still runs silky smooth.\n\nWhile the city (district) is big, it doesn't feel huge, there are missions that will have you from one end of the city (district) to the other in about two minutes, because Batman knows how to get around. You'll glide from place to place, dive kick enemies and use your grappling hook to quickly get from rooftop to rooftop. Not only that, but just holding the run button has a lot of functionality, it'll let you jump, climb and even glide. So you never miss a beat. Catwoman has a whip to get around. She can also cling to walls and ceilings.\n\nThe streets are still dangerous, that's where most of the enemies are. You can keep to the rooftops or stealth around them. You can take out enemies stealthily one by one by using gargoyles to hide in the shadows and floor or wall grates to move through from point A to point B all to evade enemy detection. You'll hear them talk about things and when they find one of their comrades down, they'll be more alert and eager to shoot down gargoyles so you won't have that one to hide on. Once you get far enough in the game, you'll unlock challenge rooms which revisit previous locations, but with more challenge that you need to take out the enemies using stealth.\n\nAlmost all of the major villains are back from Arkham Asylum, proving Batman should really start killing his greatest foes. Not just that, but there are new villains and almost all of them have their own gang. This gives the goons more style, but really, the goons are all the same for the most part resorting to just brawlers and gunmen. Eventually the game amps things up with long range snipers, armored brawlers, shielded brawlers, knife wielders and stun batoners. If a gun or weapon gets knocked out of the hand of a gunman, someone else can pick it up. The brawlers will pile on you, sometimes two dozen at a time, and as Batman, you can easily if not tediously defeat them. Batman: Arkham City is essentially a beat em up with a lot of traversal. Batman really just has one attack button to spam and Batman will do all of the punching, kicks, sweeps and brawling himself. When enemies telegraph an attack, you have a counter button. There are other enemies that require you to use a stun maneuver, but you might forget you even have it. The gunners require a lot more finesse to deal with, since Batman can easily be murdered by anything with a gun, even when you start upgrading your armor. The AI of the gunners is great, they'll patrol, warn others when they find a downed ally. While the enemy variety is very limited, they all seem very smart, so that makes up for it. Why have specific enemy types when they're all smart enough to do anything?\n\nOther than brawling, Batman has other tools and a quick switch menu using the D-pad. You'll start out with everything you earned in the previous game. Multiple batterangs, remote control batterangs, a zip-line, explosive gel, a grappling hook to rip down high up grates, a new smoke bomb to hide when you've been spotted, freeze grenades, which are good for freezing one enemy at a time and floating through the sewers. You'll quickly find a new electricity gun for lack of a better term that will power devices like garage doors. Everything in the arsenal can be used for combat or traversal.\n\nMaking its return is also detective mode that lets you see hints, such as highlighting enemies, seeing them through objects, lit up gargoyles you can grapple onto, doors, grates, footprints, sniper rifle trajectories and the Riddler's riddles. Speaking of the riddles, in the previous games they were just collectables. At the most you had to blow up a wall using explosive gel to reach them. Now you'll need to solve puzzles to get them. It is amazing the level of detail that was put into this game, even just for these common puzzles. You'll come across them often.\n\nSpeaking of the level of detail, the side quests aren't just quests, but they feel like extra storylines. Everything is fully voiced. Every NPC, villain, thug, Batman and Catwoman. You'll hear thugs discussing things, along with radio transmissions every so often. In the previous game you were taunted by the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker for those that remember the old Batman: The Animated Series. Kevin Conroy reprises his role from the series as Batman, and they're both excellent. There are plenty of other major voice acting stars such as Tara Strong, Nolan North and Maurice LaMarce.\n\nWith the actual game out of the way, there is the 'Riddler's Revenge' mode, which are challenge rooms like the first game had. Combat rooms where you get a high score beating up waves enemies. Then there are 'predator maps' that require you to take out gunmen in specific ways to beat the challenges. There are even downloadable challenge rooms, mini campaigns and even a make your own challenge map where you chose a map and select goals. You'll also get to select your character from Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing. Since this is Game of the Year Edition, you'll have plenty of costumes to chose from.\n\nThe Game of the Year Edition comes with the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC that has you playing as Robin and Batman in an extra hour or two mission. It has a good quick story and quality voice acting, but it won't expand that much. Robin plays mostly like Batman and has the same tools as he does with a few exceptions. Its nice to have, but I couldn't imagine it being worth the purchase price outside of getting it free in the Game of the Year Edition.\n\nTo top that off, there is a lot of extra content for players and Batman fans. Profiles on every character with detailed information. Challenge rooms to unlock and play through for high scores. This is an amazing game that feels and looks completely different than anything else out there. It is really enjoyable as a game, not just as a Batman fan.\n\nThere is a ton of content in Arkham City. Well worth $20, unless you can find it on sale or in a bundle like I did. I just feel bad for any game that has to follow this up. Not only another game in the franchise, but I feel bad for competing games. This game makes great use of the Batman mythos while new superhero IPs like Infamous just don't have the fleshed out characters to draw from. This is an amazing win and a crushing defeat to any other super hero game.","May 14, 2014","true","23.0"," 173 of 183 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","173","183","0","3"

Although 99% of people who will read this review will probably already have City, it will just be a case of trying to persuade you to finally dust it off and complete it.\n\nI have poured thirty two hours roaming around Arkham, it's a stunning looking game, even for current standards. The Arkham style combat system is at its best again, similar to Asylum, you can pretty much master the system when you can work out how to time your attacks perfectly, but you can add in plenty of combos to keep things interesting.\n\nThe main story is only one of the features here, I thoroughly enjoyed the main plot, with lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing right till the very end. Like most open world games, there is plenty to do apart from the main story though, tons of side missions, collectables and challenges that will keep this wonderful game going.\n\nIf you have the Game of the Year edition, you'll also have all of the DLC too, while some of it is useless in my opinion (the  challenges) the story side of it is well worth playing through as well.\n\nBasically, if you don't have Arkham City...well, where have you been for the past few years since it almost always goes on sale for at least 75% off, and if you are part of the majority who have it, I highly recommend you put aside a few days of your busy life and play this amazing master piece.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Sure it's a little wonky and uneven to start with but on a whole the game succeeds admirably if you don't get bogged down with the all the busywork dotted around the map and focus on the main storyline and investigation sidequests.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=475759082\nWhere Batman: Arkham City suffers the most is that in expanding its horizons by giving Batman a bigger playground to roam - Gotham City - the cost is that while the city is often drop dead gorgeous to look at it is all rather dull to explore. Exploring Gotham City in Batman: Arkham City is a very static experience and bar a few scripted events here and there feels very much like a ghost town and not the crime riddled metropolis depicted in both the comic book and film series. While the transition from the linear experience of the first game into the more open-ended playground of the sequel might not always be the smoothest of rides there is certainly no lack of ambition on Rocksteady’s part to not try and make this the best-darned-brilliant Batman game of the moment.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474110603\nIf you can look past all the silly diversions and a city devoid of any actual life and focus purely on the main story-line quest then Batman: Arkham City is just as illustrious and dare I say exhilarating as its award winning predecessor. In many ways when Batman: Arkham City narrows its focus it becomes all the better for it often surpassing the brilliance of the original. However, with that being said not all side quests on offer throughout the game are frivolous time wasters and some do actually offer a peek into a city on the brink of collapse thanks to corruption and crime. It's just a pity that some of these quests don't really work at fostering the momentum that Batman has finally arrived in Gotham City to do what he does best.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473870569\nOnce again a litany of super-villains throw themselves at Batman with much aplomb but this time round they feel more fleshed out as each are given more space to breath. They feel better characterized this time around as each villain is given his/her own piece of the center stage (a stage that was dominated by the Joker in Batman: Arkham Asylum) as the adventure unfolds. Combat remains largely unchanged although new special combo moves and gadgets are introduced this time to help keep things fresh. Also combat has been nicely overhauled in the sense that when fighting hordes of enemies it becomes easier than in the first game to actually use some of those awesome gadgets at your disposal to help turn the tide of the battle. Both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil return to reprise their roles as Batman and Joker and once again Mark Hamil steals the show. There is a certain kind of manic energy on display yet again that makes Hamils performance an utter delight to watch.\n\nAt the end of the day I can't say I am personally won over by the open world approach that Batman: Arkham City adopts but I certainly don't see it as a failure. There is a lot to enjoy here and when the game hits its stride it really shines in ways I never thought imaginable, given the pedigree of the first game. I like to see it as Rocksteady taking that first flight out into an uncharted airspace that they hopefully refine into a diamond with Batman Arkham Knight (once all the PC performance issues have been dealt with). Ultimately Batman: Arkham City emerges as a game that is definitely worthy of your attention and worth at least one complete playthrough.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 6, 2015","true","24.7"," 175 of 202 people (87%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","87","175","202","15","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/200260/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:Batman: Arkham City is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum by Rocksteady Studios.  It is an 'Open World Action-Adventure game that incorporates one of the best blends of action and stealth mechanic on any game on its genre to date. It was first released on the consoles and made it's way to the PC. It included the Catwoman DLC which lets the player use Catwoman who has her own special move set and gamestyle.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The game follows the adventures of Batman approximately one year after the events of Arkham Asylum. A large portion of Gotham City has been walled off and turned into a maximum security prison called Arkham City which is placed under the supervision of Dr. Hugo Strange. Bruce Wayne starts a campaign to shut down the prison but was subsequently arrested by orders of Dr. Strange and thrown into Arkham City. There, he is greeted by a massive gang war between some of the deadliest super villains Batman has ever faced. Survive within the walls of Arkham City as the Batman, discover the prison's true purpose and learn something called 'Protocol 10'.\n\nPROS:+ Open World Map: As opposed to Arkham Asylum which was semi-open.\n+ Improved Graphical Fidelity: Animation is more fluid and has excellent use of PhysX technology\n+ Immersive Atmosphere\n+ Sound: To be specific, this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever seen. (with Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy and Tara Strong, what did you expect?)\n+ Replayablitiy and end game content: Side missions, New Game Plus, Challanges and more will keep you occupied\n+ Easter Eggs with History and Lore of the Batman Universe\n+ Humor: The inmates provide some very humorous conversations which makes for a refreshing feel to the otherwise dark and serious tone of the game.\n+ Character diversity: Granted you can only play Batman and Catwoman in the main story, Nightwing and Robin can also be played during the challenge missions. They come with their own skills, gadgets and play styles.\n\nCONS:- Main Campaign is too short if you skip all the side content.\n- PhysX, although a great addition, only benefits Nvidia users, and AMD users might need to put a little more effort in order to benefit from its features.\n- Games for Windows Live shutdown caused some users to loose their save files when the game was transferred to Steam. (If your just buying this game, don't worry about this CON)\n- Too little screen time for the main villains\n- Some frustrating Riddler / Augmented Reality Training Challanges\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME! A worthy successor to Arkham Asylum. The game expanded the world in which the player can explore, provided a great atmosphere and setting with a visually stunning presentation and impressive blend of stealth and action makes this game a MUST BUY for Batman and action-adventure fans.\n\nWORTH IT?:FULL PRICE or a SALE, this game is worth every cent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Arkham City is a big section of Gotham City which has been turned into a large-scale prison for its criminals, all constructed by Hugo Strange. Very early in the game Bruce Wayne is campaigning to demolish the institution when he himself is incarcerated under Strange's orders.\nWhile Strange prepares to commence "Protocol 10", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred, allowing him to become Batman. Now it is up to him to find out what Protocol 10 is. Along the way he fights several famous villains, among them Joker, Riddler, Penguin and Two-Face.\nThe story is pretty well done. Many recognizable characters on both sides of the Batman mythos are along for the ride.\nBatman: Arkham City plays and controls much like Arkham Asylum. But one thing you will notice is that the game takes place in an open city, rather than in a single area. Arkham Asylum was by no means a small game, but in Arkham City the player is able to get the full Batman experience by gliding around the city in a much larger scale.\nThe combat system is pretty much the same as in previous game. You punch, counter, and use gadgets and finishing moves to subdue large amounts of enemies.\nBesides of the main story and side quests you also have a lot of other stuff to do like solving Riddler secrets, Catwoman Missions, challenge maps and more. This game will last you a long time if you are trying to go for 100% completion.\nThe graphics are stunning and all the characters look really good. Faces and facial expressions are brilliantly made.\nThe soundtrack is literally Hollywood movie quality. The voice acting is incredible and everything else sounds great as well.\nBatman: Arkham City is a great experience for anyone who likes Batman or who wants to discover his universe. It is definitely worth to buy and to play.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","October 31, 2014","true","70.3"," 111 of 120 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","111","120","6","0"

Of course, Arkham Asylum's silly idea of RPG elements are still around, and shouldn't be, but the developer needed to shoehorn in a reason to collect things - other than just it being an entertaining set of puzzles.\n\nUnfortunately it does have a problem with game design, Batman does not fight armies of men in hand to hand combat...  He fights small groups from time to time, but it is quite rare to see Batman taking on 50 men.  Yet in this game, it happens on several occasions, as though the developers wanted you to feel super badass for doing this amazing thing that Batman would think is incredibly stupid and a waste of his time.  Batman does not take down armies, he would use a clever gadget to take down most of them, and then mop up the rest.\n\nThe game is fun, the story is a bit contrived, but that is kind of standard for Batman stories.\n\nI could easily recommend this game to players.","November 25, 2013","true","72.9"," 146 of 174 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","146","174","0","3"

A task that first sounded too great even after everything the developer has given us in the first game. Fear not, they upped the ante.\n\nOur favorite detective is forced to Arkham City occupied by thugs, gangsters, super-villains and Dr. Strange's guards. Initially we only know that he is after Strange who is preparing an experiment, which he calls "Protocol 10". The main plot of the game isn't the strongest we have ever experienced, but diverse enough to keep our heads spinning in every half hour or so. Even if Strange isn't the typical main villain you'd expect from a game like this, the others keep the show running. Boy, and how well. Joker, Two-Face, Penguin are only the most famous ones to recognize. Even the minor villains give splendid performances that will make you feel you're in an action packed DC comic book. Only this time around you're the one who beats up the bad guys. The ending of the game will keep you scratching your head and maybe this time - and this time only - Rocksteady took on more that they could bear...\n\nThe game has excellent graphical representation pushing the unreal engine to it's limits. The older engine sometimes shows it's limits with slowly loading textures and load screens in open areas. However, from artistic perspective it's breathtaking. You can read stories about the city or it's unwanted "residents", listen to crazy interviews taped by Strange with the greatest villains that will uncover some of their background stories and let us see what has happened before the place was opened. It's exactly this where the game comes to full circle, not just being a super enjoyable action-superhero game, but a true part of the Batman legacy. The music and voice acting are top notch. Listening to an well composed orchestral piece before hearing Mark Hamill's voice behind The Joker is true joy and no fan could ask for more in that respect.\n\nThe freeflow combat introduced in Arkham Asylum returns with an array of gadgets that can be deployed in combat. The combat is so well balanced that it will be easy for everybody to pick up, but very difficult to master as Batman has plenty of moves in his pocket. You can choose to hit or counter each enemy when you are attacked, but there will always be a second, third or eighth move to pull. It's a mechanic that will never get boring even after the 428th enemy. Of course the game will challenge you eventually with more powerful enemies that can't be put down with repeated hitting of one button.\n\nAfter you are done with the main campaign, which takes about 10 hour to complete, there's literally a dozen thing to do in Arkham City. For one you can explore the story based side quests which are not only cleverly integrated in the game's main story but they are also highly addictive. Of course Riddler made his mark in this game too, so you can try to collect his collectibles of which there is more than 300. If you have done everything in Arkham City (takes around 20-30 hours) there is a game mode called Riddler's revenge which is essentially a task-based-clean-the-room mini-game. You are rewarded with medals based on your successes, but cleaning every room and hitting high score everywhere will take you at least that much as the main game. That adds up around 50+ hours of gameplay for 100% completion. Really the only thing worth of complain here is that when you do everything and I mean everything in Arkham City there isn't anything else to load your save game again. The streets are empty except for some thug groups always spawned in the same spots. Arkham City feels empty; a thing that can be noticed even in the heat of the first walkthrough.\n\nRating: 94/100; Replay Value: 4/5; To Beat: 8-10 hours (main campaign), 22-25 hours (campaign with collectibles); Played on: normal.","November 5, 2013","true","27.7"," 87 of 96 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","87","96","0","0"

I've played this game more than 200 hours (goty and non-goty combined) and I can see myself playing it again and again in the future. It is my favorite game of all times and I'll try to tell you why it is.\n\nLet's start with the story. From the beginning to the end, it never slows down. Specially the ending is among the best I've ever seen. Though you can easily lose track of what you're doing because the game does everything in its power to distract you. There are so many things you can do apart from the story. Collecting trophies, solving riddles, beating up inmates, side missions. There are also challange maps. These are seperate from main game and they are fun as hell. In fact they're so good, I spent more time in them than the game itself.\n\nGameplay is expertly done. There are many different gameplay elements and none of them is less awesome than the others. Fighting is amazing. It is easy to learn but hard to master. You press one button to attack and one button to counter but the more you play the game the more you understand how strategic the combat is. Game throws all kinds of enemies at you and all of them require a different tactic to beat. Inmates with shields can only be attacked from above, ones who are carrying shock sticks can only be attacked from behind, armored inmates need to be stunned before they can be hit and so forth.\n\nAnother big portion of the gameplay is predator encounters. These are so much fun. There are so many different ways you can takedown your enemies, you won't even notice you can do some of them. After you take out everyone but one, the real fun starts. The last guy just starts freaking out, shooting at his own shadow and so on. You truly feel like a predator in these moments, a non-lethal predator :)\n\nVisually, the game is stunning. It looks fantastic. In my opinion, this game has the best looking Batman ever. His appearance and animations are amazing. Even in combat you rarely see animations glitching. Soundtracks are just as good. They're truly epic and they make you feel like you're Batman! Voice acting is among the best. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill steal the show as Batman and Joker.\n\nI can write about this game all day but since I keep jumping from one point to another, I'll stop here. Give this game a chance if you haven't already and see for yourself what it feels like to be Batman!","February 12, 2014","true","169.5"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","66","72","0","5"

You don't have to like Batman to love this game. Basically the point is: BUY IT!\n\nNow here for the full review\n\nStory\nI won't go into the story much as I don't want to spoil it but what I can tell you is that its almost perfect. Way better than its predecessor and possibly the best in the series. The main premisis of it all is that you are taken into Arkham City, a prison filled with batman's famous villians such as the Joker, Two-Face and the Penguin. Since this is the goty version, you'll switch between Batman and Catwomen throughout various bits of the game. While some argue that there is the occasional plot hole, to me, its perfect.\n10/10.\n\nCharacters\nAs mentioned before, Batman Arkham City has many of Batmans famous villians, but also people like Alfred and Robin. Batman is still Batman, (Duh!) being a badass and pretty much wiping the floor off everyone. The game also takes a unique road to fully understanding the villians. Different parts of the game focus on the particular villian but never makes it get old. Only negative point worth mentioning is, for god sake Catwoman zip up that jacket!\n9/10.\n\nGameplay\nIn my opinion its just as good as Arkham Asylum. Beat up one guy to another but with added moves that you can unlock as you level up. Grappling from building to building makes you feel like Batman! Or it did to me anyway. Gliding around the place is also fun. One of Batman's villians, The Riddler, has added trophies and riddles for you to find and solve. Plus with the gadgets such as batarangs and freeze grenades to add a twist when fighting, all of which can be upgraded when you level up. So really the gameplay is a lot like Asylum's but slightly better.\n8/10\n\nAccessebility\nFor me it wasn't that hard to grasp into the game. The gameplay mechanics are simple enough and since the game pretty much helps you when fighting by locking on one person to another it isn't really that difficult to get to know it. You can always make it a bit more challenging by increasing the difficulty but even then you get used to that pretty much easily.\n10/10.\n\nSoundtrack\nMy favourite thing in this game is the soundtrack. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Classic Batman music as I call it. Some tracks are intense and get you ready for combat, some are calm and tranquil, all fitting the right locations. Nothing more to say really. Just beautiful music.\n10/10.\n\nPros - Excellent Story\n- Interesting Characters\n- Superb Soundtrack\n- Never Rushed\n- Amazing (  but sad  ) Ending\n- Sometimes hilarious knock out animations. XD\n- High Replayability Value\n\nCons - Camera Positioning can be awkward sometimes.\n- Sometimes you can be in a posistion where you have no idea what to do but look it up on the internet.\n\nPersonnal Recommendation\nI'd say, if you haven't already, buy this game! Doesn't matter if its on sale or not, buy it! You don't have to like Batman to love this game! One of my favourite games of all time. 10/10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V1ZF5cNYCs\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/200260/\n\nSo, what did you think of my first proper review?

The cutscenes have also improved by a great margin as well. The character's faces, even Harley Quinn's, exceptionally worked very well and they had me engaged throughout the whole experience. What I really liked was as your character goes through the story your suits that you wear show tears and scrapes on the surface and capes of your character. The characters are a strong point in this game and it really helped the story at every vantage point.\n\nStory: The story was solid; I absolutely loved the story mode they set up in this universe. It was full of exciting moments where the game made you feel on edge at certain points where you felt like you had to rush things but you really did not. Without giving anything away let's ust say that the story has a couple of twists and the several collectibles that you find throughout the large map in the game make the story rather intriguing and mesmerizing. And without giving anything away to the story, let's just say that the ending of the game hit me really hard, emotionally in fact. It was more of an impact than the previous game, let alone any Batman game that I played. Overall, the story is what sold this game and I highly recommend it for everyone.\n\nGameplay: Good f***king GOD there is a lot to talk about in this game: You get to play as two characters as opposed to just one character; Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman may take some time getting used to, but it is fun to crawl around on ceilings and using that whip, and for whatever reason they decided to add a "timing" element for Catwoman when jumping on walls, and for some reason that confused me. There are now twice as many Riddler trophies to get around the environment once Catwoman becomes a characters to play as. The combat has improved dramatically; there are lot more features and abilities than the first game. There are also several types of enemies, even ones with swords that you must dodge precisely to disarm them. Most boss battles are fun and very imaginative and exciting and memorable; soem can be frustrating but most of the time you'll find yourself amazed by how many moves bosses have during each battle. I found myself reacting and screaming to all sorts of attacks, and with humorous intentions. Completing the game to 100% will set you for a good 20+ hours depending on your playstyle.\n\n\nOverall: One of the best Batman games to ever release by Rocksteady and I highly recommend it to those who love being a detective, who love the DC universe, who love open-world games and fiding clues and solving puzzles.\n\nSeriously, buy it right now.","July 5, 2015","true","26.8"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","47","53","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/200260/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Batman: Arkham City - GOTY EditionDeveloper: Rocksteady Studios\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nBatman: Arkham City (sequel to Arkham Asylum), in some ways, improves on the formula that was set forth in Arkham Asylum. How can a perfect game get anymore perfect? Well...it can't. Some things were improved, while some things made the experience suffer a bit. Overall, Arkham City does what it's supposed to do: Puts you in the shoes of the Caped Crusader and tells a thrilling Batman tale via the video game medium. Let's go over it and see how it compares to Arkham Asylum.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nA lot of things have been added and improved in this title over Arkham Asylum. You are now free to explore Arkham City to your heart's content, adding Open-World to the iconic Batman universe (to an extent). Thugs roam the streets, easy targets for Batman to pick off and earn experience, which is still used to level up and learn new abilities. There are a lot of side-quests, each mainly tying into a specific villian from Batman's case files -- Villians such as Deadshot, the Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and Mr. Freeze...just to name a few. There is much more going on behind the scenes, though. And as the Dark Knight, it's your job to find out what's going on and who is behind it all!\n\nBatman still retains a lot of his signature gadgets, along with a few additions. Combat is more or less the same, but feels a bit more balanced and fluid. With how well the combat system was implemented in Arkham Asylum, it's hard to imagine it getting any better, but they somehow pulled it off! Chaining attacks together grants Batman access to finishing moves, and those who master the system are rewarded with bonus EXP and quicker battles in general.\n\nA new feature added in Arkham City are the crime scene puzzles, which are little more than just scanning pieces of evidence at a crime scene to piece together who or what happened, which will lead you to where you need to go. This only takes places in a small handful of segments of the game, not taking long to figure out and move on. A nice small addition, but ultimately little more than an obstacle to get through as you advance the story.\n\nThe Riddler is also present here, with a new set of trophies to collect, new riddles to solve, and new challenges to overcome. Solving/collecting them all is a great challenge, and is sure to keep you busy for quite some time if you decide to tackle them all. Instead of secret maps laying around like in Arkham Asylum, this time you are able to spot Riddle informants in a pack of thugs. Taking down all other thugs around him will allow you to interrogate him, revealing hidden Riddler secrets on your map. Make it a point to interrogate them all if you intend to face Riddler's challenge.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nArkham City does very little to improve on the graphics set down in Arkham Asylum. It more or less looks the same. That's not a bad thing, though. Arkham City looks as dark and dreary as it should, hiding all sorts of secrets in it's alleys and battered buildings. If you've played Arkham Asylum, you know what to expect here. Some smaller details, such as Batman's breath showing outside in the cold, are present and serve to add a small bit of depth to the graphical presentation of this game.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nJust as good as Arkham Asylum, the sound effects and music in Arkham City help to set the tone of everything happening in each area. Striking thugs sounds oh so satisfying, as well as the 'knock-out' sound when finishing one off. The soundtrack is just as ominous as Arkham Asylum, which definitely helps to immerse you in the game.\n\nAnother excellent thing carried over from Arkham Asylum is the use of the same voice actors! Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles as the Joker and Batman respectively. Again, the Joker is the star of the show, owing to Mark Hamill's stellar voice work and performance as the Joker.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nI was able to maintain a constant 59-60 FPS during gameplay at all times. No stuttering, no framedrops, no lag...the game ran flawlessly. I feel like they improved the performance quite a bit from Arkham Asylum, despite it being more open and having more going on on-screen due to the open-world elements that were added. Draw distance was fairly impressive, showing buildings far in the background as Batman grapples and glides about the city.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nArkham City ultimately improves upon Arkham Asylum in nearly every way imaginable, only suffering from feeling a bit empty at points despite being a large city. If more things were added around the city it would have felt a lot better. Still, Arkham City is another near perfect game that should be in every fan's library.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x67y-bWESbs\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must Play\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 26, 2015","true","29.2"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","49","57","6","3"

Like Spider-Man's web swing, and his combat blanket, and his ability to move like a jumping bean while still being built like a brick ♥♥♥♥ house. Seriously, look at him, he makes me question my hetereosexuality.  I once had a dream where he kissed me on the lips. In Paris, France. I don't think it makes me gay and neither does my therapist.\n\nBut also, this time around, you get to go through story segments as Halae Bear-e. Who has the amazing powers of making you and excellent survivalmen with your tent pitching skills. Her segments aren't that different from playing as Dead-parents man, but this time you move around with grace instead of like a tank that just drove through an orphanage. The segments end very quickly, and are few in between, but one leaves Hallee Beree restrained by poison Ivy and you're all "Woah! Damn!

Alway fun to see how high of combo score you can get.  The Story in Arkham City was so much better then Asylum.

Proving that more of a good thing can make that thing great.  The amazing fight system which was implemented in the first game is back, with enough Subtle improvements to make the worlds greatest detective grin.\n\nThe story line again reads like something ripped from a comic book and brought to life for me and my fellow gamers to enjoy.  Doctor Hugo Strange who mysteriously vanished years before after finding out Batman's real identity is back, and he's running Arkham City, a high tech prison designed to replace Black Gate prison as the home to Gotham's most dangerous and insane inmates.  Strange has plans to enact something known as protocol 10, and as a start to his plan he captures Bruce Wayne and warns him against trying to stop his plan.\n\nObviously Batman will not, and can not allow this dastardly to succeed, after a thrilling escape from Custody and a run in with Penguin you're off and running on a wonderful comic adventure to stop protocol 10, stop Hugo Strange from revealing your true identity and hopefully figure out the mystery of what ties all these events together.\n\nI'd recommend this game to people who love super hero games that don't suck, people who love beat em up's and people who love being the greatest Dectective of all time in one of the greatest super hero video games ever made.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/200260/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","I don't like Batman.  I'm not a 9-year-old boy, and never was I, and I naively thought this would be the only target audience of such a game (because when I was a kid, it was mainly boys who seemed to read the Batman comics).  As a result, Batman and I never really crossed paths other than the odd TV show when I was a wee thing in the Ice Age era.  I also don't like combat games.  All those buttons for punching and kicking and all that nonsense.  Pffft!\n\nBut back to Batman.  There was some article in my fave magazine looking back at this game and talking about stealth-play (which I love) and a fantastic open-world city.  They recommended it hugely and the screenshots LOOKED incredible!  But it was still Batman ... so I figured I'd wait for a cheapy deal just to see what it was like anyway.  Checking that no-one else in the house was looking at my screen (I mean - Batman for chrissakes...) I loaded up the game - and my badly formed preconceptions were thrown in my face!  Now the entire household knows I'm raving about a Batman game....\n\nSo what makes this game so great?\nFirstly, the game offers complete freedom of play (you can stealth much of the game or fight your way through).  Secondly, the controls are amazingly easy for a game with so many moves - very intuitive for those not blessed with controller dexterity (me included).  Thirdly, Arkham City is a HUGE open-world dark city of seeming unlimited places to explore, and finally, like Batman or not, the colourful personalities of all the caricatures you'll meet in a Batman game are fun, crazy and brilliantly done.  I found myself replaying the starting chapter twice over just to see Penguin again!\n\nThere is nothing better than swooping down on an unsuspecting enemy from skyscraper heights (in-game tutorials help you with special moves in flight).  Control and precision are absolutely perfect.  Stealth is a joy to play (and encouraged in some missions).  The combat is easy too - taught gradually with on-screen prompts for buttons to press and when to make a high-scoring move.  Best of all, this GOTY edition features Catwoman with some extra missions - and her playstyle is entirely different but equally engaging.\n\nThe dark city has depth and atmosphere, and feels like the crime-ridden snake's pit that it is.  It's all brilliantly detailed.  There are collectibles too, though some are pretty tough to beat.  They offer a good challenge so they aren't mundane busiwork unlike some franchises (Assassin's Creed to name one example).  There is a great upgrade system too - though a word of warning: your upgrade points are for Batman AND Catwoman separately.  By the time I reached the end of the main Batman game, I had a Batman armed to the teeth, but a neglected Catwoman who had little more than black leotard and tights(!) - so remember to share the points around a bit.\n\nIn summary...A great story-led plot, fabulous characters and really polished gameplay puts this game at the top of my best-games-ever tree.  I really recommend it, even if you too find yourself grimacing and NOT ever having been a 9-year-old boy!  Don't make the mistake I did and look past this game if you enjoy open-world games where you choose how to play.","October 4, 2014","true","50.2"," 46 of 66 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","46","66","2","3"

It immereses you with its shady and illusive atmosphere in combination with great characters from the DC universe.\n\nArkham City is set in the aftermath of the events which occured in Arkham Asylum. Events that caused everyone to question the safety of Gotham in the eyes of criminal society. The game begins with Bruce Wayne  being captured by Hugo Strange and sent to his facility, the super prison of Gotham, of which he has full control over and plans to initiate a secret plan called "Protocol 10". Batman (Bruce Wayne) seeks to find out what Protocol 10 is whilst bumping into familiar faces from the DC universe.\n\nThe main story line is solid, coupled with great side-missions that will keep you occupied. The fighting style is transfered from Arkham Asylum and improved upon whilst the open world is even bigger which promises a lot more content and playability. The characters are beyond amazing, they are sinister, funny, sarcastic and interesting. If you're a fan of the Joker, Penguin and Ra's al Ghul then you won't be dissapointed.\n\nThis game is an overall improvement of the series; If you've already played the first one and thinking about getting this one, I urge you to hurry up and pick up this amazing open-world fighting game; You won't be dissapointed.","November 20, 2015","true","17.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","20","24","5","6"

In spite of that game offers many new things, like open map. One of the best things you could do was playing as catwoman or robin and use much more weapons and gadgets. There is an option of some side quests which I consider as much more attracting than main story. You will meet many super villains lie mr. Freeze, Riddler in person, Hatter and many others. Riddle becomes indeed very great threat and you will need find and solve his riddles, which are much more difficult than in Arkham Asylum, to rescue his hostages. You have an option to play Zsaz's little booth game, save Nora Fries or meet mysterious watcher who keeps watching batman, there are many possibilities what to do after main line is done.

Arkham City is such a big improvement over Batman: Arkham Asylum. If you played that one then you can expect all that in this one plus a few major things. This time the game is open world, if you wish to  call it that way, what I mean is that you can move as you please through Arkham City and eventually you'll hear inmates conversations or come across a secondary quest or "random" event. Every now and then once I'd pick one of the inmates conversations I'd just get to a safe spot and listen them talk, it might look like ordinary talk but I found that it sometimes contain some story elements and some funny stuff, I really like that they included some neat dialogue this way. Combat wise the game excells just like the previous one, it's satisfying and it feels great, they've added abunch of new gear and new perks to unlock as you "level up" which can turn the tide of the battle every now and then. The story is as good as the first one and it takes place after the events of Arkham Asylum as you uncover a "conspiracy", per say. I also wouldn't be lying if I said that this series has probably one of the best character designs I ever witnessed in a video game so if you're into that and really care about each individual character you'll certainly love this one. One thing I actually don't really like and couldn't care less are the riddles, I just don't find it appealing to go around the city looking for all the puzzles and solving, still,    I'm sure that some people are really into that. The last two things I'd like to say about Batman: Arkham City is that the soundtrack is bloody amazing, I love that as soon as you start a fight another track pops in to make it feel more intense, kinda. Last thing is the graphics, they're bloody gorgeous. Besides that I don't think I have anything else to say about Arkham City, if you loved Arkham Asylum you'll love this one and if you didn't enjoyed Arkham Asylum you might still wanna give this one a try because it's so much better in every possible way.

What the game did improve on is its boss fights, narrative, much more content, and improved environments for better combat planning. What it failed to do is, repetitivity, combat is too simple and the villains feel like plot devices and barely makes any appearances. This does not make the game bad, it just makes it hard to compare to Arkham Asylum. This Batman is now open world, there is side-missions, much more challenges, improved upgrade system, more gadgets, and get to play as Catwoman. The game should only take 8-10 hours  if you ignore side-missions.

Well, Arkham City is the same, BUT BETTER OMG!1!!11\n\n\nPaul Dini is not alone now due to the colaboration with Sefton Hill (Rocksteady Founder) and Paul Crocker (one of the biggest comic Freaks that i´ve ever seen IRL), and this means that MY BODY IS READY.\nThe main storyline, the sidequest, the environments, characters, npcs, even the simple details of the scenery are so good that its annoying, you have a lot of information to assimilate. For instance, during a boss fight, the stage has it´s own references for him, the weapons, the mechanics, dialogues, everything...thats amazing nowadays, because there are a few studios that want to make GOOD GAMES instead of Moneymakers.  And it doesn´t dissapoint in the dubbing neither. Kevin Conroy will give his voice to Batman again, same as Mark Hamill with Joker, Arleen was replaced by Tara Strong a good change IMO, Nolan North as Penguin and the Kid Lover Solomon Grundy voiced by Tatasciore.\n\n\n\nLets move to the storyline. Bruce Wayne is incarcerated in Arkham City, a new massive prison located over the slums of Gotham City, founding out that there is a protocol named "Protocol 10" directed by Hugo Strange. And obviously you, AS BATMAN, must uncover what it is. During the main plot you´ll face different villains that are now settled in Arkham City.\n\n\nAs i said above, the systems and patterns used with Arkham Asylum are here in City, but improved.\nFor instance, the freeflow combat has been improved now you are able to counter more than one enemy simultaneously, create bigger combos, use aerial attacks or catch hurled items from the scenery. Also you can use almost every gadget during the combat in order to disable armored foes or set traps around you. The "Detective Vision" has been nerfed, which is a good new, now the visual effect obscure the game and doesnt highlight everything all the time.\nBesides, now with a bigger city the predator-hunter perspective takes a great advantage, now you can choose where, how and who. Let me explain this with a normal encounter, enemies are around a central square, armed-to-the-teeth so:\n\n-With the design of the city you can choose WHERE are you going to be, a rooftop, a beam, behind any object, etc...you can be literally everywhere.\n-The amount of gadgets that you are able to use during fights has increased, choose how are you going to achieve your goal.\n-The enemies now have different behaviours so be mindful of your target, choose wisely who should be knocked down/disarmed first.\n\n\nMoreover the IA is now somehow better. Enemies now are armed with a wide variety of weapons and armored with different levels of armors. Some should be disarmed in order to neutralize them, others should be stunned, etc... their patterns of actuation were enhanced too. They made squads if they feel danger or if some of them are nervous, pick up weapons from boxes, hurl items to the character, get weapons from the ground asap, etc...\n\nThe skills have been mended too. Each category contains up to 15 unique upgrades according to your own combat preferences. Less percents and more useful skills to use during the fights. The worst part is that a lot of predator or hunter skills are already unlocked, but thats just my opinion.\n\nFurthermore the movements for Batman were expanded, in fact they add new movement and though about new ones, but the dev. team only took the ones who felt authentic with Batman.\n\nFinally Arkham City offers the same end-game content, trophies, riddles, combat challenges, etc... but all these aspects have been enhanced.\n\n\nIf you dont have this game yet, buy it, cheap, funny and full of content.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nRecordáis...Arkham Asylum? Bueno, Arkham City es lo mismo, PERO MEJOR OMG!1!!!1!!1!\n\n\nPaul Dini ya no está solo, debido a la colaboración con Sefton Hill (fundador de Rocksteady) y Paul Crocker (uno de los mayores fridigo expertos en cómics que he visto IRL) por lo que significa...que va a ser la OSTIA.\n\n\nLa trama, las secundarias, los entornos, npcs, personajes, incluso los simples detalles de la escenografía son tan buenos que es molesto. Tienes toneladas de información que han dejado los guionistas en estos lugares para que la asimiles. Por ejemplo durante una pelea con un boos, la fase tienen diferentes referencias hacia él, desde las armas hasta el propio fondo de la pelea, sus mecánicas, diálogos, etc... es un gran trabajo, y es lo que diferencia a un buen juego. Ni siquiera decepciona en el doblaje, y eso que el primero era DIFÍCIL de superar. Kevin Conroy va a volver a ponerle voz a nuestro Batman, al igual que Mark Hamill con Joker. Arleen fue reemplazada por Tara Strong, un buen cambio de voz en mi opinión, Nolan North será el Pingüino y el Amante de los Niños Solomon Grundy tomará su voz de Fred Tatasciore.\n\nLa historia principal es simple, como la primera entrega. Bruce es encarcelado en Arkham City, una nueva prisión masiva que fue establecida sobre los arrabales de Gotham, encontrando que hay un protocolo en marcha (llamado Protocol 10) y dirigido por Hugo Strange. Y obviamente, tú, COMO BATMAN, vas a ir a descubrir de que va la cosa. Durante la trama principal te encontrarás diferentes villanos que se encuentran en Arkham city.\n\nComo dije algo más arriba, los sistemas usados  y los patrones siguen presentes en City pero han sido mejorados para ofrecer una mejor experiencia jugable.\n\nPor ejemplo, el Freeflow ha sido retocado permitiendo contraatacar a más de un enemigo de forma simultánea, crear mayores combos, usar ataques aéreos o tomar objetos lanzados del escenario. Además la cantidad de utensilios que puedes usar ha aumentado significativamente, ampliando las posibilidades de combate. La visión de detective ha sido nerfeada, y esto es una buena implementación, ya que en el primer Batman esta herramienta tan básica hacía superar el juego en cero coma. Además, al tener una mayor ciudad y mejoras en los sistemas de combate y aparatos se puede decir que, donde y como quieres combatir. Una situación simple, enemigos armados hasta los dientes en una plaza:\n\n-Con este nuevo diseño puedes elegir DONDE estarás, techos, vigas, gárgolas, etc... literalmente puedes posicionarte donde y como quieras.\n-La cantidad de utensilios a utilizar ha aumentado, lo que te permite elaborar más tácticas para afrontar un desafío.\n-Los enemigos ahora tienen diferentes comportamientos, así que se consciente de tu objetivo, a quien vas a desarmar/knockear y por que.\n\n\nPara más inri la IA ha sido corregida. Los enemigos están mejor armados, si no lo están recurrirán al escenario para enmendarlo, además de contar con una amplia gama de armas y armaduras. Sus patrones de actuación se han visto mejorados también. Harán cuadrillas si se sienten amenazados o si están nerviosos y no quieren ir solos.\n\nLas habilidades están mejor desarrolladas. Cada categoría tiene hasta 15 habilidades únicas dependiendo de tu preferencias en el combate. Menos porcentajes y más habilidades para usar. Aunque por criticar algo diría que las depredador y cazador vienen en su mayoría desbloqueadas.\n\nLo que es más, los movimientos de Batman han aumentado y se han corregido así que no más Ortopedias Wayne. Añadieron más movimientos y mejoraron los antiguos, haciendo que quedasen naturales y fidedignos a Batman.\n\nComo colofón, Arkham City tiene un mayor contenido tras el juego que su anterior entrega además de mayores retos de combates y una historia acorde a Riddler.\n\nSi aún no tenéis este juego, compradlo, barato y divertido.","October 9, 2014","true","37.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Taking place in a walled off section of Gotham called "Arkham City", Batman must defeat several iconic villains and solve a crisis yadda yadda yadda it's the same premise as the previous game.\n\nSomething Arkham City does that really is different than Asylum was it features alternate playable characters. You can play as Catwoman during the main campaign, and Robin/Nightwing during the challenge maps. The alternate side content in Arkham City is really what makes the game stand out to me compared to Asylum. There's a lot of side missions, owing to the titular city the player gets to explore. Because of this the game is much less linear than Asylum was. The world of Arkham City is just breathtaking to behold and graphically it is an extremely impressive game.\n\nHowever where the game really falls flat for me is in the storytelling, characters and general pacing of the game. The returning voice actors all come across as much more disinterested this time around, especially Kevin Conroy. The storyline itself in-part rehashes the premise of Asylum and I felt wasn't that interesting. And the mission pacing was very weak, often I remembered getting stuck in numerous places because of how vague your objectives were at times.\n\nWhere Arkham City excels is in it's presentation, but it's a much less polished game than Asylum. I would say it is a game worth experiencing and I'd still recommend playing it. But ultimately I spent a lot more time in the challenge maps and doing sidequests and less time trying to actually complete the game.","June 16, 2015","true","18.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","3"

Short version is below the long one!!!Long version:\nArkham series is one of mine most favorite video games series I've played. Back in 2009 I got addicted to Arkham Asylum and 6 years later I'm still in love with the series. So let's begin.\n\nIntroduction:\nBatman: Arkham City is a 2011 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on October 18, 2011, with a Microsoft Windows version following on November 22.\n\nPlot\nThe events of Arkham City are set one year after Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's erstwhile director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed in the care of psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.\nAt a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence "Protocol 10", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.\nThere, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease.Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. Will Batman cure himself? Will he find out what is Protocol 10? Play this game to find out more!\n\nGameplay\nBatman: Arkham City is an open-world action-adventure game that incorporates tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries.The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downward and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use "Detective Vision", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.\nUsing an improved version of the Freeflow combat system from Arkham Asylum, the player can now counter multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes.\nAs you noticed - the combat system is big improvement compared to the Arkham Asylum's one (Which, don't get me wrong, was insanely good too!).\n\nVerdict: This game is insanely fun and the plot is filled with action and intense moments, which keeps you interested. 10/10 hands down.\n\nShort version: This is a sequel to Arkham Asylum, in which we fight Joker and Hugo Strange at the same time. The plot is mind-blowing and the characters are unique and all of this is support by an insane combat system, that is so pleasing to use, that you will fall in love with it. Must buy for every comic fan / fan of Batman, those who liked Asylum this game is gonna be like a dream - nothing more, rather than an overall improvement. 10/10.\nEDIT: Since the game is often on sale - grab it, because it's worth your money :D","July 3, 2015","true","34.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

It trades the tightly designed Metroidvania environments of the first game for a more open world and while that's certainly impressive it also manages to lose a bit of direction and focus. And because you're free to go anywhere you'd like you'll have to use your compass more than ever if you want fo find your way through the many streets and buildings. You have to move across the city both vertically and horizontally and it's not always clear where you have to go exactly. I frequently lost my way.\n\nAnd I understand the city is designed to make it more immersive, to make you feel more like Batman, instead of being caged on an island like the previous game. But if you do this then you better do it well. The city feels empty and there are hardly any civilians to be found out there. Yes, there are gangs and yes, it's night time but, come on, surely there must be people out there. The game also throws too many things at you too soon, so I became overwhelmed in my first couple of hours of playing it. After a while you'll know what to do and what not, but I can imagine that casual gamers might not enjoy that that much.\n\nDidn't I enjoy Arkham City you'll probably wonder. Well, I did, but as I said it lacks certain direction and it throws too many things at you without the right amount of build up and explanation. But once you know exactly what to do it's a great game. There's plenty to do and finding every clue and collectible will take you tens of hours.\n\nThe fight with Mr. Freeze is also one of the best boss fights I've ever witnessed and played. Clever and unique. Well done !\n\nArkham City is still one of the best Batman games around, but if I had to make a selection Arkham Asylum would be my first choice.\n\n[Rating: 90/100]","April 24, 2014","true","12.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

With the violence of Gotham’s “Supervillains” more uncontrollable than ever, the new head of Arkham Azylum, Dr. Hugo Strange, has an entire section of Old Gotham closed off to lock criminals away and have them keep their violence to themselves. Hugo Strange confronts Bruce Wayne about being Batman, threatening to expose his secret if he digs too deep into the true goals behind Arkham City.\n\nPros: The already solid mechanics of Batman: Arkham Azylum are enhanced, allowing better control over gliding and using momentum to take off or maintain flight over a longer distance. Combat Mechanics also remain the same, although additional combo and special moves are available, as well as a greater arsenal of WayneTech gadgets or other tools you get or collect through the game. There is a much broader cast of characters, including a few returning ones from the previous game, some serving as fan service, others having a larger implications as sort of side quests. The Catwoman DLC happens in parallel to the main story, giving a greater diversity to the gameplay, while the Harley Quinn’s Revenge featuring Tim Drake’s Robin is a nice followup to how Batman is affected by the event of the game. There are many achievements and collector’s items to have those interested look into every nook and corner, while additional difficulty levels are available to encourage replaying through the game. Graphics are the best they’ve been prior to Batman: Arkham Knight.\n\nCons: The combat can become a repetitive button mashing fest unless you really bother to explore the various attack/item combos. The map, although bigger than its predecessor's, is still a restrictive sandbox by today’s standards (perhaps as big as, say, the smallest city from the first Assassin’s Creed game). There is no day cycle: Although all the events are happening on the same night, there really isn’t any urgency and you can spend dozens of hours exploring every corner of the map.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nThe game is fun, Batman feels like a badass, the Arkham continuity remains the perfect adaptation halfway between the visions of Christopher Nolan movies, The Animated Series and the comic books. Unless Batman isn’t your thing at all, in which case you wouldn’t consider this game to begin with, there really isn’t any reason not to get Batman: Arkham City – Game of the Year Edition.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 25, 2014","true","148.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Rocksteady really delivered all that they could with this game and it's certainly a step up from their last game Batman: Arkham Asylum. The controls are amazingly comfortable and it this Arkham City makes me oftenly think about Just Cause 2 in a way. The voice acting is phenominal, especially Mark Hamill as The Joker and Kevin Conroy as Batman. Every time I read the Batman comics those are exact voices I wanna hear from these characters and that is what this game does so perfectly. The open world plays in North Gothem and it's closed off from the rest of the city.\n\nThe open world aspect to this game is also very nice and detailed. The combat feels and looks amazing and I believe that their are hundreds of different fighting animations and it doesn't make it all looks too repetetive. Another thing that makes this game more creative are the gadgets. You need think of how to open or do certain things with these gadgets. If you're a mega fan of Batman, you might enjoy this game a tiny bit more than if you didn't. Fan or not, buy this game, you'll have a blast. It's sort of hard to point out the negatives but one of them is some of the random texture popins but it doesn't really bother me. I think one of the things is that you can spam press the counter attack button and Batman will fight for you.

There are still some questionable optimisation issues, owners of newer configurations won't notice them, but still it drags a bit on max DX11 settings on machines on which it shouldn't. Also, in challenge modes, sometimes it happens that your character grabs some invisible wall if he jumps too high from the vantage point, or too close to some wall (grabbing mostly air), ruinning your escape plan offten ending in your death. Or opponents having unestablished attacks, even if you clearly see that someone is rushing to punch you he stops suddenly breaking your combo (which shouldn't concern you too much if you don't chase scores).\n\nBut that's pretty much everything bad I can say about this game, really. Everything else is pure gold. Its unbelievable that it took only 2 years after first game for Rocksteady to develop the game which is in every way vastly superior to its already phenomenal predeccessor.  Incredible amount of love is invested in every detail: characters, story, gameplay, superior voice acting, writing, story-driven and optional missions, challenges,... Theres so much to do here. When you finish with story campaign you can throw yourself into challenge maps with one of the 4 characters (Batman, Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing), with their own gadgets, moves, and objectives on every map. Catwoman is satisfying to controll in the fight maps, but in predator not so good because she is lacking gadgets and moves, but you shouldn't have much problems with other characters in that manner.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best games I've ever played, and a great fan service.

(one of these is a blatant lie).\n\nThe Arkham games offer a mix of stealth and action gameplay, and they make both of them work perfectly (at least Asylum and City do). I never played a 3D action game with fighting controls this tight, or stealth this fun, it's just a blast to play the combat challenges and predator encounters in these games (again, talking about Asylum and City),\nOn top of that, the voice acting, music, controls, gameplay, story, everything is as good as it can get.\n\nSo why is this one my favorite? Well there's just something about open world games with a ton of side stuff scattered around that gets to me, and this game definitely has it.\nFrom Riddler trophies/puzzles (440 of them if I remember correctly), to side quests that involve some of Gotham's and DC's famous criminals. These make Arkham City a pretty damn fun playground for our flying mammal.\nYou also get to play some parts of the game as Catwoman. I know some people don't enjoy controlling her, but I personally like it, especially in combat. She's faster than Batman and has totally different fighting animations (I wanna say she doesn't punch as hard as the bat, but don't quote me on that).\n\nNot sure if I can say anything about the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's pretty good, and Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Kevin Conroy as Batman did an amazing job bringing their characters to life.\nAgain, I'm not a huge Batman fan outside of these games, and I absolutely love the story in this game, I've beaten the game multiple times, and I never skipped a single cutscene.\n\nThis game is a clean 10/10 for me, it's just fantastic in every way possible.","June 29, 2015","true","92.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","2"

There are tons of memorable characters, and a story that will enthrall you to no end. The artwork in this game is astounding, and some of the characters are even voiced by legendary voice actors like Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker),\n\nThe fighting mechanics in the Arkham series are unlike anything you've ever seen before, with tons of options for combos for beating the living crap out of your enemies.\n\nAfter 100 hours, I have completed the game on the three main difficulties and completed the game 100% on Normal. Currently, I'm working on a New Game + playthrough.\n\nThe music is top notch; composed by Nick Arundel.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Batman, is a fan of beat-em-ups, or just wants to try something new.","February 19","true","117.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/professorpocket/recommended/200260/","professorpocket","(-TN-) Prof. Pocket ™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/professorpocket/","345 products in account","BATMAN Arkham City Review! I almost forgot to do it after I beat the story so here it is.\n\nThe story was pretty short but the fight system is pretty awesome. I kinda wish the fights lasted longer but I was playing on regular difficulty. Apparently the new game plus mode is really intensely hard, but I didn't care enough to go through it all again. I was pleased with the game on my first run through so I didn't really want to go back and collect all the craploads of Riddler trophies scattered throughout the game or finish any of the side quests.\n\nThe overall story is pretty solid, but I was feeling like something was missing and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's good, but it just seemed a little too... cookie cutter Batman. There wasn't really anything that stood out or blew my mind. I guess that's what some people enjoy about Batman is that he's Batman and predictable. I don't say that in a negative way, just that some people might like that more than me is all. I had a few "what a twist" moments that mainly came from Batman's adversaries rather than himself. Basically Batman just beat the hell out of everyone to get what he needs. I liked how the story was like a few short stories end to end that had an overall theme. It's pretty cool the way Batman works his way through all the scum in Arkham City one by one with the same suit that shows wear and tear as the game progresses.\n\nThe combat system is by far my favorite aspect of the game. At first I was really not getting it down, but once I realized it's not about button mashing and I have to time literally every hit after the first 2 connect. Basically Batman crits everyone after his second hit, and assuming you're targeting the right thug and not button mashing you can string together some totally mega badass combos. Not to mention the gadgets. They're all there including some new fangled things that wouldn't make it to the movies, but for the purposes of the game it's perfect. Lot's of different configurations of gadget use and combos make for some ridiculous fights. I never got tired of the slow-mo hits either, somehow they were always satisfying. Even if the stealth parts were fun, like hanging some random unfortunate goon upside down of the side of a building, or sneaking around in vents only to bust into the room and knock down a bunch of thugs. All in all the combat is what makes this game worth playing in my opinion.\n\nSome of the voice acting is really good and other times it's pretty lame. Sometimes it sounds like people reading to each other off a script with no emotion, then other times it really great and immersive. Joker is by far the best and sounds crazy as you'd expect. Batman wasn't all that great though, but Harley Quinn was spot on as well as a few others.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding and that's probably my second favorite thing about this game. It just LOOKS really good. The devs really didn't miss much, lots of really fine details are everywhere and really add to the overall ambiance when necessary. If you're not into 3rd person combat, at least play it for the graphics. It's gorgeous.\n\nBatman AC: 6.95. Fine I'll round up. 7.\n","November 23, 2014","true","21.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

A decent lengthen storyline with plenty of side missions and DLC story lines too.\n- Missions are varied, both within the storyline and side missions, including puzzles, stealth, gung-ho action and boss battles.\n- For the first time you can play as Catwoman and Robin, the former is awesome to play as and adds a fresh dimension to the game.\n- The storyline is great, thanks to incredible characters with superb voice acting and twists and turns to keep you guessing.\n- Roam the city, it feels great to glide around Arkham city with plenty to explore.\n- Combat is some of the best in the industry with some new moves and use of gadgets.\n- Batman, Robin, Catwoma, Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane, Mr.Freeze, Penguin..so many of the great comic book legends come to life in the game.\n- GOTY edition comes with all content including some rather cool skin packs for Batman and Robin.\n\nCONS:\n- On first play through on other platforms I found it easy to lose interest when wondering arkham city, often getting lost and mislead when navigating. I preferred Asylums more linear approach for a long time before I revisited arkham city.\n- Game mode plus, I hate this invention. Theres plenty of replay value anyway due to free roam after story completion, allowing you to revisit side missions but plus mode feels like a con. If there is an even more difficult mode have it available from the start as if your one to play for achievements you will need to play the game again.\n\nVERDICT?\nAn incredible game which is high value for money.","July 6, 2015","true","17.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Great graphics, solid story. Right from the start you are shown Batman, villain after villain, after villain. It hooks you in and keeps you going. It's not an overwhelming combat system lots of typical button mashing for a hand to hand fighter but in this style of game it's enjoyable. The game focuses more on stealth combat not direct fighting. If you are a batman fan, read no farther go ahead and buy it. If you are on the fence read on.\n\nThe game is solid, like I mentioned before it's some button mashing style gameplay and it's pretty basic gameplay in my opinion. Basic as in you don't have to be a seasoned gamer to figure it out and play. The graphics are great and Batman as always is awesome. Catwoman is a nice addition, I know Robin is supposed to be around somewhere in the game (not sure if I misread or not got to him yet or something) then all the villains all wrapped up into one story line! It's great, any of the new Batman games (Asylum, City, Origins) This one is my favorite so far but I've not got into Origins much at this time to decide.

You punch with LMB and counter with RMB, the rest you dont really need but the other gadgets batman uses can be very helpful in more intense fights.\n-Story is a very strong aspect of the game and can get you gripped throughout the whole campaign, as there isn't really any boring parts of the game.\nA lot of effort was put in the characters as you, throughout your journey (this is an open world sandbox game BTW), meet tons of characters from the Batman licence, you fight the Joker, Cobblepot, Two-Face, Mr.Freeze(which is a great boss fight, very cleverly done), and you even team up with Bane and try to capture Zasz, etc.\nContinuing in the story aspect, the game delivers the most apropriate ending to the game there could be, absolute genius, it was a fantastic ending and a lot of twists you didn't see coming through the story, mostly toward the end).\nAnother aspect I need to mention is the amazing stealth system, it's not a crappy stealth system like Kane & Lynch 2, for example. It's very rewarding to knock out a whole room of guards without ever being detected (the live guards can't see the other's "corpses" or they will trigger alarms and then, ♥♥♥♥ will hit the fan).\nAnother great thing about the game, is that you can play as various characters, being the most important one, CATWOMAN (Dat ♥♥♥!), i play better with her than batman!!! You can play also as Robin and Nightwig (which are not characters that i like much...), but they all have different gadgets and moves, so they aren't just a re-skin of eachother, however they are DLC only characters.\nThere is also a challenge mode, that included various objetives, like clear a room of bad guys through fighting, and you fight various waves and get points to get to leaderboards, or clear a room a bit more stealthy, etc.\nThere are also over 400 riddler trophies scattered throughout the whole city of Arkham and you need to use you gadgets and brains to get to them, and various sort of thing.\nThere is also a New Game +, which allows you to get all your XP points and upgraded combo moves (you do not get ridiculouly overpowered in this game like in most other action shooty-fighties) and get through the main story and secondary quests all over again, and it's still fun to do, and adds a lot to the replayability of the game.\nThis is the GOTY edition (there isn't the regular edition on the steam store anymore), so you get all DLC, includind Harley Quinn's Revenge, but it contains heavy spoilers right at the beginning of the DLC Campaign, so I won't talk about it much.\nThere is only one issue with the game (ONE!) and that is the fact that it uses 3 DRM's (3!!!!), it uses the steam overlay (which is something noone had troubles with and i'm fine with that), there is SECUROM (which asks for your CD-Key before your first run of the game, and then it disappears, I never got problems with SECUROM in Arkham City, actually, i haven't seen it since i entred the CD-Key on the next day after i bought the game to play it. Finally, there is the broken limb of Arkham City: Games For Windows Live (GFWL), you should know what it is, if you don't, then don't ever get close to it (unless to play this awesome game!) because it's a flawed piece of ♥♥♥♥ DRM system, however, it isn't some stupid DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that isn't going to ruin this epic game's score:\n\n10/10, the best there is! Batman: Arkham City is a must have even at full price, if you can't deal with this nonsensical DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, then wait for a price drop...\n","April 18, 2013","true","27.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

Batman Arkham City is an excellent game of highest quality out on the market. There's a lot to say about Batman AC. What grabs your attention almost right away is the amazing scenery along with the incredibly well done voice acting to all different characters within the game. As a result of that, you bond a strange relationship with both the hero and the villains in AC.\n\nAnother rare (to me) and fantastic thing about this game is the combat system. The combat mechanics runs extremely smooth and it's tons of different things you can do in different situations; Long story short, the combat varies a great deal. Another important thing to point out is the stealth and how it works. There's loads of things you can do once you enter stealth and start sneaking around. This includes sneaking past enemies to get to your objective faster, taking 'em down one by one by taking a good hold around their neck and tighten enough to squeeze out the oxygen of their lifeless bodies or you can just simply creep around in Arkham City, listening to what the different gangmembers has to say about the weather, their annoying boss or the infamous Batman. I find that very amusing for some reason.\n\nLast thing that I can recall at this very moment that's worth mentioning is the well written plot of both the main story and most side quests. I hope the writers of this gem got a salary raise 'cause the main story along with all the side quests are truly fascinating and well writen, therefore it engages the player to do whatever he/she can do to complete the task or whatever the player's being told.\n\nIn conclusion, Batman Arkham City is a marvelous game, I have to say I've never played any other game with better voice acting than this, the same goes for plot and story.

Well to be honest i had my doubts for this game, didn't like Arkham Asylum all too much but Arkham City really did opened up the series for me. With Arkham City's being a free roamer really caugth my attention being that usually Free Roam superhero games like the Spiderman series really gives alot of potential on games for me. Arkham City didn't fail and in fact sucseeded in suprising me more than i thougth it would. Combat is amazing, free roam never got boring being that you tend to get that Batman feel everytime you leap from one building to another and glide your way to slam over an enemy never gets old.\n\nThe story is great, intense and the campaign is almost always thrilling. Boss fights are challenging and rememberable. Map size is rather big, but nothing special. Stealth feels rather real compared to most games. A.I feels amazingly intelligent and you get that hide for your life type of feel whenever you're taking the predator approach in a room filled with armed thugs.\n\nYou can spend alot of time playing this game garrunteed, side missions are fun on thier own, and Catwoman being an editon to the gameplay as a playable character really only makes the experience that much better. I'd give Arkham City a 9/10. Good story. Good combat. Good map and free roam. Spectacular campaign and only some slight character bugs.","January 10, 2014","true","29.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Captivating story, great gameplay, and characters that make the expirience even better! It gets difficult occasionally, but only to the extent that when you complete the mission/task/whatever, you achieve a sense of acomplishment. The plot is incredibly well thought out, with twists and turns at every corner. In fact, the only thing better than the story, is the gameplay itself. After a little getting used to, the combat becomes enjoyable. Whether you're taking on a few thugs, a titan, or both at once, i can guarantee that you will find it entertaining. The upgrade system has improved significantly from what it was in arkham asylum. I'm not going to lie, using the cryptographic sequencer was a bit of a struggle, but after more frequent use, became an exellent adition to batman's repetoire of gadgets. And then there's the voice acting. Absolutely amazing. The cast was perfect, and all portrayed the characters brilliantly. The only thing that i dislike about this game was that it ended. Game of the Year is an understatement. This is one of the greatest games ever made. Whether you're a fan of batman, or not, this game will prove to be a fantastic expirience that you will never forget.

This is one of the best single player adventure games released in recent years. The story is exciting and keeps you wanting for more, voice talent is perfect and delivers a cinematic experience.The map looks small for a "city" but Arkham offers unique diversity and beautify atmospheric locations. Many buildings are visitable and lead to sizeable interiors in which much of the story is told. A mass of content is available to be explored at your leisure: ranging from gang wars to Alice in wonderland.\n\nBecaise batman cant attach himself to every ledge and brick you'll often find yourself "f-ing" the f button (which engages the grapple hook) and swooping from roof to roof with your cape. This is not bad but it does cause for alot of awkward bumping throught the game. Combat is very satisfying with a choreographed feel to it! The counter and attack mechanics are simple but very enjoyable due to the rhythmic pace and the matrix like flow.\n\nAs of now I have only played with Batman and Catwoman. Unlike Batman, Catwoman is able to crawl onto every surface, this sadly forces the overly sexualised character to show her every curve. Not that I am complaining, but I personally am tired of the catty attitude (lol), teasing female character and I can imagine women being disappointed about the Barbie body shape and skin tight costumes. Apart from that Catwoman is awesome. In fact, I prefer her over the bulky Batman. She is quicker, lighter and smaller. Add this on top of her wall climbing skills and you've got an epic ninja!\n\nMy experience was with mouse and keyboard, which held up relatively good. Though a game pad will make life easier to utilize the increasing number of gadgets. In conclusion I would like to make a note about the story. The pacing and execution are brilliantly done, but even the most beautiful cinematography cant hide Batman's biggest shortcoming. A relatable character, Bruce Wayne is a billionaire who spends all his efforts fighting street crime.\n\nWhilst billionaires like him are the very cause of crime in Gotham. Instead of fighting the corrupt and rotten society, he chooses to fight the poor and the prospectless. If you can get over this fundamentally flawed premise, then welcome to Arkham City.

It doesn't stray too far to confuse you if you played the first but it definitely takes the game in a different enough direction that you don't feel like you're playing a rehash called Arkham Asylum 1.5.\n\nA bigger, longer game from the first with a much improved story, some good plot twists, a more conventional 3 act story and still has the great moments and voice acting from the first.\n\nThe Riddler challenges in the first game were fun to do, and they've been improved drastically here. They can be wildly different from the first game and quite hard to figure out, but well worth the time doing so.\n\nThe Catwoman sections are a lot of fun too. She plays different enough from Batman but you don't feel like you're weaker than him. In fact, I liked playing as Catwoman more than I did Batman. Her takedowns are slower and she climbs up buildings differently and it can take a bit to get the hang of, but it added to the game a lot.\n\nThe Harley Quinn DLC was very short, but most DLCs are. It was fun, it was different and geniunely added to the experience. You spend a lot of time playing as Robin and he plays a little more like Batman but with some different moves on him.\n\nThe challenges include Batman, Catwoman, Robin & Nightwing (formerly the first Robin) and they all play different from one another but still have the same moves overall, just different actions, different power and different speed.\n\nThis was an amazing game and easily recommended to anyone who likes action games.","March 19, 2014","true","23.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Underdrill/recommended/200260/","Underdrill","Underdrill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Underdrill/","248 products in account","Batman Arkham City is, obviously, the sequel to Arkham Asylum. I already said that Asylum was one of my best games of all time. However, Arkham City improves in every single aspect of the Arkham games. It has more content that is still of high quality, better mechanics, a better story that actually has a couple of twists in it (They will not be spoiled here) and some of the best downloadable content on the market.\n\nI'll begin by discussing the improved combat system. It makes the one is Asylum seem extremely outdated even though this was released only two years after Asylum. There are much more combat moves, a bigger enemy variety that includes armored enemies that can only be hit with the new Beatdown move and enemies holding doors which can only be avoided by maneuvering away from them or by pulling off the aerial attack move. Even the titan combat has been improved with two moves you can pull of on them. This makes the game harder, but not by much. Taking away the counter icons will give you a much tougher experience. The system will take a bit of getting used to, especially with the tougher moves like the Blade Dodge Takedown.\n\nThe stealth has also been improved. There is a much bigger variety of takedowns that Batman can perform such as the Ledge Takedown, Takedowns through glass and walls and Double Takedowns which are very rewarding when you can pull one off. Again, the stealth has also been made harder. You will have to deal with armored enemies that can only be taken down with exotic methods and enemies that will be able to see you on vantage points if you don't have the right upgrade.\n\nMost of Batman's gadgets that were in Arkham Asylum have returned for City with a few new editions such as the Line Launcher (Which I believe is the most useful gadget it any game ever) and the Freeze Grenade. All of the gadgets are very helpful in stealth. Most of them are useful in combat and they help keep the variety in your combos.\n\nThe game now contains not only Riddler Trophies as collectables, but it also has some challenges that are completed by Gliding for a certain length of time or using a certain gadget in a combo for example. Destroyable items are back too.\n\nThere are also a lot of side missions in this game that each focus on a specific character. You can begin them at random points throughout the game or simply through discovery. Some of them can be completely missed out. They all have a lot of variety and some of them hint at things that could happen in Arkham Knight.\n\nChallenge Maps are back as well. The base game had 6 combat and 6 predator challenges with extreme varients. The extreme predator maps have been improved since Asylum. It is quite rare for you to ever be in a situation where the map has the vantage points with proximity mines on them which I think was just a cheap way to increase the difficulty. The maps are not too hard, even if you are aiming for all three medals. The predator ones may require a bit of trial and error for some of the objectives. I don't really see this as a problem as it reminds me of what Batman is: A detective. There are also a set of 12 campaigns which are a series of three maps which you must complete with modifiers that make some maps harder, but you are also given some helpful modifiers. A series of three extreme maps will test your skills to the limits.\n\nThe port itself had problems and the abysmal GFWL integrated into it at launch. Now those problems are pretty much nonexistant. There are a couple of bugs with the A.I. and combat but these issues don't come up that often.The game runs pretty well after some configuration and it also includes all of the DLC. It wouldn't be a GOTY edition without all of the DLC, am I right?\n\nThe extra content you are getting for Arkham City is all brilliant. There are a ton of skins that Batman can use from different storylines. Catwoman is playable with 4 extra story missions and two additional skiins. Her ability set is quite limited compared to Batman and she is intented for the more experienced players. Robin and Nightwing are both playable in the challenge maps. They come with some gadgets you will already be familiar with and new gadgets that will give you more unique ways to dispatch your foes. Extra challenge maps are also provided that try to do things differently. There are two survival maps and a sidescroller for example. The Batcave is also a predator map. Finally, there is the Two Hour Story Campaign, Harley Quinn's Revenge. It doesn't do much new, but you are getting more arkham city and extra playtime with Robin. What more could you ask for?\n\nYou are going to get well over 100 hours completing everything this game has to offer (I played this on the PS3 so I rushed through both of my story playthroughs). If you liked Arkham Asylum, you probably already have this. If you haven't played a Batman Game before, wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be disappointed as this is an unforgettable experience. The amount of detail put into the world is astounding and the mechanics have been polished even further than before. It is one of the greatest video games ever created. 10/10.","June 3, 2015","true","66.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

No matter if you're just familar with the movies, the cartoons, the comics, or none of the above, there is something to appeal to everybody. I've beat it numerous times on the 360 and the PC and I still come back to it from time to time because of the addictive combat and Riddler Challenges, as you can tell by the number of hours I've put into it. The only negative things I'd have to say about the game would be that not much attention was placed on Nightwing and Robin in the game; an example would be that in the challenge rooms neither of them have any voice acting. But that's more of a nitpick (I love Robin/Tim Drake) becasue this is a game centered around Batman, and in that regard the game is perfect. This is my favorite game of all time, a title I hope will be replaced by the upcoming Arkham Knight. If I had to give this game a score it be 10/10.

Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, Legendary Batman related Voice Actors return as their normal roles.\n\n\n\nNow, on to the story. After the events of Arkham Asylum, Arkham Asylum was shut down. And Mayor Sharp thought that maybe a bigger prison would be better. So, They built a Wall around Old Gotham. Where we start this story, Bruce Wayne is giving a speech infront of the Prison. He's part of the Anti-Arkham City thing that some poeple made. Hugo Strange, The Warden of Arkham City, Orders Bruce Wayne's arrest. Now we all know that Hugo Strange knows Bruce is Batman. Bruce then escapes Strange's custody and calls Alfred to send in the Batusit. Batman's long Night, has Just begun. That's all I'll say about the story. You'll just have to see what happens for yourself. (I know in my Arkham Origins review I talked about the end, But, I'm cheap. xD I enjoy the story in this more and it really sucks you in. So I choose not to spoil anything)\n\n\n\nThere are many different Batman Characters in this game. Such as Barbara & Jim Gordon, Tim Drake Robin, Ra's Al Ghul, Hugo Strange, Catwoman, Two-Face, Penguin, Nightwing, (Sadly only a playable character in the challenge maps. No voice actor untill Arkham Knight either) Joker, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Deadshot, Mister Freeze, and much, much more. Now on to what I liked. I did like that Tim Was In here at least. I also, LOVED the Story. The Detective vision has improved since Arkham Asylum. The Combat system is also good. I Really like that this game has more than Batman Beating up people. It shows that he truely is The World's Greatest Detective. Batman and all the playable characters have a variety of Takedowns, and Gadgets. One of my favorite passtimes in Arkham Asylum & City is Thug Bowling on the Line Launcher. I also really like Playing as Nightwing in the challenge maps.\n\n\n\nNow, On to things I didn't like. I really liked everything in this game! But one of the VERY few Problems I had with this game was how they handled Tim Drake. With the Buzz Cut, Damian hood, & Brooding! He acted more Like Damian! Plus Tim Always had Anime style hair. Then again they hardly had any development in him. He acted more like Tim in the Story DLC. Anyway, Tim is basically the only problem I had with Arkham City.\n\n\nWell, Besides the Ra's Al Ghul part. When Batman Talks To Freeze he knows that Ra's has been using the Pit for centuries. Freeze asked "What will you do if he's dead?" Batman then responds with "Then I'll Wake Him Up". BUT, After the Ra's boss Battle, Batman talks to Barbara and is like "He's using some sort of Pit. He's been using it for centuries". Batman Already Knew that! Continuity error there! I also didn't really like how Penguin was. He was supposed to be gentleman like he looked in his poster in Arkham Asylum. He just sounds and looks like a British Thug! But the reason for this is because this is Arkham City, the criminals really are at there lowest points.\n\n\n\nI really had hardly any problems with Arkham City. I give this Game a 9.5 out of 10.","July 5, 2014","true","293.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","8"

Robin and Nightwing are available in DLC challenge maps. Explore, fight, and solve crime in 3rd person throughout Gotham. Has a solid story and even more solid combat system, aside from the occasional glitch.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nI would say that for its time, Batman: Arkham City has top of the line graphics. The Batman character model is well done, coupled with the environment, this leads to some impressive views when sitting atop a roof or overhang. The game is well optimized too. With graphics on highest settings I never dropped below 60fps.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe voice acting is very well done, significantly enhancing the experience. Most sound effects and background noise are spot on as well. What really bothered me in this category however, was that the simple thugs you're fighting 80% time, had really redundant dialogue that grated on my nerves after 20+ hours of game play.\n\nPlayability: 9/10\nMost of the time this game ran very smoothly. I commend how well combat flows, not to mention the fun variety of side missions and overall story. However I did often find myself "cheated" in combat, with enemies sliding ridiculous distances to score a punch outside of my peripheral vision. The combat system is easy to learn, hard to master, allowing you to jump right in, but still enjoy the combat hours later as you learn to incorporate new abilities into your fighting style.\n\nEntertainment: 10/10\nI really enjoyed this game. The story kept me involved, and the side missions were interesting enough to give a breath of fresh air. With the quality voice acting and graphics, it's almost like watching a movie. The combat is satisfying, and entertaining. The freedom of movement throughout the city is great too, grappling, gliding, sliding, sneaking, and running between and to your foes.\n\nReplay: 6/10\nAlthough new game plus is implemented, allowing you to go through the game again with your upgrades and skills unlocked, there's not much more to be gained entertainment-wise. The story-line and game play albeit being very fun, have no real deviation from the first time through. There are a plethora of DLC additions and challenge maps adding many hours of additional game play, but I've found these to be extremely tedious after the first few hours. (If you're looking to 100% this game expect to spend close to 60 hours repeating dozens of challenge maps over and over with every character,)\n\n","May 15, 2015","true","91.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/200260/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Batman: Arkham City is widely considered to be the best of the Arkham series (I actually think it'll beat out the upcoming Arkham Knight too) and also arguably one of the best games of last generation. I wanted to get this game because, well, you know, it's Batman. I've had experience with the previous game (Arkham Asylum) and didn't bother getting Origins because that game looked mediocre, despite the fact the game had Deathstroke, who is one of my favorite Batman characters. Well, let me get back on track. Batman: Arkham City is actually a pretty solid title and I enjoyed most of the game, but it's nowhere near perfect.\n\nThe visuals look stunning and I enjoy every bit of it. The atmosphere captures the dark feeling that Batman games need or else they lose on a significant part on the game. Let's be real for a moment, would you rather play a game where there's a dark, terrifying atmosphere or a fluffy unicorn rainbow Pyroland-styled atmosphere that Batman hangs around in? Exactly. You would choose the Pyroland one, right? Anyway, the character models look great, especially the Joker. Shockingly, I've found no flaws with the graphics and stand out among the best of 2011, well, besides modded Skyrim anyway.\n\nThe gameplay is above average. Arkham City successfully uses the tactical/stealth mechanics, such as maneuvering quickly with your grappling hook, plus the secret stealth attacks can be pretty effective and fun to use. However, the combat itself and also the glide kicks are disappointing, especially with a controller. Speaking of which, if you want the combat to be somewhat better, I recommend getting a controller before getting this game. The keyboard can be quite annoying to use during the fight scenes. To add on to that, the glide kicks get messed up often for me. One time, towards the end of the game, I was sorrounded by snipers and was picking them off one-by-one. What happened though is that when I attempted to do a glide kick towards an enemy, it aimed toward someone else and the kick got them, but then the snipers got me before I could get away, so I had to do that whole part all over again. Also, with Catwoman's story, the whip she uses is annoying when climbing up buildings and annoyed me to death. In the end, AC is above average at it's best for the gameplay.\n\nThe story is surprisingly dark and actually pretty amazing. Hugo Strange captures you and brings you into Arkham City, and tells you about something called 'Protocol Ten' and Batman has to stop the plan in under ten hours (and also find what the plan is) but encounters several other issues along the way, most notably the Joker, who is dying from the TITAN overdose at the end of Arkham Asylum but still seeks to defeat Batman. The story gets better and better as it goes on, but it's at it's best towards the end of the game. There are 2 major plot twists, but trust me, they were done well. Where Arkham City was at it's low point was basically Catwoman's chapters. Catwoman wants to get into Hugo Strange's vault but can't get in without doing a few things. Trust me, the whole story is absolutely boring and she goes through all that trouble and all of that suspense building for two suitcases that are barely even larger than her head. She then has an opportunity to get rid of the suitcases we had to waste our time for to save Batman, or just walk away with the suitcases and just leave Batman to his problem. Waste of time if you ask me. Batman's story is outstanding, but Catwoman's is not.\n\nThe audio is amazing when it comes to sound effects and voice acting. The music, too, is great. However, it doesn't compare to the greatness of the other two. The voice acting (more specifically the Joker and the Penguin) is superb and top-notch. Just listen to them in the demo or on Youtube or something. They do not disappoint. The sound effects look great and look them up on Youtube too. The music is thrilling and heated. It matches well with the atmosphere and you will enjoy it greatly.\n\nThe replayability contains the following: New Game+, extra missions, Catwoman chapter finale, a large open world, and the riddler trophies. Quite a few things to enjoy yourself with here.\n\nIn the end, Batman: Arkham City is an impressive game despite its many flaws. If you enjoy Batman in any way, you will most certainly enjoy this game. I heartily recommend it.\n\nGraphics- 10/10\nGameplay- 6.5/10\nStory- 8.5/10\nAudio- 8.0/10\nReplayability- 8.0/10\n\n.:8.5/10:.\n\n+Outstanding visuals\n+Superb voice acting\n+Stealth mechanics done well\n+Fitting music\n+Batman's story was amazing\n\n-Catwoman's chapter fell short\n-Poor combat controls\n-Glide kicks can be quite annoying","August 28, 2014","true","13.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The new gadgets and the way that they can be used in battles give a lot of variety, making it a bore returning to Asylum. It's a blast to move through the open world _ it feels more like Spider-Man than Batman, but that's not bad. Riddler's trophies are not just hidden, you have to solve puzzles to get them (I didn't manage to get them all, like I did in Asylum, but there's no achievement for it, so I gave up after getting more than 90%). And, although they're way more limited than Batman, it was great to play as Robin, Nightwing and, specially, as Catwoman (she's sexy as hell!).

The way he moves, controls, gadgets and game play all facilitate towards that goal making you feel like you are in complete control of your surroundings.\n\n+The combat is fun and challenging requiring timing and precision to master.\n\n+Stealth is excellent, finding the right balance between fun and realism. The AI isn't so brain dead that you can kill them with ease nor are they super realistic that they will spot you a mile away.\n\n+Solid sense of progression and upgrades. Gaining experience unlocks more powerful combat moves and gadgets.\n\n+ Open World is detailed with lots of collectables and side quests.\n\n+ One of the few games that does collectables right. Some of the collectables are easy to get while other require a bit of thinking. The game also provides a way of unlocking collectables on the mini map so you don't need to use a guide to collect them all. Collecting riddler trophies unlocks new concept art, predator maps and helps you finish the riddler's side quest.\n\n+ Fantastic boss fights\n\n+ Great cast of characters\n\n+ Predator maps and combat maps further the replay value giving you extra challenges. You can play as Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing\n\n+ Great voice acting and sound\n\n+ Game is gorgeous.\n\n+ New Game Plus- Upgrades carry over.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Some plot holes in the main story\n\n-Getting all the achievements will take a lot of work. Nitpicky issue, but going through all the maps with each of the four characters is exhausting.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is one of the best Batman games, this is one of the best action adventure games. You can tell Rocksteady put a lot of blood sweat and tears into this game to make it the best it can possibly be. The game is extremely polished and a joy to play with insane value. No matter what price you buy this game you will get your money's worth .\n\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","79.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Granted its a Batman game and its predecessor was not as great as this sequel. The storyline in Arkham City kept me glued to my monitor from start to finish. I played the game for 3 days and beat it. The writers did an incredible job with the whole  Joker dying  storyline and the Mr. Freeze story, however I feel that every other villian's story line fell extremely short, Bane being a perfect example, he shows up for 10minutes of the game and his story just sort of ends.\n\nCatwoman's role in the game was somewhat useless until the ending to be completely honest. As theres a choice at the end of her gameplay to save Batman or not. If you decide not to save Batman the game shows a cutscene then rewinds the gameplay to the same choice until you choose to save him, which is somewhat pointless, it'd make more sense for them to just not allow you to "choose" if ultimatey you had to save Batman, no matter what. Granted the game wouldn't make much sense if Catwoman didn't go back and save him, because there would be no closure as to what happens between Batman and all the villians in Arkham City.\n\nThe game never stopped amazing me, when most people think of Batman they think of the children's cartoons, but this game is pretty dark and as far as the overall story went, it was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing insane. The ending really shocked me and I didn't know if I should feel sad or good.\n\n10/10, Whether you are or are not a Batman fan, this is a game I'd recommend to everyone to try, it is definitely in my top 5 games.","October 9, 2013","true","26.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/recommended/200260/","neogunhero","kuri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neogunhero/","311 products in account","One of my all time favorite games. Batman: Arkham City took what Arkham Asylum did good and made it a whole lot better. The one thing that Arkham City does the best is that it makes you feel like you're Batman. It does so in a variety of ways, from giving you a large arsenal of gadgets to use, making the combat feel fluid and responsive with lots of different types of attacks, having you investigate crimes by searching for clues and trying to repiece the moments in your head, and best of all, it lets you glide around the city with your wings. There's no question why this is considered one of the best licensed games next to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena.\n\nThe GOTY edition really does add to the game. It comes with a few extra challenge maps that are actually fun to play. They certainly are challenging and aren't just tacky add-ons to make the game longer. In fact, the main story is longer than most of todays games, coming in at around 15 hours, not including the side missions (I owned the GFWL version before the Steam version, and I have yet to complete it on Steam). With the side missions, I'd say total gameplay hours would be around 30 hours, since there are tons of extra stuff to do, not including challenge mode.\n\nSo overall, this game is worth your time. Even if you aren't a Batman fan or don't know much about his character or the world, this game is fun for everyone who enjoys third person action games.\n\nMy only complaint is that the open world can feel dead at times, with no one in the streets and nothing happening, and also how it takes a long time to travel from one area to another if you didn't unlock it already. Arkham Knight will fix this with being able to freely drive the Batmobile.\n\nMy personal rating: 9/10 -  Gripping story, fluid combat, awesome graphics, and just downright fun to play.\n","April 25, 2015","true","13.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

Pays good lip service to the comics and contains the best voice over cast ever to do the Batman franchise, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil in my mind are the best Batman and Joker combination ever concieved and they both delievered yet again.\n\nThe gadgetry is well thought out and a nice improvement over Batman:AA\n\nThe catwoman gameplay felt a little tacked on, especially the bonus missions, it just felt like they couldn't think of anything else to do with her.\n\nThe revenge of Harley was actually a nice DLC add on that was a pretty good couple of hours, well worth the original price, and gives you a nice hands on with Robin. Robin definitely feels inferior to Batman in H2H which just adds to the greatness of Batman himself.\n\nGraphically the game is real nice running on the newet iteration of the unreal engine but nothing really ground breaking. Does the job and no real complaints, I just wish they would ditch Phys-X for something else.\n\nSound wise the game is absolutely great, the atmosphere is fantastic and the sound track is fitting as always.\n\nRocksteady has made a real masterpiece here and it is a great shame they have been denied the opportunity to do another sequel.

This game is just a masterpiece, everything is made up for every batman fan and to make you become one.\nYou can probably see all the characters in this, the story doesn't really follows the previous one in my opinion, maybe only with The Joker.\n\nWhen I was complaining of the lack of combat moves in Arkham Asylum, they added more here to create more techniques to make battles like so EPIC.\nHowever, they kept the challenges, they added even more with the Robin, Catwoman and Nightwing packs, the challenges are the same as Arkham Asylum, only the maps and the new moves change. For me, it's not really enjoyable, some challenges are too hard and require 1 hour of play doing nothing to get all the medals. Boring.\nThe DLC Quinn's Revenge is quite good, a bit too short.\nIf you're an achievement master, you will probably end the story campaign 99.50% with 3 Riddler's challenges that you can do only once in the middle of the story.\n\nTo brief, this game has an awesome story that will get you curious of every single event in Arkham, The Joker is brilliant, I wonder what he's become in Arkham Origins. And if you didn't play Arkham Asylum, buy the triple pack.","January 13, 2014","true","32.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I LOVED LOVED LOVED Asylum, but this game does not live up to the fun of the first.  This game takes place in a much larger world than the first game, however the world is boring and lifeless, and you will spend most of your time doing busywork to upgrade your character.  With all of the side missions this is a lengthy game, I wish they focused more on the core story.  The fun Riddler riddles from the first game have been replaced tons of boring easy puzzles.  It's not a bad game, but nowhere near as good as 1.  The boss battles are good.  In the first game you likely left detective mode turned on the whole game, in this game they made detective mode worse, encouraging you to turn it off.","July 23, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The world isn't necessarily bigger, but it's more densely packed with trophies, side missions, and baddies. The Riddler challenges are improved, but honestly I still needed some help to understand what the goal was of some of the trophies.\n\nThe story and characters are still good, the voiceover work is great, but I was still left wondering why I should care about any of the events. I love Batman, but even he asks near the end: "What's the point of locking you up when you're just going to get out and wreak havoc again?"\n\nIt feels like by restricting everything Batman does to a prison area, we've restricted the significance of what Batman can do. It's like "Oh no! The prisoners are revolting! Get them back in prison! Oh good, they're back in prison, thanks, Batman, you just saved the world again." Maybe some of this story scope is resolved in Origins, but I didn't find it here.\n\nNow, there are some great moments, like when Batman revisits the crime alley where his parents were murdered, or the creepy stories from Calendar Man, but they felt like exceptions to the rule.\n\nOverall, it's a better game than Asylum for the fluidity of flight with Batman's upgrades and the new characters with which you get to command, but it still feels like something's missing.\n\n","November 29, 2013","true","45.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've just finished the story game and unlocked the re-play with all gadgets mode but will try to solve all the first round puzzles and do the missions. It's an epic game and I say this never having played any other Batman game although I hear that Arkham Aslyum is awesome as well. If you've never played or owned a Batman game, then this could be the one to get. GOTY edition has a lot to offer and it has all the characters good and bad that make Batman an awesome game.","December 1, 2013","true","27.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I LOVED LOVED LOVED Asylum, but this game does not live up to the fun of the first.  This game takes place in a much larger world than the first game, however the world is boring and lifeless, and you will spend most of your time doing busywork to upgrade your character.  With all of the side missions this is a lengthy game, I wish they focused more on the core story.  The fun Riddler riddles from the first game have been replaced tons of boring easy puzzles.  It's not a bad game, but nowhere near as good as 1.  The boss battles are good.  In the first game you likely left detective mode turned on the whole game, in this game they made detective mode worse, encouraging you to turn it off.","July 23, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ever.\n\nI will go over 5 topics in this review.\nStory, Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and Replay Value\n\nFirst off The Story.\nIt is around 12-15 hours all-up storywise and it is truely gripping and a great premise. Without spoiling anything, The game is set a couple of years after Arkham Asylum, and the newly appointed mayor Quincy Sharp Ex Warden of old Arkham Asylum has created a super prison dubbed ARKHAM CITY, Sure just throw all the bad guys in one place and throw away the key, Like thats gonna work!\n\nIt's up to Batman to sort all this out, by punching every Super-Villan in the face!\n\nThe Character list in the main game, not to mention the side missions is huge, more than I can say but from the trailers of course you have Hugo Strange, The Joker, Two-Face, Catwoman, The Riddler, EVEN Solomon Grundy is here, if you like the comics you will love the detail the devs have put into this game.\n\nNext Gameplay, what good is an amazing story without gameplay?\nYou for the most part of the game play as BATMAN, the worlds greatest Crimefighter and Detective, Both of which are put to work as you Grappel around the place, glide, Throw Batman's Signature Batarangs and fire his disarming Bat-Claw, and of course the magnificent FreeFlow combat from the previous game upscaled and infused with more awesome. Double Takedowns, Counters (Or more if those thugs dare hitting you at the same time!) The combat is improved dramatically and encouraging more use of using your gadgets more than ever during your combat and it really pays to do so!\n\nGraphics:\nI am not one to judge a game by its Graphics usually... But this game, is really pretty! So much detail in the enviroments you fly around in and well rendered character models all make this game truely immersive!\n\nSound:\nThe games sound is standout both in its strong epic soundtrack and the Excellent voice acting brought to us again in both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil repectively as Batman and The Joker, and the countless other characters from supporting characters like Alfred and Oracle to the complaining of the thugs you encounter on the street as Batman, this level of Voice Acting really makes the experience come alive.\n\nReplay Value:\nIn addition to the main story you have a bunch of side quests, which are varied and interesting to play through and give Batman more time to show off his Detective Skills.\n\nThe Riddler is the largest side mission, he has hidden large amounts of riddler trophies and created riddles all over Arkham City for Batman to collect and solve, and you won't turn a blind eye to this if you did in the previous game, the Riddler has hostages who he will kill if Batman doesn't solve enough of his riddles before the night is over. Also completing the Riddlers Challenges unlock Concept art and 3-D Character trophies for you to look at in the main menu which is sweet if you are into that!\n\nAside from the many side quests there is a seperate gamemode called New Game Plus unlocked after you complete the game on Normal/Hard, which allows you to play the story again, With all of your upgrades!\nThe Catch? No Counter icons in combat, and pretty much everything about the gameplay has gotten four times as hard. (Good Luck Beating Two-Face as Catwoman :P)\n\nOnce you have done all of this to keep you entertained there is a mode called "Riddlers Revenge" a bunch of small levels usually of either Plain Combat or Predator rooms each of which you have to complete objectives for to get a High Score on that Leaderboard!","November 22, 2013","true","44.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This is probably one of the best games ever made. It's a true gem that has little to no flaws whatsoever. The graphics are superb, the story is great, the voice acting is amazing, the gameplay is a spot on. In short, it's a true joy to play.\n\nThe game revolves around a small section of Gotham City, known now as "Arkham City", where gangs and thugs seem to have free-run of there own little slice of Gotham. It allows much greater freedom than Arkham Asylum did - and is all the better for it. You start with all the abilities and gadgets that you picked up in the previous game, and unlock a ton more too. As such, it may have a steep learning curve for people that did not play the previous game, but once you get into it, it's fluid, responsive and great fun.\n\nUpgrades to your Batsuit and character(s) abilities are bought with XP, that is earned fighting thugs - and you are rewarded for slick moves, long combos and variety. You can also quick-fire gadgets during combat, adding another really cool addition to the game.\n\nIf you are still not sure about this one, ask yourself the following questions (2 points for yes, 1 for no - and add up your score to determine if you should buy the game).\n\n1.

I got it last week and I have about 24 hours in it already. One of the best games I have played by far. Onto the review!\n\nBatman: Arkham City is a 3rd Person Beat 'em Up game. Of course, there are more aspects to this game as well, such as the stealth, and the detective work. When you start out this game, you are shoved into Arkham City, a walled-off section of Gotham City that houses all of Gotham's dangerous criminals. The person behind this "Arkham City", Hugo Strange, has a plan labelled "Protocol 10", which Batman seems to be very suspicious of, and for good reason. Now, enough story, how does this game play? Well, first off, there is no jump button, something that I am used to, as I have played many tLoZ games, but that's not what we're talking about. Instead, there's a "run" button, which is space. You can run off of buildings and ledges and the game will make you jump then. That is the most obvious difference from other 3rd person games. Getting around Arkham City is quite easy, as you can grapple to far away buildings and ledges, and you can upgrade this ablility so that it allows you to get launched quite a ways from where you intended to grapple. The combat system is AMAZING, you could jump into a group of enemies, and take them all out because of how it works. It's really only a 2 button system, with the attack and counter button, but it works so well! I could keep going on and on about the positives of this game, but it'd be pointless. It took me about 10 hours to get through the main campaign on normal mode, and I'm replaying it on the hardest difficulty. There are sidequests and end-game DLC to keep you playing after the main campaign, and there are challenges you could do, such as taking out a group of enemies using stealth, or just jumping in and beating them up, there's so much to do. My only complaint is that there are waaaaay too many Riddler Trophies to get, and 100%-ing the game will take much more time. But that is just one complaint in a game full of positives, so I give this game a 9.5/10.","August 16, 2014","true","83.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This allows the player to run around in an open-world sandbox, fulfil side missions, gather collectibles, play as catwoman and generally just have fun.\nIt sounded almost too good to be true...\n\nUnfortunately, it kind of was.\nArkham City, compared to its predecessor, feels unfocussed and poorly optimized. The large areas (including the seamless outdoor area that is the city) look great, but can have some framerate drops, especially when travelling at high speeds (e.g. with the grappling hook).\nCombat, which was relatively slow but delightfully impactful-feeling in the original has been sped up a bit for Batman and a lot for newcomer Catwoman. It suits Catwoman's style, but in Batman's case it feels as if his punches are less effective.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, this is still an excellent game that I would recommend, even to non-fans like myself.\nThe story is solid (while also silly, it's a super hero game after all! Don't expect this game to just be gritty situations like the recent DC films)\n\nIf you haven't played the first game yet, start there.\nIf you have, know that this might not be quite as good, but still a fun game.\nOh, and ignore Origins, that game is a mess.","September 1, 2014","true","18.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I refer to those games with sequels where everyone and you reading this, know about the terror of a brilliant game fallen in the next one, we will bang our heads against the wall saying "they should've stopped the morns" but Batman Arkham City, did just that. the made this game better then the 1st and topped it with even more gadgets, a bigger map , as well as tons of challenges, villians (such as Two-face, Penguin, the badman himself Joker and the smoking Harley ;) etc) the story continues and will make you once again sit there for hours playing this game over and over again. To everyone that wants to know about this game, I recommend buying as there are plenty of spoilers. through review. The graphics are amazing, the story-line gets better, and the DLC's are trully an amazing things, as they let you play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing.\n\nOverall I give this game 9.5/10 same as Arkham Asylum, only because it stops you from doing university work, homework, and jobs be warned lmao.","November 28, 2013","true","43.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A meticulously-detailed world, where every building, wall, and street thug tells a story, incredible characters oosing with wit and personality, and an expansion over the gameplay mechanics that made the original Arkham Asylum a classic is just the tip of the iceberg of what makes this game special. I, at the time, was convinced that Rocksteady could not have made a better game, and rewarded it a perfect score. There were no stupid bugs, glitches, or any breaks in the pacing. It was a long, meaty game that kept being at the top of its class from beginning to end.\n\nFast forward to 2016, and here I'm revisiting it again via the GOTY Edition on PC. I thought I was overhyping the game my first go-around, since it was brand new at the time, and decided to see if it still held up as highly as I once thought of it. Thankfully, good gameplay doesn't get old, and while the graphics have since been surpassed by the excellent Arkham Knight, the artistry still stands tall here. The GOTY Edition includes a variety of goodies, like costumes, new missions, and most important of them all: Catwoman.\n\nCatwoman wasn't in my original playthrough of the game, but her inclusion in this package extends the length of the overall adventure by at least a few hours. Her adventures happen during the events of the game, and the story switches perspectives between Batman and Catwoman at certain points. The Catwoman stuff isn't essential to the main story, but it is a welcome change of pace, since she controls differently and features her own set of moves. That would be the biggest reason to get the GOTY edition over the standard one, on top of a post-story mission that is also included.\n\ntl;dr Arkham City is the best Batman game I will probably ever play, and one of the best games of the seventh generation. Even half a decade later, the writing's on the wall. This is Rocksteady's magnum opus.","June 4","true","18.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is the only game in which I did not skip any cutscenes and enjoyed all of them; the script was written so excellent that you feel like they are truly talking to you. Like how Joker tries to talk to you and makes you oblivious to the tricks he has up his sleeves, or someone like Two-Face who just yells at his henchmen to blow you to bits! The gameplay is flawless and smooth without any hiccups, and it's also easy to learn for anyone new to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who likes to play video games, because not only is this a game for comic book fans but it's an game for every gamer out there. 10/10.","July 5, 2014","true","19.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game has all you want: a good main story, interesting side-quests, many of the Batman important enemies from the comics are in this game, boss battles (especially Mr. Freeze and Ra's al Ghul battles) are very well done, voice actors fit the characters very good (especially Mark Hamill voice as Joker), an awesome soundtrack, good PC optimization (this game runs on a weak laptop with high settings), and also the fighting system is perfectly done, encouraging you to use gadgets or stealth. As cons, I would have liked the city to be bigger and the game to have some events like Crime alerts from Arkham Origins.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is 9.5/10, and definitely one of the best games ever made.

Played this game so much because I really like this game.\n\nThe Arkham City Story is very interesting, the characters was played by a great cast with very good voice acting. As you progress you unlock upgrades for Batman, The side missions are amazing. The Mystery Watcher, Character Hush....\nRiddler Trophies are an interesting part of this game. Some of them require some thinking, I collected all 440 trophies.\n\nThe best part about this game I like is the combat and beating up thugs. The challenge maps are so fun. The most 2 fun challenge maps are Iceberg Lounge and Joker's Funhouse.\nIceberg Lounge has unlimited wave of enemies that you could fight as long as you survive. I once got a 1157 combo in that map.And Joker's Funhouse is also another fun map that makes you keep on playing on you start learning not to get hit and how to keep on going.\n\nI totally recommend this game, it has great graphics, very well optimized. Totally worth every dollar and penny you spend on it.","September 1, 2014","true","102.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xTheShadowReaper/recommended/200260/","xTheShadowReaper","TheShadowReaper ™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xTheShadowReaper/","213 products in account","This is an extended review on Batman: Arkham City.\n\nContent: 9/10\nWith a 15+ hours of campaign story, challenges - DLC ones included, character trophies, concept art, character bios and stories in-game which you can read or listen to and Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC (which is a 1-2 hours story for what happened after the events of the game) you have in your hands a 30+ hours (or more) of gameplay that can easily be expanded upon with the "New Game Plus" option. Plenty of value here.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThere is a small improvement over Arkham Asylum's visuals here, not that it matters though! This game is visually excellent and its strong even when you dont compare it to the prequel game. Great detail at max settings for a console port.\n\nAesthetics: 10/10\nThe gritty environment of an abandoned city-prison is perfectly caught here. There is high detail at every turn so as Batman you feel at home!\n\nSound: 9/10\n- Sound Quality: Excellent. Just that.\n- Soundtrack: The score in this game is much stonger than it was on Asylum. A lot of work and passion has been given in this division of this game. Simply put, gorgeous.\n- Lip synching: Improved since Asylum, now its one of the best out there.\n(note: I've had problems with the 7.1 sound of the game, it simply doesnt work. I had to tone it down to 5.1 through my speaker's panel. It may be just my system or my Logitech G430 but i still mention this so buyers should be aware. Research it first if you are annoyed by these kinds of problems.)\n\nPC Port: 9/10\n- Display Settings: Not only nothing is missing from the standards, such as AA, Ambient Occlusion, Dynamic Shadows etc, but there is an option for the DX11 to be fully taken advantage of, which is great for enthusiasts. Although the DX11 is fairly heavy on this game.\n- Controls: Fully rebindable keys and this time it seems they took their time to make certain actions not being binded to a key that another action is already binded to. And those who are do not make any problems in the gameplay whatsoever. Controller is completely optional here in my opinion.\n- Optimization: This game has been tested and completed using an Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 Sonic Edition. With AA set to 16Q CSAA (cause 32Q is an overkill and doesnt look much better either), Motion Blur turned off and DX11 features turned off, this game was running smoothly on max settings at 1080p 60fps. Great optimization.\n\nStory: 10/10\nAfter the events of Arkham Asylum, Harley Quinn breaks out with her "puddin" (Joker) and establish themselves in Arkham City. A city-prison in which everything goes wrong once the Joker sets foot in. Batman is there to stop the three factions from destroying themselves and Arkham City (Joker, Penguin and Two Face) when a scientist there called Hugo Strange has set in motion something called "Protocol 10". Its up to Batman to stop the madness. All of that while Catwoman tries to steal jewelry and valuables from Two Face and Hugo Strange.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n- Combat: The combat mode of Arkham CIty has been streamlined into an even smoother experience than what it was in Arkham Asylum. Its the same "Attack-Defense-Special move when ready" deal but this time its even faster, more responsive and the slew amount of Bat-gadgets that are available in this game make it an even better experience.\n- Non-Combat: This is an "Open Park" game. Meaning that the distance you have to cover is a lot more than Asylum. Dont worry though, the "Augmented Reality Training" that is available early on in the game teaches you how to make the best of your Bat-gadgets when traversing the City and they reward you with upgrades that will help you doing that. The Riddler makes a return in this game alongside his infamous riddles and trophies that you need to find. In Arkham Asylum you could just find a map and reveal everything Riddler related in your map. This time they mark certain prisoners that you can interrogate and reveal pieces of Riddler's stuff on your map. Makes you work harder for concept art and character trophies.\n- And of course the dedective mode (or thief mode when you're playing Catwoman). Useful in combat as it is out of combat. Helping you to find weaknesses in enemies or find Riddler's trophies. As with Asylum you unlock new gear while through progressing through the game, some of which are essential in order to get to some Riddler trophies.\nThe game is 90% Batman content and 10% Catwoman content. Makes for a nice change of pace and a deep breath when it happens. Bonus points for that.\n\nAll in all, Batman: Arkham City is both a great standalone game and a huge leap from Arkham Asylum, with more content, streamlined and improved gameplay and an excellent written story (for which the fanbase is devided as to which is better - Asylum or City? - pushing the boundaries right here). Full price or on a Steam sale this game is worth more than your money, but unfortunately that's all you can provide them!\n\nMy rating:\n- Must Buy <<<\n- Strongly Recommended\n- Recommended\n- Not Recommended\n- Definitely Not Recommended\n- Must Avoid","December 20, 2014","true","35.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/200260/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","508 products in account","Awesome game. Truly one of the greatest.\n\nThe controls are sharp even though you still cannot adjust the mouse sensitivity as I hoped but the camera speed is fast enough. There is still some sloppiness and slight delay when it comes to moving around. For instance just like in the first game, there are preset points where your grappling hook works - you can't pick your spots. Initially, there are too many HUD oriented hints, and even though you can turn off some, you cannot turn them all off. The game itself doesn't have that much hud especially in-doors which is a good thing in my opinion because it helps the immersion.\n\nThe city map is small. REALLY small by today's standards at least. It's at best 30 square blocks. But the good thing is that eventually you get access to restricted areas such as houses, mansions, sewers, etc. So you will be doing a lot of backtracking just like in the first game, only this time, you have an open map and not a series of large closed off areas to navigate in. Plus there is always something happening in the city and you will see the city change as you play. Barely anything is static.\n\nThe gameplay (battle-wise). I feel like it changed slightly for worst in some areas. The first game would literally force you to watch your enemies and anticipate their movies so you could counter-attack. This time it's different. This time you will see several lightening bolts flash above enemies that are about to attack you. This warning throws me off because it decreases the challenge and realism. However, if you want to play the second time on hardest mode then these warnings disappear which is neat. On the other hand, the fighting is at the same time easier than in the first game because you can actually counter-several enemies who are about to punch you at the same time - something you couldn't do in the first game.\n\nMore so, what's tedious is that this time you will be battling sometimes about a dozen of enemies at a time. You will rarely be able to finish off your enemies while they are on the ground because you will be overwhelmed for the most part. While playing the PS3 version, my thumb frequently got tired at the time of battling. But that problem when away because of simply mouse clicks which do not require as much energy as tapping a button, evidently. So I actually did not die as many times as I did while playing the PS3 version.\n\nAlso, this time if you want to counter-attack CONSTANTLY and never get hit (Except for when they try to throw a trash can at you) is to simply tap right the right mouse button (NO TIMING REQUIRED this time). In the first game if you pressed the counter-attack button a lot earlier before the preceding attack, then you would get hit, even IF you pressed the same button right after. The first game really forced you to monitor your enemies closely and work out the algorithm of the fight you were in. But at least now you can counter-attack two enemies attacking you at the same time.\n\nBut eventually you get introduced to bigger and badder high-tech enemies that force you to employ different tactics (reminiscent of the last splinter cell game).\n\nAnother minus is that there is no blood in the game, again. (but yes I know that this is Batman Universe, the villains never die, they simply escape over and over and over again....)\n\nAlso, those annoying unrealistic bats that fly around you are still there. There's still no way to turn them off.\n\nAlso, this time around, there are even more unlockables to unlock. There are still Joker teeth, but now there are Penguin's penguin dolls, air balloons and other miscellaneous interactive items that need to be destroyed upon sight.\n\nThe story is engaging and ties itself well with the first game somewhat. Some villains as well as their demise gets mentioned so it's kind of cool to wonder what happened. The boss fights are okaish but the one that I didn't like was with that immortal dude. I mean the whole stage with him and the subsequent fight was just an excuse for Batman to fight some more (even though he was dreaming). Same applies tot he Mad Hatter stage of the game, it's just more fighting, albeit it is disturbing fighting. I think they could use more creativity with these stages. One of the best boss fights without a doubt is with Mr. Freeze, it can last for up to 20 minutes and you do have to use your brains. Sadly, that was the most developed boss battle in the entire game.\n\nAlso, barely ANY dialogue gets repeated, ever, except for sometimes. I'm surprised how much effort went into dialogue here, it's like watching a movie, a good Batman movie that is, ahem ahem.\n\nThe loading screen sometimes takes 11 seconds.\n\nI also appreciate the remix of the Hans Zimmer soundtracks from the last two Batman movies. Nice touch. There's some inception there too.\n\nThe bosses and the characters are all so versatile and flamboyant. You get fully immersed in their personalities and you don't really want the villains dead you may want them hurt but you don't want them GONE because then you know that the fun is over. So the game makes you care even about the villains because aside from Batman that's what the Batman Universe if famous for. However, you do not really get to see too much of the villains. You only see the Two-Face a couple of times and you do not even see Killer Croc.\n\nThe amount of the Riddler riddles and tricks is insane. I'm not sure if that many were needed. I mean, they are supposed to be concealed better; they are supposed to take time to find and unlock like in the first game. Here you get a large portion of them practically for free, but as you progress you realize that Batman has a whopping 400 riddler secrets to unlock and the cat woman has 100. A small portion of them (like 5-10%) is extremely hard to solve, some require blind luck which is annoying.\n\nThe game is extremely well refined. Ever step and area is thought out, every engagement can still be approached differently so the gameplay will never get you bored. The artistic value of this game cannot be understated. The gangs and the bandits all have different allegiances to different villains, so it is a nice touch to see that not all villains team up with each other, they all have different missions and ideologies.\n\nThe amount of upgrades here is about 3-4 times than the amount in the first game and you retain most if not all of your abilities from the first game.\n\nOne of the downsides of this game being an open-worlded game is that quite often you will lose your sense of direction. You might weight out your priorities as to where it is you want to go. There's main mission and there are side missions and there are Riddler missions and there are miscellaneous missions. You might go into one direction only to realize that it's best if you went another direction. The first game didn't have that problem if you can call it that. Still, the world is not too big for you to get lost and it is not too small to be called a sand-box.\n\nOne of the downsides of the PS3 version was slow texture loading. I haven't experienced anything like that on PC. AND, the loading time between deaths is about twice as short as on the PS3, go figure.\n\nLastly, it's the same unreal engine from the last game; the water looks slightly better rendered on the PC, but it is not that great looking either.","November 27, 2013","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The negative ones obviously are complaints that their PC can't handle the graphics.....or they're stuck in some part of the game and so it's the game's fault.\n\nI think this is the best of the Arkham games. I've played 3.\n\nThere have been numerous times I thought I wouldn't figure out parts of this game, It's one challenge after another. That's why it's the best.\n\nI played a lot of the game on console back when it came out. I think I gave up somewhere in the riddler part. That, to me, is the most frustrating part.\nIt isn't an easy game. But, there's so much to do, that it's worth every penny and all the frustration.\n\n\nI'm finisahing this game this time around. Also, I wannna meet the girl they used to model catwoman. Sheeesh. That's one hot looking character.\n\nDoes anyone know why credits roll at 35%? Is it just that that part of the Joker story  as written and designed separately?\n\nDoesn't matter. Once you beat the Joker at 35%, you get the downloadable batsuits to play the rest.\nAnd there's A LOT more.\n\nAll the best villians make an appearance. A few for just a few minutes.\n\nI haven't finished this game ever. So, I hear someone in game say "there's two Jokers? "\n\nDoes that mean anything? I don't know yet. I'm busy trying to find Mr. Freeze's wife.....while trying to solve several murders and riddles galore.\n\nTotally addictive game......even the 2nd time around. I'm finding new stories and characters at every turn. Who is the mysterious figure watching Batman's every move?I saw Robin for a minute. Is he coming back?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/200260/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","How have I not reviewed this yet?\n\nArkham City is the sequel to Arkham Asylum, which was an excellent game itself.  I said a lot of great things about that game, and Arkham City improves on pretty much everything.\n\nFirst, the combat.  The combat in Arkham Asylum was okay, but had some awkwardness.  This game is a little more forgiving and far more fluid when fighting, you'll notice the difference immediately if you've played the original game.  This along with a whole lot of new moves and better combos means fighting is more fun and interesting, and feels less stiff.\n\nWhile Arkham Asylum took place on an island divided into three areas that loaded separately and were connected by passages, Arkham City takes a different approach to make it feel more like an open world.  The entire exterior map acts as one large area, and you can move freely across it, even though overall it is larger than the entire map of Arkham Asylum.  Interior areas still load separately, but the outside has eliminated loading screens and connector areas entirely.  It makes moving through Arkham City seamless.\n\nEven better, with the improved controls, it is now possible to travel through the entire game world using glide without ever touching the ground.  It's amazing thing to see.  The glide system was overhauled, allowing new actions during gliding, such as diving, giving Batman near-flight powers.  The grapnel gun was also upgraded, with a boost mechanism that instead of pulling you to a location allows you to gain momentum and shoot out into the sky.  The grapnel gun can easily be used in mid-glide, now.  This makes travelling around the city both exciting and easy, instead of tedious.\n\nAnother nice touch is the addition of another character.  In the storyline (Game of the Year Edition), the plot alternates between Batman and Catwoman, both are playable.  Catwoman's moves are completely different from Batman's, which makes a nice change.  Unfortunately, for most of the game the switching is mandatory, meaning you have to finish a Catwoman segment to continue as Batman, and the transitions between the characters are cliffhangers.  Eventually, you will get the option to switch back and forth between them.\n\nThe story is excellent, and plays into the foreshadowing in Arkham Asylum.  The Warden, Quincy Sharpe, is now the mayor of Gotham, and following Joker's takeover of Arkham, ordered both the Asylum and Blackgate shut down, and a rundown section of Gotham was designated a maximum security prison, the new Arkham City.  This setting means most of Batman's regular foes can all be running loose in one crime-infested area, with no one to stop them, which gives villains like Penguin and Two-Face a lot of time to shine after being left out of the previous game.  Joker and Harley Quinn remain the biggest threat to Batman, but something strange is going on with Joker.  Few people have actually seen him, and rumor is that he is very ill after the Arkham Asylum incident.  But Joker is not the only mastermind in Arkham City, not in the least.\n\nThe ending is stunning.  I was shocked.  I won't spoil it.  All I will say is I won't hear the song "Only You" the same ever again.\n\nI know I used a lot of words, but I didn't come close to talking about everything good about this game.  It really is great.  Definitely recommended.","August 29, 2014","true","62.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game essentially takes place at night, and the lighting looks great. It felt very immersive and I rarely felt like something was just a texture or polygon (a problem i have with most games i.e. Bioshock Infinite)\n\nGameplay is part fantastic brawler, and part stealth action. Traversing the open world is grappling and gliding (with some climbing if you feel like it); this system worked way better than i expected.\nBrawling is smooth and can be difficult.\nYou have many gadgets at your disposal, and the stealth really makes you feel like the Bat. Swooping down at taking out a baddie, then 5 seconds later drop another enemy on the other side of the room really makes you feel powerful.\n\nEven if you are powerful, Batman is far from invincible; guns do a lot of damage, so you have to plan each move. While you have a lot of gadgets, its all non-lethal, and the non-lethal aspect can make the game more difficult than other stealth games where you can just shoot baddies in the head from cover. The game makes you become Batman. It captures the essence of Batman more than i could have hoped.\n\nCatwoman and others have their distance combat and movement styles, this keeps the game very interesting.\n\nThe only gripes i have: In one scene Batman is coughing, the same audio clip is played over and over. This like a minute of the game, a really minor detail. The other gripe is the line-launcher. Its a late-story gadget, and it can be very janky. After all the other gadgets doing what you want them to, the line-laucher can be finicky and i had to keep retrying a couple platforming parts.\n\nVoice acting is great, story is great, open world is great, gameplay is great, graphics are great, music is great.\nWhy are you still reading this, just play this game (when it goes on sale for 5$ you have no reason to not buy it)","October 5, 2014","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mowshu/recommended/200260/","mowshu","«mowshu»","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mowshu/","267 products in account","Batman: Arkham City GOTY is a open world 3rd person beat 'em up, the sequel to Batman: Arkham Asylum. I had a lot of fun playing it, and it was an unique experience.\n\nThe whole Arkham City is used as a prison. The city is big, and looks amazing, each area is unique and beautiful, from Selina Kyle's apartment with her cats out of the window, to a frozen police and a clown infested steel meel. You will glide from place to place, leap, climb, dive kick enemies, and use your grapling hook to climb from rooftop to rooftop. The most of enemies are in the streets, there are new villains and almost all of them have their own gang. The enemies are different, from brawlers, gun wielders, armored brawlers to snipers, knife wielders, shielded brawlers and stun batoners. Batman just has one attack button to use and Batman will do all of the punching, kicks, sweeps and brawling himself. There is seriously an incredible amount of attacks, finishing moves, counters, etc. you will enjoy fighting even the weakest foe. You can also counter incoming enemy attacks, some enemies need to be stunned, or a special move to be killed. The gun users are the harderst, because you will die quickly if they start shooting at you, here is where the stealth comes in. You have to climb to high places, hide in grates, or just corner cover and silently assassinate every one of the thugs. The AI of the gunners is great, they'll patrol, warn others when they find a downed ally. In combat, you can also use batarangs, shock blasts, freeze grenades and other useful gadgets, but not only in combat, these gadgets are used to help you progress further and solve puzzles.  Multiple batterangs, remote control batterangs, to help you hit things you can't normally reach, a zip-line, explosive gel, a grappling hook to rip down high up grates, a new smoke bomb to hide when you've been spotted, freeze grenades, which are good for floating through the sewers, an electricity gun for powering devices like garage doors, a hacking device to break into security and also detective mode that lets you see hints, such as highlighting enemies, seeing them through objects, lit up gargoyles you can grapple onto, doors, grates, footprints, sniper rifle trajectories and the Riddler's riddle. During your adventure you will also play as Catwoman, which I find very interesting and fun, she has a very fast paced combat, she uses her whip to get around, also climb walls and ceiling, and she has new unique gadgets. Everything is fully voiced, every NPC, villain, thug, Batman and Catwoman. You'll hear thugs discussing things, along with radio transmissions every so often. The main quests took around 14h for me to complete, which I think its an ok amount of time, but keep in mind there are side quests too which are very good and take much more to complete, they feel like extra storylines and also many Riddler trophies and challanges to complete, also very well detailed. There is also the Riddler Challange mode, which are challenge rooms like the first game had. Combat rooms where you get a high score beating up waves enemies, ''predator maps'' that require you to take out gunmen in specific ways to beat the challenges and even downloadable challenge rooms, mini campaigns and even a make your own challenge map where you chose a map and select goals. You'll also get to select your character from Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing with costumes to choose from. This also comes with Harley Quinn's revenge DLC, for 1-2 extra hours where you play as Batman and Robin, a quick good story.\n\nThe graphics look really good, and with many awesome details, the story is also really interesting. The soundrack is great, and so is the voice acting. There are many voice acting stars such as: the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker  Kevin Conroy as Batman, and Tara Strong, Nolan North and Maurice LaMarce.\n\nI strongly recommend this game, great combat system, great story, soundtrack, voice acting and graphics 10/10.","September 30, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Batman's glider combined with the grappling hook makes the parkour in this game extremely fun.  Overall, this game was enjoyable and I had fun playing the 16 hours that I logged.\n\nAlso, the team that created the animations for this game is amazing.

With interesting boss fights (a nice upgrade from the first game), a very slick and balanced gameplay that manages to balance stealthy segments with more action-packed ones, and great visual identity, Arkham City establishes itself as a solid AAA title that follows in the footsteps of its predecessor for great results.  The game is filled to the brim with content ; while the main story can be beaten in about 15 hours, the many sidequests and collectibles will grab dedicated players' attention. Also worth noting are the numerous iconic characters from the Batman lore that make an appearance, whether during the main storyline or during sidequests. This will most certainly satisfy hardcore fans of the franchise, while being a great way to introduce newcomers, as each appearing character is given a biography that the player can read at any time.\n\nThe elements that disappointed me were the simplistic combat system (not really improved since the previous title), the upgrades that sometimes felt like they were only useful for one specific situation ; and the story, while more developed than in the previous title, did not quite make up for the slightly underwhelming and subdued overall atmosphere that clashed with the oppressive, almost intoxicating setting of Arkham Asylum. All in all, Batman Arkham City is really enjoyable, and although it is not revolutionary by any means, I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone with as much as a passing interest in the Batman universe.","October 18, 2014","true","55.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/200260/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","I absolutely loved Batman: Arkham Asylum. It was a spectacular look into the asylum itself, a location that stole the show, transformed and twisted by the inmates over the course of the game and providing ample room to explore. The plot wasn't groundbreaking, but it was great, and the spectacular returns of Animated Series cast members were accompanied by other great performances across the board. Most importantly, it gave the player an experience no other game could attest to: The feeling of becoming The Bat, learning his methods and feeling the tension he never expresses. When I heard about Arkham City, I doubted that a sequel could do it justice.\n\nThose doubts have been blasted out of the frikkin' water.\n\nThe mere concept of Arkham City as a location cleverly serves several purposes: The reasons you'll uncover over the course of the game, a chance to explore much of Gotham City while staying in criminal territory, a way to bring together enemies both criminally insane and just downright criminal, and a warning that this is all-new, untrodden territory. Sure, there are a ton of thematic illusions to classic Batman works, as in Asylum, but while Asylum stuck to a composite of other works, City creates a new blend of characters all its own, and does quite well in doing so. A lot of characters we write off nowadays as pathetic jokes are brought back up to the terrifying, vicious foes they're meant to be.\n\nThe vocal talents on display here are fantastic once again, although I personally got a little annoyed at Nolan North voicing every other goon. (To be fair, he does an excellent job as Penguin. I just feel the lack of vocal variety for enemies stands out.) I was disappointed to hear that Arleen wasn't voicing Harley this time around, but Tara Strong takes the role and runs with it like it was hers from the start. Everyone on the cast slips into these roles quite naturally.\n\nAnyways! Combat is quite well evolved from Arkham Asylum, and just as thrilling as before. The "quickfire" options took me quite a while to actually figure out, though, and I only understood how to do the knife counters until after completing the story (and all side missions (besides the AR stuff but we'll get to that later)). Stealth segments didn't feel quite as interesting to me as before, but that might just be nostalgia goggles and a bit of repetitive choices on my part.\n\nThe side missions are quite engaging and presented in a reasonably organic manner. I would go as far as to say that the only missions that legitimately suck and are never fun are the AR Training challenges. Finish the first four early on, get your Grapnel Boost upgrade, and don't even bother with the other ones. They are not worth the frustration.\n\nBoss battles were one thing that Arkham Asylum sucked at. They are noticably better here, with the exception of one that reminded me of a certain infuriating duo in the first game. Here, it's frustrating due to a particular environmental hazard that you WILL hit. Upgrade your health early.\n\nAs far as the Game of the Year content goes, there's some new challenge maps, some costumes, and most importantly, extra characters. Unlike what you might expect, they all play very distinctly from one another, and Catwoman takes center stage a few times in the main plot in this version. Her role provides a refreshing change of pace every now and then.\n\nThey heavily advertise the addition of a new story mode called "Harley Quinn's Revenge". That is not really the strong point of this version. It's more of a neat little extra for when you've finished pretty much everything else and would like to see a little more story. It's like an OVA: It's a nice extra to have if you really, really want more, but it doesn't fundamentally change much. I would've at least hoped for more focus on Robin in it, but nope. Back to The Bat in short order.\n\nIn short, excellent detail, intriguing plot, fantastic gameplay, and a spectacular Batman experience all-round, with most issues arising in tacked-on extras that shouldn't hamper the core experience much for you.","November 13, 2013","true","88.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Batman soon learns of "Protocol 10", which Strange says will make him famous. Batman begins his quest to stop Hugo Strange and his Protocol 10 to save Gotham city. Notable villains include:\n-Hugo Strange\n-Two-Face\n-Penguin\n-Mr. Freeze\n-Ra's al-Ghul\n-Joker\nAll of the characters are very well done with phenomenal voice acting. Most notably are Batman voiced by Kevin Conroy and Joker voiced by Mark Hamill (HEEEEEEHEHEEhehehee AHAAAAAAAAAHHHHAAAAhooo HA HEHEEE heee heee)\n\nGameplay:\nYou will spend the majority of the game as the Dark Knight himself, and there's a reason he is "The most dangerous man in the world", as Superman once said. The gameplay can be split into four basic categories:\n\nBatman is a master of all forms of martial arts, and it shows. The combat is focused on a free-flow brawl which utilizes combos after 8 uninterrupted moves and is very responsive and satisfying. The right click to counter system works very well and is very enjoyable to play.\n\nHe is the Dark Knight for a reason after all. Not all thugs are simply using their fists to try and beat you to death, some have found that bullets are far more effective. Now begins the stealth portions of the game, which are just as fun as the brawling. Stealth focuses around Takedowns. Takedowns can be silent, loud, terrifying, and much more. The thugs in the room have a very realistic reaction to things. I love (perhaps a bit too much) terrorizing thugs as I zip around, breaking more than a few of their bones.\n\nArkham City is a big place, and the sidewalk just ain't gonna cut it. Batman uses the Batclaw (his grapple gun) to zip around Arkham City in a very enjoyable manner. He can also use his cape to glide around like the bat he is. Parkour in the game is also very well done: not very complicated, but very effective.\n\nAnd of course, what would Batman be without his toolbelt? At your disposal are all sorts of gadgets available to the Bat at any time. These gadgets range from the Batclaw, smoke pellets, explosive gel, and the classic Batarang. His gadgets are all unique in their own way, each with their own puprose and all very useful.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game has great graphics and the in game cutscenes transition very well to actual gameplay. I don't have much else to say, I'm not a graphics guy.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. When I got it I didn't expect to play it that much. I don't like fighting games all too much. After 5 hours (straight) of "I'M BATMAN" I changed my mind.\n\n\nAlso:\nI'M BATMAN","January 30, 2015","true","48.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

You get the chance to play Batman and Catwoman in Arkham City; a prison fortress controlled by Hugo Strange. Besides Hugo Strange, you’ll run into other Batman’s foes however I won’t give list the names since it will spoil the story.\n\nPlaying Batman is fantastic. You got access to Batman’s gadgets that will help him in any errand he’s in and let’s not forget his cape. The game takes place in an abandoned city so you’ll get the chance to glide with minimum sound and attack the thugs by stealth. There are a lot of stealth methods to be applied so it’s about planning attacks. Sometimes I improvised to make it more authentic and that was such a cool experience! This game is the sequel to Batman - Arkham Asylum so I suggest trying that game as well.\n\nPeace.","December 5, 2013","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/200260/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","I absolutely loved Batman: Arkham Asylum. It was a spectacular look into the asylum itself, a location that stole the show, transformed and twisted by the inmates over the course of the game and providing ample room to explore. The plot wasn't groundbreaking, but it was great, and the spectacular returns of Animated Series cast members were accompanied by other great performances across the board. Most importantly, it gave the player an experience no other game could attest to: The feeling of becoming The Bat, learning his methods and feeling the tension he never expresses. When I heard about Arkham City, I doubted that a sequel could do it justice.\n\nThose doubts have been blasted out of the frikkin' water.\n\nThe mere concept of Arkham City as a location cleverly serves several purposes: The reasons you'll uncover over the course of the game, a chance to explore much of Gotham City while staying in criminal territory, a way to bring together enemies both criminally insane and just downright criminal, and a warning that this is all-new, untrodden territory. Sure, there are a ton of thematic illusions to classic Batman works, as in Asylum, but while Asylum stuck to a composite of other works, City creates a new blend of characters all its own, and does quite well in doing so. A lot of characters we write off nowadays as pathetic jokes are brought back up to the terrifying, vicious foes they're meant to be.\n\nThe vocal talents on display here are fantastic once again, although I personally got a little annoyed at Nolan North voicing every other goon. (To be fair, he does an excellent job as Penguin. I just feel the lack of vocal variety for enemies stands out.) I was disappointed to hear that Arleen wasn't voicing Harley this time around, but Tara Strong takes the role and runs with it like it was hers from the start. Everyone on the cast slips into these roles quite naturally.\n\nAnyways! Combat is quite well evolved from Arkham Asylum, and just as thrilling as before. The "quickfire" options took me quite a while to actually figure out, though, and I only understood how to do the knife counters until after completing the story (and all side missions (besides the AR stuff but we'll get to that later)). Stealth segments didn't feel quite as interesting to me as before, but that might just be nostalgia goggles and a bit of repetitive choices on my part.\n\nThe side missions are quite engaging and presented in a reasonably organic manner. I would go as far as to say that the only missions that legitimately suck and are never fun are the AR Training challenges. Finish the first four early on, get your Grapnel Boost upgrade, and don't even bother with the other ones. They are not worth the frustration.\n\nBoss battles were one thing that Arkham Asylum sucked at. They are noticably better here, with the exception of one that reminded me of a certain infuriating duo in the first game. Here, it's frustrating due to a particular environmental hazard that you WILL hit. Upgrade your health early.\n\nAs far as the Game of the Year content goes, there's some new challenge maps, some costumes, and most importantly, extra characters. Unlike what you might expect, they all play very distinctly from one another, and Catwoman takes center stage a few times in the main plot in this version. Her role provides a refreshing change of pace every now and then.\n\nThey heavily advertise the addition of a new story mode called "Harley Quinn's Revenge". That is not really the strong point of this version. It's more of a neat little extra for when you've finished pretty much everything else and would like to see a little more story. It's like an OVA: It's a nice extra to have if you really, really want more, but it doesn't fundamentally change much. I would've at least hoped for more focus on Robin in it, but nope. Back to The Bat in short order.\n\nIn short, excellent detail, intriguing plot, fantastic gameplay, and a spectacular Batman experience all-round, with most issues arising in tacked-on extras that shouldn't hamper the core experience much for you.","November 13, 2013","true","88.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After years and years pass by, there's nothing else could replace it in the throne of my heart.

I found myself really enjoy it as if I have never played it before...can you believe it? :)\n\nBatman Arkham City itself is immortal, it will last decades untill someone re-make it with advanced graphics using the modernest digital technology in the future.\n\nEven if no one is doing so, the outstanding driven-story, multiple gameplay system, herotic comic characters, exquisite art design, epic soundtrack...oh, boy, they will last forever.\n\nThe only bad thing about this games is: "There isn't anything bad about it at all"\n\nP.S Arkham City Soundtrack Main theme still is the hottest soundtrack of all times in Itunes Store, AC Collector's Editions sell a lot each day on Amazon after it reaches its "life-time", if it isn't a legend, what is it?\n\nScarlet's Score: 9.6/10","July 9, 2013","true","82.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well let me break down some details for you.\n\na.Story\nThe story of Batman has never been this frustrating. On the first series, Batman has been made confused by the infamous evil Joker's plan. Doctor Hugo Strange, Ra's al Ghul, and once again, Joker, put him on hard times even more than ever where he has to put down the chaos made in Arkham City in. Very interesting and engaging.\n\nb.Gameplay\nWe know that Batman, among the Justice League, is the weakest. But, in the game he actually a badass. The free flow combat system makes him really strong and gives an awesome feeling when you hit the last enemy within a combo chain. You can also access many gadgets the dark knight can offer. Fantasy of being the bat came true.\n\nc.Graphics\nI really like look of the game. The aura of Arkham City nightmare is felt really well. Atmosphere of injustice brings down upon the chaotic city of Arkham. What I like the most is that it can run on my computer very well with almost no performance issues.\n\nd.Replayability\nIt is always good to back as "The Dark Knight". You can choose different customisation (character upgrade) from previous playthrough and try to play the hardest difficulty. Well, if you don't fancy yourself challenge modes, have yourself a new game plus.\n\nVerdict\nIt is the best Batman game, beating bad guys on the streets in the most dangerous area out there in the world to bring justice is very noble.\n\nVerdict\n9.0","December 10, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main story is cool, the Riddler expanded his operation (there are now 440 items/puzzles between Batman and Catwoman), and actually shows up in person. Pretty much every major Batman villain shows up and has stuff for you to do, either as part of the main story or as their own set of side quests.\n\nThe challenge mode expanded. There is a campaign mode that picks a few challenges for you to do consecutively, with small changes to make things easier or harder, (e.g. no silent takedowns, or batarangs that KO instantly), or you can pick your own group of challenges. There's also a mission that just throws thugs at you until you die, which is great fun.\n\nRobin and Nightwing are really fun to use, but it's unfortunate that they can't fly around the city like Batman and Catwoman can. Robin is at least playable in the Harley DLC, but Nightwing is restricted to challenge mode.\n\nRE: Harley DLC\nIt was cool, though you can't freeroam with Robin, and I thought Harley's voice was pretty shrill at times.\n\ntl;dr\nEverything was improved upon, 10/10, GOTY, etc.","January 13, 2014","true","94.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What I like the most is that it can run on my computer very well with almost no performance issues.\n\nd.Replayability\nIt is always good to back as "The Dark Knight". You can choose different customisation (character upgrade) from previous playthrough and try to play the hardest difficulty. Well, if you don't fancy yourself challenge modes, have yourself a new game plus.\n\nVerdict\nIt is the best Batman game, beating bad guys on the streets in the most dangerous area out there in the world to bring justice is very noble.\n\nVerdict\n9.0","December 10, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main story is cool, the Riddler expanded his operation (there are now 440 items/puzzles between Batman and Catwoman), and actually shows up in person. Pretty much every major Batman villain shows up and has stuff for you to do, either as part of the main story or as their own set of side quests.\n\nThe challenge mode expanded. There is a campaign mode that picks a few challenges for you to do consecutively, with small changes to make things easier or harder, (e.g. no silent takedowns, or batarangs that KO instantly), or you can pick your own group of challenges. There's also a mission that just throws thugs at you until you die, which is great fun.\n\nRobin and Nightwing are really fun to use, but it's unfortunate that they can't fly around the city like Batman and Catwoman can. Robin is at least playable in the Harley DLC, but Nightwing is restricted to challenge mode.\n\nRE: Harley DLC\nIt was cool, though you can't freeroam with Robin, and I thought Harley's voice was pretty shrill at times.\n\ntl;dr\nEverything was improved upon, 10/10, GOTY, etc.","January 13, 2014","true","94.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played it at least two times when it came out.\n\nIn the following text, I'll be comparing it to Arkham Asylum a lot, so excuse me, if you haven't played it yet.\nFirst thing that got me when I started Arkham City were the graphics, definitely better than those in Arkham Asylum. And also the nice cutscene right at the beginning. Then I started playing it. It was and still is the exact same game, according to the gameplay. Only the story and setting are different, alas both above average. I enjoyed playing both, as I have loved Batman ever since I was a small kid. But I liked Arkham Asylum a lot more. It had this dark, gritty tone which Arkham City lacks most of the time. And it also had these crazy hallucinatory Scarecrow- missions. Ah, and also highly memorable, the moment when you thought the game had broken. To me, Arkham Asylum will always be the definitive Batman game. It may not have a world as open as in Arkham City, it may not be as long, but it is atmospheric as f**k.\n\nStill, I give Arkham City\n8/10\nenjoy it","February 19","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat system is obviously similar to Asylum, but with a little more kick in it. The story is what is amazing here though. The writing in Arkham City and character development is even more embraced than the Nolan films.\n\nYou are Batman (obviously), well you actually start as Bruce Wayne getting captured and sent to Arkham City for being opposed to TYGER, since AC is currently controlled by criminals as all this stuff has happened. But you get your gear soon after and the show begins.\n\nFirst of all, the city is gorgeous, stunning, beautiful, even though the only time is night time. You can glide around and climb all over the place, the free roam is simply riveting. I couldn't have enjoyed a Batman game more than ever.\n\nThe plot is intricate, but essentially, it becomes known that Joker is dying from an illness from the Titan formula. You investigate and do a bunch of crime fighting while running into various foes........there are enemies everywhere, just put it like that.\n\n9.5/10","September 26, 2013","true","28.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything that made the original game a great experience has been expanded and improved upon, thus making this game one of the best action adventure games you could ever spend your time playing.\n\nThe freeflow combat system that was so satisfying the first time around has been majorly upgraded and now features an impressive amount of ways to stun and cripple whoever dares to stand in your way. Batman\'s collection of gadgets has also been expanded, with each one having applications in combat and puzzle-solving scenarios. Predator encounters have also seen a boost in excitement as there are now a more ways to takedown your foes, but also more ways to be caught by them. The addition of more playable characters is also a great benefit, as each one plays slightly differently, yet consistently satisfyingly.\n\nYou will also find yourself fighting a larger variety enemies this time around too, as the game introduces deadlier foes like snipers, armored goons, and blade wielding ninjas. And even more exciting is the larger variety of super villains that you'll find yourself at odds, and sometimes evens, with. A large portion of Batman's rogues gallery is on display here and the ways in which you\'ll face these enemies are as varied as they thrilling. Sometimes there will be a complex and intense battle that must be fought with hard fists, while other times a sharp detective\'s mind and keen puzzle-solving skills will be needed.\n\nThe most obvious expansion to the game is of course its world design. Whereas Arkham Asylum saw you making your way through the interesting and somewhat linear titular location, Arkham City sees you gliding through the snow covered streets of Gotham City itself, or at least a decent portion of it. It is amazingly detailed and diverse in its depiction and thanks to all the riddles that need solving, those who wish to explore it will be rewarded with interesting stories that give each location, as well as the entire game\'s story, an impressive amount of context.\n\nAnd when speaking about the story I wish to say is that this one\'s is excellent. It starts with a flawless beginning that doesn\'t directly follow Arkham Asylum\'s ending, but provides enough information that you feel as though it almost does. This level of excellence then continues all the way through to the end of the main story, finishes off with quite the show. The characters, from the good to the bad, are each compelling in their own right and even though it\'s satisfying to be victorious over them, it\'s usually a bittersweet victory because your experience with them is over. Throw in the fact that Catwoman has her own separate storyline that weaves in and out of the main one, and you\'ve got a narrative that is varied in its perspective and tone. My only true gripe is that there isn\'t a concluding story moment that plays out once you\'ve completed every task that you can do. You\'re just left to free roam the map, wondering what to do with yourself. However there is an epilogue chapter which heavily features Robin, and while its inclusion does help relieve some feelings of story abandonment, it ultimately still leaves you wanting more.\n\nBatman Arkham City is simply put, a major advancement, in almost every way over its predecessor. Almost every functioning part of this game has been improved from the previous Arkham game, and it is undeniably apparent. It is also obvious that huge amount of hard work and reverence for the Dark Knight that went it to creating this game. And in total, I truly believe it to be a work of interactive art.","June 1","true","32.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It could take an hour just to clean out your inventory or work out what upgrades you want to make to your character and so it makes it hard for me to get into these games from the start.\n\nBatman: Arkham City doesn't suffer these problems and while the open world is small compared with 2016's standards it holds up well design wise and is filled with things to do if you want to stray away from the main story. In an hour you could meet and take down a new adversary, complete a good portion of the main story, complete a good few side quests, find and solve plenty of riddler trophies/riddles and the list goes on from there.\n\nI will probably never 100% finish this game because that involves tedious hunting and solving of riddles and collectibles but the main story and a lot of the side quests in it are really good and the characters and voice acting are well portrayed in 99% of cases.\n\nIf you enjoy batman, superheroes or enjoyed Arkham Asylum and want some more then i definitely recommend this to you!

In fact Batman Arkham City goes beyond Arkham Asylum.\n\n+++Pros+++- The Story. It Goes On Exactly from where Asylum ended, and it's so well orchestrated, by involving many characters, old and new ones, and giving them their own situations and fitting context. The story is so great, full of Turning points with one of the greatest ends ever possible.\n- Gameplay. Absolutely fun, following the style of Asylum, this time we can also fly through the whole city... Absolutely the best.\n- Secondary Missions are nice and fun, they have some depth, some story, so you do have a reason to play them. Especially the Riddler, one of the best villain in these games, in my opinion... Seriously (Why so serious? XD)\n- Characters. It's amazing how many famous characters are involved in the story: old ones, new ones... And Being a Generic Comic fan And batman reader I admit I didn't know anything About Hugo Strange. This made me read more (and enjoy the game more, somehow)\n- Endless References, cameos and homages to batman's and DC's universe\n- Those damn riddles are more difficult in this chapter... XD\n- Playable Catwoman Sidestory. It wasn't much, but it was a very nice addition that gave some variety to the game.\n- Nice Soundtrack\n\n---Cons---- Key Bindings in a pre-Game Window only? in 2012? Seriously? Again? This reminds me of Need For Speed... 3... 1998... and that was for graphic selection (software or 3dfx), the keys were editable ingame... 1998... Ridiculous considering the great results of the game itself.\n- Those damn riddles are more difficult in this chapter...

I haven't played Arkham Asylum, so I can't make a comparison between two.  It wouldn't make sense to compare it to the other Batman game I played, Batman NES by Sunsoft.  The game takes place in Arkham City, a new super prison set up in walled off section of Gotham containing the area where Bruce Wayne's parents were gunned down by Joe Chill.  As Batman you fight to uncover the truth behind the walls of this new super prison.  You can also play at Catwoman during the campaign.  The game features challenge maps where you play as Batman in different skins, such as the Animated Series Batman and Batman Beyond.  You can also play a few different characters.  There is an add-on campaign called Harley Quinn's revenge where you reprise your role as Batman not that long after the events of the main campaign.\n\nThe "Free Flow" combat system carries on from the previous installment, which allows for more dynamic hand to hand combat or Bat vs Gun combat.  As you land consecutive hits the combo meter increases and the more hits you can land without getting hurt or taking too long to get another hit, the more experience points you get.  You use the experience points to level up your armor for both Batman and Catwoman.  You can also unlock extra gadgets, improve your gadgets, and you can improve your combat skills with special takedowns or moves.  There are other factors that goes into your XP gains.  There are bonuses for using different gadgets during combat, such as the Bat-a-rang, the Batclaw, etc.  There is also an "intimidation bonus" where taking out thugs through stealth and concealment.  Once you get down to the last thug standing or if you are only fighting one thug you are granted a slow-mo take down where you can look at the painful last hit thrown by Batman or Catwoman(the nutshots are painful to watch).  Honestly, the combat can get a little boring but the takedowns are satisfying.  You can counter enemy attacks with default RMB, if you see little blue lines above an enemies head they are about to try to hit you.  You block multiple enemy attacks by pressing the RMB the number of times there are people about to try to hit you.\nThe graphics are fantastic, but there are some glitches, but overall it is pretty well put together.  There are times where you can tell that it was ported, but don't let that fool you, it is still a great game.  The voice acting is superb, the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill aka Luke Skywalker.  Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, the same man behind the Animated Series's Batman.  I never found any dull voice acting, even the minor characters were well done.  The game can last pretty long if you go for the side-quests, especially getting all the Riddler trophies without looking up hints.  Overall, I give it a 9/10, it is a great game once you get past some of the glitches, but for me I never had any problems with it except for some long load times at some points.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.","August 7, 2014","true","61.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

There are bonuses for using different gadgets during combat, such as the Bat-a-rang, the Batclaw, etc.  There is also an "intimidation bonus" where taking out thugs through stealth and concealment.  Once you get down to the last thug standing or if you are only fighting one thug you are granted a slow-mo take down where you can look at the painful last hit thrown by Batman or Catwoman(the nutshots are painful to watch).  Honestly, the combat can get a little boring but the takedowns are satisfying.  You can counter enemy attacks with default RMB, if you see little blue lines above an enemies head they are about to try to hit you.  You block multiple enemy attacks by pressing the RMB the number of times there are people about to try to hit you.\nThe graphics are fantastic, but there are some glitches, but overall it is pretty well put together.  There are times where you can tell that it was ported, but don't let that fool you, it is still a great game.  The voice acting is superb, the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill aka Luke Skywalker.  Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, the same man behind the Animated Series's Batman.  I never found any dull voice acting, even the minor characters were well done.  The game can last pretty long if you go for the side-quests, especially getting all the Riddler trophies without looking up hints.  Overall, I give it a 9/10, it is a great game once you get past some of the glitches, but for me I never had any problems with it except for some long load times at some points.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.","August 7, 2014","true","61.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I have a lot of hours on the PS3 version i just recently decided to get the PC version. I have to honestly say this is one of the best games I have played in a while. Everything about this game i just love about it. The combat feels great. And I love the story of the Arkham games and this one to me doesnt dissappoint me at all. The pc port of this game feels like a really good port despite the specs i have i still can run this game rather well and still have a wonderful time with it. And like with the other Arkham games the riddler is here and boy are there a lot of stuff to do with especially since this is the Game Of The Year edition.\n\nNow I'm gonna talk about the combat. If you have played either Arkham Asylum or Orgins then the combat will feel the same. Arkham city's combat really feels perfect i can't really find a fault with it. If you have ever played sleeping dogs then this combat will feel the same.\n\nNow about the riddler there are a lot of riddles and riddler trophies to collect since this is the GOTY edition. If you enjoyed getting all of them in Asylum/Origins then you will enjoy getting them here. Now i haven't gotten all of them yet on the PS3 version but i do plan on getting all of them on here.\n\nIll try to get talk about some of the story. The story begins with Catwomen trying to steal from Two-Face but then gets caught then the game cuts to bruce wayne getting shocked by Hugo Strange then a flashback happens and shows Bruce at the gates of Arkham City's gate saying how Arkham city is destorying the fine city of Gotham and he wants it shut down then he gets captured. Fast forward to bruce getting shocked and hugo strange saying how by the end of the night he will be a hero thanks to protocol 10. Its up to you Batman to figure out what protocol 10 is and shut it down before its too late.\n\nAnd one last thing the music Oh my god is it amazing. Every track fits what is going on. Buy the soundtrack if you love it. The soundtrack can be found on itunes.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 9/10. It is an amazing game and I feel like everyone should play it if you have the specs for it. And as of this theres a sale for it where its only 5 bucks. Get it while its on sale you will not be disappointed.","June 20, 2015","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Because you know, you're the Batman. Rich snob.\n- A large map is yours to glide around, not much to do, but still a big relief compared to the cramped space that was the Asylum.\n- Expanded the detective part of Batman a lot more with a variety of cases that range from homicide to search and rescue.\n- Two (or three, depending how you look at it) playable characters! Though its still more heavily focused on Batman, you'll get to play as Catwoman here and there. She's a little forgetable though. My only regret is that they didn't expand the use of Robin a little more than they should have.\n- Plot twists! Plenty of plot twists! It solved the previous game's problem of being a little predictable by having multiple side missions with their own little story focusing on some of the villains of the past.\n\nCONS\n- Goddammit, Riddler, you still prove to be annoying with your trophy collectibles, but now you come back with some really easy puzzles to solve for his side case.\n- A little short for the main story, but this is the type of game that you don't just focus on the main story. Its not really a complaint against it, you should focus on getting the most out of this game, not just the main campaign.\n- Post-game story uses a better way to fight bosses that aren't used for the main game. A little unforunate, since it was definitely more interesting to try and stealth takedown a boss than rushing at them announced.","July 15, 2015","true","22.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While they weren't able to recapture the atmosphere of loneliness, depression and madness of the asylum, it is still a very captivating experience.\n\nCombat\nThe combat was improved, making the stun less useless and the special finish moves less useless. New enemy types are also a thing in this game, you have your standard henchmen, henchmen armed with guns, knives, stunsticks, henchmen carrying shields and MOTHERF*CKING NINJAS.\nThe game now has an open world, it is now set in the northen part of Gotham that has been sealed off.\n\nStory\nThe story is great but feels very short, and even though there are side mission you can do after finishing the main story, they just feel like the devs were lazy and just plopped these in to extend the playtime.\nThe Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC is welcome addition to the story albeit a bit short. It nicely depicts the characters and the change they went through after Joker's death.\n\nDLC\nAs stated before, Harley Quinn's Revenge is a great addition to the main storyline, however the rest of the extra content is forgettable at best. Same goes for the challenge maps (I didn't want to make another section for that :P), the over-abundance of them makes them feel very cheap and uninteresting (I personally haven't actually bothered to play most of the maps in City or even Origins).\n\nOverall, Arkham City is a great experience and a (weaker) followup to Arkham Asylum and I strongly recommend playing the games in chronological order as it helps to understand the story.","April 15, 2015","true","49.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Jó ötletem tartom, hogy nem csak Batman-nel kellett játszani a játék során. A harcrendszer, a különféle újabb, és újabb ellenféltípusok is nagyon tetszettek. Egy-egy harcban eléggé meg lehetett izzadni, főleg, hogy egyszerre 3-4-5 fajta ellenséggel is kellett harcolni, és mind ellen más-más technikát kellett alkalmazni. A skillrendszer is tetszett, jó volt fejlesztgetni Batman képességeit, a kütyüim képességét, vagy akár Macskanőt. A Rébuszokkal is elvoltam, bár volt, amit nem tudtam megcsinálni, nem is kevés. A bossfight-ok különösképp jók voltak, bár azok nem voltak annyira nehezek, viszont annál inkább lehetett izgulni, hogy le tudjuk győzni az adott ellenfelet. Többször előfordult, hogy elakadtam, és hosszú ideig nem jöttem rá, hogy most mi a fenét is kellene csinálnom, de ez csak a játék mellett áll, ettől lesz egy Batman játék igazi Batman játék. Hisz mint tudjuk, ő a világ legnagyobb nyomozója, és nem csak egy agyatlan darálógép, így az Asylum-ból már megszokott környezeti puzzle-kből sem volt hiány -- már önmagában az a 400 Rébusz kihívás is nagyon sok agyalást, és gondolkodást követel, és ezt nagyon pozitív értelemben mondom. Tehát az egész játék a tetejétől a talpáig teljesen kiváló volt. Mindenkinek ajánlom a játékot, aki szereti Batman-t, esetleg csak szeretne egy jó sztorival rendelkező, játszásra érdemes játékkal foglalkozni. Azok is nyugodtan játszhatnak vele, akik az előző részt kihagyták. A játék nem túl hosszú, de rengeteg tartalom van benne, ha akarunk eltölthetünk 30-40 órát is, mire mindent megcsinálunk benne. Megérte végigjátszani! Kíváncsian várom az Origins-t, valószínűleg azt is elkezdem a közeljövőben.","December 22, 2015","true","17.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

By activating detective mode you see that there are 8 in total, with 2 armed and a hostage. One of them also has a thermal scanner attached. You slowly creep from a vantage point and begin a silent takedown. Once he is unconcious a beeping sound occurs. Suddenly everyone in the room is alerted to your presence and you grapple to a vantage point to re-assess the situation. You drop down and hide under a grate before perfoming a takedown that finishes with a loud thud. The remaning six run down the stairs and approach you. You hide behind a weak wooden wall that you have sprayed explosive gel on before imploding it onto the first man that approaches. They start shooting at you and you throw batarangs at three of them before dropping a smoke pellet. Activating detective mode you calmly batclaw one of the henchmen outside the smoke towards you, knocking him unconcious. You take down one more before grappling up to another vantage point.\n\nPanicking and with his heart rate rising one guy takes the hostage and threatens to kill him. Another runs up and starts shooting down one vantage point, shouting and saying you won't be able to use it. The third man runs under your vantage point and uses his thermal scanner. However because of your anti-heat detection upgrade he doesn't detect you as you stand perfectly still. You then drop down and leave him hanging from the gargoyle you were perched on as he screams. The others rush over and you use you disrupter to jam the armed guy's weapon. You then throw a freeze grenade at the first guy rooting him in place before flying up to a vantage point.\n\nThe guy with a gun becomes shaky as his weapon is no longer working and he has lost sight of you as you have quickly moved from vantage point to vantage point. As he moves under you you drop down on him and knock him out before running to the frozen guy and finishing him with an ice takedown. Batman then proceeds to clean and brush his wristguards very casually.\n\nThis is just one tiny morsel of an amazing open-world game.

The idea in which part of Gotham becomes a prison and is put in a game .... yes please. From the start of the game you’re going to be stuck to your screen. In the first sitting I played it for about 6 hours straight without noticing that a little sneak peek before going to bed, turned in to ’’waiting for the sunrise’’. GamePlay has been improved with a faster flight and a few new gadgets in your arsenal but most of GamePlay is familiar. Where I was most overwhelmed was the story which is so rich with good voice acting, lot of action and plot twists. It really keeps you going and playing the game while hours pass by. My favorite part is the side quests which are quite good. They give you an extra content to explore and to see the story behind the lesser known villains. The game is more fun and entertaining than ever before and that doesn't come lightly after his predecessor.

Gliding through the skies to swoop down on gangs of thugs, solving some of the many side missions, or just playing the actual story campaign - whatever your preference this game will most likely satisfy it (unless you want to be tooling around in a Batmobile, but I'll get to that in a sec)\n\nThe combat is well executed and in the style we have come to expect as a result of the Chris Nolan movies and, whilst some may find it repetitive, it has the option of being a straight-up slug fest or a combination of well timed moves. The general opponents range from unarmed thugs to snipers, shield carriers and some in body armour - each of which requires a slightly different approach.\n\nThe open-world format gives you the freedom to do things in your own time, breaking up the story with numerous side missions and a staggering number of "collectibles" so even when the story is finished there is still plenty to do in Arkham City.\n\nAbout the aforementioned Batmobile : The close confines and ruined conditions in Arkham City really don't lend themselves to using a vehicle so to be honest it's really not a piece of Lore that I missed. The combination of Gliding and grapple assisted parkour are more than capable of getting you anywhere in the map in pretty good time.\n\nThe characterisations are perfect (although this is sadly the last time Mark Hamill will be voicing the Joker) and the scripting is well enough written to let the voice talent really shine. The animations are smooth and fluid, even in the midst of combat with multiple opponents.\n\nAs a player, the only thing I'd suggest is that you get a controller for this game, much as I prefer Keyboard and Mouse it is better suited to a handset.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this was definitely one of my better purchases - but don't take my word for it, get your hands on a copy and see for yourself.","December 29, 2014","true","80.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The freeflow combat system is incredibly fun, and even better than before thanks to new enemy types, new gadgets, and, most importantly, significantly tightened up controls. People who played the previous game will know all those annoying situations when your punch happens to be just a bit too slow to stop an attack, or a counter not working. That happens extremely rarely now - whenever you break your combo, it is your fault. The predator sections are also more fun now, as the enemy henchmen now use their own gadgets to mess up your strategies, like the detective mode-disrupting jammers and mines, which you can also use against them.\n\nIf you haven't played Asylum, well, prepare for one of the best combat systems in a game, ever. I am not overexaggerating. The freeflow combat system is incredibly simple to leare, but fun and has a lot of depth. It is used in fights with up to 40 unarmed or melee-armed henchmen. It's basics are simple: punch, dodge and counter, but add in the whole different layer of gadgets and special combos, and you really feel like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Batman. The predator sections are a whole different beast: up to 10 armed henchment in open rooms force you to play stealthily, swinging from vantage point to vantage point to take them out one by one. There are a lot of different ways to do this, from a simple takedown from the back to dragging your enemies over railings, blowing up walls and knocking them out with debris, and my personal favourite, disabling their guns, then dropping right in front of them and watching them struggle helplessly as you pummel them into sleep. There are just so many ways to approach an objective, that I can't help but adore these sections.\n\nThis game adds a free roaming element to the series, and while it is by no means as developed in full-blown sandboxes, it really ties the game together quite nicely. There are a few sidequests which revolve around you catching various (super)criminals in the titular Arkham City, and they do not feel shoehorned in, although there could certainly be more of them. Simply put, don't buy this game just for the open world, as you will regret it if you do. The riddler trophies and riddles return, and they feel far better thanks to the open world. There is more of them, they give better rewards, and it is easier to find them thanks to the new informant system.\n\nAs for the story, well, it is really the only weaker side of this game, at least when compared to Asylum. The linear structure of the last game lent itself far better to the type of story Rocksteady was trying to tell, but it is still by no means bad. Still, the big plot twist at the end is far too easy to spot, and the characters feel weaker than they did in the last game.\n\nThe length of the game is around 8 hours, should you just want to complete the main story. However, 100%ing the game will take far more, which should prove really nice for a completionist like me: Besides the aforementioned riddler trophies and sidequests, there is a new game+ with tougher enemies and combat, but you start with all your gadgets, rather than aquiring them over the course of the plot, a 2-3 hour story DLC, and an incredibly large challenge mode.This challenge mode is a bit hit and miss: some people will find it very repetitive. What you need to know is that it can add around 10-20 hours of entertainment, should you choose to complete it.\n\nTL:DR;Chances are, you will really like this game if you liked Arkham Asylum.  If you haven't played it or didn't like Asylum, well, you will probably still like it. All in all, this a really good game and one of my favourite games ever, and I would recommend anyone to try it.","November 25, 2013","true","111.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the same vein as its predecessor, Arkham City stylishly blends visual and conceptual elements from the Nolanverse, the Burtonverse, and most of all (and most importantly IMO), the Timmverse.\n\nPros:\n\nInteresting story, but don't think that just because many of The Animated Series voice actors are involved that this is part of the TAS continuity. Many liberties were taken, but it all plays out pretty well, and pays enough homage to the DCAU to keep us 1990s Saturday Morning Cartoon kids pleased.\n\nAn excellent arsenal of familiar and loveable characters.\n\nAmazing voice acting (of course). This is sadly, Mark Hamill's final outing as The Joker, ending his reign as one of the greatest and most iconic Joker portrayals in history, in my opinion only slightly behind Heath Ledger in the Number One spot.\n\nCombat that is fluid, easy enough for just about anyone to get used to, and fun enough to keep you wanting more.\n\nCons:\n\nReally terrible third-person navigation. This doesn't affect the main story campaign so much, you can make it work well enough, but for a lot of the quick, tricky maneuvers required for the Extreme Challenge missions it becomes a real Bane. Want to grapple to that vantage point in a hurry? Too bad, you're going to grapple to this ledge with people on it instead. Need to dive over this railing to escape gunfire? Too bad, because Batman can't navigate around this short banister. Environmental circumstances must be JUST RIGHT to perform certain maneuvers, and that is really uncool. Don't expect this Batman to navigate obstacles like a ninja when the action gets intense. He's more like Russell Casse from Independence Day ("I'm fly... I'm pilot"). On Extreme Challenge Campaigns, this causes controller-chucking rage episodes. /rant\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the story mode campaign seemed a bit on the short side. I have not yet begun New Game Plus, but I definitely finished my first playthrough wishing there was more to it. I think that one contribution to this feeling is the fact that they crammed so many big-name foes that none of them really get enough screentime and a lot of them seem to come and go way too quickly. Take your time, explore everything, do all the things.\n\nAll in all:\n\nI definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale. It's worth it for the main game. Add in the buttloads of concept art, character dossiers, and REALLY cool alternative character skins for the playable characters (yes, including really funny 3D adaptations of their TAS counterparts). I'm raging my way through the bonus missions, and I do plan on playing through the game again, gunning for full completion.","July 5, 2014","true","120.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A great sequel to the fantastic first game, Arkham City presents a larger game world, more incredible characters from the Batman lore, a lot of new gadgets and combos/moves, nice graphics, top notch musical score, all this made precious by one of the best control interfaces and combat mechanics ever designed for a third person action game (please buy a gamepad if you don't have one!).\nThe GOTY edition let's you play also as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, a nice short DLC campaign is included and there's also a big bunch of arenas where you can test your combat and stealth skills while trying to rank up more points as possible (and that is addictive I can assure you).\nMaybe the campaign story is a bit weaker than its prequel's and game fundamentals are basically the same all other from the previous title, but Rocksteady has expanded and optimized every positive aspect of the first game, so I think this is indeed the best super hero game on the market, and one of the best action games / beat 'em ups ever created.\nLet's see if they will be able to do better and maybe innovate their franchise with the third and final game of this planned trilogy, Arkham Knight is coming in 2015!","July 7, 2014","true","42.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BUT That all changed when I played This Game:\nBatman:Arkham City.I decided to look at some gameplay before I bought it.\nIt tick all the boxes for my favourite genres\nOpen World (go anywhere)\n(I’m)Batman\nA lot of gadgets\nKevin Conroy\nMark Hamill\n3rd Person\nAnd I was allowed to play it because\nIt was within my classification range (M)\nI had enough Money\nI had the platform I was getting it for(PC)\nWhen I got Home I did what anyone would do…\nPut it in the Disc Drive of the laptop and Install it. After what seemed like 3 Hours (15 minutes) It had finished installing and, So I booted it up. It asked me to make an account for…The Dreaded…..GFWL(Games For Windows Live). I couldn’t make an account because of some stupid reason. so I panicked for 10 minutes THEN I had a brilliant idea to fix it...Look it up on youtube. I found that way to get around the no saving problem. I finally got to play and immediately I fell in love with the graphics and gameplay.\n\n\nThe Gameplay:\n3rd person\nOpen World\nBatman\nEPIC GADGETS\nStealthy or Fighting\nDetective Case files\n\nKey Features:\nMade By a talented team\nPerfect Voice Acting\nIn-Depth story\nMany Easter Eggs (secrets)\nEngaging gameplay\n\n\nAfter I got up to a certain point in said game my disc stopped working and I was HALF WAY THROUGH. But by that time my game save had been deleted several times making me start again.\n\n\n½ a year later:\nI finally got another Copy of a really good site called {STEAM} and it was 75% off so i got the GOTY(Game Of The Year) Edition and I was happy again. BUT I had to start again. My playtime on steam is around 130 hours!! because of the open world there are many sidequests and thing to collect and secrets to find.\n\n\nThe Review:\nBatman: Arkham City is a very engaging Batman styled “stealth-beat em up” with an amazing story. Although They tried to pack all the villains they could think of to add in to make it like the mad hatters tea party i still like it.\nIt is not perfect but it is still pretty amazing.\nI really love how you get the feeling of actually being batman (without the raspy voice) Kevin(Batman) and Mark(The Joker) do an amazing job and so do all the other Voice actors.\nThe thing I really took away from this is: You DON’T have to be Batman to be Batman. 9/10\n\n\nMy favorite moments:\nThe best boss fight in the game is Mr. Freeze which was very well thought out making you think and making you use all your skills.\nThe Combat is what you’d expect very well flushed out mechanics and amazing Free Flow(jumping from thug to thug).Gadgets were well implemented too.\nOpen world makes any game last longer to make you just want to fly around or grapple and punch randomly generated thugs.\nThe Bugs and Glitches are just plain funny, once i saw a thug spinning rapidly and i walked right through him.\nThe cutscenes are acted out using motion capture making them look extremely realistic.\nAnimations of batman are always either crouching walking or leaping.There are amazing animations like when the thugs see you coming they might cower in a corner.\n\nThe BAD:\nNot having a powerful computer affects cut scenes making the voices look desynced.\nCramming in all the villains possible makes it look messy.\nJoker’s sadistic nature make it appropriate for people above the age of 11.\nAfter you complete EVERYTHING there is no reason to come back.\nStory is quite short: 9-10 hours for beginners.\nCan’t QuickFire Gadgets while flying\nNo Batmobile\nWorld is quite small\nBig Hard Drive Space (17 Gigabytes)\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIn conclusion you should play this game if you like batman or fun games in general.\nit only costs around $7.50 on sale and it will keep you coming back for ages.\nI am extremely excited about Batman: Arkham Knight coming out early next year (2015) because it has fixed most of the problems that I had with this near perfect game: Possibly a much longer story, you CAN QuickFire gadgets while flying , they added the batmobile and also the open world of Gotham is 5 times larger than this!\n\nQuiz: What was the first episode of the 1960s batman TV show called? ANSWER: Hi-Diddle Riddle. It featured Frank Gorshin as the Riddler and Adam West as Batman.

It is not long however before he breaks free and gathers his costume, becoming Batman and ready to get to the bottom of what is going on.\n\nAlong the way Batman meets a bevy of supervillains, from Two-Face to Penguin to Joker and more, all seemingly at a war with each other within the city and like always it is up to Batman to stop them all, this gives reason for Batman to at times work with some villains for the greater good, least till someones back is turned.\n\nArkham City plays, for the most part, just like Arkham Asylum but with more gadgets, moves, and now a big open city to run around in, making it much larger in pretty much every way it could be as well as letting you play as Catwoman in the open city, and Robin as well as Nightwing in the Riddler challenge rooms, each with their own medals and achievements to earn.\n\nCombine that with all the downloadable content such as the mini campaign, bonus maps, and all the skins and you got yourself an amazing package with hours on hours of great gameplay that builds on everything Asylum started. I have very few complaints against this game, noticeable ones being that even though there are more Riddler objects to collect, over four hundred in fact, it is one aspect where more content does not always mean better content, but it is a very small complaint to an otherwise fantastic game, if you loved Arkham Asylum there is a very good chance you will adore this game as well.","April 21, 2014","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.\n\nThere’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.","January 8, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.\n\nBigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.\n\nThe Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!\n\nThe Ending? Fantastic\n\nThe voice acting? Fantastic?\n\nI played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!\n\nM\n","April 17, 2014","true","51.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Balancing almost to perfection action and brains, it's the kind of game that kills your social life for a good reason and makes you feel like an orphan after you finish it, but then there are the challenges, as fun as they are hard; the combos are pure magic, but miss a single input and your rank is history. The graphics are good and crisp even in my old Radeon HD 5670. In my new Geforce GTX 760 is so much eye candy, sometimes I could stop playing and just enjoy the visuals.\nAnother thing that makes it so good is how true to the comic book it is; as you play, you can almost imagine a print version of it.\nOf course it's not perfect, Harley Quinn's Revenge's end still feels like something is missing, but considering the medium the story is delivered, it's miles away from being a bad story.","December 1, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stackonme/recommended/200260/","stackonme","UNDERWATCH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stackonme/","520 products in account","For some reason, I never liked Batman. BUT That all changed when I played This Game:\nBatman:Arkham City.I decided to look at some gameplay before I bought it.\nIt tick all the boxes for my favourite genres\nOpen World (go anywhere)\n(I’m)Batman\nA lot of gadgets\nKevin Conroy\nMark Hamill\n3rd Person\nAnd I was allowed to play it because\nIt was within my classification range (M)\nI had enough Money\nI had the platform I was getting it for(PC)\nWhen I got Home I did what anyone would do…\nPut it in the Disc Drive of the laptop and Install it. After what seemed like 3 Hours (15 minutes) It had finished installing and, So I booted it up. It asked me to make an account for…The Dreaded…..GFWL(Games For Windows Live). I couldn’t make an account because of some stupid reason. so I panicked for 10 minutes THEN I had a brilliant idea to fix it...Look it up on youtube. I found that way to get around the no saving problem. I finally got to play and immediately I fell in love with the graphics and gameplay.\n\n\nThe Gameplay:\n3rd person\nOpen World\nBatman\nEPIC GADGETS\nStealthy or Fighting\nDetective Case files\n\nKey Features:\nMade By a talented team\nPerfect Voice Acting\nIn-Depth story\nMany Easter Eggs (secrets)\nEngaging gameplay\n\n\nAfter I got up to a certain point in said game my disc stopped working and I was HALF WAY THROUGH. But by that time my game save had been deleted several times making me start again.\n\n\n½ a year later:\nI finally got another Copy of a really good site called {STEAM} and it was 75% off so i got the GOTY(Game Of The Year) Edition and I was happy again. BUT I had to start again. My playtime on steam is around 130 hours!! because of the open world there are many sidequests and thing to collect and secrets to find.\n\n\nThe Review:\nBatman: Arkham City is a very engaging Batman styled “stealth-beat em up” with an amazing story. Although They tried to pack all the villains they could think of to add in to make it like the mad hatters tea party i still like it.\nIt is not perfect but it is still pretty amazing.\nI really love how you get the feeling of actually being batman (without the raspy voice) Kevin(Batman) and Mark(The Joker) do an amazing job and so do all the other Voice actors.\nThe thing I really took away from this is: You DON’T have to be Batman to be Batman. 9/10\n\n\nMy favorite moments:\nThe best boss fight in the game is Mr. Freeze which was very well thought out making you think and making you use all your skills.\nThe Combat is what you’d expect very well flushed out mechanics and amazing Free Flow(jumping from thug to thug).Gadgets were well implemented too.\nOpen world makes any game last longer to make you just want to fly around or grapple and punch randomly generated thugs.\nThe Bugs and Glitches are just plain funny, once i saw a thug spinning rapidly and i walked right through him.\nThe cutscenes are acted out using motion capture making them look extremely realistic.\nAnimations of batman are always either crouching walking or leaping.There are amazing animations like when the thugs see you coming they might cower in a corner.\n\nThe BAD:\nNot having a powerful computer affects cut scenes making the voices look desynced.\nCramming in all the villains possible makes it look messy.\nJoker’s sadistic nature make it appropriate for people above the age of 11.\nAfter you complete EVERYTHING there is no reason to come back.\nStory is quite short: 9-10 hours for beginners.\nCan’t QuickFire Gadgets while flying\nNo Batmobile\nWorld is quite small\nBig Hard Drive Space (17 Gigabytes)\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIn conclusion you should play this game if you like batman or fun games in general.\nit only costs around $7.50 on sale and it will keep you coming back for ages.\nI am extremely excited about Batman: Arkham Knight coming out early next year (2015) because it has fixed most of the problems that I had with this near perfect game: Possibly a much longer story, you CAN QuickFire gadgets while flying , they added the batmobile and also the open world of Gotham is 5 times larger than this!\n\nQuiz: What was the first episode of the 1960s batman TV show called?

I would recommend this to anyone who likes stealth-games and beat-'em-ups. It definitely improves on a lot of things from the first game, such as more upgrades and more fun way to take down enemies. I can't decide whether I like the changes made to the detective mode. I feel it is mostly a change made to make things harder, so you're not constantly in detective mode, scanning for enemies. It is now easier for enemies to destroy gargoyles, which means stealth becomes harder. Another improvement is that you get the batclaw, the explosive gel and the cry-something-hacker-device.\nWith the GOTY-edition you get all the DLC, which there is a lot of, for example the Catwoman-pach which lets you play as catwoman from time to time, which makes combat completely different as Catwoman has different combat tools.\nIf this doesn't convince you, just watch the trailer, which is fantastic.","June 5, 2014","true","94.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a nutshell, it's fantastic. If your rig can handle the higher settings, this is still a STUNNING looking game. Combat is fantastic, intuitive, and just plain fun. The story was well worth it to me. You can either blow through the main story in a dozen or less hours, but if you invest in the side missions, riddler challenges, expect to spend a considerable amount of time in Arkham City.\n\nBigger is not always better. Arkham City is larger in scope than its predecessor, Arkham Asylum, but is modest in size compared to other open world games today. What we do have here is an amazing attention to detail that left me simply staring at the scenery.\n\nThe Riddler challenges require some patience. For some, they will seem overwhelming - just keep in mind that like the prior game, not all challenges can be done immediately. Certain upgrades will be required. Once those are, most challenges make sense and are surprisingly addictive to find!\n\nThe Ending? Fantastic\n\nThe voice acting? Fantastic?\n\nI played this on consoles when it first came out, but in some ways I felt like I was playing for the first time, thanks to the PC setting option - no comparisons. Never played it on PC, then you need to check out the game again!!!\n\nM\n","April 17, 2014","true","51.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will always recommend this game.\nI have purchased this game 3 times (Xbox 360, PC & Wii U) and I don't regret a single one.","July 21, 2014","true","63.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat controllers are more instinctive, but you also will have to deal with a greater number of enemies at once; the result is a likewise difficulty level, but with a greater immersion feeling. Is also easier to feel like the Batman during the stealth scenes, since the possibilities of hiding and hunting your enemies one by one were also improved.\nI'm really anxious to see what Rocksteady will bring in the third chapter of the series.\n\n------------\n\nUma sequência fantástica para Arkham Asylum, Arkham City consegue manter todos os bons elementos do primeiro jogo, e ainda incluindo um mundo aberto rico e incrivelmente detalhado.

A great sequel to the fantastic first game, Arkham City presents a larger game world, more incredible characters from the Batman lore, a lot of new gadgets and combos/moves, nice graphics, top notch musical score, all this made precious by one of the best control interfaces and combat mechanics ever designed for a third person action game (please buy a gamepad if you don't have one!).\nThe GOTY edition let's you play also as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing, a nice short DLC campaign is included and there's also a big bunch of arenas where you can test your combat and stealth skills while trying to rank up more points as possible (and that is addictive I can assure you).\nMaybe the campaign story is a bit weaker than its prequel's and game fundamentals are basically the same all other from the previous title, but Rocksteady has expanded and optimized every positive aspect of the first game, so I think this is indeed the best super hero game on the market, and one of the best action games / beat 'em ups ever created.\nLet's see if they will be able to do better and maybe innovate their franchise with the third and final game of this planned trilogy, Arkham Knight is coming in 2015!","July 7, 2014","true","42.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Batman) has a press conference talking about the dangers of Arkham City,as well as his request to shut it down.Then,T.Y.G.E.R guards confront Wayne by the order of Hugo Strange and send him to Arkham CIty.\nAfter a short conversation with Strange,Bruce finds a way to escape but eventually gets caught.Then, he fights with several thugs.Then finally,Wayne escapes for good and becomes the Batman.This time,his only goal is to confront Strange and stop Arkham CIty for good.\nAfter a little while of gameplay,Batman encounters Catwoman who is in the hands of Two-Face.After that,Batman analyzes clues leading him to the Church were there are hostages trapped from Jokers Thugs.After he saves them,they tell Batman that Joker is inside a Building inside Arkham CIty.Batman, using his technology tracks down Joker's signal wich leads him to a factory.Batman goes there,but Joker fools him and, with the help of Harley Quinn,poisons Batman.\nBatman realizes that he has to find a cure to stop the poisoning.And with a little help from Alfred,his butler,Batman realizes that he has to find his old enemy Mister Freeze,who has the only cure.When Batman finds Freeze,he understands that he cant give him the antidote without blood samples.So,Batman suggest Freeze that he should go find his Mentor,Ra's Al Ghul.Then,Batman find the place were Ra's is.But in order to talk to him,he must pass the Trials of Death.Batman passes them and has a talk with Ra's.Finally after he has his blood sample,Batman returns to Mister Freeze.But saddly,Harley Quinn steals the cure and Batman must find her, in order to repossess the cure.\nAfter his second visit to the factory,Batman falls in the trap of the Joker.But suddenly,Hugo Strange sets in function his deadly project called Protocol 10.But,after Strange does that,the place were he is in, is protected by a special code which is in one of the many helicopters that fly atop of Arkham City.Batman must find the correct helicopter that contains the code in order to apprehend Strange.\nWill Batman stop the Joker and fool Strange's plans ? You must play to find out !\n\nPersonal Opinion :\n\nI really enjoyed the game.It was the Game of the Year for me as well as one of my favourite games i have ever played.\nThe graphics are amazing with smooth animations that make the game trully original and beautifull.\nIt has better graphics than Arkham Asylum and it is generally a very good improvement.During my gameplay,i found only 3 glitches.They were not serious ones as they took place for only 2 seconds,so it is nothing to worry about.\nThe story is breathtating,including shocking plot twists that will leave you stunned.It has an unusual atmoshpere and ,the main character will look like hell by the end of the game.It is a very nice detail that gives the game a generally nice feeling.\nThe combat system is the HIGHLIGHT of the game.It is its best aspect.You can take out enemies with face-to-face combat or just by good old stealth.It is very challenging and at the same time fun.In the face-to-face combat you must keep your Hit Streak from stopping.If you do that,you will see Batman take out his enemies one by one with incredibly awesome combat moves.You can also counter enemie's moves and as I mentioned before, with smooth animations, and slow motion at the last hit.While in the Stealth Mode, you must try not to be detected by your enemies and at the same taking them out silently in order not to be spotted.\nThis game also includes the DLC : Harley Quinns Revenge.As well as the other Outfits for Batman.They are available after you beat the game.The game also contains extra stages were the player tests his combat skills.Both in Stealth and in Open-Combat.Lastly,if youre think you are so good,you can try the Story Mode Plus,were the only difference is that there is no Counter-Hint.\n\n''WARNING''\n\nHarley Quinn's Revenge contains MAJOR SPOILERS from the main story.Play it only after you beat the main game.\n\n\n\nI'll rate this game...........9/10    You should definetly give it try.","June 30, 2014","true","88.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_fiend/recommended/200260/","neon_fiend","Fiendish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_fiend/","59 products in account","Follow up to Arkham Asylum, the game that brought Batman to the realm of kickass gaming. In the same vein as its predecessor, Arkham City stylishly blends visual and conceptual elements from the Nolanverse, the Burtonverse, and most of all (and most importantly IMO), the Timmverse.\n\nPros:\n\nInteresting story, but don't think that just because many of The Animated Series voice actors are involved that this is part of the TAS continuity. Many liberties were taken, but it all plays out pretty well, and pays enough homage to the DCAU to keep us 1990s Saturday Morning Cartoon kids pleased.\n\nAn excellent arsenal of familiar and loveable characters.\n\nAmazing voice acting (of course). This is sadly, Mark Hamill's final outing as The Joker, ending his reign as one of the greatest and most iconic Joker portrayals in history, in my opinion only slightly behind Heath Ledger in the Number One spot.\n\nCombat that is fluid, easy enough for just about anyone to get used to, and fun enough to keep you wanting more.\n\nCons:\n\nReally terrible third-person navigation. This doesn't affect the main story campaign so much, you can make it work well enough, but for a lot of the quick, tricky maneuvers required for the Extreme Challenge missions it becomes a real Bane. Want to grapple to that vantage point in a hurry? Too bad, you're going to grapple to this ledge with people on it instead. Need to dive over this railing to escape gunfire? Too bad, because Batman can't navigate around this short banister. Environmental circumstances must be JUST RIGHT to perform certain maneuvers, and that is really uncool. Don't expect this Batman to navigate obstacles like a ninja when the action gets intense. He's more like Russell Casse from Independence Day ("I'm fly... I'm pilot"). On Extreme Challenge Campaigns, this causes controller-chucking rage episodes. /rant\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the story mode campaign seemed a bit on the short side. I have not yet begun New Game Plus, but I definitely finished my first playthrough wishing there was more to it. I think that one contribution to this feeling is the fact that they crammed so many big-name foes that none of them really get enough screentime and a lot of them seem to come and go way too quickly. Take your time, explore everything, do all the things.\n\nAll in all:\n\nI definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale. It's worth it for the main game. Add in the buttloads of concept art, character dossiers, and REALLY cool alternative character skins for the playable characters (yes, including really funny 3D adaptations of their TAS counterparts). I'm raging my way through the bonus missions, and I do plan on playing through the game again, gunning for full completion.","July 5, 2014","true","120.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is nothing glaringly wrong with it but it feels like a step down from Asylum. City lacks any truly memorable sequences, like the original’s Killer Croc battle or the Scarecrow bits. Asylum also had a more cohesive plot. Plus, while I like playing with Catwoman, I don’t like being forced to switch between her and Batman during the campaign. It just makes things feel disjointed.\n\nThat being said it looks good, runs great, and there are a ton of gadgets to play with. If you liked Asylum then this offers some more of that gameplay. If you pick it up for $5 or so you’ll probably be satisfied with it, but you won’t love it.","March 15, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You also get to play as Catwoman which is a nice change but don't forget to keep her level up with Batman or you'll be in hotwater after the main story closes.","June 23, 2014","true","26.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As I played it however I found that the combat is very free flowing and doesn't have the clunky "hit this button now" feel.\nI can't really speak to the Batman lore, but I do find the villans taunting you after you lose a fight to be a very nice piece of work.  It really makes them feel more like super villans even though most of the time you only deal with their hired thugs.\n\nIts plot seems very lacking however.  It could be becuase I know very little about the lore, but the initial events that land you in Arkham City are never fully explained.  You were thrown in jail without trial or accusation of a specific crime.  In the end you are never aquitted of your crimes, infact they never seem to be brought up again.\n\nAll said and done I would give it an 8/10: which is pretty good considering I grade hard.  But I do have a love for good game mechanics. This game definately took it in that department.","November 25, 2013","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stealth, but especially the combat, are much improved since the first game. The fluidity of its "easy to learn, hard to master" combat mechanics puts stuff like "Assassin's Creed" (with its silly hold block until you can counter kill simplicity) to shame. In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of another third person game which has better hand to hand combat than "Batman: AC."\n\nThe open world is a nice touch too, even though alot of the side quests are kind of a pain and best left alone given that they tend to be of the "find x number of hidden objects on a map, then fight a boss" variety. The main plot is better, but never really matches the highs of "Arkham Asylum." It tries to cram every single Batman villain ever into one overarching storyline, and not only does this stretch credulity even in comic book terms, but individual segments feel rushed and lack the depth of "Arkham Asylum" (which focused on relatively fewer villains).\n\nStill, if you approach it more as a series of slightly interrelated episodes rather than one grand story the game works much better. Despite its flaws it surpasses the original in most respects and in terms of pure gameplay might be the best third person action game on the market; definitely more polished, better made, and way more fun than any given Assassin's Creed game.","January 20, 2013","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're Batman, Batman! And not only do you play as Batman, but you feel like Batman. Whether leaping from the shadows to takedown your enemies or gliding over the rooftops no other game (besides Arkham Asylum) makes you feel quite like the Caped Crusader.\n\nIf you liked Arkham Asylum, you're in for a treat. Everything is bigger, and badder. Combat is more intense, and it's a blast to glide through the enormous Arkham City.\n\nWhile Arkham City is a monumental achievement for games of this nature, there are a few caveats. As an open world game, players are given the option to explore and complete side missions at their leisure. While this can be fun, the side missions are repetitive, and largely irrelevant to overall plot. To a completionist, this can grind the story to a halt. I would advise going straight for each main story objective before attempting any secondary missions, as the story is fast-paced and worth experiencing.","November 30, 2013","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fighting part of the game, is made by using the mouse to navigate whitch charecter you want to attack, you use the left mouse button to attack and the right to counter, you can also use the middle to confuse. Along the way the enemeys get harder, and get new equpment, and new tacktics must be used to deafeat them.\n\nThere is also the stealth element, where Batman must take down a room with armed thugs in order to continue or save someone. Here you must plan your attacks and be paistent in order to succed.\n\nThere are so many small details in this game, and I really love how many mini games and challenges, there are. You can take challenges in fighting and stealth, and use diffrent charecters such as catwomen, there is also a playable charecter in the story mode, nightwing and robin. Furthermore, in the main game Zaez is on the run, the Riddler is kisnapping people and putting up his throphies and riddles to find again. The Mad Hatter is runnig amok, and so much more.\n\nThe story is the best Batman story in a long time. The story takes palce after the events of Arkham Asylum, where the Joker have become sick becouse of the titan serum he took, meanwhile Bruce Wayne is sent to the new jail city Arham City, and here we find out that Hugo Strange now knows, who Batman really is. This makes the plot more interesting, and it only get`s more tence after the Joker infects Batman with he`s blood.\n\nSo now Batman needs to find a cure and defeat Hugo Strange, in order to keep he`s identety hidden.\n\nSince this is a prison city, we meet many other charecters, such as the Penguine, Mister Frezze, Solomon Grundy, Clayface and even Ras al` Ghoul. Every single charecter is well made, and really memerable. Along the way, you can also find informatiomn about the charecters, inside Arkham city, this only adds more depth to the charecters and I love it.\n\nThe ending is worth talking about, and this is also the part where I talk about the DLC mission from the game, if you don`t want the ending spolied, don`t read untill you see the spoiler over part.\n\n-----------spoilers------------\nIn this game, the Joker dies, this is a shock to anyone who played this game, and it is truely a fantastic ending. It is clear that Batman will be scared by this event, since the Joker and Batman, have a conection deep down, every fan of the seires knows about. The Joker needs Batman and the other way around, but this put the nail in the coffin and made a climactic ending, that will be remembered by me.\n\nThis leads to the events after the attack on Arkham, and guees who`s gone mad? Well of couse it`s Harly Quen. Since the Joker died, she have kidnapped police officers, and turned prttey goth. We also find out that Batman have been kidnapped, and that Harly Quen thought she was pragnent with Jokers child, whitch only made her even more mad. It is up to Robin to save the day in this DLC, and it is a nice change since you have played as Batman all day in the main game.\n\n------------spoilers over----------\n\nOverall this game is really well designed and it is a fantastic story, that have twist and turns along the way, plus fantasitc sceneory, that only will make you love the game even more, thumps up. 8 out of 10","March 12, 2015","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd never been interested enough to watch any of the movies or read the comic books, so I had no prior knowledge beyond Batman being a guy in a batsuit. Even so, I really enjoyed this game.\n\nGotham City is absolutely beautiful, and jumping/gliding from building to building never gets old. The game is also filled with interesting characters – allies and villains alike. There are plenty of familiar faces for people who know the franchise, but they were convincing enough for me to like them based on the game alone.\n\nAdd to that some interesting game mechanics and boss fights (a direct approach will not always work) and an engaging storyline, and I see no reason for people not to play this game. Even if like me, you have no prior interest in the franchise – Arkham City just might surprise you.","April 26, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where ever you go trying to do the main story, Arkham City leads you off the trail to do side missions, investigate puzzles and beat the tar out of thugs. You can do various objectives in different order, it's non-linear. Unfortunately you can't solve every Riddler puzzle until you get the last equipment including the line launcher and freeze blast, but don't get hung up on that. I love being able to fly around Gotham with the grapnel boost, following custom way points or deviating from them to spontaneously do something else without getting lost. Top notch voice acting for Batman, Joker and Harley. The Batman villain roster is impressive. I didn't think much of Batman Arkham Asylum, the claustrophobic setting was limited, but was consistent to the story at least.  It's the perfect sequel. Newgame+ and the hard difficulty proves replay ability. The point in the story where Batman is forced to complete the demon trials was where I became the most engaged.\n\nIf you grew up watching the Tim Burtom Batman movies, including Forever and the Warner Brother animated series, you gotta play this. It's the best representation of Batman in a video game.\n\n5/5\n\n\nHere is a list of my favorite games released during the 7th generation of consoles. Honorable mentions to Dead Rising 2 Off The Record, Skyrim, Portal 2 , Call Of Duty Black Ops and Super Mario Galaxy.\n\n\n1. Batman Arkham City (Best flow of navigation and mission activity)\n2. Fallout New Vegas (Balances FO3 for more challenge and variety)\n3. Bioshock 1 (Defines FPS 1P)\n4. Call Of Duty 4 (Defines FPS Multiplayer)\n5. Super Smash Brothers Brawl (Reason to get a Wii)","December 19, 2013","true","65.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The balance between stealth and action is superb. The "level" layouts are all very well-planned and leave you free to take out the enemies any way you see fit. The storyline is a little scattered at times, and it can be easy to get confused on what your main objective is, especially if you just spent forty minutes on a sidequest.\n\nThis game does have so much to offer, though.

Its kept all the elements from Arkham Asylum that I liked and thrown in some improvements as well as a bit of DLC. The look of the game is even more impressive than AA, and the combat is just stunning to look at. The voice acting and soundtrack are just as great too. The plot is decent enough with some good "interludes" and there's plenty of side-quests. So its a definite thumbs up. On the negative side, I don't quite know why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I should. Perhaps because I've seen it before with AA?  Perhaps that a lot of game is within the challenge maps which just didn't grab me? Perhaps that when I'd finished the main plot I'd still only done about 2/3rds of the side quests, and had the opportunity to carry on playing despite the fact the game was "over". I can't put my finger on it but I didn't enjoy it as much as AA.

I love this game so much. The fact that there was a big ol' city full of thugs and croneys, Riddler Trophies, and cool locations to explore made this game the most amazing pc game, like, ever. Protical 10 made the game for me. the only problem I had with it was that after I beat it, my save file went wacky and set me back to the fight with Joker in the steel mill, but whatever, I wanted to explore more of Arkham City anyway. And speaking of Arkham, it is a well built, creatively textured gothic masterpiece. It's riddled (no pun intended) with secrets, awsome locations,  Azrial (that armored, hooded guy,[I recognized him from the outfit. I'm not spoiling anything.]), side quests, and so much more. It feels veeeery atmospherical, and while it may be better to refer to it as "Arkham Town" it is still very large.

That generic genre descriptor really does apply for all the Arkham games though: there’s a lot of action, and you constantly feel like you’re on an adventure. Rocksteady capitalizes on the foundations of Asylum and takes the series along for a ride on the open-world bandwagon; however, they do so in a way that makes their AAA competitors simply look dull and slow. There’s a great feeling of speed and environmental mastery as you use your grapple and cape, upgraded here as a slingshot mechanism that hurls you into the air before bobbing down to maintain lift. Gadgets are now incorporated into your combat repetoire; A-list villains are actually given their due with some impressive boss encounters; the Catwoman chapter is short but immensely fun; environmental puzzles are more complex while the Riddler challenges are compulsively fun to track down and complete. You want to know how to make your collectathon mini games fun? Make them inherently fun, not because they reward a shiny or an achievement or feed your OCD (although all those are legit reasons). 'City' is packed with fun stuff to do.\n\nThere’s just more of Arkham here: more characters, an expanded moveset, bigger and more diverse environments, more DC universe shoutouts and fanbait (the terrible Harley Quinn DLC is one such tease). It’s the ‘Batman Returns’ of the franchise: a louder and campier sequel that raises the fun quotient significantly, even if it comes at the cost of some narrative and design tightness.","January 8, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feenris/recommended/200260/","Feenris","Feenris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feenris/","482 products in account","If you told me 5+ years ago that a lesser-known studio under a massive publisher is making a triple-A comicbook hero game adaptation, I'd be a cynic.\n\n2011, Batman:Arkham City was released, the sequel to the acclaimed Batman:Arkham Asylum developed by Rocksteady studios. While AA managed to exceed the expectations of cynics like me, being a really polished and solid game in itself, AC rose way up higher, being one of the most amazing games in recent memory. Or at least for me personally.\n\nArkham City, in essence, is Arkham Asylum with a massive open world, slightly better animations (e.g. no more cretins holding their heads when they're defeated, regardless of where you actually hurt them) and more polishes around its edges, It manages to keep the fantastic, fluid combat, excellent level design, atmospheric setting, incredible narrative and oh-so perfect voice acting. So much of this review has been said in my previous review of AA.\n\nCombat in AC is satisfying as ever, but now with more awesome animations and more importantly, more gadgets and the introduction of freeflow gadgets. Freeflow gadgets basically allows you to incorporate your gadgets mid-combat more seamlessly which makes the variety of combos way more exciting. With the introduction of more gadgets comes more approaches in combat which plays a huge part in AC and is without a doubt, extremely fun to experiment with different gadgets in different combat situations.\n\nBoss fights in AC are a major improvement from its predecessor. Each boss is almost perfectly depicted as their comicbook counterpart not only in terms of presentation, but also their method of combat. Bottom line, boss encounters are extremely fun and at times challenging, although some bosses rely alot on button mashing.\n\nStealth in AA relied a lot on the game's excellent level design and combat/gadgetry to a certain extent (ignoring the clumsy AI). AC manages to yet again, excel in the series' stealth aspect with even more incredible level designs and as said earlier, more gadgets which also are incorporable for stealthy approaches. If you are a fan of stealth games, I recommend playing the game on hard because more often than not when you have a multiple gun-armed men encounter, you are forced to approach them extremely stealthily as guns kill you fairly quick. IMO, stealth on hard in Arkham City is feels just as or even more rewarding than combat.\n\nTalking about stealth, it is almost unignorable to talk about the clumsy AI. Whilst enemies patroling/covering area are sometimes very tight and challenging, it sometimes fails to notice you in obvious positions of their line of sight and I am also convinced they never look behind or above them (unless theyre using thermo). This most definitely needs work.\n\nPresentation of the game is without a doubt a massive eye (and ear) candy. The world is grim, dark and quite large, managing to retain the gothic atmosphere of AA once again. AC manages to have an ungeneric world due to being able to not to use generic buildings or placing alike buildings very close to each other. Rocksteady manages to put a lot of easter eggs in the world pretty well with references to the comic book stories in the form of riddler challenges and sidemissions. There's one easter egg where if you go to crime alley within the game which really generates a ton of feels (personally), if you are getting this game, do not forget to check it out, this shows the amount of effort the devs put into the game.\n\nThe music is not only extremely good as well, but its placement within each scene is perfection, definitely worth checking out the soundtrack itself.\n\nVoice acting, oh my god, Mark Hamill nails it down the ground yet again with his portrayal of Joker, alongside Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong and every other villain as well being quite possibly one of the best voice-acting crew in the history of gaming. This helps build a spot-on portrayal of each character which is already presented extremely well with each of their character models and great costume design.\n\nStory-wise, a lot of reviews I've read mentions that AC isn's as strong as AA but I say otherwise. While I do agree some villains felt rather shoehorned into the story after much thought, my initial playthrough almost ignores this fact due to the game's undeniably spectacular narrative. AC's narrative played out extremely well and felt very much alike a blockbuster movie (perhaps maybe even comparable to Nolan's trilogy) as the scale felt grand as compared to AA. Overall, I felt that the story was pretty much one of the key selling points of the game (again, personally).\n\nWell that pretty much covers all my opinions of the game. I admit I do have abit of a Batboner (ok not that small after all..) but whether or not you are a huge fan of Batman should not be taken to consideration if you are deciding whether or not to buy this game because personally, Batman:Arkham City is one of the best games in recent memory. Treat yourselves well by buying yourselves this incredible piece of entertainment.\n\nConclusion; a fantastic game with incredibly satisfying combat, rewardingly challenging stealth, a relatively large world with excellent world and level design, great atmosphere of grim ( and yet, epicness of being the caped crusader), perfect sound direction and composition, unforgettable characters with their spot-on impressions/models/costume and triple-A voice acting, great story and a wonderful narrative. Yes, this game is so good i ran out of unique positive reinforcement adjectives to use.\n\n9.5/10 - Brings me wonders how TESV got goty instead of this.","October 1, 2014","true","69.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By activating detective mode you see that there are 8 in total, with 2 armed and a hostage. One of them also has a thermal scanner attached. You slowly creep from a vantage point and begin a silent takedown. Once he is unconcious a beeping sound occurs. Suddenly everyone in the room is alerted to your presence and you grapple to a vantage point to re-assess the situation. You drop down and hide under a grate before perfoming a takedown that finishes with a loud thud. The remaning six run down the stairs and approach you. You hide behind a weak wooden wall that you have sprayed explosive gel on before imploding it onto the first man that approaches. They start shooting at you and you throw batarangs at three of them before dropping a smoke pellet. Activating detective mode you calmly batclaw one of the henchmen outside the smoke towards you, knocking him unconcious. You take down one more before grappling up to another vantage point.\n\nPanicking and with his heart rate rising one guy takes the hostage and threatens to kill him. Another runs up and starts shooting down one vantage point, shouting and saying you won't be able to use it. The third man runs under your vantage point and uses his thermal scanner. However because of your anti-heat detection upgrade he doesn't detect you as you stand perfectly still. You then drop down and leave him hanging from the gargoyle you were perched on as he screams. The others rush over and you use you disrupter to jam the armed guy's weapon. You then throw a freeze grenade at the first guy rooting him in place before flying up to a vantage point.\n\nThe guy with a gun becomes shaky as his weapon is no longer working and he has lost sight of you as you have quickly moved from vantage point to vantage point. As he moves under you you drop down on him and knock him out before running to the frozen guy and finishing him with an ice takedown. Batman then proceeds to clean and brush his wristguards very casually.\n\nThis is just one tiny morsel of an amazing open-world game.

This game is absolutely unbelievable! The story is so rich and motivates you to keep pushing in the story, the gameplay really makes you feel like Batman, and the amount of things to do in the game is staggering. I still have not completed the Catwomen storyline or any other of the DLC included in the GOTY edition of the game (however, I plan on continuing to play Batman Arkham City so be on the lookout for updated reviews regarding the DLC component of this game). This is strictly a review of the base game of Batman Arkham.\n\nStory: 9.5 out of 10\nAfter completing the main story of the game, my jaw dropped. Everything that led up to the end, the struggle, all concluded in an epic finale that I will not forget for a long time. I am not going to discuss the story for fear of spoiling something, but I must say that the story alone is worth the price of admission. The written script is excellent, and Batman is confronted by a numerous amount of famous rivals. Overall, I enjoyed every minute of the story; sequences with the Joker (just like Arkham Asylum) were definitely a highlight in my book.\n\nGraphics: 9.5 out of 10\nThe graphics in Batman Arkham City are excellent. The atmosphere is dark, tense, rich with detail, and a feeling of dread overcomes me everytime I play the game (in a good way). However, this does not last long due to the fact that you are Batman! The environments vary greatly in Arkham City. There is a steel mill taken over by the Joker and turned into something resembling a circus act, a police department taken over by Mr. Freeze, a museum occupied by the Penguin, etc. The character models and environment are polished, filled with detail, and provide for a rich Batman experience.\n\n- The only thing I disliked about Batman Arkham City is that the game sometimes stutters when gliding over Arkham City which I imagine has to be streaming issue (this is a well known issue among many PC gamers). However, other than this issue, the game runs great on my R9 290. Maxed out, I average about 160+ fps indoors and 90-120 fps outdoors. Do not let the stuttering issue prevent you from playing this masterpiece - you honestly get use to it. A work-around that I use to fix some stuttering issues is to pan the camera 360 degrees around Batman a few times - this really helps!\n\nGameplay: 9.8 out of 10\nJust like Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City is broken into a few gameplay scenarios: stealth, combat, and exploration - Riddler trophies/challenges. Just like the previous game, stealth is one of my favorite parts of this game. As the predator, you hunt down one thug at a time using different tactics such as hanging from gargoyles and performing inverted takedowns, and using a range of different gadgets at your disposal. Overall, the amount of options you have when approaching these scenarios is amazing, and I can totally see myself going back and perfecting my skills in the challenge mode.\nCombat is much more dynamic and free-flowing than in Arkham Asylum. You can now counter multiple enemies at one time, there are many more enemy types, and there are now more gadgets that are hotkeyed to use to string together combos. The combat in Batman Arkham City can be as in-depth as you want it to be. Overall, the stealth and combat is turned up to eleven as compared to Arkham Asylum, and the game really makes you feel like Batman!\nThe game also comes with 12 side missions (I believe that is right?) that has Batman fighting, tracking down, and helping some classic rivals. Challenge rooms return letting you refine your skills in stealth and combat. Also, with the GOTY edition of the game, Catwomen becomes a playable character whose story becomes intertwined with Batman's. Catwomen controls greatly, her fighting style differs greatly from Batman's, and it is a joy playing as her (I personally prefer playing as Batman, but playing as Catwoman is a nice change of pace.)\nLastly, just like Arkham Asylum, Riddler trophies/challenges return in abundance (however this is not a bad thing). Spread out among Arkham City are 440 Riddler trophies/challenges (I have only collected 170). These trophies/challenges really make you scavenge the environment, and provide many more hours of enjoyment to an already fantastic game.\n\nAudio: 10 out of 10\nIt should come as no surprise that the audio in this game is stellar. The voice acting is the best that I have ever heard in a game; the musical score bring out the perfect emotions at the perfect times. Gadgets sound just as they should, and gliding around Arkham City with wind flowing underneath Batman's wingsuit is excellent. I could not wish for anything better in the audio department of this game!\n\nConclusion:\nI LOVED BATMAN ARKHAM CITY! It is the reason I love playing video games, and why I continue to do so. This game provides a medium to play as Batman, and should not be passed up on. This game does everything right, and is one of the best games that I have played in the past five years (I do not say that lightly). It improves so much upon the great core provided by Batman Arkham Asylum, yet provides so much innovation to keep the game fresh and rewarding. Do yourself a favor, you owe it to yourself to play Batman Arkham City.\n\nBatman Arkham  City		9.7 out of 10\n\nBUY THIS GAME!!!!","January 5, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Flying around the open world is great, if a little tedious until you get the grapnel gun. Even collecting all of the open world collectibles is satisfying.\n\nEven with the slightly lacklustre storyline, made just that much better by the tremendous voice acting and plenty of sidequests to keep you occupied really makes Arkham City into the quintessential superhero game.","October 1, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better combat, an open world with interior and exterior locations, and a large cast of characters will all be welcome additions and make the game feel superior to the franchise debut.\n\nHowever, Arkham City isn't without flaws. The biggest in my book is the absolute over-saturation/overkill of Riddler junk. There are over 400 trophies, riddles, and destructible objects all over the place and with their integration into a side-mission you almost feel obligated to track them all down - something that becomes even MORE of a pain when you come across numerous ones you can't access yet due to your progress in the main story (needing certain gadgets). This annoyance is multiplied then when you have to come back to it later but to do so requires a lengthy journey to their location hampered by areas that were accessible but no longer (forcing you to find a different path) and/or the simple time it takes to get to them.\n\nArkham City is also still hindered by bugs/glitches and crashes even four years after its intial release, and cutscenes are absolutely terrible looking as they're done at a resolution and detail level that shouldn't even have been the "norm" for 2011 consoles. Beyond these things there are plenty of other smaller annoyances that, while not severly diminishing the overall experience, certainly hold the game back from being almost perfect.\n\nIn the end, Arkham City is a fantastic game that every Batman fan has to play. Easily the second best game in the entire franchise it's not one to glance over because of its age.\n\n8 Joker Balloons out of 10\n\n\n","September 5, 2015","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story itself is a little bit too short but there are a few sidequests so that is okay.\n\nThe gameplay is just great. Gliding and grappling is very easy and after a few minutes you are used to it.\nSame for the fight system, which ist easy to control but on harder difficults also hard to master perfectly.\n\nTotally recommended if you are a fan of the Batman Series.","September 6, 2015","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many improvements and the complete access to all the skins and characters, and Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC make this the definitive edition of Arkham City. Great game to buy at a discount (around $5)!","September 12, 2015","true","82.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
