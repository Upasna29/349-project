The storyline is adorable and the graphics are colorful, but the play control and difficulty will give you a massive headache.  Wandering monsters with stun mechanics or knockback abilities will ruin your day as they are extremely difficult to dodge.  Bottomless pits are everywhere, so knockback enemies are particularly dangerous here.  There is no status immunity and there is no way to overlevel to make the game easier - the game caps your level dependent on the number of a certain relic you've obtained.\n\nIf you're in for a challenge and enjoy sidescroller ARPG gameplay, you will like this game.  If you're the average COD or Madden obsessed gamer, stay at least 50 feet away!","November 30, 2014","true","49.6"," 82 of 95 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","82","95","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syn010110/recommended/203510/","syn010110","Relentlessly Gay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syn010110/","83 products in account","I don't normally review games I haven't finished. There are loads of games I just don't like and I couldn't bring myself to finish. I never bothered to give them a poor review simply because they weren't my cup of tea; to me, that's a bit disingenuous. However, if I cannot finish a game due to design flaws so astonishingly glaring and blatant, well... then it's fair game. And Fortune Summoners is definitely fair game.\n\nThis game is broken. Full stop.\n\nLet's start at the beginning. Fortune Summoners is a side-scrolling action RPG developed by former indie game dev Lizsoft. Apparently their games haven't sold enough to warrant further investment, so I heard they shut down. It's a very charming game with graphics reminiscent of the 16-bit era's "last hurrah" during the mid 90s. The characters are adorable and well-designed while the story is simple but cute and a nice refreshing break from all the blood, metal and grime that seems to permeate gaming these days.\n\nThe story may be simple but the game's combat system has a lot of depth. There's quite a bit of different techniques you can pull off, with Arche, the protagonist, having a wide variety of sword skills that can be used to deal with various enemies. Sana and Stella are the mages, where water-aspected Sana fills the support and healing role with only sub-par offensive magic, Stella brings the pain with fire-based damage dealing. The AI scripting controls two of the characters while the player controls one--you can swap between them on the fly in the middle of a fight and it feels like the developer expected swapping character control to be a major facet of gameplay.\n\nSo what's the problem, you might ask? How is Fortune Summoners broken, if it has no major bugs and seems to be a cute little Japanese indie title?\n\nTwo words: difficulty and controls.\n\nFortune Summoners suffers from the absolute worst difficulty curve I've ever seen in any game I've ever played. Part of the problem here is that everything is so extreme. Arche can take a reasonable amount of punishment, but when she does damage she might as well be wielding a feather instead of a sword. Even basic enemies at-level can take such an enormous number of hits before they go down. It's simply tedious. Sana and Stella have the defense of wet tissue paper and enemies can rapidly kill them, especially since all of their best offensive powers--their magic, of course--takes some time to activate and any hit will interrupt their spell-casting. It doesn't help that Sana's first offensive spell cannot be aimed directly forward, but forward and down, making hitting anything at all nearly impossible without getting right in its face (and then being interrupted forever). The magic-users hit hard, but they also take hits hard and trying to set them up to kill things is quite a chore (though Stella does make things a lot easier once you get her on your team).\n\nThe difficulty of this game is beyond challenging and enters the realm of punishing. Monsters can strike you repeatedly and you do not get a moment of invincibility after being hit, so you can easily be juggled to death by a small group of basic enemies around you. The enemy AI scripting is way, way too tight--enemies will read your moves as you use them and dodge your more powerful techniques with annoying regularity. This, to me, is poor game design--if you want to make a side-scroller where the enemies are very good at dodging attacks and the skill factor is placed on precision and timing, you really can't also turn every basic mook into a damage sponge. That's just absurd.\n\nThe difficulty settings don't seem to do much, either. Setting the game to "Easy" didn't seem to affect damage dealt or received. Monsters seemed to still have exactly the same number of HP. The only real difference I could even detect is that you receive less XP from monsters (how backwards is that?) and the number of healing items that drop from slain enemies seems to be higher.\n\nThe difficulty curve is bad enough, but it's exacerbated and amplified, cranked up to eleven, by the controls. The controls in this game are an utter trainwreck. I've played unlicensed hacked NES cartridge games with better controls than this game. Movement is very imprecise and "slidy" with a significant amount of inertia to almost every movement. Turning around is slow, especially when enemies are hitting you (and, of course, you get no invincibility frames after being hit). In order to perform any of Arche's special moves, which you'll need to do in order to fight effectively, requires that you tap out a combination within a very narrow window. It feels like a bad fighting game in some ways, where instead of rolling your thumb across the d-pad in a quarter circle and then pressing Attack, you have to tap down, tap left and, while you tap left, also tap the attack button. It's terribly unintuitive and needlessly finicky.\n\nFor a lighthearted title like this, combat should be relatively easy to learn but potentially hard to master with a smooth curve from being able to kill the enemies and progress to pulling off insane combos and specials in rapid succession once you've practiced. This game is not like that at all. The gameplay is brutally demanding of precision and exact button timing to the point where the entire combat system feels like a giant disjointed string of quick-time events rather than smooth and fluid action.\n\nThe combat system in Fortune Summoners could be a joy to play if they fixed the absurd precision requirements. For example, you should be able to hold the direction while using the attack button to perform a special move, rather than having to tap both buttons within a few milliseconds of each other else the attack simply fails and Arche performs a basic standing attack. Turning around should be faster. Executing a dodge roll should be a single button press or a double-tap of left or right, and the dodge roll should yield invincibility frames for the entire animation.\n\nEven running and walking is needlessly clunky. To run you have to double-tap the d-pad... and it doesn't matter which direction you double-tap. I can't count how many times I've run off an edge and fallen into a pit in the middle of battle because I tapped two opposing directions too rapidly in succession. That should never happen; in a game with two movement speeds, you should be able to hold a button down to run or walk! The jumping mechanics in the game are extremely strange as well, allowing a great deal of movement while in mid-air as well as your run speed unaffecting your jump distance. You can leap over a large pit from a dead stop and trying to get a running start adds no distance to your jump. This is unintuitive and runs counter to basically every platform side-scroller ever made. The controls in Fortune Summoners are so horrendously awful and counterintuitive that I spent the entire time playing, all six hours or so, trying to intentionally forget the muscle memory I built up from years of 8- and 16-bit console gaming.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I really did. It ticks most of my boxes when it comes to RPGs and being a side-scroller had me feeling a bit of nostalgia. Cute characters, a charming and light-hearted plot, something nice to balance out the endless waves of "grimdark" games that seem to dominate the market these days. Unfortunately the game is, in my opinion, so frustrating that it's virtually unplayable. If you're in the market for a side-scrolling hack and slash action RPG, don't buy Fortune Summoners. Do yourself a favor and pick up Dust: An Elysian Tail, which has many of the same elements as this game (and more besides) with excellent controls and fast, fluid combat.","August 21, 2014","false","6.2"," 426 of 639 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","426","639","4","111"

Since then I've played modern games like Dark Souls and Left4Dead2, and liked them, but the nagging urge to alt tab the game and do something else was always there. But not with this game. What a refreshing feeling.\nI can play this game all day and not have any nagging urge to do anything else.  Its retro jrpg style mixed with modern anime design is so well done that I feel like I'm a part of this magical world.\nThe characters are all lovable and the dialogue is funny, and the gameplay is engaging and challenging.

It's not terrible, but you have to be willing to learn to progress or even the low level slimes in the beginning will kick your butt. Every character has various moves that are performed via short and fast code-like combos.\n\nMashing attack will get you literally nowhere - enemies react quickly to your moves. And they all play to win. If you just walk up beside an enemy and start mashing attack it's ducking under or jumping over and countering your attack with something of its own. The game plan ultimately is to catch them in a position they can't block or dodge - such as dodging around their attack to strike. The NPCs are alarmingly more unpredictable and fast to respond as the game continues so getting down your moves is a much needed talent for the player to have. You have to perform various moves as well or the enemy will catch on and start hitting via weak areas (normal attack is a simple overhead strike. Low range and no movement while performed - thus lunging or attacks that strike further in general would get through  your attacks easily).\n\nThe concept of the story and setting feel like something you'd see in a Miyuzaki film; adorable little children learning to be witches in a school for witches. Rushing around an old fantasy-themed world for the purposes of everything from class field trips to dangerous dungeon crawling (though it's all fairly dangerous considering).\n\nIt's cute and fun. Can be frustrating if you don't take every fight with some level of seriousness. Even seemingly weak enemies have a sense of self-presevation.","December 25, 2014","true","17.0"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","0"

Espechially about video games: Big companies will rain you with more and more realistik graphics, gameplay may resemble a sheit load mess of everything, big names actors and actresses will do voices, huge marketing... But people still wll play and most of gamers will prefer something simple, something that will lend you a hand in killing time. Think of this; Battlefield 4 may be bells and whistles fest, but would not your ather play deathmatch in Unreal? New Thief and Dishonored are hiding in shadows when original Thief and Thief 2 appear. Morrowind community is no less than Skyrim one. Pacman gets his HD remake, while Modern Warfare is a long dead with a bunch of lads still playing it (when nobody's watching).\n\nWhy is it? Maybe because before games became buisness, developers tryed to entertain their consumers with what gamers actually wanted! Simple doesn't mean easy, and hard doesn't mean frustrating. As opposite for modern games, they are easy or frustrating. rarely we can experience an actuall blast from the past, even indy many times don't understand what made games from the past so great -- they making games, like dem pioners of arkcde developpment. Of course past was not a magic land with ponies eating rainbows and farting butterflyes. But back than, experiments where conducting! A lot of games, -- masterpiece mind you -- where born as a joke, or with developers themselfs not beleving in sucsess (Deus Ex, Thief, Unreal, Rainbow 6, Operation Flaspoint). But did it matter? No, developers where bold, the where making games, not movies and not the same game over and over (at least on PC and early consoles). Now it's like there are 5 games, only diffrent wrap. And you know what... Oh sheit! I was suppose to write a rewiew or just my own thought about this game... How did it jumped into nostalgia and ranting?\n\nWhatever, a good old platformer-JRPG mix; Fun, challenging, adorable charecters and great time killer. I like it, and if you're into Platformer-action-JRPG with school gals as charecters, you sure will like this one too.","April 24, 2014","true","24.9"," 55 of 79 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","55","79","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrincessHime/recommended/203510/","PrincessHime","Ｈｉｍｅ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrincessHime/","249 products in account","If I were to keep it short : This game is an experience. A really good one while at that. And I hope a miracle happens that creates a sequel.\nUsually, I'm not a fan of RPG games. Turn-based, real-time, the random loot ones, you name it. I honestly despise the genre.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, I fell in love with this game. The cute art, the gameplay, the atmosphere and the brutal difficulty made me literally not stop playing it until the point where the sun is shining and I realise that I just played it for 6+ hours straight. I mean it, I pretty much didn't stop playing it until the sun started to shine or I completed it. At the time of writing the review, I had 27 hours put into this game. This includes moments where I got lost for a few hours and had to figure out what to do as I refused to make use of a guide.\n\nThe story and the characters while not really being that unique, completely work within the game and actually give it quite a bit of charm.\n\nAside from that, the movement might take a slight amount of getting used as turning around to face the other direction takes a split second. Along side that, you might want to adjust the run input sensitivity until you no longer can tap a direction twice at a slow pace to run.\n\nIf you're going to have doubts after reading this..thing, there is also the demo which I believe is the entire prologue of the game.\n\nFortune Summoners is a brutal game, it does not hold your hand. Early on, at least.\nThe whole brutality comes from the fact that this game is more similar to a fighter or a more complex beat em up game than an RPG at its core where you are more likely to focus on guarding or avoiding attacks via Arche's mobility or the other characters backwards hopping neither of which provide you with any invulnerability frames and only serve as a method of avoiding. I guess there's jumping too as a method of avoiding damage.\n\nAs such, the thing that you must learn early on is either to avoid/block things or to learn ways to hit your target for as long as possible to prevent it from hitting you before that. Oh and, the enemies will actively try to guard or if they're unable to guard, move out of the way of your attacks in the similar manner that you yourself are able to. They will also actively try to make sure you will not be in a position to fight back by mercilessly beating on you. No one will blame you if you die to your first enemy even if it feels humiliating.\n\nThe only help you will have at the very start is that there's an option to guard for you when you are not attacking, jumping or doing the dodge moves.\n\nThe main characters here all feel different to play, with there being some similarities between the two mages.\n\nThe playable characters are as follows :\n\nArche, the first character in this game that transfers in to the magic school, while she wishes to learn magic she is more capable in the ways of the sword than magic. Thankfully, due to the fact that she uses a sword, she has become rather agile. Alongside that, she is the most durable of the 3 characters and will take a few hits. Unlike the other two characters which primarily use spells, Arche has a rather large move set that expands as you level up. Some of these moves also chain together and if you focus on playing mostly her, you will have to make use of the moveset to defeat things.\n\nSana, the second character that you meet shortly after. Using the water element she is more of a support character than an offensive one. Having excellent support abilities but rather small set of offensive abilities. Unlike Arche, she does not have a huge set of moves, and she does not have a dodging ability until way later on in the game. Thankfully, since she is a mage, she has a wide variety of magic that expands as she levels up. Even if most of these are support skills. As a mage, she has casting time before she can make use of her magic.\n\nStella, the third character that you encounter much later on in the game. Using the fire element she is purely an offensive mage with minimal support abilities. Unlike Sana, she has her dodge ability from the start. Outside of the part where she is an offensive mage, and as such has mostly high damage dealing spells of varying sizes or usage situations. Her magic behaves similarly in that you select it in the same way and it also has casting time.\n\nThis is where the game surprised me. With no co-op multiplayer of any description, I expected the worst when it came to the party members. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised as the CPU is incredibly competent in combat without having strange priorities nor being horrible at following you.\n\nIf you're playing Arche, Sana will use her buffs primarily on you, healing whoever has the lowest hp first. If both of these are not currently possible, she will make use of her weaker offensive spells instead. Stella meanwhile uses her shorter range or defensive spells if there are enemies near her, longer range or homing spells on enemies further away or if the enemies are above her she will use spells that primarily hit the air instead.\n\nIf you're not playing Arche, the CPU for Arche expects you to fill the same role as the CPU you just replaced, in the way that she will leap straight into combat, making use of the sword moves that close the distance if she has them. In most cases she is able to handle any situation she is thrown in without much of an issue. You will however need to support her in the same way the CPU supports you when you're playing her.\n\nThis is the other and later method of hand holding the game provides you, in the manner that your party members actively assist you in combat. I can't really complain about it either because the game is difficult as it is and if the CPU was incompetent I'd probably just ragequit the game and never play it again.\n\nWhile the story and characters are nothing special, they work well enough with the art and the game itself to give it a unique feel while being written well enough to make the game entertaining.\n\nThe game is also adorable. Mostly because of the writing and the artstyle this game has as it gives the game tons of personality. The backgrounds, the character portraits, the character sprites and animation. The enemy sprites, animation. Just all of it gives the game such an adorable feel that it's impossible to not mention it. It's honestly hard to believe that such a cute looking game is incredibly merciless when it comes to the difficulty. While the cuteness might be a turnoff for some people, I feel that if this were the case they would've already left the store page upon seeing the screenshots. The music also adds to the cuteness.\n\nFor a game made by a single person, they have done a great job at making the game seem alive and fun to play. Not to mention making it completely adorable.\n\nWith all the praise I gave the game, surely there are some flaws. Right? Well, yeah.\n\nOne of the major issues I've already mentioned at the very start is the run input sensitivity, but that can be easily adjusted.\nOutside the lack of steam overlay making screenshots rather difficult to upload (Although, there is a guide provided for that) the largest issue is also the game's brutality, as silly as it sounds as I've been praising it earlier. Just like in a fighter game against the CPU, your enemies will be reading your input to avoid or block your attacks the very instant you hit the attack key, and they will also not hesitate to punish you for doing that. This means that unless you know what exactly you're doing or switch to one of the mages to allow Arche CPU to fight for you, you will have to stay on the defensive most of the time. Responding and punishing the enemy accordingly to what it does, rather than being the one to attack first.\n\nThis can be an incredibly frustrating experience and might be a huge turnoff from the game for some. If this seems like it isn't for you, I suggest you to try the demo before you buy this.","January 6, 2015","true","27.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","1"

If you've played some fighting games you'll feel right at home here, because with only the 4 directional buttons plus jump and attack buttons, you can perform all kinds of moves: slash, upward slash, forward slash, quick poke/thrust, jumping attacks, aerial attacks, running charge, rolling attacks and of course block and dodge/roll.\nThe enemies also have various attacks, that combined with a very good AI makes for some really fun and memorable fights, even against basic slimes at the beginning.\nYour 2 friends in your party are casters, and they can learn all kinds of spells to support you from the distance, or buff and heal.\n\nThe story is nothing incredibly serious or dramatic, since the main characters are little girls that go to school (by the way yes, you play as a little girl... that goes to school with a sword... how awesome is that?), but the dialogues are never boring and the characters are all likeable, and you're always wanting to know what happens next, and begin a new adventure... !!!...\nSadly, this is also one of the bad points of the game, because it ends giving a clear indication that the story will continue in the next game, only... there is no next game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimacj/recommended/203510/","ultimacj","UltimaCJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimacj/","214 products in account","As much as I want to recommend this game.  I simply can't.  It is a fun game and unique being a JRPG action based game.  The story is great, the characters are colorful and it's not bad in that department.  What it fails in is it's playthrough.  Some parts didn't make sense at all where to go next and some parts totally made sense.  I found myself looking at a guide vs the clues it gave me for my next objective, the game could have worded it better.\n\nAnother aspect was control.  I'm not sure about KB but I'd recommend a controller.  Even with a 360 controller, the control was sometimes very stiff.  In most action games I've played, if you have to button mash and change directions the character would usually do that automatically, here it does not.  You have to stop turn then resume your attack if you want to change directions.  A thing someone can forget in the heat of battle.  Also jumping/attacking just feels sluggish and inaccurate.\n\nFinally, the enemies.  While at first it's not bad at all; about midway point through the game.  The stupid switch gets turned on....BAD!  I've never seen such enemies become super smart on normal mode.  They know when your gonna jump (they counter it), they know when to avoid a trap just at the right moment, they know when to dodge, and know when to attack.  It's like super smart, I'm only human!  Also enemies are VERY relentless AND brutal.  They will chase you down, spam attacks, while at the same time predicting your every move.  Amazingly, it was only boss fights that weren't as brutal compared to normal enemies.\n\nI got this game for $10 and for the most part it is worth it, but if you can't get past these flaws.  If controller or really unfair enemies isn't in your forte then don't get this game.  On the bright side, the game is VERY forgiveable about restarting as you'll resume in the last room your in.  This doesn't change how I feel, doing this just makes the game feel sorry for you and is frustrating to retry something just because the enemies are brutally unfair.","March 29, 2014","false","30.3"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","42","63","0","3"

In this game, you follow the story of a young girl named Arche, who will learn new things, make new friends, and go on a grand adventure in order to reveal the secret behind a certain artifact, along with her hidden powers.\n\nWhen I saw this game in the Steam Store, it looked interesting and unique, so I bought it. After playing it, I must say that I really loved it. This is in my opinion a one of a kind game, which is a combat-based platformer wih an anime art-style, classical music and action jRPG elements.\n\nThe audiovisual presentation is really good. The music is really good, and is a joy to listen to. It is mostly made of classical-style compositions, which are definitely vivid and not generic. The visuals, bearing a 16-bit aesthetic, are gorgous as well. They are colourful are well detailed, characters are pretty well animated. The actual anime artwork of characters in the game is actually really pretty as well. The enviroments are varied, every area looks interesting and unique. You will travel through mountain paths, dungeons, watery caves, medieval cities and more.\n\nThe combat system is quite nice. The game is quite challenging, as the foes and level design do not hold back. Enemy AI will make them block, jump, evade and use attacks depending on the situation, just pressing the attack button repetitively without any other action(like with ettins in Hexen 1) will not get you anywhere. A lot of enemies require different tactics to beat them, so use you brain effectively there. There are even a few bosses indluded, be prepared.  Over the course of the game, you will have two playable sidekicks added to your party(and a third one, that is passive). You can play as one of the three people in the party, without spoiling anything, one is a powerful short-range attacker, second is a mostly healing mage, and the last one is a mostly offensive mage.  Don't worry, they definitely are not plagued by the likes of retail version Daikatana sidekick AI, they will not get blocked by geometry and will follow you without having to babysit them. Just like the enemies, they will do things depending on the situation. If someone in the party is hurt, someone will heal you with a spell, if there's a lot of enemies, they will use powerful attacks, if there's a tough enemy, they will use buff spells, and so on. During the game, you can adjust what the AI is supposed to be doing with just a press of a few hotkeys. You can set their behavior to follow you, stop dead in their tracks or just fight whoever they want without needing to follow you. What kind of magic spells they are allowed to use can be managed too, you can set to not use magic, only heal, use powerful attacks, use buff spells, and burn their magic power as fast as possible. You can also set the camera to be static, dynamic or locked onto an enemy. Arche, the sword using character, relies on not so easy to pull off button combinations to perform attacks, later in the game she learns more combos, making fights easier. Mages generally rely on holding the button and letting go of it to cast a spell, so playing as one of them an letting Arche go berserk could be easier for some people. There is also a quickheal button, status effects are cured before wounds, mind that. Don't forget that during battle, applying items takes longer time.\n\nThe game is a metroidvania, therefore it's not a linear platformer where you just hunt the exit. You will go around towns and dungeons, and look and ask people around to ask for clues in order to progress through the plot. The game often involves puzzles, where you push things to solve them. In some cases, the game might get too cryptic, but that's not that much of an issue. You can only save in certain spots, however if you all your characters get K.O.'d you are given the option to restart at the beginning of the last room you were in, or be taken to the last safe area you've been in at the cost of 10% of your money. When a character gets K.O.'d, she can not be used at all. The only way to revive her is to use a special item or return to a safe area, or perhaps find a regenerating spot.\n\nThe story, due to involving cute little girls, is somewhat light-hearted, but it is actually interesting and gripping. During the course of the game, some serious business will be going on, especially at the end. The game is quite humorous, some adult jokes are even thrown in, so the story absolutely is not bad. The characters have their distinct personalities, the main protagonists consist of an energetic, brave and spontanous girl, a shy, but kind-hearted girl, and a cynical, easily annoyed, somewhat selfish, yet intelligent and helpful girl, and a cheerful cute animal, who speaks.\n\nYou will level up and gain new items as you progress, some of them have unique effects, so make sure to upgrade your characters correctly. The world contains a lot of secret areas and items, look them up, they totally can be helpful! There's also a few sidequests, so after you beat the game you will still have some things to do.\n\nThere is also a bonus mode, where you can see the characters autoplay an early portion of the game without your input. Unique, but not very exciting, to be honest. There is also a versus mode, where you can fight against characters from your party(except that you can totally have four of the same character on the battlefield). It is either AI vs. AI, or player vs. AI. Can be 1v1, 2v1 or 2v2. There further you are in the game, the more features that mode has. It is kind of cool. You can have fun with it.\n\nGame does not support Steam Overlay, and can run in a window, fullscreen(with bad resolution for some), and fullscreen with border, making the whole game take place on a square in the middle. However, you can still use F11 to make screenshots, so for that matter you will be fine, check guides on how to inject them into Steam.\n\nIn conclusion, this a very great game, that sadly is not very well known. If you like challenging games, anime artstyles and not too serious stories, go for it and buy it, you will be in a treat!","September 2, 2015","true","25.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

This game is hard and sometimes frustrating, but if you think it's unfair then you need to practice more and stop mashing buttons mindlessly, because it's not going to work in this game. The good news is that once you start figuring out how to beat each type of enemy properly, it becomes incredibly fun. It gets a LOT better and easier once you get the 3rd party member and more skills/spells though, too bad it takes a while.\n\nYou will have to master the controls, your available skills (each one exists for a reason, do not ignore them), strategies for each enemy, item/mana management, and your ANGER. No, really, you WILL get mad at times and you WILL want to just jump at that little ****er with all guns blazing, but that will only make it worse. Stop, think, try different approaches, observe his movements, defend, and most importantly: do NOT be stingy with recovery items and mana. They are there to be used and abused. Do not expect to get by most fights without recovering or using spells.\n\nThis is looking more like a guide than a review..

It's a 2D dungeon crawler with AI companions you can switch to and fighting game-esque moves for main character Arche, many of which you learn as you progress. The plot and writing are on par with Carpe Fulgur's prior works, though there is a lack of "Capitalism! Ho!" moments.\n\nThe combat early on is centered around Arche and the tight swordplay she provides, with a heavy emphasis on spacing. Later on, though, the party acquires not one but two squishy mages whose heavy artillery evolves the flavor of combat over time, as some encounters become obliterated in a flood of water or explosion of fire. When Arche finally gets a use for that MP bar of hers, using it gives *everything* a radically different flavor.\n\nIn all, highly recommended.","December 7, 2014","true","23.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The party system and the AI for party members is actually impressively responsive and adaptive.  Your allies feel like real people, and are not often a source of frustration.\n\nThe plot is intriguing, and has an undertone of Magical Girl anime, but not the kind that gets wrapped up in its genre trappings.  It really takes care to construct a world and real characters that have a lot of dimension.  Again, CarpeFulgur's OUTSTANDING localization shows through.\n\nHighly recommended for action RPG fans, fans of quirky action games, and magical girl fans.","November 30, 2014","true","48.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Many people have likened it to Dark Souls, however I have never played Dark Souls so I wouldn't know. All I know is that I really fell in love with this game, and it broke my heart. Allow me to explain.\n\nThe story starts a young girl named Arche whose family has just moved into a new town, and she has enrolled in the local magic school. From there she and her two new friends embark on adventures around the countryside, exploring caves, helping people and such. There is more to the story, but I shan't spoil it for you.\n\nBefore I talk about anything else, I must address (as just about every review does) the controls. They aren't the easiest to learn and master, but it is possible if you just practice. One should definitely not expect to have mastered them without putting in at least an hour practicing against some basic enemies - you won't be able to beat this game by simply spamming the attack button - but I whole heartedly encourage anyone who likes a challenge to keep at it. The sense of accomplishment is well worth it.\nI should emphasise that THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING - do not let it's happy-go-lucky illustrations and music fool you. The vast majority of negative reviews simply slate the controls. I can only assume those players didn't know what they were getting into and just gave up without taking the time to get to grips with the controls. Coupled with the surprisingly fiendish AI it will take some time to master.\n\nNow, I have completed this game and from start to finish I was charmed by the characters, the simplistic yet elegeant storyline, the pleasant and atmospheric music, and the challenge that the game itself presented. You remember all those games you played as a kid, you know, those ones 'that you never managed to beat'? This is what this game was to me. It gave me a sense of nostalgia even though I'd never played it before, and a sense of longing for that time when you're just a child playing your first RPG for the first time, and everything is so whimsical and fascinating.\n\nSadly, this story does have a sad ending, hence my broken heart.\n\nJust as I was thinking that the game was about to explode into a larger world ripe for the exploring, it ended, and I was presented with the classic 'To Be Continued' message. Undeterred I sought out any sign of a sequel, and unfortunately Lizsoft - the studio that made the game - has since stopped operating.\nIn conclusion, there will be no sequel. EVER.\nThe three girls will never get to finish the grand adventure that only just seemed to be starting when the game came to an end, and that is how this game broke my heart.\n\nNevertheless, I fully recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience that retro-like challenge combined with a simple yet engaging storyline. This game really did make me feel like a kid again, and I can't say that about many games.\n\nJust be prepared for the gut-wrenching lack of closure at the end.","March 4, 2015","true","23.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I recommend the game overall, but be warned that it aggravates on multiple levels. Don't pick it up if you're not willing to tolerate the cons below.\n\nHaving said that, the characters were memorable enough that I think back on it fondly.\n\nPros:\n+ It really is just as adorable as it looks.\n+ The combat is more involved than the mindless hack and slash in a lot of Recettear.\n+ The animation has some cute details, like the way Sana transitions from a run to a slide-crouch.\n+ The soundtrack is fun! I particularly enjoy how it reacts dynamically to the aggregate difficulty of combat.\n+ While not particularly novel, the characters are robust enough to get attached to.\n\nCons:\n- It really _is_ as adorable as it looks. If you're not okay with anime twee, it might be too much for you.\n- While more involved than Recettear, the combat is pretty slippery. There is more momentum in platforming and combat than in something like Mario or Super Meat Boy. Whether this is a valid design decision or not, I found the adjustment period unpleasant.\n- The character system is a little shallow, as with many traditional JRPGs. All weapons and armor are direct upgrades, and only accessories allow for any variance. The maximum character level is 20.\n- Some of the better parts of the combat aren't unlocked until about 3/4 through the game. The "Full Moon" air attack is perfect for dealing with bee-type enemies, but you get it around level 17 out of 20.\n- Enemy variety is very low. Palette-swap-city.\n- My biggest problem: the story is unfinished! It perfectly sets up a sequel, but the (indie) developer quit the game business! I actually find myself wanting to know more about the world, but this is all we will ever know about Arche Plumfield.\n\nHints:\n? Block more. Seriously. Especially with those bees. Just block until they fly at you with their stupid pollen, then do the up attack.\n? Your downward stab attack is unblockable. It's also one of the few weapon attacks that mushrooms won't punish you for.\n? Watch a youtube walkthrough for the block puzzle in the wizard's tower. The lever on the left side of the room snaps the blocks into the grid.\n? You can lift most enemies off the ground with your up attack. A useful string for me was: jump attack, standing attack to up attack, juggle with standard attack to wide slash.\n? Play it with a friend or romantic partner. I probably would have quit halfway through if I didn't have someone cuddly cooing over the girls' character developments.","April 4, 2015","true","55.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","3"

Story is set in the country of Scotsholm and follows an energetic 10-year old girl Arche as she and her family just moved in town of Tonkiness.\n\nAs you progress through the game, two more girls will join Arche - Sana, a water-type magician specialized in support and crowd control magic (beware of the nice ones - Sana gains insanely powerful offensive spells near the end of the game), and Stella, a fire-type magician specialized in offensive magic. Those two girls can as well be controlled (and will be required to pass certain point - you might easily get frustrated once you get to those points without them only to figure out you need them), albeit only one at a time - AI will control the other two and WILL ASSIST you. Playstyle with each of the 3 characters is different, so you can pick whoever you're most comfortable with.\n\nWhy did I emphasized "AI will assist"? Because, unlike most games with AI controlled partners, AI in Fortune Summoners is great at doing its job. Girls will attack and defend themselves, use magic, assist you with supportive spells, coordinate their attacks with you etc. You can also modify AI's behavior - how often will it use spells (none of the characters regenerates mana), which spells will it use and other parameters so you can configure the AI for each situation.\n\nOpponent AI is equally good. Opponents will dodge your attacks, try to strike you from vulnerable spot, use their spells, parry your attacks, and do everything like human opponent would do. That alone raises challenge to 11, and on several places (beginning of the game, flying opponents, DAMNED HARPIES for example) it might get highly frustrating. Beating flying opponents is especially difficult as Arche learns Moonsault technique ("spinning sword in midair") fairly late in the game.\n\nControls need some time to adjust to. As you start with the game, there will be some difficulties in controlling characters - especially Arche, who uses sword to fight, and controls might seem to be unresponsive. However, there isn't any fake difficulty - manuevering through map and battles need a good timing on the button pressing, similar to the fighter games. Due to that, once you get a feel for controls, you'll just mow down everything in your path.\n\nIn conclusion, fun and interesting game. Graphic style might repel someone, learning curve as well. If you give it a try and some time, you might be satisfied with this hidden little gem.\nDefinite recommendation for anyone who wants a little challenge and nice story.","May 20, 2013","true","31.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The problem is that the AI will punish you for any normal action.  Jump over an enemy?  They react almost instantly and will wail on you for it.  You can't get a single string of attacks in even on easy mode.  They can, and likely will, beat the living daylights out of you.  Bring healing items at all times.\n\nOriginal:\nFortune Summoners is, from what I played, a good story.  It isn't a good platform RPG for those wondering about the gameplay.\n\nReason: It's the difficulty and the controls.\n\nFirst off, the difficulty.  The enemies can deal a significant amount of damage in such a short amount of time.  Not only that but they can knock you down or render you unable to even fight.  All this in normal difficulty.\n\nIf it were only the difficulty this game would be fun.  It's not.  The controls for the fighter are so contrived and stiff it makes even the most simplest of fights like a battle for your life.  I generally run past them when I am given the opportunity.\n\nAm I being too hard on this game?  No.  The game is making it hard on itself.  The first boss you will encounter will decimate you if you play the fighter.  Try fighting with those controls with actions that are hard to fire off.\n\nAlthough, credit due where it is given.  Their AI for both the enemy and your allies are well done.  Especially for the fighter.\n\nReturning to the first boss fight and letting the AI take control of the fighter while controlling the mage/healer.  The fight is much, much more easier.\n\nStill, I intend on playing this to the end.  But I am going to keep the difficulty on easy and I'm going to have the AI control the fighter for any available moment.","September 3, 2015","true","14.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Your main character is not a chosen hero on a quest to save the world; she's an adventurous girl who wants to get an elemental stone so she can practice magic with her classmates.\n\nThe game's combat seems very strange at first - I immediately noticed that jamming the attack button did not perform any kind of combo; rather I just kept swinging my sword in the same way. To combo, you actually have to use different attacks via directional inputs plus the attack button and chain them together. The fact that each attack differs widely in terms of attack radius, range, and speed means that every attack is useful in some respect, and makes properly performing combos and using them in the right circumstances somewhat of an art.\n\nThis is a really cool system that makes even the simplest fights enjoyable, and that's without even considering the enemies and their behaviors.\n\nEnemies are tough. The first slimes I fought posed a challenge, as rather than flopping around at snail-speeds and waiting five seconds before striking, they actually moved quite quickly, performed several types of attacks, and seemed quite adept at jumping to avoid my sloppy strikes. The game does not hold your hand in combat, and rather than coaching you through every aspect, it expects you to pay attention and learn. Yes, this game actually respects your intelligence as a human being - thank heavens for that.\n\nWithin half an hour or so, I had learned to be patient while fighting. To block, to dodge, to poke quickly at enemies with fast attacks and retreat, and to counter aerial attacks with well-timed uppercuts. It's quite rewarding to see your efforts to learn the combat system come to fruition, let me tell you.\n\nI haven't played enough of the game to give full impressions just yet, but I'm already having an absolute blast with the combat, and as someone who's rather picky about combat in games, that's saying something.","May 3","true","8.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

She then goes to a magic school then unsupervised adventures comes along...won't go any further than that summary there...\n\nThe gameplay is a side scrolling action RPG style. So I recommend using a gamepad controller and switch up some of the controls up. My only complaint about this game is that you gotta anticipate and time it correctly to attack your foes. Mashing buttons wheter it be on your keyboard or controller will just make you an easy target. So it could be a little challenging....well that and the analog stick to move can switch to camera movement which is confusing to turn back. So sometimes I have to close the game to make it reset to moving the character.

While I do agree the controls _could_ be a bit better, they're far from unusable. They're also not that bad once you get to them. The strange movement inertia on anything you do is annoying at first, but once you get the hang of it you can compensate your timings accordingly. I see a lot of people complain the game is impossibly difficult but I'm on my first playthrough on hard and while it's certainly challening, it's definitely nothing new to people who are familiar with "difficult" games like Ys and the like.\n\nAs mentioned in some other reviews, buttom mashing is a one way ticket to an endless loop of dying. Learn your combos and figure out what works on what enemies. What you can use on a slime won't work on a mothbee. What works on a mothbee most certainly won't work on a Cocorat. What works on a Cocorat won't work on a Merkid Mage. Each character you use will obviously require different tactics to use and with each character, your combos and tactic will again change depending on which enemy. It's a challenging game in that you need to be able to quickly execute, chain and modify your tactics as you go because rarely will you ever be fighting just one type of monster at a time.\n\nThe game itself is immensely adorable and the localization by Carpe Fulgur is absolutely fantastic. If you're like me, you'll come to love the characters very quickly. (And also feel terrible when you accidentally die. Whoops) The art is definitely a double thumbs up and the variety of character portraits for dialogue really add to the atmosphere and feeling of the game.\n\nOne thing I also want to highly praise is the music. I know it's not an international award winning soundtrack or anything, but the cutesy, lighthearted music is really enjoyable.\n\nOverall, just be prepared for a steep learning curve that'll be mercilessly brutal, but once you get the hang of it and you get the ball rolling, oh boy oh boy is this an enjoyable game.

What this game offers is an interesting combat system that stands firmly on the simple side, and promises beauty therein. Unfortunately for the players, it's control scheme aspires for clumsy and lands resolutely in bad. Not terrible, though close. Having played a bit using both a controller and the keyboard all I can say for sure is this: good luck getting it to do the same thing twice. The controls are so fickle and indescisive if it were a person I'd have speculated it had all its decisions made for it through life and thus had developed no reasoning skills. You get skills as you level characters, so maybe the controls refine, but I will never know for sure, cause after 1 hour and 15 minutes of straight game time, I'd honestly rather play ANYTHING else. Story is cute though.\nPros:\nDecent art stylings, cutesy even\nPretty nice soundtrack\nInteresting combat idea\nCons:\nFreakin' abismal combat execution\nBats are annoying, not hard, just time consuming and annoying\nMaybe TOO cutesy to take seriously?

When you're the swordsgirl, it's almost like Super Smash Bros. This is definitely not a button mash game, and the game is most rewarding when you improvise your combos. As with most RPGs, you can always grind if it gets too difficult, which doesn't seem long if you see it as an opportunity to hone your sword skills.\n\nThe thing that stands out in this game is the AI. Some enemies have perfect reaction time, which makes it seem like they can predict your moves and counter whatever you do. If you like learning enemy patterns and countering them, this is the game for you. Even if you suck, your allies are strong enough that they can bail you out.\n\nMoney is plentiful in the game, so you can always adventure with good healing items. You'll still need to save up for better equipment, though. You won't have to worry about permanently missing any items, but a walkthrough will make sure you get them all. In fact, I highly suggest using one with maps for the dungeons. I find myself going in circles a lot because I forget where I had already explored.\n\nThe cute art and dialogue makes up for its lackluster plot, which ends on a bit of a cliffhanger. I heard that the developer(s) won't make a sequel because it didn't sell well.

The dialogue also has a nice mix of things. On one hand, it's very comedic (especially the "Holy Crackers!" line). On another hand, the characters can show emotion and they develop as well (Arche and Sana FTW).\nCombat is very fun with two ways to kill an enemy. One can use a sword, and the others can use magic.\nWhen you combine these two, you can dish out insane combos that can make battles very hectic.\nThere's also puzzle-solving, and requires your teammates to help you out on certain areas, which is a nice plus in my book.\nGraphics are surprisingly detailed with fresh anime-styled art well-animated sprites.\nMusic is also a nice joy to listen to. Whether it be the overworld music (second version) or some of the dungeon music,\nthey really fit the area they are and you can easily hum into them should you play this game for some time.\nAs for other things to point out, the game is challenging. It may seem difficult, but luckily, you're free to tone down the difficulty at any time. However, it's best played with the challenge.\nI do wish it had local co-op though. The CPU friends play very well, but if you have teammates around, it's also nice to at least have that. Then again, you can give them commands which can help in puzzle-solving.\n\nOverall, this game has become one of my favourite JRPGs of all time and is definitely a fun experience from start to finish.\nWhether you're a fan of JRPGs or the Metroidvania genre, you will enjoy this game a lot.","June 20, 2014","true","50.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art work is cute and the character designs are cute. The game story is fairly well made, other than the fact that it takes every opportunity to force you to explore a hardcore dungeon. I was kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the 'hot springs arc', the part where the party of adventurous magical school girls goes to an Onsen for a field trip and I was so keen on seeing the artworks for that but...\n\nI had to explore 2 dungeons before getting to the Onsen and guess what happens when I get to the Onsen? ****SPOILERS**** The Onsen is dry... ****SPOILERS END**** Now here we go to explore a few more dungeons. I stopped playing for quite a while after that.\n\nIt may sound easy to you, 'pfffft... a few school girls clearing dungeons, it'll just be one of those easy Japanese made weeaboo games.' Well, you are wrong, for the most part. There is a reason why I chose to call this game "Kawaii Souls". Because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥, therefore I hereby make a Dark Souls reference. I play on normal and the monsters are so hard to kill, oh my god, I sometimes contemplate killing myself. But it's a good point, to some, the combat AI is amazing. I feel like the AI learns the way you fight, and calculate strategies on how to break the way you fight. Normally there would be a sequence that each mob follow in combat situations in other games, and you just have to figure out that sequence and you'd get through the game easy. But it's the complete opposite in this game, if you don't constantly improve and change the way you fight, the AI would kill you off, easy.\n\nOther than the amazing...ly hard combat, the dialogue and story is quite good too. The humourous and cute (omg the babbling Sana, so cute, kya kya) dialogues always cheer me up after spending hours trying to clear a dungeon. But sometimes I wonder what's actually keeping me here playing this game...\n\nOverall, 8/10 game with over 20 hours gameplay. Would play again.","February 5, 2014","true","25.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game uses animation based combat like dark souls games where you must commit to your attacks and the enemies will punish you if you button mash. The difficulty ramps up extremely after the demo but becomes more managable when you get the third character in the game. The ai on both enemies and npc characters are extremely good and often you will be jealous on how good the the npc ai is in comparison to yourself in the beginning. If you struggle with the main character if you can  press on and get the third character the difficulty curve is fair as long as you explore.\n\nThe game mostly killing monsters, occassionally solving puzzles, back tracking and finding items to stock your papa's store. the combat is very engaging and skill based, its often difficult to out level the content in early portions of the game because you need to collect these items called mark of heroism to increase your wallet size and level cap. The first character plays like a traditional sword fighting character that uses fighting game inputs to use abilities. The second character is a healer that has status abilities that supports the party that gets a heavy damage ability late in the game. The third character is a dps aoe mage and like the healer requires cast time to use spells but have weak basic attacks.\n\nThe game has some technical issues like buttons are extremely precise and it has memory leak issue with the menus with multi monitors. Also if you are running Windows 10 or Windows 8 make sure you are running in  window mode because the framerate will dip below 10 fps in battles.\n\nThe game is definitely worth buying as long as you pick it up on a sale, it has cons like a cliff hanger ending but there is a lot of heart and good gameplay mechanics to be worth the prize tag. a second playthrough allows you to get the all abilities of the main character earned at the start and a optional dungeon quest in the final area if you get the password at the end of the game.\nIf you enjoy the punishing combat of dark souls this title should scratch your itch.","May 22","true","52.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Totally recommend it.\n\nPros:\n+ The atmosphere of the game is very charming. The storyline is out of a fairy-tale book.\n+ Fun combat, especially when you got 3 girls together.\n+ Good companion AI, mostly.\n\nCons:\n- A little of going back and forth to towns and dungeons, but I find it ok due to fun combat.\n- A few time it is not obvious how to progress the story line, especially in town. You have to talk to a specific person (which sometimes not obvious if you did not pay good attention when talking to NPCs).\n- In later parts of the game, it can be confusing in battle when your girls and enemies casting several spells at once and the screen is filled with special effects.\n- Not much variety or interesting dungeon design. Cave, Tower, Dungeon. They all look the same.\n\nDesign choices that may irritate some people:\n- Limited inventory space and limited number of each item. This make the game more difficult. Your equipment and "dressing up clothings" are counted as part of the limit! Which I personally hate (I want to dress up the girls but doing so will be wasting space)\n- Timer when using item in battle (about 1-2 seconds). Again make it more difficult because in the later stages your whole party can be wiped out in 5 seconds. The game lets you restart from the previous screen though (and just record your party death number.)\n\nComments:\nMany people may find the combat a bit difficult, which is partially true. You have to learn enemy strength and weakness and how to use the girls' abilities according to a given situation. Some people complains about the control, but I find it very crisp and unforgiving. When something happened unintentionally, it is always your mistake in inputing combos. This game plays like a fighting game. Your skill is as equally important as your stats and equipment. I'd say that the combat is difficult but fair.\n\nAnother minor complaint is that in the 2 last dungeons both you and enemies are powerful, so sometimes outcome of similar battles can differ widely depending on the sequence of what happening. For example, I can usually wipe the floor with Orgs+Mages enemies, but sometimes **** happens and they kill my healer or mage first and wipe the floor with my party instead. Also, I lost badly in the final battle for 3-4 times, but when I won I won quite easily (without changing tactics).\n\nFinal Verdict:\nTotally recommended for action rpg fans that find challenge in taking control of combat personally similar to a fighting game. If you don't like fighting games you may become frustrate with combat.","May 19","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here goes;\nFortune Summoners is, at its core, an platform-style action-rpg, in the vein of games like Zelda II or Castlevania: SotN.  However, don't expect a feel quite like those; the graphical style and slower gameplay evoke something more like a very polished, offline Maple Story.  But don't let that necessarily deter you.\nTo make a long review short, I'll put it this way: The graphics may seem almost appallingly cutesy at first, but they absolutely grow on you.  The characters and story may seem pathetically shallow and childish at first, but they absolutely grow on you.  The music may not seem special (and indeed, the default battle music you'll hear often early in the game is pretty atrocious) but it absolutely grows on you.  The gameplay... well, frankly, it feels very sloppy and frustrating, but it does, too, grow on you.\nReally, that's the key here.  The gameplay is... a noble attempt to make your average sidescrolling hack-n'-slash much deeper and more involved than you may be used to.  In fact, I'd say it's rather TOO deep for how straightforward and, frankly, enjoyable, the rest of the game is; swordplay is rather needlessly over-complex and it can be difficult to pull off specific moves when you need them most, even with a gamepad and lots of practice.  But as you work your way through the game, improve statistically and most importantly grow your party, this becomes less and less of an issue -- though still somewhat of an annoyance here and there.\n\nOverall, though, I can't deny that this game utterly charmed me and once it was over, I found myself quite satisfied.  If you feel brave enough to attempt to overcome the flaws of what is otherwise a gem, I certainly do recommend it to you.","December 18, 2012","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

However, while the game may be fun, there are some major faults that must be highlighted.\n\nFirst for the good parts. Fortune Summoners has a pretty nice game concept, environment creation, and overall story design. The game concept is basically like a platforming JPRG and ARPG. There are some similarities, such as slimes, that almost all of these RPG games have. The evnironment looks very good and whoever crafted it did a good job. The story, sometimes rather lengthy with the text to read through, is definitly not horrible.\n\nHowever, on the other hand. The mechanics of this game were pretty clunky. The buttons were often not too responsive and attack motions were often Qed up inocrrectly if I pressed a button twice in trying to get it to work. The fighting therefore became rather annoying because of this. Another mechanical annoyance was that walking was so slow and jumping actually moved you faster than walking. Unless I am stupid, there was no run option. The final mechanical isue I had with the game was the buttons themselves. Why the hell would you combine two unique action possibilities into one key and not give the option to seperate them. The attack and use buttons were the same ones, so if you are holding a weapon, you couldnt even use anything easily without sheating your weapon. Furthermore, I could not figure out how to change the menu from f1 to esc for my life. Another flaw of this game that I thought was annoying was that there is A LOT of walking around. To complete one "quest" often required you to walk back and forth and back and forth. The annoying part is sometimes those regions had monsters that you had to defeat before you can even move on, which made moving back and forth even slower. Finally, it is quite easy to get lost earlier on in this game as they don't really provide you a good quest log with directions, but only a mail system which has a brief overviews of the beginnings of a quest (not really even sometimes).\n\nEven though my cons section is way longer than the pros, do not get me wrong in saying that this game is fun if you are searching for something like this. Overall, worth the play, but I would not pay a lot for this.\n\nRating: 7.1\nRecommend: $2 or less","May 9","true","8.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FormalityIndecent/recommended/203510/","FormalityIndecent","Soull","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FormalityIndecent/","97 products in account","This game is an… experience. I’m not even sure where to start with this review, so I think I’ll start with an address to something I’ve never felt a need to mention before: The other reviews.\n\nThis game is not in any fashion like Dark Souls whatsoever, and it’s very disappointing that this statement is immediately added to every single game that people consider to be even remotely difficult… particularly because it’s added for the wrong reasons. Dark Souls was difficult because it was punishing on your mistakes. When you died, it made certain you needed to understand why you died: so that it would not happen again. Failing to learn and making the same mistake twice would result in you losing your experience points, as you needed to be capable of reaching the same place as before, or further, in order to retrieve that experience. The game itself was not very difficult if you understood the mechanics. The swordplay was forgiving, the magic rather powerful, and the paths to victory were easy to understand and reach. Enemies had low HP but did high quantities of damage: You would die in 5 to 6 hits unless you built very tank-like.\n\nThis game holds none of these traits. Combat is very slidey, Arche constantly moves like she is on ice. It takes a full second to stop moving once you let go of the running key, and more often than not you will be running in-between combat, and even during combat in order to re-position yourself. The combat is nothing special either: as enemies soak up five to fifteen hits, even from the start of the game, as several other reviewers have mentioned, the enemies also seem to read your inputs as you make them, dodging with inhuman accuracy whenever possible. Leave spell casting to the CPU: Slimes will dodge the gouts of water less often if you don’t aim them yourself. As if these faults in the AI weren’t enough, you are knocked back whenever hit, and have no invincibility frames granted to you upon receiving damage. It’s very easy to be knocked into a permanent stun lock, and very difficult to avoid it once the game starts ramping up its difficulty and mob density.\n\nFlying enemies are a whole new level of hell. Even your aerial attack (up + x) will do a poor job at handling those foes, and like everything else in this game they will take seven or eight hits to defeat. Honestly I almost threw in the towel then and there, but I presumed things might get better if I moved forward. I regret being so presumptuous. Flying enemies only got mildly easier to deal with, as I figured out when and how to strike them to minimize conflict times. Right as I felt I had the game down to a frustrating but playable science, I encountered a boss fight: A skeleton with a sleeping spell that fills half of the room and must be manually dodged. Even though I could succeed at dodging, my CPU ally performed far more poorly at this act: and constantly was thrown into dreamland, before being executed by the skeleton before they could react. The skeleton would ignore any attempts I made to bash it off my ally, with my meager blows that did 1% of it’s max life each. A part of me considered if I should play the spell caster for this encounter, and when I tried, I discovered the game does a poorer job playing Arche than I do… and honestly I was under the impression I’d been doing pretty poorly at that. I lowered the difficulty to Easy after this, only to discover that I do the exact same amount of damage on easy as I do on Very Hard. The enemies also take the same amount of damage on Very Hard as they do on Easy, and as far as I could tell, their reaction times were just as good as ever. So what did change? You earn less experience if you play on a lower difficulty.\n\nI decided to stop playing there, having concluded that Diety difficulty of Civ 5 was a better put together experience than this is, and if I suffer a serious accident in the near future, I am positive my biggest regret in life as I laid on my deathbed would be purchasing this game.","February 23, 2015","false","4.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","6","11","4","2"

The fights are tedious, excessive, and way too difficult for a game of its design, the rpg elements are practically nonexistent, and the exploration is boring and uninspired.\n\nI will forgive all the tired tropes and lazy design choices, if I can slowly get drunk once a week to hack enemies, jump on things and level up. I wanted to like this game. I loved the idea fighting mechanics for the main character.. of course, they weren't implemented in a way that allows the player to accurately use them. Not without devoting your life to the game like you were some MLG player counting frames and pixels.\n\nConsidering this is an action rpg, there are two things that completely ruin the experience: terrible character control, and enemy AI.\n\nEnemies will lock their position on-screen if you move towards them, or away from them when they're not in the middle of an attack animation. Their actions are also reactive to player button inputs, meaning they're literally psychic. In order to win a fight--any fight--you have to game the system, and play each encounter like you were in a SSF4 tournament.\n\nI suppose that's what kept me interested for 10 hours, but the controls weren't built to operate at those speeds, and the player movement patterns weren't built around pixel-perfect actions. They were built around the ice world from mario. You also jump like you're Mary fkn Poppins.\n\nThere was an impasse I came to, finally, where the game essentially told me to level up more before continuing. I tried to grind for a time, then realized an hour had passed, and I had barely put 1 level on any of my characters, which showed no noticeable improvement in my fights. I could've kept grinding, but it's the weekend, and I'm not going to do work when I'm trying to relax.\n\nIf you want to play a game that does what this game is trying (and failing) to do, go play Dust: AET.","May 16, 2015","false","11.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realtimegamer/recommended/203510/","realtimegamer","RealTimeGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realtimegamer/","447 products in account","I tend not to review games I dont like, but I grabbed this one based on the >90% positive review and was left wondering how it got there... I tried hard to enjoy this game and searched hard to find positive factor but... I dont like it.\nThe main reason is the controls which dont feel confortable and often fail. Jumping and moving with precision are difficult because the amount of inertia given to the character with the two speed movement system (any movement results in substantial sliding when you stop). As a result trying to jump from moving platform to moving platform is more deficult then it needs to be. Another issue comes with the timeing of button presses to activate combo. You get a number of abilities for melee combat on the main character Arche they each have a combination of button presses to activate, but something in the controller detection is finicky and often they wont activate when pressed correctly.\nThe next big issue is the difficulty curve. The most basic enemies (slimes) will dodge your ranged attacks as you press them. It seems like your button presses are fed directly to the enemies AI rather then you position and movement and the AI will dodge every attack that is possible to dodge and if capable block the rest, To make matter worse when you do hit the enemies they have massive amounts of hit points and can soak up several hits even without blocking. Changing the difficult doesnt fix it either, it just makes it take longer to level up. Encounters in room tend to have about 4 times as enemies are their are members of your party and any hit will interupt movement casting and most attacks, but getting struck doesnt grant the typical momentary invincible common to most platformers, so often if 3 or more enemies can appoach you at once (even if they are greatly underleveled to you) they can knockback juggle you from full health to death.\nThe final problem that was really glaring was the lack of any direction on how to progress (you can see this even in the demo). The game plays like a click everything adventure game requiring you to talk to everyone in the room then building then later town in order to find the right que to allow advancement of the story (if you play the demo I'll save you a little grief before finishing it, when you get stuck go talk to everyone at the school). Although at first I thought this was neat by the time I got to the point where I had talk to everyone in the big city twice I was tired of it.\nSome things I'd like to mention that are good about the game I found with some searching...\nYour characters appearance and the proformance of their equipment are not linked so you can look like any custom change your bought/found without hindering battle performance, I really liked this.\nHaving to play a fighter style combat system and trying to time my attacks precisely in order to get a kill was entertaining and if the enemies only took a single strike it would be an entiretaining way to do combat.\nI enjoyed how each character abilities allowed your team to take different paths but I think it would have bean more enjoyable if the ability to breath unwater was granted to the party earlier then level 7.","January 6, 2015","false","15.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Combine that with a bit of floaty controls that take a while to get used to and I can see why a lot of people would give up on it during their initial hour of play.\n\nJust try to plough through it and and you'll find a charming and challenging game that has a good bit of length to it without feeling too padded out, though there is a lot of backtracking in the game.  I'd also suggest setting it on Easy and then working yourself up difficulty-wise if you feel like you want more of a challenge, since as I said, the beginning is slow and dying early will more likely frustrate you into quitting rather than continuing.","June 24, 2014","true","23.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've now played all of the ones they've made available on Steam and I can safely say that none of them are good. Recettear is an incredibly repetitive grind that punishes you by sending you back to the start of the game if you don't fulfill outrageous dues, Chantelise has the worst camera angles of all time, and this game starts you off having the range of a lemon and a magic school that is so poorly managed that they don't have the stones to actually teach with.\n\nThe story in this game was so terribly written, I have to wonder what was responsible. Was it the terrible translation or the fact that Japan just seems to be full of the worst writers in the world? The intro explicitly states, quite clearly in fact, that magic is common place. Everyone uses magic. Why then is the main character so ignorant to magic? Wouldn't she have had lots of exposure to magic before? Why then is the school fresh out of stones? Wouldn't everyday magic mean that stones are easy to produce in huge quantities for everyone to use?\n\nThe combat is an absolute joke. I already stated above that you have the range of a lemon to start with. Your first enemy is a slime that takes about a million hits to destroy and your character can swing about the thickness or width of her body straight ahead. Mix that with the fact slimes bounce around a lot and snakes lunge at you and you have some of the worst combat I've seen. Plus, it's stiff. On the way to "school", you meet a mage who is a thousand times more competent than you. Then she leaves and has to take care of some pet...by just standing there like everyone else.\n\nGame sucks.

Even on normal, beginner-level enemies can and will kick the dirt out of you. And yet, it's really fun! The characters are vibrant and enjoyable, and the story makes you want to continue playing it without taking any breaks.\nThe only real COMPLAINT I have, is the controls. The controls are very slide-y; you can't walk too quickly in one direction and try to stop without sliding on the ground for a distance longer than the width of your character. Also, the attacks that she can do feel very very slow, which makes fighting the very difficult monsters even more of a pain. You fall into the groove of it eventually, but it isn't intuitive. I've found myself just using the crazy sliding to get where I'm going, but it's still unpredictable, and sliding all over the screen is particularly dangerous when there are cliffs you can fall off of all over the place.\nA good thing about the difficulty and poor controls is that it's very forgiving if you die. If you die, it just starts you outside the room you died in. I think if it made it any more difficult than that to resume the game, it would definitely wear on you over time.","February 2, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You either have to play in a tiny window with varying FPS or fullscreen with 3 FPS. Becuase of this, I cannot recommend that you buy this game at this point unless you have a Windows 7 machine.\n\nBut other than that, the game is quite good considering it was made by 3 people tops.\n\nThe story is nothing special, it doesn't have a good overarching plot or any overarching plot really, you just follow 3 little girls and their adventures. What's actually good about this game though is the combat. Sword fighting just feels satisfying. It's one of the best that I've seen in a 2D sidescroller. And the enemies exploding into coins when they die... oh so good.\n\nThat said, it's a tough game. You should stack up on restorative items before you go to any adventures since you cannot make it without those. Enemeis are quite vicious and AI isn't dumb. Some enemies have skills that are similar to your characters and some have skills that are better than your characters. You'll need to master the sword figthing have a chance. Granted you can play as the magic using girls but until the end game where they unlock their big nukes, they aren't that useful or fun to play.\n\nDungeons being a bit mazey did get on my nerves but they weren't that confusing that I got completely lost. Overall, I had fun playing this game.","February 1, 2015","false","27.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's beautiful, with an elegant, cheerful, carefully-constructed art style that makes exploration a joy. The main character is THE BEST 8-year-old protagonist video games has ever seen, I'm pretty dang sure, and the supporting cast of family and classmates do a good job backing her up. She's funny, charming, surprisingly well-rounded, and insanely endearing. Playing this game was such a joy for the dialogue alone. It's kind of over-the-top, sure, but in a lot of ways this bunch of sword-fighting, magic-wielding kids feel like real kids, which I find refreshing. Slow-paced, full of little details, secrets, large environments and dozens of npcs to chat with; this is a game you spend a lot of time with and get to know slowly.\n\nThe only fatal flaw, for me, was that I eventually found the combat to be too difficult. I've never been too good at remembering and utilizing combos, actually figuring out how magic works, or side-scrolly action games. I was able to bluster my way through combat for a significant chunk of time, but I reached a point where it simply became overwhelming, and I quit, never finishing the game. That said, I'd like to go back someday, start over, make the effort to actually try and be good at combat, and maybe actually find out what happens to my favorite sword-wielding girl.\n\nEven though I wasn't able to finish the game due to difficulty, I still found it absolutely worth playing, and got a lot out of it without even getting - I think - more than halfway through. As someone who likes snappy dialogue, nice art, friendship, and magic, this game was right up my alley.\n\nNot a good game if you don't have the patience for a slow story, or don't have a lot of time on your hands (you can only save at buildings, so you might find yourself stuck in a dungeon for an hour or so, frantically trying to stab all the snakes before dinner). Also not good if you hate rascally kids or have a deathly phobia of giant bees (which I might have now, actually, having played this game -- I'm scarred for life).\n\nAwesome if you like your slice-of-life anime with magic and giant bees. Also talking skeletons! Wouldn't be a proper game without the talking skeltons.\n\n8/10","November 26, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are some clarifications to concerns some people had\n\nCONTROLS\nControls are excellent and tight, with just enough buffering leniency to ensure that your inputs go through as expected.  The game is easygoing enough that you can "mash" inputs to a certain degree and the game will usually produce the desired results in gapless chains, yet is strict enough that you will rarely get accidental misinterpreted inputs.  This is not 1f links the game, its probably 10f or more of leniency.  The dev went as far as putting luxury settings such as the ability to change the command interpreter sensitivity to dash with a granularity of up to 7 degrees and multiple modes of configuring keyboard and gamepad and analog.  I've tried playing the game for a while on keyboard, on a gamepad using d-pad, and on a gamepad using analog (PS3's DS3).  The DS3 analog is notoriously poor as a precision input device and I could feel its imprecision in this game with certain moves, and yet the game was lenient enough that I didn't mind playing on it.\n#CONCLUSION: People who complain about the "controls" are merely bad or want to turn off their brain and sloppily mash buttons with a mild notion of direction behind their actions, hoping that the game will let you cancel anything into anything and get away with it.\nIf you can't play a game without turning off your brain and mashing semi-randomly, I can't recommend this game, you will be frustrated.\n\n\nDIFFICULTY\nhttp://imgur.com/zIru7i7\nI've just cleared my first main game playthrough and my total party wipe count is 7.  This is normal difficulty.  Two of those deaths were because I decided to check out a place I was absolutely not supposed to go to yet and got wiped out instantly in.  Zero wipes on boss fights.  I played recklessly aggressively rather than utilizing careful defensive strategies.  I didn't use any of my permanent stat up items (locked away in the stash until the end of the game).  I rarely bothered to take the time to prepare before fights with the amazingly overpowered buffs sana provides.  I spent most of my initial dungeon runs in a low performance high efficiency set of settings designed to conserve MP rather than fight with maximum power, lending towards deeper expeditions rather than ease of combat.  Mid game buffs such as shield II and forcefield are so game breaking that they trivialize most fights.\n\nEnemies have excellent AI, as do your allies.  Both allies and enemies will dodge attacks very well, and have plenty of situational awareness.  Enemies will notice you are blocking and use unblockable attacks, they will notice you are jumping in and use their anti air, they will block and dodge your attacks.  In short, when compared to the typical easy game, even the lowliest of enemies in FS are practically a boss fight.  Not particularly a new thing if you've played stuff like dark souls or other games where enemies are granted good AI.\nLearning to combo will aid in breaking their defenses, as will taking advantage of their over-reliance on their defenses and reactions.  Feint a jump to trigger their anti air, but then land short and hit them.  Run in with a light fast swing, and if they jump to dodge then follow up with anti air.  Run in as though you planned to attack from the ground and they will attempt to hit you first, yet if you time your jump you will go over this and hit them from the air.  Most enemies that lack any way to guard, you can simply guard an attack and then counter attack immediately and they are simply helpless to do anything about it.  The AI is good but not so good that it will "read your mind", it is merely a shallow ability to react to your most predictable actions.\n\nEnemies do not respawn in a given room (bounded by a screen transition such as a door) until you go 2 rooms away, so you can take your time and clear everything out at a safe pace, and even retreat into a previous room temporarily if you accidentally bite off more than you can chew.  Once you have your other party members, in a pinch most enemies can be trivially defeated just by sitting there and blocking while they bombard the target with spells and ranged attacks.  If you continue to struggle playing as Arche, you can even even choose to switch to one of her mage friends and let the powerful AI assume control over Arche.\n\nStatus effects are almighty in this game and a real terror.  You absolutely want to bring a bag full of anti venom, and learn the enemy attack patterns that disperse horrors such as sleep and confusion.  Once you learn to avoid these their dangers to yourself are minimal but its more likely that your AI friends will still get hit by them which can be a problem (esp with confusion).  Truly this is the closest thing to real frightening difficulty in this game and it is still fair in my books since you can avoid these attacks (and with careful use of formations, movement, and prioritizing of targets your allies will generally stay out of trouble).  You will get an accessory that provides near immunity to each of these which makes things significantly easier.  There's also strategies like staying poisoned on purpose to make sleep less threatening.\n#CONCLUSION:\nAs I mentioned above, I got through the game fine with my half-♥♥♥♥♥ playing.  Taking your time with more careful playing and dropping the difficulty to easy will make the game even easier!\nWhether you are a seasoned veteran of the RPG genre good with careful planning, preparation and optimization, or a skilled action platform fighting game player good at skillfully controlling your character and making magic happen, the game is just easy enough that you can crutch on your strengths and get by with some difficulty.\nIf you have no patience, don't know how to set up your party commands and formations, don't know how to buy and equip, don't know how to buff up before fights, don't know how to use kite / space / make use of all your moves,\ndon't prepare by bringing lots of useful items, don't know when to run away, don't want to learn the strategies for surviving and defeating various monster types, etc,etc,etc... then this game is just going to be impossibly hard for you and I absolutely would not recommend it.  It is a difficult game.\nAs a matter of comparison I would say its easier/more fair than old school roguelikes, battletoads, etrian odyssey, dark/demon souls, etc pretty much any game that is supposed to be difficult without being flat out stupid.  So if you know about challenge you may want to raise the difficulty setting to hard.\n\nOPINIONS:\n100/10, probably the best whatever-this-genre-is I've ever played.  Challenge feels perfectly balanced so as to provide the incentive to play thoughtfully.  The level cap system prevents circumventing the difficulty by grinding which in turn removes grinding from the game.  Skill/spell escalation leads you to eventually becoming almighty, yet the difficulty ramps up via enemies learning to use powerful magic as well, leading to a satisfying follow through of balance rather than a game that is challenging in the first half and then disappointingly easy in the second half.  Story is refreshingly light-hearted, though it might not appeal to some as a result.  AI on allies is very impressive and can be further configured by enabling/disabling specific spells and configuring the party settings and formations.  My only disappointments are that you never learn a teleport2 spell to trivialize travel between areas, and the somewhat inconclusive ending that could use a sequel.\n\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nIf you know you're too lazy and impatient, I wouldn't bother with this game unless you have the background.","January 7, 2015","true","47.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let the graphics fool you because it actually fits with the style of the game. It allows the drawings of the character to stand out more, the gameplay machanics to be simple and understandable, and it gives a nostalgic feeling for old RPGs like Final Fantasy.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to understand but this is also one of the most difficult games to play. The monsters you fight in this game responds to how you fight so if you don't learn how to block and dodge you will be dying a lot. Even though the game is difficult it is quite fun because you get this immense satisfaction of defeating your opponent especially during the boss fights.\n\nThis game also does not hold your hand. Most games nowadays just guides you to where you have to go but Fortune Summoners is different. It just gives you the name of the location and you have to figure out where that is and how to get there. I personally like it this way because it forces you to think about what you have to do and where you have to go. It even makes you think on how you have to fight sometimes.\n\nIf you are not sure about buying this game you can just go to the steam page and download the demo version and judge for yourself if you might like the game or not. Save files from the demo can transfer to the full game so don't worry about restarting. If you think it is too expensive just wait for a steam sale then. I personally believe that this game is a must buy and it is a shame that so little people play it.","August 21, 2013","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to add upon that title by giving it one that better redeems the essence of this game: Light Souls.\n\nAlright, enough joking around. Fortune Summoners is a great game although the developing studio behind it, Lizsoft, has only publicly released one game before it. As I played through the game, I couldn't help but think of this as a cheerful 2D rendition of Dark Souls. As I loved playing the original Dark Souls, let me clarify why Fortune Summoners was such an addictive drug to me.\n\nThe plot is moreorless alright. You start as a child named Arche who swings a sword the size of herself valliantly against generic JRPG slimes. You're later joined by two other party members (which can be seen in the steam banner) who have their own role to play in both combat and story. Every inch of dialog is seemly spoken, as if this entire game is through the perspective of 8 year old elementary students. It has so much contrast with the dark setting that starts taking place in the prologue of the game. Each main character has a distinctively different personality, keeping each conversations fresh with some comedic moments scattered around. The side that receives the greatest criticism from me is the storyline. Moreorless, the story looked like it was copied from a generic shonen manga. Only having 1-2 somewhat big plot twists, I always saw where the story was going. However, this can be overlooked depending on the age group. This game looks to target all ages, with its flimsy dialog and pleasant environments. To an actual 8 year old, I'd imagine the storyline wouldn't be as obvious to them. All in all, I wouldn't play this game just for the story but it's definitely not a reason to drop the game.\n\nThe setting and music of this game is both pleasant and fitting. Like most game worlds, you don't recognize how great these things are until you realize that you've been playing for 6 hours straight. The setting is nicely drawn and clearly shows that a great amount of work has been put into every grassfield, dungeon, and household. Similar to other JRPGs, there are a variety of NPCs that bring depth and immersion into the game world. For the average player however, it seems that they'd skip past all the NPCs and focus only on the storyline. This seems like a poor playstyle, as that player will be less immersed in the world than a player who plays Fortune Summoners thoroughly. In that sense, it forces the player to adopt one playstyle which moreorless determines how immersed you are; directly affecting how much playtime you'll get out of this game. Esentially my point is that if you don't have the time to be playin this game, DON'T. It can be magical adventure with information about the world pouring into your soul every minute of gameplay, or a dull shonen manga with nothing else. The music fits this pleasant magical tale experienced by several 8 year old girls (and later some flying rabbit). The music system dynamically changes songs perfectly in tune with the gameplay, adding more immersion into the entire setting. Overall, the setting and music of Fortune Summoners is something to look forward to.\n\nNow the most controversial but most entertaining portion of the game: The combat. This factor defines why Fortune Summoners can be refferred to as Light Souls. If you live under a pineapple and don't know what I'm referring to, a title namely "Dark Souls" is often seen from a large majority as an insanely hard triple A title that requires a greater amount of concentration than the average modern game. The change in "light" refers to the plot, setting, and music experienced through 8 year old girls in a diverse amount of friendly towns, unlike Dark Souls' apocalyptic setting. The similarity between the two is the difficulty of combat. The controls for our protagonist Arche feel extremely clunky and difficulty to learn, as should be swinging a blunt sword the size of herself. However, it's extremely satisfying to kill your first slime as you learn the basic mechanics of combat (react/counterattack) instead of trying to button mash which can easily get you through other fighting games. Combat controls are in-depth and as you come to use a gallery of combos to fight off new enemies, it feels greatly accomplishing to do so. Each new level has at least one new enemy, which doesn't seem too great in terms of enemy variety, but makes up for it with the hardest AI I've ever experienced. Enemies read your inputs like clairvoyance, yet the combat is still amazing as there is always an optimal way to fight each and everyone one of them by taking only minimal damage. When you progress to the stage of group fights, the AI is usually competent (depending on your command mode) and alot of !!FUN!! pursues as you learn how to fight group as a group instead of solo. And just when you thought you've fought off the hardest enemy archetype there is, a new one appears and it's even worse. The combat is insanely challenging, but extremely satisfying once you've started to master it.\n\nThe controversy with the combat comes in when judging how difficult a game should be. Dark Souls enjoys popular acclaim as being "insanely difficult", while multiple negative reviews about Fortune Summoners criticizes the steep learning curve and intense difficulty of the game. Therefore, I say this to any future buyers of Fortune Summoners.\n\nDON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A DAMN CHALLENGE.\n\nIf you're expecting this game to be as easy as any other modern platformer, it's likely that you'll repeatedly die 20+ times ON THE WAY TO AND FROM SCHOOL. If you're not going to be concentrated in learning the mechanics of this game and learning the enemies' attack patterns, you're going to drop this game before the 1 hour mark. THIS GAME WILL BE CHALLENGING. Dark Souls never told its players how to play its own game, yet is an exceptional game simply because the learning experience of how to approach each enemy is so enticing. And if you're telling me pressing ONE MORE BUTTON than Dark Souls to roll backwards is "too complex", then I have no hope for future games that hope to bring the difficulty of games from the 90s back in a modern fashion.\n\nYes, this game is hard. Maybe even harder than Dark Souls (for me it was). But please give this game a try. Its negative reviews make Fortune Summoners look underrated with most of its complaints being directed to the difficulty. Personally, I enjoyed all 35 hours of my first playthrough because there was that difficulty factor to it. Without it, this game would be a simple button masher hack and slash. In conclusion, I fully recommend you try this game out (there's even a demo!) as long as you're prepared to suffer a bit of your confidence to play video games. I'll repeat this statement the fifthteenth time in this review: this game will be an insta-drop if you don't challenge yourself to beat it.\n\nOh, and I recommend choosing the hard difficulty for maximum !!FUN!!.\n\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nAs it's commonly experienced, Windows 8.1 is a piece of trash when it deals with literally every video game out there. I had to download DXGL which supposedley fixes the DirectDraw issues with Windows 8 and list the executable for Fortune Summoners (sotes.exe) inside DXGL. It still runs (sadly) at around 40 frames per second normally although a game with "this" amount of graphics usually runs at 90 frames for me. I still recommend you make this game compatible for your computer (although it'll be a greater hassel than any other modern game out there) because it's well worth your effort. There's alot of content in this game that I haven't even explored although I've beaten the game, and it's a great challenge to those who look forward to it.","February 28, 2015","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Using JoyToKey to simply emulate keyboard presses on your controller is the way to go.  The built in controller settings to the game really suck.**\n\nI deeply enjoyed this game, thought I confess it had me very frustrated at times.  The combat requires a much higher degree of skill than the cutesy graphics would lead you to believe otherwise, but, you still learn to appreciate the depth of play.  Once you get a handle on things, it's very satisfying to properly execute maneuvers.  Throughout many of the games areas and dungeons, I often felt threated and had to keep sharp in order to avoid an untimely death.  There were a couple of times where it was difficult to determine where to go next, however, if you are committed to putting in some effort into exploring, you can figure it out.

Also the game crashes sometimes if I switch to a different application and then try to switch back to the game, which can lose me a lot of progress if I am deep in a dungeon where there are no save points or fast travel.\n\nIf they made a sequel/successor I would definitely purchase it.","January 8, 2015","true","44.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a very classic feel to it, but the art design and sound assets are by no means dated.\n\nThis game is hard and even brutal at times though it stays fair due to it's very respondsive combat system, which I'd think is best compared to something like street fighter, however this does mean\nthat skill is required. Charging in on enemies will result in death and to be honest some early monsters were a tad too fast and precise in their strikes, for me at least.\n\nThe game's translation is good as well, to where you're not able to tell it's origin off the bat.\nStory-wise it's nothing ground breaking yet satisfying enough.\nCharacters feel alive though each and every one of them represent a stereotype or some form or another.\nYou'll most likely find yourself saying "Oh the silent and strong one, oh the airhead but everyone loves her type", which I'm not too fond of.\n\nIt will not hold your hand on the way through, expect to a decent amount of backtracking unless ofcourse you are using a guide/walkthrough of which there are a few good ones.\n\nI do recommend it, BUT only if you happen to like it's art style and are looking for a simple yet enjoyable Castlevania/Metroid style of game.\n\nThe best recommendation is of course made by yourself. This game, unlike many others nowadays, features a demo which will reveal exactly what this game is all about. Since the download for it is so very small and you can actually continue where you left off once you do purchase it, you simply must try it before a purchase.","July 21, 2012","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game even allows me the be the blue one. Whenever I watch the magical girl animes on the TVs, my favorite is always the blue ones. Whenever you push a block in this game, the main character makes a lewd groan, but its not lewd, because that would be innappropiate for someone her age, you pervert. One thing amgical anime girls like to do is eat lots of sweets. When I eat lots of sweets, my parents like to remind me of my imminent diabetic coma. Magical girls never have to worry about diabetes because of all the magic. I think that all girls are magical except for the ones who stop talking to me on facebook. I swear I haven't been doing anything creepy or disgusting to their facebook pages but they never responde to my funny jokes. There was thiis one time I was said to a girl "that dress is pretty can i borrow it? lel" on facebook and I had to  AIM (AOL(America On-Line (Its an old ISP(Internet Service Provider)) Instant Messanger)) her 3 times before she got the joke. The joke is that I would wear the dress which is funny because I'm a guy and that would be weird. Get it? I know right? Maybe she is just slow. I can understand. I'm pretty slow alot of times too.

Don't let the graphics fool you because it actually fits with the style of the game. It allows the drawings of the character to stand out more, the gameplay machanics to be simple and understandable, and it gives a nostalgic feeling for old RPGs like Final Fantasy.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to understand but this is also one of the most difficult games to play. The monsters you fight in this game responds to how you fight so if you don't learn how to block and dodge you will be dying a lot. Even though the game is difficult it is quite fun because you get this immense satisfaction of defeating your opponent especially during the boss fights.\n\nThis game also does not hold your hand. Most games nowadays just guides you to where you have to go but Fortune Summoners is different. It just gives you the name of the location and you have to figure out where that is and how to get there. I personally like it this way because it forces you to think about what you have to do and where you have to go. It even makes you think on how you have to fight sometimes.\n\nIf you are not sure about buying this game you can just go to the steam page and download the demo version and judge for yourself if you might like the game or not. Save files from the demo can transfer to the full game so don't worry about restarting. If you think it is too expensive just wait for a steam sale then. I personally believe that this game is a must buy and it is a shame that so little people play it.","August 21, 2013","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat system has combos that are open and have room for you to play with, infinites ho~. The story is long and there's a versus mode.

You might find the battle controls a bit difficult at first but you will quickly get a good grip and feel of it especially if you know the different moves (which are all listed in the menu and easy to execute). One issue i have though is a gradual slowdown in menu navigation the more you keep opening the menu (F1) after hours of gameplay. As a software developer, i suspect it is a severe memory leak taking place in the underlying menu code framework. But once you close the menu it performs alright. As a workaround minimize opening the menu or restart the game once an hour or so lol. Others have claimed that if you have multiple monitors running and disable them, the problem is resolved, which is kind of weird though. well just try it.

Like it is often the case the game has a soul but execution is obscure.\nIn this case the game uses obsolate direct draw, which you'd see mostly in the previous millenia graphics. Because of it the game is unplayable with modern OS. The game runs properly if you install some unofficial random files, which works some black magic to get the game working properly. While I'm pro black magic, I always find installing random files, which content I'm not aware of, more or less dubious. In my opinion the game shouldn't be sold in Steam at all, because it doesn't work without extra files that have to be searched from the net.\n\nBut about the game. Besides the awful awful direct draw the game is great. I haven't ever seen this good pacing in a rpg. You don't get overlevelled and progressing in the story unlocks different characters and abilities in a pace that keep the gameplay fresh. The game is very story centered and there might be a serious person in the world who isn't interested about adventure of three (magic) elementary school student. Some times you play with one of the character's and later on you'll get two followers at the same time. The character played can be changed anytime (if you have followers) and the others left to AI, which does good job (better than I did).\n\nThe game is designed for keyboard and there isn't enough buttons for controller to obtain all functionality. This means that the keyboard is needed even if played with controller (as I did). For example playing mages may be quite gimmicky when controller only has one button for cycling through 10 spells.\n\nBesides the stupid direct draw, enjoyed immensely.","June 9, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even on normal, beginner-level enemies can and will kick the dirt out of you. And yet, it's really fun! The characters are vibrant and enjoyable, and the story makes you want to continue playing it without taking any breaks.\nThe only real COMPLAINT I have, is the controls. The controls are very slide-y; you can't walk too quickly in one direction and try to stop without sliding on the ground for a distance longer than the width of your character. Also, the attacks that she can do feel very very slow, which makes fighting the very difficult monsters even more of a pain. You fall into the groove of it eventually, but it isn't intuitive. I've found myself just using the crazy sliding to get where I'm going, but it's still unpredictable, and sliding all over the screen is particularly dangerous when there are cliffs you can fall off of all over the place.\nA good thing about the difficulty and poor controls is that it's very forgiving if you die. If you die, it just starts you outside the room you died in. I think if it made it any more difficult than that to resume the game, it would definitely wear on you over time.","February 2, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has insane expectations in terms of how good you should get with the mages in a few screens, and they seem to force you play as them, even though the sword girl is all you really have had time to get good with, but also in terms of difficulty of play, being a mage is way harder combat wise having little to no juggling or staggering abilitiy and you can be constantly staggered without a shield spell, which the fire mage has yet to learn if she ever does, you have to be super careful all the time, I went through like nine minor healing items just walking down the road, and you have to gear up and set out with whatever pocket change you had from before when you were the sword girl. And the crazy pricing as progressivly better pieces of gear get stocked in stores, I'm starting to get really fed up with it, Oh this new sword gives you plus ten damage a pretty good buy for 380 coins, oh but this one gives you plus twenty damage, for a mear 3800 coins. Yeah game, adding a zero sure makes it seem like a worth while buy, especially when I need it to kill the sleep spell bees that are everywhere now in less than five hits, while they can kill me in four and can imobilize spam me in a corner to boot. just once I'd like to have a full party and be able to safely grind for some damn money so I could buy the gear of the next teir all at once when it becomes available, Like your wallet gets massive fast in terms of coin cappacity, but you always need to spend money on something, whether its the plus twenty sword, or a new set of armor so you don't die as fast. Honestly in hindsight, I was really well off in the Shrine of Wind, I had all the gear I needed and a party memeber with a healing spell, I didn't have to solo half of it, only to need to solo the other half a few minutes later as a noticable weaker character, I was king ♥♥♥♥ of Buck mountain, now what am I, a little girl with almost no chance of getting to the bottom of this dungeon unless I grind for XP. I never actually noticed the XP thing until I had none all of a sudden as this fire mage, like, enimes dont give you much, but it's really not about the levels it feels, they help eminsely but it's almost never practical to grind for XP, if you do you will proabably be able to buy eveything in the store twice over from all the money you will get while reaching the current temporary level cap. Thats actually a feature I never mentioned, you get Level cap and wallet cap boosters from time to time in dungeons, they are the same thing but they do both, they also full heal your health mana and cure any ailment when you pick them up, so unless you are at the level cap and the money cap simultaniously, you should just commit it's location to memory and grind for a bit first becasue why not free money and XP and you can just keep going in the dungeon once you pick it up like you weren't just totally exhuasted from several minutes of killing mobs. But that has it's own risks so don't push your luck.\n\nAfter trying again as the fire mage I noticed somthing that actually I find funny now, they expect you to play as a character with a 0/5 combat rating, I gave her pretty good armor and a decent weapon, but its bit sub par for other characters currently, and it didn't give her even 1/5 in terms of combat efficiency on the comabt efficiency rating system the game has listed next to your level, I'm literally trying to do somthing the game knows can't reasonably be done, yet demands I do, ♥♥♥♥ it, I'm going to grind for XP now.\n\n♥♥♥♥ Wyverns, and yeah I know its not even the last boss, its the first boss I actually died to, meaing I reached it while underpowered, now I got to grind and ♥♥♥♥, I was like man bosses always seem hard but are never immpossible when I first get to them, this one wipped my party in less than thirty seconds, and it's pattern is all over the place so you never know if you are about to get hellfire rained upon you or crushed with a body slam. I was so damn close, out of healing items, out of revives, out of mages to sheild my body from the flames and pour water and fire on my wounds to heal them, and it had a pixel of healh, not a chunk, not a sliver a mother ♥♥♥♥ing Pixel, I could see it on my high resolution monitor thats how close I was to the screen as I died.\n\nAlso, this is about dying, if your party wipes out, you get the option to pay 10% of the money you have to go back to town and get a heal and can spend what you have left, or just try the battle/room again, I hope no one in the futures has to make the mistake I did, both count toward your party deaths which is fine, I don't think it affects anyhting, maybe an achivement. But if your party member dies in a room, say one that you needed them to get past, and you both entered with relitivly full health or mana or both or whatever, and you are able to leave and make a run for the exit, really think about it first, becasue if you die in that room you will be able to try again in the same room how you were when you first entered it, but if you leave the room and you die on the way out you will have to, try again in that room you just died in while short a team member while starting it over still short a team member, or pay to leave the dungeon. And paying to leave a dungeon is almost always more expensive than just exiting and going to an Inn, but thats why it's dangerous, and subsiquintly kind of stupid to try and escape with a dead girl in toe. Personally I've made five trips back to town becasue of this mage, and thats how I got good with the sword character, but adding another point to my (How may times I died)-O-meter and not having to go all the way back every damn time sounds way better, especially since I don't have anthing left to buy equipment wise, at least until the shops get a new inventory update, which will probably be after I beat this dungeon.\n\nYou might need too look at a guide for the stroy elements too, some plot stuff isn't even hinted at somtimes, I criticized a guy for not talking to all the people on a first impressions Lets Try of this, I know why he didn't but I felt he missed key elements to the plot that would have helped him find things he claimed to need a guide to find, but no, some stuff nobody tells you, like they imply for you to go the wrong way at times, as a means of getting you to explore and see things so you don't go, "Wait, I never got to go to BLANK." But the bridge was out so it's not like you could have anyway, and then a plot lady is there talking about the next plot wall keeping you from the next dungeon, so you back track and then you can't figure out what you need to do to trigger it, well turns out you were supposed to go talk to the old lady in town and get a thing to develop trust with the plot wall so it would confide that it wants to love, then you can distract it with the plot ladies love for the plot wall, didn't see that coming? Well neither did I, thank god some master of the mystic made a guide for this, or I'd probably never finish it.","June 14, 2015","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game looked promising. Charming and sweet and light-hearted, and I'd usually play a game just for the story. But this game is unplayable for me. The main character combat is bad. She moves like she is on ice, the window for specific attack commands is incredibly tiny, her attack range is incredibly small and the attacks do not flow as you'd expect. The game also has you do a ton of backtracking from the very onset of the game, meaning you have to fight the same boring enemies over and over, and you can't run away either. If an enemy is on screen, escape requires you to stay still for several seconds. The game furthermore contains the unneccessary mechanic of drawing or sheathing your sword. Forget to draw the sword before combat, and you end up losing a lot of health, try to talk to people with your sword drawn, and you go through one of the slow attack animations instead. The characters are also nowhere near as interesting as you'd hope. Every character fits perfectly into a checklist of characters you'd expect from a slice-of-life anime. But what finally made me give up on the game though is the game's lack of clues as to where you should go or what you should do. And with how much combat this game seems to promise, it really doesn't seem worth it to try to slog through.\n\nSo the short of it. Sloppy controls, lots of backtracking and flat characters.\n\nIf you want a cute game, play Recettear instead.","October 22, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looked promising. Charming and sweet and light-hearted, and I'd usually play a game just for the story. But this game is unplayable for me. The main character combat is bad. She moves like she is on ice, the window for specific attack commands is incredibly tiny, her attack range is incredibly small and the attacks do not flow as you'd expect. The game also has you do a ton of backtracking from the very onset of the game, meaning you have to fight the same boring enemies over and over, and you can't run away either. If an enemy is on screen, escape requires you to stay still for several seconds. The game furthermore contains the unneccessary mechanic of drawing or sheathing your sword. Forget to draw the sword before combat, and you end up losing a lot of health, try to talk to people with your sword drawn, and you go through one of the slow attack animations instead. The characters are also nowhere near as interesting as you'd hope. Every character fits perfectly into a checklist of characters you'd expect from a slice-of-life anime. But what finally made me give up on the game though is the game's lack of clues as to where you should go or what you should do. And with how much combat this game seems to promise, it really doesn't seem worth it to try to slog through.\n\nSo the short of it. Sloppy controls, lots of backtracking and flat characters.\n\nIf you want a cute game, play Recettear instead.","October 22, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get a party system where you can switch between the characters on the fly while the rest are AI controlled its sort of like Portrait of Ruin if you ever played it on the DS but with more party members I guess but the combat is way more fleshed out for the most part.\n\nThe characters and dialogue are all very cute and adorable but the game is still relatively challenging. I personally didn't find the difficulty to be too hard yet on Normal but I heard that alot of people complain that this game is hard so maybe it gets harder later? Either way I am having alot of fun with this one so far and think its worth getting especially if its on sale.\n\nAlso as a side note this game has a weird game breaking graphical issue with some Nvidia users but its easily fixed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimitrifryguy/recommended/203510/","dimitrifryguy","Dimitri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimitrifryguy/","90 products in account","My TL:DR review of Fortune Summoners:  Take Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 and mash them together into an action oriented side-scrolling quasi-JRPG and you get Fortune Summoners.\n\nNow for the actual review of the game:\n\nI just finished beating Fortune Summoners, an action packed side-scrolling adventure game staring Arche, a young girl with a dream.  I have to say that I really appreciate the attention to detail that Lizsoft went into making this an enjoyable game.  It’s got everything you’d think it should have and brings back memories a-la Magic Sword, Willow, and other exciting Capcom classics.\n\nThe voice acting is done in Japanese, but doesn’t take away from the experience.  The sounds are cute, and the music is pleasant, but does get repetitive after hearing the same battle song over and over.  The story is charming and I found myself excitedly loading the game just to experience the next little nugget of story in cute Arche’s life.  As a new father myself, I simply adored Arche, Sana, and Stella.  Though I wouldn’t have the same measure of restraint when it comes to Arche’s parents, I definitely played the game attempting to see it through my own daughter’s eyes.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  Absolutely.  It’s inexpensive, fun, and challenging.  The story and art style are worth it and it’s a break from the “norm” that most modern games offer us.  Like I said before, a lot of thought went into the planning of the various cities, quests, and objectives.\n\nHowever, there are some glaring problems with Fortune Summoners.  Rather than spend too much time with them in paragraph format, I will list them and then expand on just a few to be more clear.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent ‘genre’ graphics\n-Fun and engaging story\n-Good sense of humor maintained throughout the game\n-Levels are well designed, puzzles are polished and cool\n-Has controller support\n-Interesting “bonus” modes and alternate (New Game+) material\n\nCons:\n-Horrifically painful controls*\n-Dastardly deviously difficult**\n-Somewhat repetitive and annoying music (only in battles though)\n-A lot of grinding***\n\nOkay so let’s talk about the controls first.  I played the game with my gamepad (the one you can use on your Xbox/PC, etc) and it worked well.   The problem I had is that the controls are a bit “sticky” if that makes sense.   I’d press a button and not always would I feel like the character was responding with the same efficiency it should.  The controls weren’t bad in that they weren’t intuitive, they were bad because they just felt…sluggish, slow, and sticky.\n\nNow let’s talk about the grinding.  This is not much of a con to some people, but to me it was a bit annoying.  Like most good quasi-RPGs, the game offers experience points that allow your characters to level, and money that provide them with a way to buy goods and services.   In Fortune Summoners, the weapons and armor are expensive.  Not just pricey, but downright EXPENSIVE.   Like I remember a cape costing like 12,000g and to put things in perspective, one monster might drop 10g.  To be fair, later on in the game, the monsters are dropping around 100-200g per kill, so you can quickly farm them to get a few thousand.  The problem is there are three main girls and each girl requires you to equip her with the best stuff (trust me, the difficulty rant will explain more) and that means that you’ll have to come up with 36,000g for your three girls for ONE slot.  Then you’ve got weapons, armors, and accessories.  Obviously you can find these things in dungeons (as well as chests that have money) but you get the idea.  It’s grind worthy.   Levels aren’t so bad, as you can get those fairly quickly just progressing through the content.\n\nOk, finally, the difficulty.  When you first play the game, it puts you in charge of one of the three characters.  Either you play as Arche (swords), Sana (healing & support magic), or Stella (fire magic DPS).  The problem is that, this game does not screw around.  Regular level 1 snakes will give you a hard time.  If you like to button mash, you will die.  If you don’t block, you will die.  If you don’t pay attention, you will die.  Eventually, when you have all three girls you will play as whoever you want (cycling through them at will) and you will see the computer take control of your other two girls and play them MASTERFULLY.  No matter how good you think you are at video games, this game will test your patience.  More than once I wanted to throw my controller across the room.  I had to get up, take a deep breath, and sit back down and try again.  Nothing really “bad” happens when you die, you are given the option to start again or re-start in town for a hit to your gold (see above) so most people would just opt to try again with no penalty.\n\nBut I think the reason the difficulty bothers me so much is that I attempted playing the game on the “normal” setting for the first few dungeons.  Around level 8 or so, I realized that this game was a bit too hardcore for me, and I toned it down to Easy.  I felt ashamed, but I wanted to enjoy the story.  EVEN on easy, the enemies made me quick work of me over and over.  I’m not joking, either.  See if you can find a gameplay video of some of the combat for an example.  In fact, the first time I fought a kobold as Arche, I thought it was a BOSS for how well it fought.  Blocking, jumping, stabbing, flipping around, dodging every attack, counter attacking like a menace.  I was dumbfounded.  Luckily, magic does make things easier, so you’ll  enjoy Sana and Stella’s company.  Especially when Stella gets Chaser 2.  Too bad it’s right near the end of the game.\n\nSo at the end of the day, do I recommend Fortune Summoners?  Sure, I would, actually.  Despite the difficulty I thought it was a cute and amusing game well worth the price and definitely kept my attention from start to finish.  Just be wary of the difficulty.  And the harpies.  Oh god, the harpies.\n","March 24","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I can recommend this game. The hardest time is when you have to go solo at day 5 but after that you it should play smoothly.\n\nOld Edit New: Ok, if you "torture" yourself through the first 7-8 Days this games strongest point is it's Story for me.\nAfter 8 Days you have all 3 Party Members and the things get alot easier than before, it's still difficult but not ragingly difficult and you can enjoy the rest of the Story.\n\nI have not finished this game yet but so far I like it so much more than before :)\n\nOld:\nI would love to recommend it, but only for someone who likes Dark Souls with a adorable setting and story.\nI struggle very hard since I lost Sana cause she got "ill" and now I can barely stand my own without pumping out Healing items. The controls feel very unforgiven. And flying enemies, especially mothbees, are a pain if you are alone cause it's hard to get them into a combo.\n\nI am at Day 6 right now and my only chance to progress for me I see is to die my way through it, more or less.\nBut I like the cute setting and story that it pains me to not recommend it, as much as it frustrates me already.\nIf I am out of combat the input commands work for me. But as soon as you get pressured, especially when you fight alone is a pain xD","January 29","true","38.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I've tried various methods to get around this and it just won't work; I get maybe 10 FPS in town, and if I'm lucky 6 FPS in dungeons/caves. Needless to say such a handicap means only die-hard fans will be able to deal with the choppy graphics...Really too bad, I miss this kinda cutesy dungeon-crawler/action game. Plus it's 2d Anime-Style Graphics to begin with...but even Anime-inducing games usually get atleast 20+ FPS by comparison. Still I gave it a thumbs up because of it's charm, but no I'm not likely to recommend it if your using a "Modern" PC (I Realize Some of us still have ancient hardware so it's not fair to judge it by FPS alone)\n\nEdit: * - Upon Further Testing it seems this flaw only applies to Full Screen and Zoomed Modes, Windowed Mode i get over 120 FPS.","December 21, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Further, you cannot assign directional buttons meaning the control stick is the only way to move using a controller, and worse manuing ends up almost impossible in such a setup.\nHowever if you can play with the keyboard or wizard your way out of these issues.\n\nIn a game where you play a team of cute girls in a magical world. And creatures more violent than anything in real life are largely ignored because those cute girls can(and will) kill these creatures with mostly just minor annoyance. You play an adorable little sword weilder whos only desire is to learn magic, and man does she have loops to jump through to get there.\nJourneymans tip; hitting up and attack at the same time makes an uppercut, which does bonus damage to flying enemies, like those pesky bats who will be annoying as all getout otherwise.\nAlso this game is best enjoyed on easy mode, upgrading to hard once you want more of a challenge. Considering I play play on higher difficulties just fine saying "get good scrub" makes you look like an illiterate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nHowever since I haven't beaten the game yet I can't give a full review. So unfortunately that's all you get.","January 25","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a bit of aiming and timing required when attacking, you'll go nowhere if you just mash buttons since the AI is pretty competent. Looks very cutesy and this will probably annoy most people, but I got hooked on the old school RPG feel and you feel pretty badass wrecking ♥♥♥♥ specially once you get a group. The game doesn't hold your hand when it comes to quest stuff, so you can easily get lost if you don't pay attention, and sometimes you just have to talk to everyone to figure out what to do. I guess that's a little bit *too* old school but then again, I'd rather have that over being set on rails from start to end.\n\nThe demo lets you play a decent sized chunk of the game (like 10%) and if you liked it you can transfer your save file over to the full game if you purchase it so you don't lose progress. Definitely worth the price, it's a full fledged game.","July 21, 2012","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
