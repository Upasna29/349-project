I had no real expectations that it would be anything other than a relatively casual factory/automation sim.\n\nUnfortunately it really isn’t a very good game, which is a shame since it could have been something quite entertaining.\n\nI’ll summarise my thoughts as a serious of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n•	It’s fairly cheap\n•	Very easy to get up and running in the game – it’s quite simple and self-explanatory.\n\nCons\n•	Far too simple and the automation side of things is very limited.  Loading things into boxes only seems to work some of the time so I still had weapons spilling out onto the floor.\n•	The sound effects are horrendous.  I actually ended up switching off the sound after a few minutes of playing.\n•	The controls are very clunky, having to drag and drop things that have fallen of conveyor belts one by one isn’t much fun.  Would also be nice if the conveyor belts etc remembered which orientation you last had them in, although that’s just personal preference really.\n•	Very, very repetitive.  Really it shows it’s free to play roots and from what I can tell it’s been switched over to a paid model with few changes.\n\nTLDR:\nDon’t bother with this game.  If you really have an automation itch that needs scratching wait for Factorio to come on Steam (or buy it from their website now).  Failing that if you want something less complex (than Factorio) get Big Pharma.","October 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 83 of 92 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","83","92","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulan/recommended/374640/","zebulan","Zebulan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulan/","824 products in account","Notice: I had been provided a complimentary copy of March of Industry by the developer, Archive Entertainment, for review purposes. These opinions are my own.\nI entered March of Industry with the knowledge it would not take too long to proceed.  This wasn't a bother as the idea of the game piqued my interest.\n\nTurns out, March of Industry was nothing like I thought it would be.  Automation?  Assembly?  Capitalism?  These concepts exist at the most basic level imaginable, and this is where disappointment kicks in.\n\nMarch of Industry plays like a ‘Doodle God’ or similar style mobile game, where your aim is to take two objects and attempt to merge them together to make a new object.  This new object could then be merged with another object to make a new one, and continue this process until you’ve discovered all possible objects.  The manner in which you solve this puzzle is to place objects into a machine that either, by itself, converts to a new object – or merged with another object, converts to a new object.\n\nThe problem lies in the automation.  March of Industry claims to have automation of which there is almost none.  You must manually purchase your beginning objects, run them through your machines using conveyer belts, and then manually sell your end results.  The only automation that takes place is conveyer belts moving items through your constructed system.  Further automation improvements include the obvious: Automatic buying and automatic selling of objects.\n\nMarch of Industry also boasts crafting of your weapons.  Crafting was already described above: put one or two items into a machine, new item comes out.  That’s crafting.  There are no timers, no extra machinery, no secondary steps, no real puzzle – just put items in a machine and see if something new comes out.  Didn’t work?  Try a different item or combination.\n\nCapitalism?  There’s none of that, either.  There is no real sense of “profit” except needing to make money to buy more expensive objects.  Never does your money mean anything else.  Finally... play with your sound off.  Every time an object it produced, there is some sarcastic quip that is played *every bloody time* the item is produced.  Since the game driver is "make money," producing lots of items to sell is obvious.  You will drive yourself mad listening to the same audio clip over and over and over and over and over again.  The fact that there is no option to disable these, astounds me.\n\nWith major changes and improvements, March of Industry would be the Doodle God of the year.  Unfortunately in its current state, you’ll find yourself easily frustrated at the manner you play and the lack of sense of accomplishment as you progress.","October 17, 2015","false","1.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I understand that the design choice was to allow each play through to be around an hour, focusing on replayability. My disapoitment was after the first play through I found myself doing the same thing over and over again.\n\n\nPros\nIt's an automation game\nInteresting Non-Grid/Non-Tiled approach\nMod Support, but not really integrated into the game itself.\nHumor\nCons\nNo Tutorial or information on how an object functions\nVery short production chains (I believe the max uses 5 items)\nVery simple production chains (Combine 1 or Combine 2 items)\nVery little replayability. No randomness... (outside of one unlocked machine each new game+) Everything is the same, No Events, No Quests( Random Orders)\nOnly supports Just In Time Manufacturing, All machines are either on or off.

The fact that this game asks for 10 dollars with the lack of content is a bit of joke, but that's the least of this games problem at time. The interface is very selective of what it allows you to do: and at times that makes the management part of the game really really frustrating. In a game that's made to manage a factory. You see the problem here. The game's “replayability” factor to me is a joke, as while the main game can be beaten in 30 minutes. But the “new game +” is barely an addition to the content, it just speeds things up. A game like Big Pharma knocks it out the water with its options, and while it's more expensive, it's return on value is infinitely more useful then March of Industry. It feels like a game in Early Access to be honest, a game that's not only rough around the edges, but really lacking in a lot of areas overall. An easy pass.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GkiIl4BD3E\n\nLists:\n+:\nIt has Mod support?\nI mean it's a good concept at its core....The automation is a tiny bit interesting.\nI guess figuring out the combinations can be fun.....\n-:\nWhile the game touts replayability, the lack of content here becomes apparently quickly, especially for the price point in question. It's almost like the mod support was there just to add content for the game that the developer didn't have at the core.\nA really clunky interface that fights you more then it helps you. Feels like it wasn't designed for the game in mind. Trying to grab one item at times can be really freaking hard, harder then it should be.\nNew Game +? More like New Game. It's really the same thing. There's a small benefit, but it really doesn't change gameplay that much.\nThe sound design/lolrandom elements get really freaking annoying very quickly. Your ears will bleed.\nMultiple items on the same location makes no sense whatsoever especially as it doesn't really indicate that visually.\nGive the options like speeding up at the start. There's no reason to hold it back.\nNeeded added functionality to help the factor elements of the game, like the ability to stop production lines and add switches into it.\nRather ugly at times.\nI'm just going to come out and say it: How is this game a 10 dollar game? It doesn't justify the price at any point.","December 30, 2015","false","1.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Simply, you have resources that you put into "input machines" which become new resources. These new resources mix in various combinations with other resources with the ultimate goal of creating weapons which you can then sell. However, this isn't just about experimenting with resources, it's about efficiency and automation and your ultimate goal is to have a fully functioning factory that requires very little input from the player. Slap on a slightly, command and conquer-esque Soviet aesthetic and you have March of Industry.\n\nHonestly, I find the core concepts to be a ton of fun and it's actually rather engaging and addicting trying to find new weapon combinations but there is just not enough content here for any type of extended play. Graphically, it's your usual 16 bit, pixelized look and the game becomes rather challenging rather quickly. Thankfully, the game isn't overly punishing and you should be able to rectify any mistakes you make without too much fear of having to start over. Then again, if you make a lot of mistakes then you've very little choice but to start your business all over again.\n\nAfter extended playing, I've found there are a couple of negative issues. First, is the sound can get really annoying really quickly. If you sell items one by one, you have the "narrator" looping so you'll probably end up turning the sound off altogether anyway. Secondly, when resources get bunched up in your input machines, they get cluttered really badly and you have to select the resources one by one... which is sort of a pain in the ♥♥♥. It'd be nice if the dev could add a double click feature which lets you select all of one resource in a general area or something. The worst problem is an almost complete lack of replayability. Sure you are suggested to restart your factories multiple times but what's the point? If I didn't enjoy the core game concepts so much, this would almost be a complete deal breaker.\n\nAll in all, it's simple and it's fun. 9.99 isn't a bad price but for the current content, I'd like to see that price go down to about 4.99 or there to be some additional content because the current version of the game can be beat in only a few hours..

While the theme was kind of disappointing I had fun with the game. If you like assembling complex "machines" and games that rely heavily on crafting you should enjoy March of Industry. If after looking at the game you are interested in it I think you should enjoy it. With the ability for anyone to create their own materials and weapons there are a lot of possibilities for the game.\n\nA couple issues keep March of Industry from being great though.\n\nI wish the game gave you more control over how materials moved through your factories. Materials tend to get stuck in the conveyor belts too often. If you had more control over when materials would be released into your machines this problem could be solved. While this issue doesn't ruin the game it is kind of a hassle to keep unclogging your machines.\n\nThe other issue is that the game doesn't really have much of a structure to it. The game doesn't really have traditional missions. You pretty much just build assembly lines which get you more money to build more assembly lines. Once you reach a certain amount of money you can move to a new factory that provides an additional machine but that is the only thing that changes. If you can't get enjoyment out of making assembly lines without working towards a goal you might tire of the game kind of quickly since it can get repetitive at times.\n\nIf you like the game's concept and these type of games I think you will enjoy March of Industry.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

The game has that simple premise, but it’s actually rather difficult when you’ve just started. You’re not given the recipes, after all, but have to find out yourself via trial and error what to items make what.\nThe game gives you goals as you advance, be it in amount to earn or sell or what item to make next, and you are left to set up the machines and resources and discover what makes what and clean up the mess after on your own.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple as is learning to play it, the difficulty I feel lies in finding all the combinations, and then waiting for the machines to finish however many you need to sell to advance to the next goal. While I didn’t think some of the combinations were overly logical, I still kinda liked it.\nThe recipes you find are logged, so if you ever forget them, or go back to the game after a long while, you can always re-read what items made what.\n\nThe soundbits are repetitive and annoying, and yet they somehow added a sort of charm to the game. Don’t ask me why, after a while of having it open I just got used to them I guess.\nThe art is decent for pixel art, I rather enjoyed the fresh look that wasn’t cartoony.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, this is essentially a waiting game. And a rather short one at that.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but perhaps not for its full price, and definitely only if you enjoy the style of crafting/waiting/micromanaging game.","October 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

As I would like some more game content in the future, I will give it an honest review as the game is now.\n\n\nAlthough the game is lacking content from some of it's fields, the game would have a much greater potential in the future then is does now. Currently the game is immensely straightforward and it doesn't have much gameplay to go through. In the forthcoming of this game i would like to see more stuff get thrown into the game.\n\n\nThe graphic capability of this game is minimal. Although i do like the style of it, im just complaining, for example, if you look at the floor of your "factory" it looks like a bomb has hit it... quite literally. If the "develper(s)" had spent more time "developing" the game and put some thought into how your surroundings would look like, then it would feel like a more complete game.\n\n\nFinally, the game itself is missing being complex and over extent.

Wait, what did I say again? Ignore that part. But here you are, making arms for the Motherland. It’s a simple premise of test and build and sell to expand and reset to be able to build better and faster… for funzies! Most of the time those types of games don’t interest me much at all. I’ve played a few games based on resetting to get a bonus and they just leave me with a bad taste. March of Industry is a great example of how to make that formula fun.\n\nYou’ll start out with simple, basic materials and will need to work your way up to the more advanced ingredients and weaponry as you progress through the ages. The ages thing does feel a bit tacked on, but I get what they were going for. It’s just so easy to work through the “ages” that it feels more like a “prove you can work with this” test to gain access to better materials. Would that have been better? I’m not completely sure, but I appreciate what they were going for. The interesting part of all of this is that you’re never given any specific blueprints. That means you’ll need to figure out which ingredients make which parts or weapons and then sell or make them into more complex parts or weapons. Maybe for some players the ages will take ages to get through, but I would like to give the players the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYou’ll probably get through the ages rather quickly if you’re going to sit down and plow through March of Industry like I mentioned. If you turn it on for only a few minutes at a time, it will be a different story. The longevity of this game looks to be in the achievements and mods. There are mods for new parts and weapons that you’ll have to figure out how to build as well as figure out if they are more cost efficient to build as opposed to other weapons that you already can build. Achievement wise, the two that will take you the longest will be discovering all of the blueprints first and then maximizing the size of your factory. Don’t cheat to find out what the correct blueprints are, that kills the point of this whole game. Test and see. After all, “Discovery requires experimentation.”\n\nThese achievements are going to be tackled together for my play-through. It only makes sense due to the abnormal amount of money that is required to maximize your factory’s size. I plan on building my money machines and then just experimenting on the side. What’s a money machine? Well, when you figure out what’s the cheapest to build and sells for the most, you can usually buy the 100 packs of the materials and have a series of conveyors taking those parts into machines that will combine them and then send the end product into an auto-selling crate. All very clean and proper. So I just have to make sure they have the supplies they need and then I can experiment on the side while the money flows in and out of my coffers. If only I could figure out how to auto-purchase ingredients… I’m sure it’s possible…\n\nScore: Gewd/Tasty\n\nWhile it may not do much, it does what it does well. I am enjoying the puzzle of figuring out all of the different combinations in March of Industry. I’m not sure why I’m finding this so fun… but I am and I’ll take it. It’s all about fun here on The Backlog and March of Industry delivers for me. Will it forever change your mind about a genre, probably not, but if you can catch a good sale and you like this type/style of game, you should pick it up because I’m guessing you’ll enjoy it.","December 18, 2015","true","17.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played similar factory games, and most of them have a bit more content and a bit more explicit challenge, but also feel comparatively "sterile" (not to mention cost 2-3 times as much). The assembly lines in this have so many more possibilities, since it actually uses some rudimentary physics, and *really weird stuff* is possible.\nI don't really feel like the point of this game is just to beat it... The goals are there just as a sort of tutorial to drive you forward in discovering the different tools available. I beat the game in like an hour, but I still ended up playing it for a long time after I beat it. I am all about efficiency, and making the most efficient production lines possible (using some really funky tricks) is the part I really enjoyed. I planned to just take a quick peek and make sure the game ran on on OSX, and ended up beating it several times over in a single sitting in my quest for production line perfection.\n\nDisclosure: I received a free review copy of the game to aid with testing OSX compatibility.","October 8, 2015","true","16.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

Not entirely a game that plays itself, it requires some input from the player as they shuffle about purchasing resources from the shop to turn into ‘other’ resources which can be combined to make resources that… make weapons, but watch out for those traffic jams on your conveyor belts!\nWhat makes what exactly is free for experimentation as you move between Copper, Tin, Vodka and of course ‘this is memes’ Potato Age (Think Age of Empires or Empire Earth but far simpler). For those who are not ‘in-the-know’ with this style of game, expect minimal to no hand holding throughout as newcomers are going to be dissuaded rather quickly by the underwhelming lack of information given through the wholly vast tutorial phase which breaks down as such; ‘Purchase Machine A; Purchase Resource A, Well you are good to go! Have fun!’. It does not help that the actual ‘HELP’ menu button consists of nothing more than the basic controls, a youtube/twitch.tv link and most bizarrely; the credits for the Developers of the game? Surely that could have been  set on a separate menu titled say.. Oh I don’t know.. CREDITS. So for first time users, be prepared to be very lost and confused. So anyway..\n\n..You construct your Assembly lines by trading resources and weapons for cash which in turn is used to buy better equipment like conveyor belts, guard rails, resource processors and et cetera. You can also expand your work space by purchasing additional rooms. What this all breaks down into; is one massive rubix cube sort of puzzle that you solve over a prolonged period of time, but once you have solved said puzzle there is not really a whole lot else to do except to do it all again in New Game+, rinse and repeat. Now one could expect micro-transactions in a game such as this but the Developer seems to have had good sense by not only dressing an arbitrary puzzle solver in a post decedent soviet Russian theme but has skipped over the inclusion of an easily integrated micro-transaction system in a game that just screams out for one, altogether. So kudos for the sky being blue and not coloured in money I suppose, as they felt it was a necessary selling point on the Steam store front page, but $9.99 for the admission price of such a fundamentally basic game, this is still rather steep for all that it is and all that it is not. Look, it is not a horrible game by any means, there are far worse and the game does have a sense of humour that helps alleviate the otherwise mundane atmosphere of staring at 8 bit pixels for any great length of time, but this will inevitably fade and your eyes will glaze over as you hear the same regurgitated lines of dialogue over and over while playing for extended periods. NOW PERK UP, You are reading a review not playing this game but now you can sense the nature of the beast. It is recommendable on the basis that it is an interactive puzzle that has a unique if not isolated identity, but not much more than that. Is it satire? is it social commentary like Papers Please, Perhaps? but that is for another debate.\n\nThis is going to be a game for a very niche demographic of people who have little to do or a few minutes in between waiting to do something better. Now I must say… Congratulations for making it through my review Comrade, literary ingestion expanded Comrade! (Did I mention the incredibly obnoxious voice over throughout the game that grinds on your ears within the first minute that will never, EVER cease. Well now I have.)

The problem is that once you've learned all the recipes (which you will probably do in your first hour or two of play), then resetting simply becomes a case of rinse-and-repeat the exact same production lines with no significant changes to either difficulty or objectives.\n\nIf you don't believe me, try it for yourself, then use the steam refund system and get your money back.....","October 11, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel bad writing a review with so little time,  but the repitition was horridly grating.  Could see this working as a mobile app,  ya know..a time waster for the bus.  But as a full fledged steam game,  anything over 2 bucks, needs more than just 1 joke to carry it.","October 22, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And 4 of them doesn't give you anything.\nAfter 1 hour I got bored. Hey there's a 'New life' button.\nOh wait... It's boring again.\n\n10 bucks for this? Naah.

The "Mostly Negative" Reviews had me very wary and thinking I might refund this game. But It looked interesting enough that it was on my wishlist and it was on sale. Now... I don't get the hate. It's a trial and error factory production game. You have to try and figure out multiple things and create machines that will let you sell it. I find it a lot of fun and it is pretty fun in spurts. It's worth the full price I'd say.","May 30","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
